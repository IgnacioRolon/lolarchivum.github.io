Mainly just to see if he's looking back. I don't think he's in a terrible place, but I was honestly surprised the 6.1 changes didn't feel better for him.  Always run into a couple of deep questions when I play him: do I want to win lane phase, or survive it?  Do I want to be cute (Cottontail) or deadly (Omega Squad)?  Sometimes the burden of these questions is too hard to overcome and I lose because of it.  I'll make sure he remains in our conversations on this end. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"SlyTactician ","date":"2016-02-06T20:10:50.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to see that Teemo is being looked at. It is true that he is considered \"unfun\" to lane against; however, these days I just wonder where Teemo exactly fits in within the game. Whenever I choose him in ranked games, many just feel the need to point out that Teemo is a weak choice for top or any other lane for that matter. He's a marksman that doesn't exactly do well in the botlane, but he also has to play very safely as an assassin for his secondary category; yet, he is more likely to be assassinated first before finishing off an opponent due to his linear kit.\n\nThough the shroom tossing was a welcoming addition to his team fight abilities. I do wish his escape (W) provided more options for him such as a mushroom bouncing active which may detonate a shroom if he runs over it while activating his W, but allows him to jump much like Ziggs' W. It might provide him a chance to escape while also dashing through bushes for an escape. As a swift scout, his small movement speed burst just doesn't provide enough for him to escape ganks and whatnot.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-02-06T20:23:26.908+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely feel like you have to pressure hard to take advantage of lane, and then you open yourself up to ganks. Then again, sometimes I'm just losing 1v1 to Fiora or the like. :(  \n\nI haven't learned to use the brush portion of the passive particularly well yet. I used to super rarely use his passive but I can definitely see it being a lot more viable dancing in the brush as opposed to standing still.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Toasted","date":"2016-02-06T20:53:43.373+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new minion aggro changes were a pretty big hidden nerf to his aggressive play-style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twisted Tea","date":"2016-02-06T22:13:55.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is part of why I strongly feel that Teemo should get some buffs that specifically help him play as a Jungler.

I like where teemo is right now. \n\nI would like perhaps an ever so slight base damage buff to e and perhaps a couple changes to w. Perhaps a tiny boost to the movespeed later (mainly thinking scaling 10% to 30% instead of 10-26) or a partial/full reset on the cooldown when he gets a kill/assist.\n\nI don't do ap teemo much so i can't speak on his health in that regard. Mostly because a majority of mid lane matchups are either assassins, which destroy teemo, or long range mages and shit which will just poke me down. I don't enjoy ap teemo outside of mid as much as i do ad/onhit/slightlytanky teemo.\n\nIf you want to do something with teemo i don't want that kind of build to be discouraged in favor of AP. I'd like to see both be viable.\n\nAlso teemo can be a pain to lane against but even champions he \"counters\" can still beat him. Nasus for example just kind of rushes spirit visage and now teemo can't do anything. Darius can kill teemo over and over again once he hits 6. And yet looking at a place like champion.gg some of the champions that \"counter\" teemo i would actually willingly pick teemo against. Those are few and far between but among them are gnar, which i love playing against as teemo, and tahm kench, which i feel teemo is one of the few champions that can actually beat a tahm in lane. For most of the other matchups there aren't enough games to get an accurate idea as to who counters who. Like i would play teemo against zac and warwick even though they \"counter\" teemo based on this but there are only 40 games between the 2 of them (at the elos that champion.gg looks at) so it is no where near accurate. Infact there are 3 matchups with more than 500 games top and only 3 matchups over 100 games in mid.\n\nI find it to be interesting that teemo exists in a state where looking at some statistics he isn't that good and yet i know from experience on the champion how good he can be and yet how he can be dealt with in lane. I always feel like that if people put time into the champion then it would invalidate most of the statistics that exist on him, and yet I also know that he has a low pick rate and the people that do play him do it because they know what they are doing on the champion and play it a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LemurMonster","date":"2016-02-06T21:52:22.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel it's his W that really needs to be looked at.

Not sure if attack rate is the most ideal bonus however, but the stat is something I value on him with how powerful his E actually can be... It was always really hard to take advantage of his passive in lane before in a skilled setting; not so much anymore tho\n\nI think if Teemo's ult costed slightly less mana especially at later ranks {{item:3115}} would easily be core and he might even be a competitive niche rather than just a fun pick.\n\nNow IDK if it's just me but his AP ratios seem lowish so I always forgo {{item:3089}} , putting more value on Lichbane or Void Staff always... That's fine because I hate saving soo much gold for that thing and enjoy the utilities other ap items have on the side\n\nI don't really value {{item:3151}} , the effect never seemed that pronounced to me to be worth a slot... I've always felt I have to build him with either lichbane or nashor's to give him some bite to his burst or dps in teamfights (both is an option). It's also important to build him brawny sometimes too so Rylias & abyssal/zhonyas are most useful...\n\nTeemo's skill order can vary on his opponent's tankiness and kill pressure. Q is more poke/burst and safer. This is often the way to go versus mages and melee carries for blind duration. E is for dps versus very tanky types. The style is fun but more dangerous in general but effective for doing a lot of damage in one fight. I will then often build to accommodate my skill order choice. Sheen for Q style or stinger for E style.\n\nRight now the Q max poke style is easier to play, and less niche... Now I don't want to lose having options here, I feel having choices adds a lot of depth to the game, but I also feel like pressing Q to blind your opponent and chunk is a cheesy playstyle.","replies":[]}]}
