A statue like this is ultimately made of plastic and certain areas where it joins or narrows are weaker, and that's a risk with anything of an unusual shape during transport. I have no doubts about the quality of the piece and will be ordering another one once my free shipping label is sorted. Because it IS a good piece.

So it could get knocked around a bit within the actual shipping container, as opposed to within the \"Riot\" box. \n\nWhen I saw the packaging myself I didn't think it was badly packaged and was at a standard level I would expect. In hindsight it would probably have been safer to have it in a foam pad within the Riot box, but I consider that level of shipping consideration to be a fairly high level of product protection. It's a lovely thing to see but I don't EXPECT it every time I open something like this, because it's not generally necessary. For this one it appears it may be. Live and learn for them.
