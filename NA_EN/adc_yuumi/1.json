Maybe making Rylai's slow 10% so it only slows for 60%.\n\nPlease, don't sweat what would need to be balanced / removed.\n\nFor example, Warmog's might be removed for Force of Nature; since like 6 Warmog's would instantly bring you to full health after leaving a fight.\nForce of Nature would be adjusted to give only 1.5% _missing health_ regen, stacking only to 9% missing health per second.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-07-08T13:11:30.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remember the idea is no limits on the game mode\n\nI would assume that means beyond just *Unique Passives can stack now*\n\nit could also mean *Other effects now stack*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-08T12:58:35.652+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The key argument against this is right here:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=AFK Yuumi Main,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k0fMR4Wo,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-08T11:04:17.366+0000)\n>\n> Ever wanted to have 5 Karthus on your team? \n> Sure, that's possible in one-for-all.\n\n_It's not._ Karthus and Teemo were disabled in OFA because it was boring.
