Like I'm not trying to be a dick, but seriously, of the roster of characters with even a basic notion of depth, emotion, personality, aspirations or even the slightest bit of agency within the very universe he supposedly exists in. Gregas is a piece of cardboard. \n\nThe remnants of his old lore has arguably nothing substantial to offer nor a foundation that might have compelling potential. At least compared to other champs who hardly exist at all in their universe (Malphite, Zilean, Shaco etc) all have a captivating fantasy baseline. On a character-level, what amazing potential could be tapped into from Gragas? I can't see anything.\n\nBut I say a huge pay rise to whichever writer takes up the challenge and thoroughly pulls it off!!","replies":[{"poster":"DWT12345","date":"2019-05-20T04:55:46.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My guess is he'll end up being a braum-like, folktale character.

Make him a cool hardcore brewer so dedicated to his craft he's gone across the world gathering all sorts of ingredients in the effort to make the perfect brew, which has earned him a few very unique relics and perhaps a combination of ingredients that got him some very volatile and deadly drinks making him quite the terror if you get on his bad side. \n\nHe can still take no shit from anyone, does his own thing and is a mean brawler, but not just some drunkard who got some relics making him stronk.
