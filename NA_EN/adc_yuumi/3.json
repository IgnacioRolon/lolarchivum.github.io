There is no (and has never been any)  other \"two-for-one\" champ that has the kind of interconnected relationship and teamwork that Quinn and Valor have.\n\nAlso, Riot should get rid of this \"behind enemy lines\" bullshit and give us the *real* Valor back.\n\nAnd while we're talking about it, Riot should also fix that god dam bug with Vault occasionally causing you to fly off in random directions, because it's been 2,266 days without an actual fix for that.\n\nOh, and not to forget Cockatoo Quinn for OCE server skin instead of that \"oh look, stars\" bullshit.\n\nRant over...","replies":[{"poster":"Storn Saroe","date":"2019-05-13T16:08:41.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow I have been playing on OCE since the server launched and didn't realise until this comment that Cosmic Reaver Kassadin (which I am pretty sure came out a few years later) is supposedly the server skin for OCE...\n\nI honestly assumed that they just never bothered to do one. I had to do a bunch of digging to find out that \"oh look, stars\" meant Cosmic Reaver Kassadin and when I went into the splash on client to try spot the Southern Cross, I couldn't even see it initially because it is hidden by the info XD. Seriously though how is Cosmic Reaver oceanic?\n\nHonestly I would have guessed it was the boomerang Sivir skin even though I am a Kiwi. Also even though I love Quinn, something Pasifika inspired or Seafaring/Spirit Journey probably would have been a better fit than a bird found only in Australia (Still a more obvious reference than Cosmic Reaver Kassadin though).\n\nAlso yeah I have no idea why they refuse to make it Quinn and Valor, the only thing RIOT have said against it was a direct contradiction to RIOTs earlier statement on the champion. Its not like adding Valor to the name would hurt them at all. (I also laugh that when Quinn and Valor were first being launched someone asked about Nunu being called Nunu and Willump  but RIOT shut them down saying they were not a duo champ in the same way Quinn and Valor were).\n\nAlso talking about Sivir, her base splash is fine but I think some of her skin splashes could use some love as well (Battle Princess is really dated and has a completely different weapon to the in game version).","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-05-13T16:49:38.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Storn Saroe,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=nHbAqAE5,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-05-13T16:08:41.735+0000)\n>\n> bird found only in Australia\n\nActually, cockatoos aren't strictly found in Australia *only*. They have a mainly Australasian distribution, ranging from the Phillippines and the eastern Indonesian Islands of Wallacea to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and (obviously) Australia. So far as comparing to the reach of the OCE server, it's pretty much just NZ that isn't strictly covered by \"cockatoos\", and even then they're relatively closely related to Strigopoidae (such as the Kakapo, which is endemic to NZ), which ultimately makes them a relatively good concept as a basis for a skin to cover the Oceanic region (vastly better than \"stars\", anyway).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Everyday Legends","date":"2019-05-13T16:04:06.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Don't act like Valor is the only one being mistreated.\n\nIt's not Kled and Skaarl.\nIt's not Lulu and Pix.\nIt's not Sejuani and Bristle.\nIt's not Kayn and Rhaast.\nIt's not Annie and Tibbers.\nIt's not Ivern and Daisy.\nIt's not Bard and Meeps.\nIt's not Illaoi and Nagakabouros.\nIt's not Orianna and the Ball.\nIt's not Rumble and Tristy.\nIt's not Yorick and the Maiden of the Mist.\nIt's not Varus feat.

You can literally hear them communicating with each other, their moveset is equally shared and even their emotes have them both.\n\nPix only really follows Lulu and Lulu has almost nothing towards him; though otherwise stated in lore.\nKled gets fxxking pissed as Skaarl leaves halfway through the fight.\nSejuani is only using Bristle to get the throne.\nKayn... I mean probably his legendary skin counts. But otherwise, I don't think demonic possession or compressing a soul is friendship.\nAnnie does most of the work, can't really be equals there.\nIvern asks Daisy for her help, which is definitely friendly but not enough to show it in game. ( Daisy only appears during ult. )\nBard is collecting these meeps for a reason I do not understand.\nIllaoi is possessed by it. Again, possession is NOT friendship.\nOrianna technically controls the ball herself, so it's not really friendship.\nDefinitely not Rumble and Tristy yet Nunu and Willump is possible. Anyways I mean, Rumble controls it; thus.\nYorick and the Maiden are not friends. He's using her to rid himself of a curse. But he can't just control the maiden. ( Why the Maiden goes alone in lane. ) \nVarus is a darkin. They're who got possessed. They are no more.\nNeeko and Neeko are probably Neekos but not Neekos with not Neeko. Not Neeko Neeko Neekos Neeko (not Neeko) Neeko not Neeko ( Neeko ) Neeko.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kagepaladin","date":"2019-05-14T09:36:06.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"especially since Valor actually helped saved Quinn's life \n(which quinn had also saved Valor by taking him back to her home Uwendale and healing him) and helped her kill a feral Tuskvore ( picture Mamoswine from pokemon with shaggier fur and a lot larger) which killed her brother, Caleb about a year prior when he saved Lestara Buvelle's life.
