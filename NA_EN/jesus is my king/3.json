All of her damage now comes from autoattacks, which basically makes her a worse irelia with a shroud. Every single ability has been nerfed outside of shroud not having a pink ward reveal her. For some reason she now heals on her first autoattack, which is bizarre because she should be pretty high health on her first auto and would benefit much more from her second auto healing.

Also has been heavily modified since video (now AD/AP ratios on both attacks, and generally more generous).\n\nW: Duration set back to 8 seconds at all levels. Also, not following what is wrong with this new teleport mechanic. Would like to see in action. Will admit, sounds pointless, but it is a free flash with a slow to cover your ground.\n\nE: It's a damage buff, pretty much through and through. Not as bursty with higher cooldowns at high levels, but top laners were abusing this (See her Champion.gg ). On the other side of things, it wastes less energy for the power, so that's something.\n\nR: Nerfed badly. That said, the ability is a double flash range on top of an enemy already, and at an absurdly low cooldown for the combo damage alone.\n\nI will say, I do have reservations about this build, but you're missing the picture entirely. She has a mini Flash pre-6 now, with the old movement jolt on top of it, and a speedy escape route, too. This can be used to actually harass in the mid lane, instead of basically sitting under tower until level 6. And even if you are stuck under there, Crescent Slash has only been buffed for waveclear purposes. \n\nIn top, she can't spam Crescent Slash to burst enemies down along with the whole wave, but instead she has a real harass now. Toss a Q, run up and auto double proc > Q > auto double proc, and toss in a bulkier Crescent Slash on top, you won't be losing many trades up there, either, and all within 2 autos and several fast casting spells. And I don't even think her trades were particularly bad up there, either, they just required basically fighting in your shroud, and out-DPSing your enemies with E and passive, on an assassin champ... I'm kinda glad she lost her DPS for some burst, actually. She will still be quite imposing, but I'm hopeful that she won't assassinate so fast, and that an enemy can turn around and knock her back down heavily, and probably waste her escape tool in the process.\n\nAll in all, I see her getting a lot more potential early game, and that scares me that she will be overpowered early on, and then will eventaually fall off when her 2 second R cooldown actually means something lategame. I don't want them to strive for that pattern, but I think it actually plays toward the Akali player playstyle of midgame menace, with some bonus early game pressure added in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-11-03T01:18:08.790+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"People that post their League opinions on the internet make up barely a fraction of a % of the total League player base. \n\nYour opinion and the opinions of everyone who agrees with you are drops in an ocean.","replies":[{"poster":"Rıots Bad Client","date":"2016-11-03T02:30:14.708+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't care what happens to akali. but the Majority are not akali mains, they don't know exactly what they want- However Akali mains do and its why he is saying what's on his mind. \n\nAgain, I don't care what happens.
