I don't know why its doing this, I have good wifi and good connection but it just keeps joining late. Its very stressful dealing with this because i cant even call my role and Iv'e been having to play support :(\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Olivia Hye","date":"2017-02-25T13:43:40.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This also has been happening to me recently!

Every single time i que up and in all ques. My blackout lasts for at least 40 seconds which jeopardize ban phase in draft and makes it hard to trade, reroll and set up sums, mastries and runes in ARURF. Initiated a Full Repair in the client but it didn't help. \n\nWould appreciate a fix for this ultra rapidly.\n\nEDIT:\n\nDid some googling and found another post on the board. This gave me some kind of a workaround though it's still problematic:\n\n[Friend-list causing freeze in champ-select](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/ZiBGWUjA-client-bugs-and-is-late-joining-champ-select-unless-my-friends-list-is-collapsed?show=rundown)\n\nThis blackout doesn't occur if my friend-groups in the friend-list are all collapsed. The remaining problem is that after a game these friend-group-lists automaticly expand. Collapsing them all takes me about two minutes since there is a minor freeze for each one. At least this way i wont suffer from que-dodge-penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"boobý shmurda","date":"2017-03-02T23:15:09.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually, fortunately, stopped happening to me, not after the reinstall if you read below, all the reinstall did was make me press \"launch\" even though i have League Alpha Client.

Noticed instantly that callapsing my friend-groups didn't seem to be a heavy and problematic task for my computer anymore. The black-out bug seems to be fixed. Thanks Riot.
