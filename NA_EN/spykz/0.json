The other day i was searching on mobafire creating item sets and applied them to the game that i was currently playing. I was playing {{champion:96}} kog&#039;maw and the build said to build {{item:3124}} rage blade first but my friend said to build it second after {{item:3508}} essence reaver and {{item:3006}} berserkers grieves. That got me wondering about how to tell if an item is good to build on a champion?
