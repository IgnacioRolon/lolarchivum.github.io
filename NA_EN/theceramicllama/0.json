I was very, very confused so i decided to change my password and username several times and i was greeted with the same screen every. single. time. So i decided to go ahead and make the new summoner name and then I see my level 30 summoner with several champions has been replaced by a level 1 summoner with nothing. I went to search for my old summoner and i could see that it was still there but I just couldnt sign into it. Why did this literally happen over night and why cant I sign in? Can I please get some help Riot? Ive submitted a ticket and Im getting no help because its a bot. Can I please talk to an actual person? I put alot of my time and money into the game only for my summoner to be taken away for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T02:18:09.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've submitted a ticket already, I recommend sitting tight until one of our account specialists gets back to you about this.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
