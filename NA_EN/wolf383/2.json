I liked how they gave him a feint with a massive but short slow. I've been playing Warwick for a while now and just want him to be more flashy and let his playstyle require more skill and smarts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-21T10:50:46.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW needs a emergency rework his kit is bad and toxic at the moment, He is a jungler but he no have a gank pre 6, a tan without no AoE dmg, Mana hunger, his W have a lot of hidden power, can use his E to run away (a skill create to chase not to run away), Ult have no counterplay if he reach a isolate enemy, but he is very reliable on his ult, also his ult make his vulberable because supress him and not reduce the dmg incoming, make him a easily target on tf, and the list goes on with devourer, challenging smite nerfs...\n\nI'm Warwick main all the season 4 (Feral flare time) and he have a huge power, maybe so OP but now after the 4.21 patch he are overnerf, Devourer and challneging smite too, so its time to fix. He its only viable on low elos, or good to smurf bronze accounts IMO.\n\nHas a insane sustain and is very good duelist but his weakness are more than his strenght, in low elo WW its a powerful GOD, but in high elo is a thrash, He really need a rework too fix his core problems and toxic kit.\n\nFor me He needs this to stay healthy:\n\n* -Remove W on his kit, replace with a skill that allow him gank pre 6.\n \n* -Make his E works only towards enemies (like Vayne passive,  Soraka Janna)\n \n* -Add more interactive gameplay on his E (passive and active part instead a toogle)\n \n* -Turn him R into a skillshot like Sejuanis Q, Gragas E or Malphite R to add counterplay.\n \n* -Give a damage reduction when he supress an enemy to reduce the vulnerability.\n \n* -A CD penalty if he uses his R to escape to minimizes his escapes chances,\n \n* -Fix his mana cost and mana pool.\n\nSo he needs a rework to stay in a healthy state, his problems are very evidents right now.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterChafa","date":"2015-10-01T01:54:23.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yes, his W needs some love; could be that he gets permanent attack speed for each level of W and also his active would be a speed boost or something. That would be way funnier and intuitive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterChafa","date":"2015-10-01T01:47:45.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his passive and his E should fuse into a better passive: According to the lore, {{champion:19}}  is great at tracking objectives, and he gets so obsessed with them that they may end up killing them. So, his passive should be something like marking a single target with an attack or ability, and his basic attacks would stack magic damage upon him, and reveal him at x distance but just him. If the target falls below half his maximum health, the detection range will double. He can switch targets every x seconds, which will diminish as {{champion:19}}  levels up, or until his target dies. And E would be a jump or something like that.\nI pray for Riot to read me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bialconelli","date":"2015-03-01T18:25:09.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rito buff warwick {{item:3070}} {{champion:19}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-02-27T19:20:23.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rito said that he is in need of a rework because his sustain hasn't counterplay","replies":[{"poster":"Wolf383","date":"2015-02-27T19:33:54.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RitoAlwayNerfMe,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eJMrtbKp,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-27T19:20:23.581+0000)\n>\n> rito said that he is in need of a rework because his sustain hasn't counterplay\n\nRiight, but when is this rework and such coming?","replies":[]}]}]}
