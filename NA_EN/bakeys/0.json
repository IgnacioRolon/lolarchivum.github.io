Tests have shown no problems with my connection, and even in game I maintain a constant 65-70ms, without ping spikes (just the packet loss that randomly occurs). When pinging the server through cmd prompt, I see consistent times to the server (60-70ms), but do see a few packets that get lost, with the most recent test only losing 2 out of 757 packets sent. I'm using a TP-Link Archer C9 router, and yes I'm hard wired to the router. I've put in tickets with Riot and received no response, as well as calling CC, but they say they see no issues with my connection and do not have any ports or connections blocked in any way. Does anyone have any experience with CC or what I'm experiencing, or have suggestions on what more I can try to rid myself of this problem?\n\nTL;DR - Experiencing packet loss using Consolidated Communications ISP, ruining games, need help.","replies":[{"poster":"Cpt Ken Doll","date":"2018-01-13T19:56:46.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi guys. so ive been running into the same issue but mines significantly worse. im also running on a wireless connection but same symptoms. ive ran cmd to ping my home network, google, and other services that all come back with 0 packet loss and a steady connection. but when i ping pvp.net i cannot connect. in game its perfect for about a minute before i start disconnecting, or a custom game will be fine but then i try a pvp game and disconnect as soon as im needed (never am i ever lucky). i ran the diagnostic tool posted earlier and these were my results:\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -

It looks like your network path is pretty normal, aside from the consistent 1% packet loss through most of your route. Such a low amount of packet loss shouldn't cause issues, though. I'd recommend hopping into some custom matches so you can verify that you're experiencing the symptoms of your packet loss before running another traceroute during a period of time when these symptoms show up.

It's random enough to simply play through it, but when it happens during a team fight or while trying to CS it is pretty unfortunate for us. \n\nI can try running a trace for a longer period of time, or even recording during a game to capture a moment when the packet loss happens to confirm that's actually what is going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T23:20:11.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, running a trace while playing a match where you're seeing the symptoms may be the best way for us to capture what's going on in the backend.","replies":[{"poster":"bakeys","date":"2017-01-21T04:07:45.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the WinMTR trace I ran while playing a game.
