It was very close, and Misfits kept them on their toes, bringing it to that final game.  They shouldn&#039;t feel defeated.  They did great.\r\nGood try Misfits!

They made mistakes, but they were really pushing SKT even while behind.  SKT outplayed them in the end, and they won because of that.  But you are right, except for game 1, Misfits were dominant.\nTHIS IS WHY I WANTED TO WATCH WORLDS!!!

They had real control of the situation and they did execute really well if not for some mistakes (that SKT charged in after because they couldn't afford not to fully capitalize over them). I think MSF have been one of the best teams we've seen in a lot of Worlds right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Gen Nakazora","date":"2017-10-20T12:53:59.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree completely.  They were really setting the pace in a good majority of those games.  They had some missteps, but everyone does.  SKT had a ton as well, thus they came that close.  Seriously, I hope people don't try to start getting cocky about this, because honestly... Misfits won even though they didn't beat SKT.  They surpassed everyone's expectations.  That alone was a massive victory.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skouriasmenos","date":"2017-10-20T12:49:44.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hopefully all those TSM fight watching from NA that didn't get what we where talking about innovation and adjusting your picks and performance, NOW GOT the point.\n\nFervor Leona with ignite ... if you have the guts and the skill and the teamwork, it works.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-10-20T12:51:42.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, they will write laughing threads about \"rip eu\" because we lost to skt.","replies":[]}]}]}
