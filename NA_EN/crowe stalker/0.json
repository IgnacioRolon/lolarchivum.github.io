I've beaten both Twisted Treeline and Crystal Scar four times (although by now they are probably gone from my match history) but I haven't gotten the Diana icon yet. I'm generally concerned that I might not get the icon (which is the one icon I DID want out of this event) and would like to ask if there's some kind of technical issue, if I'm just being paranoid, or if the server hasn't properly acknowledged it yet. I should have gotten it at least 2 days ago.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-02-04T21:55:05.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kuronan!  \n\nI'm very sorry for any confusion or aggravation you experienced.  If you have earned these Icons, I can completely understand that you want them to appear on your account as  quickly as possible.  Please keep in mind that the 2014 Lunar Revel icons are added in batches, so they may a delay of receiving them after you unlock them. These summoner icons should be unlocked on your account automatically no later than 72 hours after the event ends.\n\nIf you still do not have your Icon's at this point, please do not hesitate to let us know by submitting a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new), so we can look into this issue further!","replies":[]}]}
