Within the folder, _C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects_ (if you installed League of Legends in the default location), you should be able to locate the region-specific folders and delete them.\n\nThese folders will have a (region) or (language) in its name. For instance, my folder currently contains the following:\n- lol_air_client\n- lol_air_client_config_euw\n- lol_air_client_config_na\n- lol_air_client_config_oc1\n- lol_game_client\n- lol_game_client_en_au\n- lol_game_client_en_gb\n- lol_game_client_en_us\n- lol_launcher\n- lol_patcher\n\nIf I decided that I was going to play on Oceania exclusively and do not need the NA and EUW files anymore, I would delete the following:\n- lol_air_client_config_euw\n- lol_air_client_config_na\n- lol_game_client_en_gb\n- lol_game_client_en_us\n\nKeep in mind that your logs will remain region-independent, so there's no way to delete just the NA and EUW logs. As always, if you make modifications to the game directory in any way, I highly encourage you to play a few Custom Games to make sure that your game client continues to work as expected before jumping into a match made game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lynne","date":"2015-10-12T21:49:23.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!","replies":[]}]}]}
