Especially For Kennen, who is the only Yordle who is part of an actual non-yordle organization. (aside from Kled, but he is more of a comedic character). It sucks especially considering How iconic the trio of Shen, Akali and Kennen are.

I really did look forward to the Akali VGU in hopes Kennen will finally get some more lore, development and a further relationship with Akali. While the latter was given a bit of insight with him being a very close friend of hers since childhood, Kennen was barely touched up upon and didn't feature in her trailers either. :( \n\nIt's true that Ken is slated for an eventual VGU though I wonder when this might be considering how much of Ionia we've seen so far since Irelia's rework? Could it take another year or two before Ken gets his? I am happy that the Kinkou got development as it was left alone for quite some time now; however, it feels wrong that of the Kinkou Order trio - one of ninjas was  left behind in terms of content. Not even a short story either while both Shen and Akali received one along with Zed.\n\nIt's tough waiting for years to see one's favourite champion get even a mention from Riot. Barely any of the recent League promotion material, trailers, Akali teasers for her VGU, or even merch in general feature Kennen. Even at the time when the Kinkou Order members are given more depth, Kennen barely got much for some reason. We know he's a young, energetic yordle who ran up the Placidium walls and was later taken into the Kinkou, is willing to accept Zed if he seeks redemption, and also is fond of Sona's music. He is considered to be a prankster as well - would have love to seen how much trouble he brings to the Order!\n\nBut since then, we got a small rewrite bio about him patrolling the Spirit World with Shen...but oddly enough, Shen's new bio makes no mention of Kennen at all. Hopefully the little guy  gets some love soon! Kennen did make a small cameo dancing at the end of the Akali champion spotlight...so this does make me hopeful that Akali still maintains a good bond with the little guy ala her bio and that one quote.  Kennen is my favourite champion, so I hope Riot knows we Kennen fans exist out there! \n\n{{champion:85}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-07-31T01:51:20.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's on the VGU list so why change his lore now only to have to change it again later?","replies":[{"poster":"Cetri","date":"2018-07-31T15:43:09.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Several champs on the VGU list, like Morde, Panth, and Mundo, have had their lores updated already though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2018-07-30T20:14:15.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you seen Swamp Kennen?
