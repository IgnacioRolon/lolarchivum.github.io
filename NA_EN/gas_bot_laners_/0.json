Let's quickly try another route to get this fixed since your logs aren't showing any packet loss. Check out your client settings and turn on something called **low-spec mode** if you can. That will disable some of the fancy animations on the client and should give you an easier time. Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"gas bot laners ","date":"2017-06-26T02:59:34.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, as i said in my original post, i have tried low spec mode and my client still doesn't work in champ select. the problem is not the client freezing, but it's as though i disconnect completely from the league server, but not the chat server, during champion select. but from my end, i'm not actually disconnecting","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T03:17:20.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad!
