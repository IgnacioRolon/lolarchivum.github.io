It would also be impossible to ban someone for what they vocally say, as there would be no proof, because recording every word said in every game both in text AND vocal would be very daunting/impossible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kcStranger","date":"2015-05-03T20:22:30.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a pretty good explanation of why League doesn't have in-game voice chat: http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/04/red-post-collection-urf-q-on-april-6th.html (scroll down to \"Lyte on Voice Chat\").\n\nThe short version is that Riot has thought about it, but research shows that in-game voice leads to increased negative behavior, especially harassment against female players. You can still use an opt-in voice chat like Curse Voice if you want, though only with teammates who also have it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2015-05-03T20:48:36.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kcStranger,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OtWnwNas,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-03T20:22:30.654+0000)\n>\n> Here's a pretty good explanation of why League doesn't have in-game voice chat: http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/04/red-post-collection-urf-q-on-april-6th.html (scroll down to \"Lyte on Voice Chat\").\n\n\nThis makes you really wonder why there's even a forum for LoL on LoL if the Riot'ers themselves prefer other outlets. I would have loved to have known about this, but nowhere is something like this ever on this site. \n\nThey should just have a link to Reddit when you click \"Boards\" and if you manage to find this, just comment a note saying that any Red on here does not have any authority what so ever.

They'd need an in game method to mute people as well. Like the Sona music toggle. And then Rito will probably also have to save the recordings and have someone actually listen to them if people get reported. So I don't see it happening. Even though I agree it would help. I also think more specific pings will help. Like one for warded instead of just spamming the back off ping. Or other things like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-05-03T20:26:31.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not gonna happen. Stupid idea. You don't need a voice chat in yoloQ and the lack of voice chat is not the reason why you are in bronze.

Use them if you really want to have conversations with random yoloQ people.\n\n\n/thread","replies":[]}]}
