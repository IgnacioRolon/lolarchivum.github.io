There are obviously certain posts that are bait or solely meant to get a reaction, but there are others that are passionate, but reasonable that don't get any response.\n\nI think a good example is some of the Veigar threads. While quite a few are barely worth paying any attention to, some are very well written and clearly thought out. Usually these ones are merely asking if Veigar is finished or not. A simple yes or no would work wonders.\n\nAnyways, I digress.

It's kind of ridiculous having to see a constant flood of the same thing over and over again. I feel one good post about the current thoughts on a champion could do a lot in stopping these slug fest of opinion and insults. It would be nice to have a sort of this is where we stand on whether this champion is strong or not.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-04-22T15:22:10.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure that if he interjected into those conversations he would bias the conversation taking place, at which point he can't use the conversation to learn about what the community thinks about balance.
