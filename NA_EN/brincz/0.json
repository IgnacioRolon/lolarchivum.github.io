Is it gone?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T22:51:43.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots aren't available on the updated client yet.  You can still access them through the legacy client if you like:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI'm not sure when it will be added, but feel free to share any feedback on the [client boards ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)and help out with other areas of the client until then.  Thanks for your help!","replies":[]}]}
