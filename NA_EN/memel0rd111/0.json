They also have an event board where these communities post, I'd probably check Peak gaming - if they're still alive or not, I dunno. As far as I know clash is a glorified kids club for goody two shoes that sort of act like the moderators on this forum. No personality.\n\nExcept for Deep Water Nami as far as I'm aware, anyways.

Literally just had a duo shit on my team because they were smurfing. They had a 71% winrate in duo. I out performed the support to twice his KDA, with a losing record which puts them to shame. But you know, they didn't say anything too \"MATURE\" so you know. Riot won't punish them.
