She is trying to regain the honor of her name by dominating opponents in fair fights. Also, we made her wear really tight pants, so you can see her butt super-easy.\"\n\nOr, \"Akali was trained from birth to be the perfect assassin. She has overcome countless trials and tribulations to achieve her goal. She is one of the three members of the Kinkou, a group of ninjas who roam the world seeking to maintain balance. Check out that sideboob.\"\n\nIt's hard to be badass when your nitty-gritties are about to fall out.

Would you consider Sejuani to be objectified and sexualized due to her minimallistic clothing?","replies":[{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2014-11-13T21:50:11.882+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"> How does one separate \"objectifying\" with \"too BoobNButts\"?

Her lack of clothing matched up with Tryndamere and Braum - two other powerful warriors that embrace the cold and bore less clothing as if to display how strong they are. Would you consider Sejuani to be objectified and sexualized due to her minimalistic clothing?\n\nMost of the time when people talk about \"Americans being afraid of sexuality\" they're referring to the way that - for example - when TV stations show Predator 2 on live TV, they leave in all the blood, gore, and dismemberment, but they censor or cut out any scene with bare breasts. It's this weird idea that sexuality is inappropriate for civilized life - it's stupid, but not actively harmful.\n\nObjectification, on the other hand, harms women as a whole. \n\nWhen you look at a male hero, what he wears and how he's portrayed say a lot about how the viewer is \"supposed\" to think. If you see Superman, this is what the costume will feature:\n-Spandex\n-Boots\n-Cape\n\nWhereas when you look at a female character in a similar role - say, Power Girl - then this is what you might see:\n-Spandex\n-Boots\n-Cape\n-**Boob-window**\n\nThe two characters are nearly identical, they perform nearly the exact same role. Why does Power Girl need to show cleavage?\n\nThe implication - while probably unintentional - is that no matter how talented she is in other areas, the only way a female can be taken seriously is if she is sexy.\n\nTo answer your question, yes, I would consider old Sejuani to be TOTALLY sexualized. She wore a damn bikini into battle. The implication there is that, when going to war, it is more important that this woman be sexually enticing than for her to be physically protected, and that again is part of the \"must be sexy to be useful\" suggestion.\n\nTryndamere and Braum are different. Why? Because they aren't shirtless to try to be sexy. They're shirtless to try to look intimidating. \n\nWhen a male character is shirtless, he almost exclusively shows off big, bulging muscles. This is a male power fantasy - the idea that a male player can imagine that he's strong and capable, often moreso than he is in real life.\n\nWhen a female character is shirtless, she almost always shows off big, bulging **TITS**. This is not a female power fantasy. This is a male sexual fantasy. \n\nKayle is a female character who is seen as incredibly strong and competent without needing to show any sexual features whatsoever. THAT is a healthy power fantasy. \n\nKalista is a female character who doesn't even have the \"sexy\" female body shape you almost always see - she's wiry, she's hunched over, she's ghoulish. She's visibly feminine, but no part of her looks built to say \"do me.\" She's 0% sexy and 100% deadly. THAT is a healthy power fantasy.\n\n...So hopefully that's a sign of more improvement to come.","replies":[{"poster":"Trading Aces","date":"2014-11-14T03:18:01.799+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then what would you consider a female sexual fantasy?

Because of this I must ask: is it possible to satisfy both the sexual and power fantasies for female characters?  After all, being powerful and sexually potent are both desirable qualities. Are men not capable of being objects of sexual desire while maintaining an image of power - and if they are, why are women not?\n\nReturning to Sejuani: while I can understand where you are coming from, and why some - if not most - of the populace might agree, I am going to keep original my view on the traditional skin. However, I will agree that the change was for the better in respect with the insight you've given me.\n\nAnd yes, it'd be pretty awesome to see more fearsome female characters in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2014-11-14T04:11:23.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">At best it would appear that the male power fantasy is near synonymous to my idea of what the female sexual fantasy is.\n\n[This comic page](http://www.shortpacked.com/comics/2011-12-02-sexy.png) explains the issue here better than I can. \n\n>Then what would you consider a female sexual fantasy? It seems, from your analysis, that a obtrusively display of body parts commonly associated with sex creates the male sexual fantasy. When attempting to come up with the aforementioned other fantasy I find myself coming up with nil.\n\nIt's really unfortunate that most people in our society can REALLY easily point to the stuff that draws the attention of a horny, hormonal male - boobs, butts, long hair, hourglass shape, bedroom eyes, that sort of thing - and yet the same can't be said about what gets ladies off. Why? Because people pander to the male gaze, not the female gaze. Society is stupid.\n\nAs for female sexual fantasy, probably the closest champ I can point to is Yasuo.\n-Lean, but strong.\n-Perpetual stubble.\n-A shirt that doesn't quite cover his sculpted abs.\n-Voiced by the ever-smouldery Liam O'Brien.\n-The character himself is a rebel, but a rebel who wants to be redeemed.\n\nVarus has a couple of similar attributes, too.\n\nStudies I've read seem to suggest that women get off on ideas as much as visuals - that's a big part of the reason you see so much guy-on-guy porn in fanfiction circles, for example - so the female sexual fantasy needs a little more heft than \"Janna controls air, so let's just make her wear it and nothing else.\"\n\n>Because of this I must ask: is it possible to satisfy both the sexual and power fantasies for female characters? After all, being powerful and sexually potent are both desirable qualities. \n\nIt definitely is, sure - hell, a lot of the time when Rioters talk about tenets of champion design, they'll discuss the \"fantasy\" of playing the champion, whether it's being a badass, agile gunslinger ({{champion:236}} ) or a relentless vengeful martyr ({{champion:131}} ) or what have you. Every champion in the game is some sort of power fantasy - when I was talking about Tryndamere being a \"male power fantasy\" though, I was referring to the fact that guys are more likely to be attracted to his musclebound nature than girls.\n\nLike, I'd argue that Katarina's a great example of both a male sexual fantasy and a female power fantasy. She's an independently talented character with a lot of ambition and the skills to fulfill it. She's also got skintight leather pants, an exposed navel (and then some), and flowy red hair. \n\nThe problem is when the sexual fantasy aspect OVERCOMES the power fantasy aspect. \n\nLeague of Legends has two characters who are essentially sentient bits of vegetation. Both were \"brought to life\" by magic, after a fashion. Both are motivated by the reaction to external threats. Both possess the ambition to achieve something greater than they were once capable of. (That is, they both have satisfying power fantasies.)\n\n[This is what the male looks like.](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Maokai_0.jpg)\n\n[This is what the female looks like.](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Zyra_0.jpg)\n\nWhy is it that the guy is a gnarled bark-monster, but the girl is literally just a shapely human woman wearing nothing but leaves? \n\nI'd argue that in Katarina's case, the sexual fantasy bit is actually justified by her character. She needs to wear clothing that won't hinder her agility. On top of that, she's a show-off, and she craves recognition; showing a bit of skin will only give her more of what she wants. (It's okay for female characters to be this way. The problem only arises when MOST or ALL female characters are this way.)\n\nBut Zyra? Hmm. Her backstory has her (the plant) consuming the sorceress who became her vessel. It makes sense that she wouldn't be concerned with human propriety and so forth. But why does that mean she has to be naked? Why would the tree-monster preserve all that bare skin?
