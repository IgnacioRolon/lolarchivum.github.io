Could you try to run the game as an administrator? \n- Right-Click on the short-cut\n- Select the properties tab\n- Check the box labeled \"Run as administrator\"\n\nLet me know if this works for you!","replies":[{"poster":"Nu354","date":"2014-12-11T13:48:48.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried to do it that way, but it doesn't at all.

Then rename the existing one to \"host.old\", and copy the one from your desktop in its place.","replies":[]}]}
