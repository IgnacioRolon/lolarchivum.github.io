Though not game changing it does get on my nerves. Sometime when i look at a ally who is low it will show him with full health then he will \"take damage\" and his health will go back to normal. And by \"take damage\" i mean i will see there health go down to the actual amount of health they have. It does not change the aspect of the game but it will get on my nerves. I have friends 4 friends on Skype that are experiencing  the same thing so its not just me. Its not a game chaining thing but it happens often enough that it should be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Çhaos","date":"2014-11-30T21:48:35.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friends and everyone I play with also sees this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLU Medic","date":"2014-11-30T16:18:04.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do they appear at full health then, when you see them, they appear to take a huge chunk of damage and you see their true health?
