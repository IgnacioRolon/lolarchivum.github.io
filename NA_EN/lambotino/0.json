It includes assisting the enemy team (whether by intentionally feeding, alerting them of teammate's positions/plans, similar things), or sabotaging your own team (deliberately trolling, refusing to play the game, deliberately trying not to win, etc.)\n\nWhat you did (AFK'ing in fountain, not doing anything save attacking _extremely_ nearby enemies), amounts to sabotage. You were subtracting yourself from the match - _without AFK'ing_, so that your team would lose faster. So that your enemy would be able to press an easy win.\n\nYou don't deserve the AFK penalty if you're just \"AFK-ish\", to quote your OP. Like RallerenP has already told you, the AFK penalty is typically reserved for people who actually leave their keyboards. You stayed around, and refused to actually play. You refused to commit. You sat in fountain and did, as far as anyone's concerned, nothing, to help your team.\n\nYou sabotaged your team, and a ban is more than appropriate.\n\nIf/when your ban is served out, do remember that, if you queue up for a match of League, _you're signing up to play it 'til the end, even if it means having to fight a losing battle._ You're not allowed to sit \"AFK-ish\" in base.","replies":[{"poster":"lambotino","date":"2018-05-11T03:01:57.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"fair enough next time this happens I wont stay in fountain i'll just disconnect, makes no sense but atleast ill get a 24h ban instead of 2 weeks, thanks for the tip","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-05-11T03:11:47.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're just going to disconnect when a match isn't turning out how you want, you'd be better off not queuing up at all.

One game just cant do it.\n\nWhere'd you get that idea?\n\nThe system can absolutely punish for a single game. It's incredibly rare, and it's even more rare hearing about it. But it's not impossible. \n\nNormally people say it takes multiple games of inting before someone gets punished because that's *usually* what needed for system to be certain. \n\nBut it's not very hard to detect someone just running in circles and occasionally throwing out abilities in fountain, and if OP said he was inting when ingame, that's enough for the system to be certain.\n\nAnd further, why would OP lie about that? He gains nothing from it unless you think he is trolling. In which case: Why did you even reply to begin with?\n\nHe inted that game, even said so himself (even though he is adamant about it not being inting).","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-10T22:18:44.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gross semantics.\n\nIt *is* probably possible, but i have never seen a single report of it.\n\n0/6 definitely wont trigger it even if someone runs down lane, i see that plus shit like \"gg gonna feed\" and nothing happens to them.\n\nOP probably got banned for running their mouth all game prior to having a meltdown and quitting.","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2018-05-10T22:29:47.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It is probably possible, but i have never seen a single report of it.\n\nWhich is why it would be incredibly rare.\n\nYou construct huge strawmen from anecdotal evidence.
