I being of the \"NEVER SAY NEVER\" mindset in all games because that's how you should always play to win refused to acquiesce, and through calculated splitting, persistent warding, and strategic engagements we finally got ahead in gold by 36 minutes. However, we lost 1 team fight cuz of silly mistakes and those players then kind of went back to giving up and then it went to the loss, but there was a GOOD EFFORT TOWARDS A COMEBACK in it. \n\nExample 2: https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2916355582/237648988?tab=overview\n\nHere is a game where we never had more gold than the enemy, at times being as low as 8000 gold behind. Victory. If you have the CC and raw power, you can force many things through (this involved a yolo push mid after the Camille tried to do some backdooring). \n\nExample 3: https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2789791569/237648988?tab=overview\n\nSome lanes were losing, hard. Our individual strategies weren't as effective as we'd like, so I said NO MORE, and we turned the game into \"help Caitlyn farm simulator,\" where she ended up farming over 500 between minions and jungle.
