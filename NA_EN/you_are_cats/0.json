It happens 1-2 times per game and is guaranteed to happen every game. The problem is 100% not my internet. I reconnect to every game with no problem. I've read in other posts that some employees of Riot have recommended downgrading from High Sierra but this is not an option for me (Software Developer) and just in general the vulnerabilities not being on the newest update of Mac OS. Anyways, any solutions are helpful. This is a concern for me going into the reset of the new season!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T22:25:41.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting disconnected, it'd be worth the troubleshooting time to exhaust all our resources without skipping any steps if nothing you've tried thus far have worked. The main problem may not lie with your internet speeds, but rather something getting in the way of your connection. Sometimes firewalls can block access from certain programs if they aren't configured correctly, other times packet loss damages your connection enough to where it's no longer stable. \n\nI'd be sure to run a quick traceroute first of all to get a solid idea of how the health of your connection fares after it leaves your network. Run a trace for about 5-10 minutes to our NA servers at 104.160.131.1 and post the results here so I can take a look with ya!\n\nQuick Edit: I've heard our techs sometimes reccomend downgrading, and honestly I'm not too up-to-date with Macs myself, so I'd have to defer to them on whether or not you should downgrade. I can completely understand being wary of that though, especially if you're a dev!","replies":[]}]}
