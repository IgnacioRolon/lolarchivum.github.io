She would Q you and you were pretty much dead from there on with her extremely powerful kit and ult, However the E nerf was a little uncalled for. The reason I say this is because now to proc her Q she is obligated to auto attack, not mentioning the fact that her auto attack is the worst in the game, meaning it's very slow and clunky. I don't know of any other champs than Akali that require you to auto attack to proc a mark. E.G. Katarina, LeBlanc.\r\n\r\nI'm just asking for some well long deserved QoL buffs for Akali, faster auto attack animation.","replies":[{"poster":"Namnoms","date":"2015-02-08T23:11:58.833+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not exactly. Akali's power was in getting fed, the reason she was overbearing is because she gets fed pretty easy with so much base damage and sticking power along with how huge of an item the hextech is for her (this what causes her major spike at ~7-8). Her main downfall is that she has arguably the *worst* laning phase of any champion, now that E doesn't proc her Q, you might as well just buy {{item:3301}}  and sit under the turret until 6 since she is basically free food with no way to deal noticeable damage short of an enemy DC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duroxxigar","date":"2015-02-08T23:03:11.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know what.

What made Fizz so powerful was his reliability and HUGE ratios, so they reduced his burst on his reliability, making him still have reliable damage, but less. Removing Akali's proc chance from her E, which was originally done so she could have some kind of reliable damage, was a poor choice. Her ratios should be fixed. If her E was changed to magical damage, her Q's ratio reduced, and her AA improved, she'd be in a rather good place without being too powerful. I'm guessing her AA animations will come when they actually give her a visual update. Texture changes on her is like texture upgrades on Taric. You're not fixing the main problem where their models are beyond outdated in form. Pizza feet and hair that's rock hard and horribly styled isn't fixable with textures. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-02-08T23:24:04.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"OH NO!
