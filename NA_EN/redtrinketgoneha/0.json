I have been on PBE lately with the AP ratio added to his ult but it just simply doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s enough to bring him back in to viability, may I suggest some basic ability buffs maybe? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T21:26:03.849+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really a Kassadin expert, but I do know it doesn't take much to push that guy over the edge between unplayable and overpowered (he and Ryze have this in common).\n\nI guess that this means is that even small buffs may turn out to be a bigger deal than they read.

Sure it let's you do some more damage, but even before you would mostly use Riftwalk for repositioning, especially with the new 500 range, even if you were positioned good, you saved it to either save yourself or else reposition when people get on to you. This being said I do find him strong with the AP ratio on ult late late game when his ult is fully stacked, but it's nothing special early. We can all agree that Kassadin's ult is what makes him very good, so why doesn't Riot try some buffs to his basic abilities, and scrap the AP ratio on his ult completely?\n\nto be fair they reduced his Q damage by 10 because apparently it was oppressing in lane as a point and click ability with a low cooldown, but even with his huge mana pool and build in mana sustain, he still has problems if he just spams the ability, not to mention it's a scaling ability meaning it doesn't really do much until you get a lot of AP. This being said I find it hits like a wet noodle for an ability with a higher mana cost and decent cooldown.\n\nHis W we can talk about the fact that you need to be in a vulnerable state to use it, A.K.A. Melee range as an assassin. It could use a little love in either the utility or damage departement.\n\nNow his E does a minor amount more base damage than Q and W, I always found this puzzling as it requires time to use, meaning stacks. It could as well use a minor buff in the damage department.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-08-11T11:16:49.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His W's passive could use buffs, it's not even close to a core part of his kit and burst. \n\nThough I may be biased because I play him AD hybrid bruiser in the jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Apulminate","date":"2015-08-11T23:55:29.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Giving him MR per level would make his passive more meaningful, every other melee champ has MR growth. To put into perspective, if you gave him the same MR at lv18 as any other melee champ and took away his passive he would pretty much take the same amount of magic damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"o0O Madoka O0o","date":"2015-08-10T21:39:59.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally haven't practiced on kassidin.
