As pointed out earlier we still have a lot of champs that have outdated lore, but for the sake of keeping a clear focus I'd like to hold this discussion primarily to **champions whose biographies are completely dependent or intricately entwined with the Summoners/the IoW.** Without the aforementioned institutions, where did they come from? Why are they here? What do they want? Nocturne, Fiddlesticks, Lee Sin, fourth example. All the champs. All your favorite champs (I make a lot of bad jokes, by the way. I apologize in advance). \n\nTo give you some insight into our motivations, we're looking at stories holistically, rather than storytelling in a vacuum.  What that means is, our goal is to **preserve core personality aspects of characters** while **reinventing the how and why** of their stories to create an interesting and vibrant world. For the sake of this discussion, you **do not** have to adhere to those rules. Offer any crazy idea you can think of! I'll try and check in as often as I can and respond as often as possible.\n\nA couple points of note: this is **not a promise** to act on any of these suggestions. As well, I'd like this to stay as positive as possible - if you have criticisms feel free to voice them, but I'd rather have a friendly, focused discussion of these champs. Besides their core personalities, they're almost blank slates! Mostly blank. Kind of sort of blank. Ish.\n\nI'll get it started: where should Nocturne come from? Is he a living shadow that kills people in their dreams and impresses nightmares on the waking world in the form of hallucinatory episodes? Or something... more? Share your thoughts! Lets do it!","replies":[{"poster":"2nd Fiddle","date":"2014-10-10T21:56:13.753+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the sake of Jax I am going to point out four facts\n\n1.

I really think Jax should retain his identity as a lighthearted character whose main focus is becoming the best fighter he can be, just because he enjoys it. I don't see him maiming or killing people. This, to me, is the problem with going Musashi with him: Musashi (in folklore) fought with a bokken sometimes, yes, but it ended with him smashing his opponent's head open with it. Musashi was not very whimsical or fun. Jax, I think, should be.\n\nThe best I can come up with would be to lock him into Ionia, where he runs some sort of dojo. Keep him as a light-hearted teacher figure. He could perhaps receive visitors from friendly nations, as well. Maybe Garen would come by for some lessons.\n\nPresumably, he'd resist most efforts by Ionia to send him back onto the battlefields, but something like the invasion of Ionia would do it. So why wouldn't he be fighting with a real weapon then? I guess you could write about him fighting with real weapons during that time period, but that ruins the fun of it.\n\nMaking his lamppost super-awesome, so that it's not a self-nerf, would IMO destroy much of his character.\n\nI guess you could handwave something about a magical geas or whatever that binds him to never again wield a \"weapon\", so he learns to use a lamppost. :\\ Maybe it happened during the invasion.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-10-11T00:13:00.473+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how a Noxian army would react to someone beating the crap out of them with a lamp post, but I could picture Jax fighting them off over and over in an attempt to humiliate them, not injure them.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-10-11T00:24:54.227+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't know how a Noxian army would react to someone beating the crap out of them with a lamp post, but I could picture Jax fighting them off over and over in an attempt to humiliate them, not injure them.\n\nYou know, that's an interesting angle. I had assumed that the invasion would be a \"character-break\" for Jax that revealed another side to him. But that's really pretty generic. I like the idea of him *maintaining* his friendly, gruff demeanor even on the battlefield.\n\nThe Ionians are demoralized. They're losing the will to fight. They've seen unspeakable death. It seems like all the world contains anymore is sadness and misery. They turned to anger, but anger only lasts so long.\n\nThen, Jax comes strutting in. Everyone expects to now see Jax, their lovable friend, turn into a cold-blooded killer in a desperate attempt to defend Ionia, just like every other Ionian has had to become a soldier to survive. But no. He stays Jax. A veritable Jackie Chan movie plays out in front of their eyes as he humiliates the Noxians and drives them into retreat: all with his trusty lamppost. The city is saved, and the story spreads throughout Ionia, restoring hope and giving a few laughs to people who haven't had cause to laugh in a very long time.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2014-10-11T13:07:55.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To me, the problem with that is that the lamppost is a conscious choice.

It speaks to his character. You could do all kinds of other things with the lamppost, e.g. making it into a super-awesome magical lamppost, but IMO that misses the point.

(The friend who introduced me to LoL explained, \"First off, absolutely everything in LoL is a derpy ripoff.\") This makes it much more interesting than a standard played-straight dark-and-gritty fantasy work. Embracing the game is, in my mind, part of that carefree handwavey spirit.

I do agree: I think there's just too much money on the line now. LoL lore, I'm afraid, is going to lose its heart for the same reason that Hollywood movies tend to suck: with this much cash on the line, they have no choice but to take the safe route. So they'll commission Standard Fantasy Universe #1891902, they'll iron out all the \"embarrassing\" or \"amateurish\" quirks, and it will become an entirely forgettable bit of ornamentation that'll get 12-year-olds to say how \"super-cool\" it is.\n\nI'd really like to be wrong. In fact, I'm going to persist in pretending this isn't inevitable.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm going to scale back my involvement in LoL bit by bit, and find something else to look into, because otherwise I'm afraid it's going to leave me pretty sad when all is said and done.

The stated purpose of the thread was to illustrate character development ideas leveraging the League setting, but they're mostly adaptable to a non-League setting as well.\n\nHere's Nocturne's. tl;dr: Deathnote-style thriller.\n\n# Nocturne\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mvuILQ0.png\n*Nocturne lends himself well to horror and psychological thriller stories. The League, and his imprisonment within the Institute, synergizes with this aspect by constraining him with a need for stealth and subterfuge. Without the League, it's much more likely that his stories would revolve around simplistic \"and then Nocturne jumped into someone's dreams and gave them a heart attack. Then he did it again.\" plotlines. With the League, he turns into a sort of Deathnote villain who must disguise his supernatural murders.*\n\n* **Essential Lore.** Nocturne is a dream-stalking phantom who materialized in the Shadow Isles, on the grounds of the Twisted Treeline. He's been imprisoned by the League because (as with Cho'gath) they suspect that \"killing\" him would only release him, and because forcing him to fight exacts a form of retribution.\n* **Note.** In **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)**, and the \"old\" lore, the Shadow Isles have League representation. (They want representation because otherwise it's likely that sooner or later Demacia would come rampaging in to \"cleanse\" the Isles, and the League wants them because of their knowledge of necromancy.) I think this is a good addition for Nocturne in particular.\n* **Note.** A problem with Nocturne in any story universe is that he basically just wants to haunt/kill people. There's room for some storytelling of the \"ghost story\" variety, but to go much beyond that would require expanding his lore — and that's true regardless of whether or not there's a League to lock him up.\n* **Development.** Killing Summoners usually means waiting for them to leave the Institute. Annoyingly, the Summoners with the most power, who are thus the most valuable targets, also tend to spend the most time within the Institute's enchanted walls. However, Runeterran dream-magic is still very crude, and even the League can offer little protection there. Someone makes a deal with Nocturne, offering him another chance to kill the Summoners he so hates by opening a little gap in his arcane prison. But his \"employer\" insists that he be discreet about it: if Nocturne does his usual dream-killing, it's likely that the League will very rapidly figure out what happened and lock him down even tighter. If Nocturne wants to keep this little crack in the wall open, he'll need to be more subtle, perhaps slowly driving his target mad and making it appear to be a Shuriman curse or a Void possession. This would make a nice ghost story.\n* **Development.** Nocturne might become a sort of dream-assassin, allowing for a series of such stories. During their course, he might encounter another dream entity, perhaps a \"guardian angel\" who watches over dreamers. Their battles across the dreamscape could be self-contained stories, or could interact with other plot threads, e.g. through Nocturne's \"employers\". The constraint of the League adds tension here, because Nocturne cannot just go on a rampage, but must kill from the shadows, keeping his identity secret. This might take on a sort of \"Deathnote\" flavor, casting Nocturne as a supernatural serial killer playing a lethal game of chess with a powerful adversary.\n* **Development.** Nocturne could also be freed, of course. Perhaps something is brewing in the Shadow Isles, and Karthus wants to use him as a weapon. Karthus could convince the League to release him to the custody of the Isles, provided that Karthus keeps him on a leash. This could turn into a more involved plot not only through the Shadow Isles conflict but, e.g., if a Demacian or Ionian ventured to the Isles to seek evidence that Karthus isn't keeping Nocturne as \"leashed\" as he promised.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2014-10-10T22:04:51.236+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"I like this a lot. \n\nOne of the things we try to keep in mind is that not every champion has to behave in a humanlike fashion. Sure, we don't want Nocturne to be the League of Legends Freddy Kreuger, but if we make him a dream-stalking Evelynn then we begin to have a) a shadow who is essentially a member of the Black Hand (Hail Sithis), and b) a situation where we're potentially robbing ourselves of more monstrous characters for the sake of JoJ-style interaction, which is the kind of interaction that, with some exceptions (Swain), we'd like to get away from. It also continues a different trend we want to get away from, which is throwing all the X characters into the X themed place (Ionia).

Obviously, he is the living embodiment of a nightmare. Whose nightmare he is? If he the dream of a specific person or a long-forgotten civilization? What if he's not strictly a dream, but rather a spirit of someone long-dead who has faded to the point where he dwells in other people's nightmares? Or what if he's a living person who has become irreversibly connected with other people's nightmares through some form of ritual?\n\nOnce you decide on that direction, you can give him a degree of morality and intelligence that keeps him from randomly murdering people. As the dream of a specific person, he would be guided by both good and bad parts of their subconsciousness; perhaps the good part overwhelming the bad at times is what keeps him from killing. As a spirit or an altered person, he might still be guided by the vestiges of his otherwise shattered human psyche. That way, he can still be a nightmarish machine *but* one with subconscious levers that keep him from going overboard.\n\nEven the Corinthian in Neil Gaiman's Sandman has morals, and he is literally a nightmare created for the explicit purpose of being one by the god of dreams.

What are your thoughts there?\n\nI think Nocturne needs to be constrained somehow, forcing him to be stealthy and scheming. In the example above, the League serves this role, but you could manufacture a non-League constraint that would work similarly.\n\nHere's a tropey but workable option. Nocturne went on a murder-rampage long ago, and was locked away for centuries. He's escaped, but he realizes that if he goes on another spree, he'll end up back in his cage, and they might not make a mistake this time. Rather than inflicting heart attacks that leave victims contorted into expressions of sheer horror, he has to be craftier and more subtle. Otherwise, he's one chummy library research session away from recapture.\n\nhttp://academicalism.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-9.jpg\n*Golly, people dying screaming in their beds, howling about a dark demon from the shadows with blades for arms.

(Compare: the **[Shedim](http://www.sjgames.com/in-nomine/draft/Shedim.html)** from *In Nomine*. See also **[Beleth](http://innomine.wikia.com/wiki/Beleth)**, also from that setting.) He might try to disguise himself as a different supernatural force. For example, he might put on the semblance of a Void demon and recruit followers, starting a crazed witch hunt in Demacia. Go into Nocturne's headspace and just imagine the malevolent glee of watching noble Demacians burning their kin alive on pyres while exchanging suspicious glances in the firelight, wondering who *else* the demons have corrupted.\n\nActually, one of his primary targets might be whatever scholars and mages might be in a position to find him out.

What I'm still curious about is what you think he *is*. Often a character's motivations are affected highly by who they are, and why they are - I guess what I'm asking is, \"**Why** is Nocturne?\"\n\nI see his origins as fundamentally human. I don't mean that he was once human, or that he acts particularly human; what I mean is that the concept of *fear*, and particularly *fear of the darkness*, seem absolutely essential to his being. To me, that indicates that whatever magic created him was linked into the realm of human concepts and emotions.\n\nIf human fear created him, then it seems natural that fear sustains him, and that more to the point, the infliction of fear is what drives him. A human (at least IRL) is the product of evolution: our origin is \"these are the sequences of genetic material that are best at generating phenotypes that replicate that material by acquiring food and reproducing\", and unsurprisingly we like to eat, have sex, tell stories (being social animals geared toward information-sharing, one of our many adaptive traits that helps us survive and reproduce), and so on. We see the world largely in these terms, albeit sometimes through layers of symbolism or abstraction. Well, if Nocturne is a creation of fear, then by analogy one might expect that his perception of existence is based around fear. He inflicts fear not only to survive, but because it's as natural and pleasurable to him as eating is to us.\n\nIn short, I think he's a supernatural being firmly connected with human concepts and feelings, specifically those pertaining to \"fear of the dark\", \"fear of the unknown\", \"unthinking terror\", and so on. Like us, he can reason abstractly, develop plans, look forward to some events, and dread other events, but that's really just ornamentation around his core experience: the infliction of terror.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2014-10-10T23:34:49.160+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"A boogeyman, almost, but for adults.

The personification of fears that never really went away, but are now compounded by the wisdom and unhappiness of life. Am I interpreting that correctly? Because if so...\n> \n> I like it.\n\nYes, I think that's the basic idea: just as a universe of amino acids and chemicals can give rise to biological imperatives to eat and reproduce, and in turn generate cognition, abstraction, and emotion, so too can a universe of concepts give rise to an imperative to inflict terror, and strengthen the concept of nightmares in the human world. So he's a conscious being built from nightmares … but he *is* a conscious being.\n\nLiterary works about serial killers and mass-murderers often employ figurative language along these lines: we speak of a *lust* for blood, or a *hunger* for power. The idea of a killer who \"gets off on death\" is a vivid and frightening one. \"Ordinary people like you and me enjoy playing games, eating snacks, hugging friends, and all that — imagine if someone were instead driven just to kill and destroy! What if murder were their game, and death their food?\" Our revulsion at such an *unnatural* set of desires is part of the emotional hook there.\n\nIn Nocturne's case, though, following this line of thought, it's not really that figurative. He's not \"perverted\". He's not a creature engineered to seek out food who starts seeking out victims to terrorize instead: human terror *is* his food. And just like we're made up of the same basic ingredients that make up our food—you are what you eat, literally—the nightmares he inflicts are part of the basic material of his being.\n\nBut, speaking of \"the wisdom and unhappiness of life\", he must contend with creatures who have desires entirely alien to his own. From his perspective, humans are at once the source of his lifeblood and joy, and yet at the same time totally incomprehensible. He just wants to rip us open and use one piece of us, our capacity to experience fear, like we might shuck an oyster and consume one teensy wriggling bit of its flesh. The difference is that humans are a lot more dangerous to him, and a lot more worthy as opponents, than oysters are to us.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2014-10-10T23:51:29.922+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are the Rune Wars still canon?

If the Rune Wars are still canon, then this can be a big part of it, as he sees the injustices that mankind has inflicted on each other, and begins to lose his mind. This can ensure that he is still the 'creation' of mankind's darkness. Anyway, after years and years of exposure to crazy. He eventually turns into what we see today. A twisted, malevolent being. Now here's the kicker. The reason he kills is because he believes he is doing the world 'justice' by removing those who have completely evil thoughts in their mind. This can open up the path for his rival a 'dream spirit' who kept their sanity, who believes that humans are capable of goodness, and as such shouldn't be killed. Also keeps the possibility of his past self coming through and showing some morality. \n\nHis current quotes can also fit this interpretation. \n\n\"The light is fading.\" - Everywhere he looks, he only sees darkness in the hearts of men\n\n\"This place disgusts me.\" - Disgusted with humanity, as opposed to the world, as he was before.\n\n\"People are flames to be blotted out.\" - Flames are destructive, and must be put out to ensure the safety of the world. \n\n\"Are you my nightmare, or am I yours?\" - This first part packs a lot of meaning. He is scared of humans, scared of what they are capable of. \n\n\nTL;DR: After years of exposure to the hearts of man, and after many wars, Noct believes that humanity must be wiped out, to ensure that evil will no longer be spread.

Ages ago, in a small farm town, there lived a young man. Proud of his family's farm, he always cared deeply for it and tended to the crops. On the day his father passed, he inherited the farmlands and loved them deeply as he had always...except the fields had gone dry. The soil was rough, nothing grew for long and crows swarmed the fields. Time after time, the young man put scarecrows up to ward the birds from his horrible harvest. One...then two...four...eight...eventually the field was a field of scarecrows. Yet still, nothing grew.  Fury welled in his heart as his fellow villagers mocked his decaying farm.*\n\n*One day, the man snapped. In a fit of rage, he set every other crop in his town aflame, cackling madly as those who mocked him saw their food drown in flame. Furious at their lost harvest and seeking revenge, the man was hung for his crimes and his body was used in one final humiliating act as one of the scarecrows he had amassed. Something...changed, however. Months passed, yet no birds dare camped at his scarecrow. As his body decayed, the villagers eventually tried to put a sack over his body and head. Doing so sparked a terrifying change. The scarecrow came to life, a murder of crows circling it as it slaughtered every single person in town. *\n\n*To this day, that deathless monster roams the world, moving from crop to crop to bask in a bountiful harvest. Thus the legend goes: When you see Fiddlesticks in your field, you lock the doors and stay away. For trying to take his harvest will be the last thing you do.*\n\n(Also this ties in the fact that Fiddle has a noose around his neck in the cinematic)","replies":[{"poster":"WickedKing","date":"2014-10-10T23:57:15.701+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I approve this heartfully\n\nAlways felt that using a corpse as a scarecrow, would fit Fiddlesticks origin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2014-10-10T22:22:16.167+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"As fun as discussing biographies alone could be, I'd like to mention one major aspect you'll need to infuse them with. This is an aspect that the last few reworks failed badly with, and is especially a reason why nobody likes Ashe anymore.\n\nThat aspect is player immersion.\n\nPlayer immersion is generally an aspect specific for people who enjoy the game's lore, because they are the ones who like to live in the game's world a little. People who play the game for purely gameplay reasons don't care and won't start caring; they wouldn't have shorthands for champions with long names if they did, neither would they refer to skills entirely by their hotkeys instead of names. But to players who want to immerse themselves, such as lore junkies, it's important to create a small window that allows them to enter the world through that champion.\n\nIn the past, that immersion was provided entirely through the summoner-themed GUI. Now it will need to be provided through the characters themselves, as associating themselves with the characters they currently play is the only remaining window for players. Here is an example...\n\n{{champion:22}} Her old lore provided both opportunities for immersion. As a summoner, I would like to support a major and well-respected political leader who is leading her third-world country onto the global scene. As Ashe, I'm the badass queen who may not have much power on her own but I can lead my team to victory with a well-placed word, a dash of utility and a helpful arrow across the map. Both of those are cool angles...\n\nNow her new lore is... basically a cowardly King Arthur. That could still be a decent immersion angle for a summoner because it means they're supporting a young and inexperienced queen with whose ideals they agree, and hope she'll grow through their guidance. On the other hand, associating yourself with this Ashe's character is just... not very fun. She's flimsy and kinda incompetent and there is no reason to really want to *be her*. She is a huge failure on that regard.\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at the champions you mentioned.\n\n{{champion:24}} His lore will likely need a complete overhaul. A mystery wrapped inside an enigma is just not much for a player to associate with. While the old Jax was fun to play from the summoner angle because you were essentially radio support and drinking buddies for this unstoppable badass who is cocky but lovable, from the point of self-association, he is a complete blank slate. There's nothing going for him.\n\nFor the sake of a rework, I would recommend looking at Wolverine from Marvel Comics. You'll probably want a character who is somewhat mysterious in that only shreds of his past are known (just enough to connect the dots into a vague outline, but not a complete image), whose experience shows through his lines and actions, and whose lack of association with specific factions is made up for via numerous connections with people here and there. Essentially, turn him into a gruff, weary guy who everyone knows and either fears or respects. I know people brought up making him an arena fighter or a mercenary, but I think he'd flow smoother as a vagrant who'd been both but moved on to other things.\n\n{{champion:64}} Overall, he's much easier to associate yourself with because he's a very \"normal\" guy, so let's talk story. A lot of people are attached to his summoner past, so you might want to rework him alongside another mage character. Making him someone's failed apprentice who moved on after a terrible failure is one good angle. Maybe claim that *he's* the one who summoned Nocturne in front of many people, and is out to atone for his old actions? \n\nOh, and you'll need to look into his old history with the Noxus vs. Ionia war. Like many people said, that war makes no logistical sense right now. Basic tactics 101 dictate that Noxus should've been wiped off the face of the planet during it.\n\nEDIT: I *thought* I'd continue in part 2, but there's a perfectly fine Nocturne discussion thread that I'll chip into instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2014-10-10T23:09:27.688+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:22}} While I can't reveal what we're doing with Ashe for obvious reasons, I think you'll find she's anything but a coward.

It's weirdly serendipitous in execution... if handled correctly, anyway.\n\nFor the Ionia/Noxus war, just approach the events as if the IoW never existed, like Opeli said in a different thread.

Basically, Noxus is in this very unfortunate geographical position where leading an army against Ionia would force it to cover three fronts at once and suffer *really* bad losses. It's honestly an angle you'd want to rework completely unless you intend to completely redraw Valoran's geography.\n\n{{champion:22}} That will hopefully be the case. She's been my main for a third of my time in League and the first character I ever RPed.

Lee Sin paints a very cool martial artist, but he doesn't really have anything that makes him seem like a mage.

Dereet up-thread mentioned the idea of Lee Sin being the one to summon Cho'Gath into Valoran; perhaps he broke into his master's library and stole a major tome, confusing it as a summoning tome when it was Kassadin studying how to keep the Void at bay. The implications for why he studied magic could grow from there. Perhaps Lee Sin was a prodigy who got ahead of himself and assumed he could handle anything he wants? Kassadin has a daughter; perhaps Lee Sin had a thing for her and apprenticed under her master to impress her.\n\nAn important aspect to remember of Lee Sin is that while we know him as wise and reserved, his lore implies that he was very arrogant in his youth.

He doesn't ask why they want to fight; he's too weary for that moral burden. He just appreciates the aesthetics of the fighting arts. He cares more about your sword style than your personality.

It's a self-nerf: he fights with the lamppost because it makes his fights more challenging, and because he thinks people obsess too much over their weapons.\n\n2. (More complicated.) The Noxian invasion was the one time he heeded the call to battle. During that invasion, (standard option) he saw so much death that he couldn't bring himself to pick up an implement of war ever again, or (hokey option) something happened that placed a magical geas on him, that prevents him from using a \"weapon\". (Options might range from a curse to some kind of pact; the generic example that comes to my mind first would be him striking through a human shield to kill a Noxian sorcerer, then taking that oath to give Soraka the power she needed to revive the victim.)\n\nI mean, you could do something that'd get rid of the lamppost, or make it a super-awesome deadly lamppost (the last piece of a destroyed temple?
