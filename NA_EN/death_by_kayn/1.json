My FPS is stuck at 30 FPS, no matter what I do. If I tab in, it jumps up to 160-200 FPS (which is what I normally play at), then drops back to 30 FPS after about 5 seconds. This happens without fail. I do have the XBOX game bar disabled. Laptop is Samsung Notebook 7 Spin, with a NVIDIA graphics card (latest update).\r\nSend Help Plz","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T23:28:29.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the troubleshooting so far, including the game bar!
