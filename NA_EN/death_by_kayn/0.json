You completely nailed it when you said that hearing it out of context you can tell exactly who this song was made for. There are very distinct \"reksai burrowed\" and \"reksai unburrowed\" sections and the music does a great job conveying her kit and combat patterns as well. (She's burrowed,  stalking, hunting - oh - now she senses someone and starts moving a little faster,  stalking, stalking, and then BURST out of the ground and slaughter.)\n\nGood ears my man!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hrud","date":"2014-12-09T05:17:48.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how the song as this vibe of '' impending doom''.\n\nCan really feel like something BIG AND SCARY is coming your way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EnderForHegemon","date":"2014-12-09T12:33:29.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Myself I like the impression of movement in the music.

Wow, I do *like* the piece - I think it's actually really good... but I don't feel it convey's the champ at all - other than the slightly claustrophobic feel. I felt like this was a Quake splash soundbyte. I was expecting something more desert isolationist vibe - which would have meshed well with the storyboards we got. faint ringing of bells, wind, earth pounding sounds... dunno.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zane yalgir","date":"2014-12-09T10:19:37.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Loooooove the new login.
