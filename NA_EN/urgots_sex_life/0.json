It&#039;s not even needed, it causes fps drops, for no reason at all, you can even terminate the task (LoLclient) and the game will start to run a bit better, but when the game is done, it closes after you accept your victory or defeat","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-15T19:55:20.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using RAM does not cause FPS drops, unless your computer has a whole 4GB of RAM, lots of background processes, a slow hard drive and an aggressive pagefile. Either way you can simply enable low-spec mode and have the client close during games, this is why low-spec mode exists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GankedByWindows","date":"2017-04-15T19:32:12.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on the new client?
