This problem needs to be resolved cause a lot of my friends and even players in my games say they have the same problem in EUW. This has been occurring since the start of October and it's very irritating to just watch yourself glide around the map, and whenever i get into team fights it's even worse, sometimes i just die instantly and see i have 500 ping, then it lowers to 30 ping like nothing even happened. I NEED RIOT TO FIX THIS SERVER LAG, PLEASE HELP US.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-SithKon","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T16:16:44.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These sudden ping spikes sounds like packet loss or some sort of network instability.
