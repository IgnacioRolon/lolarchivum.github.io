This happens randomly, whether I'm in lane or in a team fight, and usually happens 2-3 times a game. I was wondering if anyone else had these issues, and if there is a known cause/fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T02:36:36.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed a good deal of players slowly getting a windows creator update, so as usual, let's first make sure the Game DVR feature is still turned on in the Windows settings. After that, make sure you check for driver updates really quick as that can be a really quick and easy fix for fps issues. \n\nIf nothing seems to help so far, make sure you check out the other steps in the [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) too. Those steps cover the basics of most fps issues, but definitely hit me back up if they don't help either!","replies":[]}]}
