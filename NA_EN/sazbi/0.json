The download rate will bounce around in the 3-4 digits and then after awhile taper off gradually towards 0.  The graph of the tapering would look like an asymptote, for you fellow math geeks.  If you restart the client, it'll do a scan and pick up where you left off, before doing the process all over again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-02-05T04:30:49.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Sazbi!\n\nTo be perfectly honest, it is incredibly difficult to pick out what could be the root cause for your download speed dropping like a brick in water.  Because of that, the best approach is to try the different steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  Most of the steps here have been known to resolve the download speed issues in the patcher, which is why I recommend that you try to complete all of the steps (I know you already tried disabling your Firewall, but make sure you try disabling your Windows Firewall to see if this helps improves your download speed).\n\nIf your still unable to download the latest patch due to your speed consistently reaching 0 kbs, they I recommend [submitting a new ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  One of our Tech guru's can work with you one-on-one in order to get this resolved.
