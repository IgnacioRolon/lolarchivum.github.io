Although not everything about ARAM is designed well like the fact ohhh I don't know Blitz, and Veigar are broken on it and champions like Evelyn are useless on it... now for those of us owning Blitz and Veigar we don't care we love getting them because we know we can hard carry on the mode if we play decently even if we have no strategy we can hard carry with them just by using Veigar's E at the right time or Blitz's Grab both of which cover a decent chunk of the map considering how narrow it is but if you have someone like Evelyn who's passive lets you go invisible but gives you a giant circle that if people enter they can see you, you kinda just die unless you or your teammates can find a way to make it easier for you either to sneak behind or single someone out....but lets go to the broken champions like blitz who's grab reaches a good length and stuns now in aram you pretty much are fucked if you get grabbed by it I shouldn't have to not want to check bush or something because I know blitz might grab me or like veigar I shouldn't have to worry about moving slower and watching the ground not my enemies so I don't get stunned and die i feel like either certain champions need to be removed from play in aram or nurfed to make it fair and fun again instead of \"oh you got your main or a good character? too bad veigar i win!\" because im getting sick of dying 24/7 no matter my character because of those two or getting Evelyn and dying you know every few minutes its annoying it makes me want to leave granted I don't but I still want to and that shouldn't be the case also All Random All Mid is kind of a lie as its not \"All Random\" only sorta random make it to where its completely random so we can try stupid things or test new characters we were thinking about getting instead of \"oh hey i got tristana 5 flippin games in a row\" and along those lines find some way to not have 5 cc capable champs on one team its annoying being stunned for 10 seconds or slowed for 10 seconds or silenced or even better a mix of the three because then its just a game of how long can the other team last before cc central over there wins granted for many im sure this seems stupid hell to me it seems a bit stupid but i feel like it needs to be addressed but idk might just be me\r\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-07-10T19:58:18.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you encounter enemies like Blitz or Veigar you should adjust your play accordingly, whether it be ARAM or on the Rift. \n\nNow if we were to unlock the entire roster  for all players on the other hand so we could stop coming up against these ARAM specific accounts, that would be nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mkyner","date":"2017-07-10T22:15:33.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about being able to spend IP on ARAM rerolls?

(Well, I would personally go beyond that and do something with rerolls, too, but that's very unlikely to happen). I care more that the game is fair than it is balanced. In a random game mode, the way to ensure fairness is to give every player an equal chance at getting any individual champion. Honestly, it's not even that I feel like ARAM accounts are ruining the mode, it's just a conceptual thing to me. \n\nAnd FYI, Blitz is pretty much a trap champion in ARAM these days. He's hovering between 49-50% win rate in the mode. He's mostly useful for getting some early kills, but Riot bumped up the pace of the game so much that those early advantages don't mean a whole lot anymore. And he really falls off later on, especially if his opponent has one or two strong front line presences that Blitz doesn't even want to pull.\n\nBut yeah, Veigar is pretty busted, tbh.
