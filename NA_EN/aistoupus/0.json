I'm curious if you're running on Windowed mode, and accidentally hitting the Windows button.  What happens if you run in full screen?  Also if you select your Taskbar Properties, there should be an option to auto-hide the taskbar in case that's getting in the way.\n\nIf none of that helps, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our tech team can figure out what's going on!","replies":[{"poster":"Aistoupus","date":"2017-07-07T20:58:11.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!\n\nRunning fullscreened. Sorry that I didn't mention it. Didn't press the windows key, its a forbidden key in games haha. Tried hiding the taskbar when I made sure it was locked and still caused the issue!\n\nI'm running the repair in the settings for League right now and have reported the bug. Hopefully I don't have to reinstall. :X","replies":[]}]}]}
