Run a traceroute to the NA server at 104.160.131.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and post the results here so I can see. \n\nPacket loss happens outside of your network generally, but before it hits our servers, so it's likely being caused by certain nodes your ISP uses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-29T17:22:15.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Global average is not 20-34 ms at all. I am very curious as to how you found that ping average. Many players play with 50-100 and in my experience that’s the most common ping players play with - but there’s players that make do with 100-200 ms ping as well. Ping is not influenced much by your graphics card and computer setup - your ping (latency) is an effect of solely your internet connection to Riot’s servers. If it’s below 100, there’s likely not *much* you can do to make it better other than moving closer to Chicago.\n\nYour huge delay on key presses sounds like it may be packet loss of some kind and/or latency spikes. I recommend following [these steps from Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) - specifically for Packet Loss, Packet Buffering, and Disabling Peer-to-Peer Updates (Windows 10). If those don’t help, submit a support ticket so an agent can help look into it further for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Brönze VII","date":"2018-02-04T03:50:01.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOUR ISP'S CONNECTION SCORE\nComcast\nYOUR CONNECTION SCORE\nComcast\nBEST ISP CONNECTION SCORE\nK-20 Telecom\n92/100\nQUALITY: GREAT\n91/100\nQUALITY: GREAT\n93/100\nQUALITY: GREAT\nEthernet\t92\nLatency\t52 ms\nPacket Loss\t0.17%\nJitter\t0 ms\nEthernet\t91\nLatency\t56 ms\nPacket Loss\t0.02%\nJitter\t1 ms\nGames\t20\nWifi\t--\nNo games played on WiFi\nEthernet\t93\nLatency\t44 ms\nPacket Loss\t0.16%\nJitter\t0 ms\nInternet Service Provider Leaderboard","replies":[{"poster":"Brönze VII","date":"2018-02-05T22:42:28.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ISP is saying its on your end, Riot games end and there is nothing I can do, its the new reality of most,if not  for  gamers that this Net Neutrality is in play,and its playing for $$$ and not the consumer benefit and companies who provide a service on the Internet are playing dirty, I guess I have to live it, and have shitty ping.
