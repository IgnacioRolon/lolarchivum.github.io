There are ways to convey criticism without being toxic. For example: \"I don't think you should build a ZZRot portal on Sivir.\" vs \"What kind of idiot builds a ZZRot on Sivir?\".\r\n\r\nNow, going on with my post, players have a very bad habit of responding to even light criticism with extreme toxicity. Just because I'm trying to criticize you and give you advice does not mean I think you're a bad player. I don't think you're an idiot. Ignorance is much different than stupidity. Good players, and smart people, can still make mistakes, because we're humans. \r\n\r\nHowever, people seem to jump immediately to being hostile upon being criticized. Here are some examples I've dealt with lately.\r\n\r\nStory 1: Had a Twitch ADC. Everytime he would ult, he would flash TOWARDS the people he was ulting. Every time. After the third time I watched him flash into melee range of a Mordekaiser, I told him he doesn't have to flash towards the Mordekaiser. I said, specifically, \"You don't have to flash towards people, especially when using your ult Twitch.\" He became hostile, immediately telling me \"Oh, so now you're harassing me? What the hell is wrong with you?\" He then proceeded to call me an \"idiot\" multiple times and claimed he never flashed into the enemy team. He threatened to report me for name calling, which I said was hypocritical, and I never called him any names. I asked him to state what name I called him, and he said (and I quote) \"You implied it by telling me I didn't have to flash. Don't you know you don't have to call someone a name to call someone something?\" That, to me, is logical gymnastics at it's finest.\r\n\r\nStory 2:  I was playing top lane Aatrox. I managed to get my lane in a perfect position to freeze it near my tower. I had a good wave built up, and was zoning the enemy Jarvan perfectly. I was about 20 CS ahead, when my jungler came top. Their jungler was also top, so nothing really happened. Their jungler left to clear more jungle or something, and my Shaco stayed top. He then proceeded to hard shove my lane. Boxes, smites, his E, he was using everything to push my lane as hard as he could and take as much CS as he could. He did this for 2 whole waves, shoving it all towards Jarvan and completely destroying my lane control. I was pretty upset about this. Anyone who plays top lane knows how hard that can mess up your lane, and could turn a winning lane into a losing one. I called him out, saying \"You messed up my freeze by shoving it towards him. You really fucked up my lane dude.\" to which he became hostile, telling me \"It doesn't matter, shut up. You suck anyways.\" I tried to enlighten him to why lane control was important, and how freezing works. He responding \"I don't care, shut up. I wanted level 6.\" We ended up winning, because I dove the Jarvan at 6 and proceeded to dumpster him in lane, but if we were two players on even footing, I easily could've gotten counter-frozen and just been zoned out of the game by J4. \r\n\r\nStory 3: I'm playing Aatrox again, this time in ARAM because I'm playing with some friends. Game is looking kinda dodgy, Sivir is heavily behind (she was 5/11) and I'm one of the only ones doing well (9/4). A 4v5 broke out because the enemy Rammus engaged on our Karma. I went in, diving for their backrow. I got two of them, and died. The rest of my team got rolled over. Sivir came much later, and got dove and died. I tried to give advice, saying \"Hey guys, buy magic resist. They have no physical damage.\" and Sivir replied \"Can't you fucking wait before you engage?\" Being a bit cheeky, but also just stating a fact, I said \"Waiting for a 5/11 Sivir wouldn't have much impact on the fight, and I counter engaged.\" She said, \"Okay, enjoy the 4v5 then\" and threatened to AFK because I had \"attacked\" her. I simply stated her score. After the game (which we won, she got off her ass after we won a 4v5 teamfight.) she proceeded to call me iron garbage, tell me to kill myself, and to uninstall the game because I'm garbage and will never be good. I outdamaged her, had more assists, more kills, less deaths, more gold, and was the main tank in every teamfight. \r\n\r\nMoral of the story, take criticism with a grain of salt. If someone is trying to help you improve, they're not calling you bad. They're trying to teach you, so that you can learn from your mistakes. If you think everything is the game's fault, and won't take someone else's point of view in what you're doing wrong, you will never improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadowbyte","date":"2019-06-10T03:05:07.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"It's the way riot punishes people.

As long as swearing is not aimed at a player directly, it is allowed. Something like \"Wow, Baron hits really fucking hard. Baron is a bitch\" vs \"This fucking Sivir player is a piece of shit\" are completely different things, and Riot understands that. \n\nWhen it comes down to reviews, Riot will understand if you are purposefully flaming someone or being objective.

I don't really have this problem as much in ranked, but I don't play a lot of ranked. But the matchmaking in this game is utterly broken. I just got out of a game with multiple golds, a couple diamonds, a bronze, two unranked, and one level 20.

Things like Twitch flashing into melee range of a Mordekaiser is a mistake that, if he stopped doing it, would lead to him possibly playing better and therefore increasing my chances of winning. I'm not doing it to demoralize and put down my teammates, and I actually do the exact opposite in the game as well. I compliment people on the things they do well. I also take the same criticism.\n\nI don't imply anyone is a \"bad\" player when I criticize them. The best players in the entire world can make mistakes. And that's the exact point of this entire post, that people shouldn't take honest criticism of their gameplay as a personal attack, but instead take it as constructive and learn from it.\n\nFor instance, just because a player doesn't know how to counter or play around Baron doesn't mean they're a bad player, simply means they have yet to learn how to properly contest objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-11T06:36:41.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no that twitch example is not worth the flame dude\nI'd at least bother talking about macro decisions but micro mistakes like this are not worth the hassle just tilting people for no reason\n\nalso ppl are setressed while they are trying to win so their tolerance for criticism is expected to be lower than usual it's not about them having a gigantic ego that accept no blame it just isn't the right time to talk about it inside a match imo also ur tone could make the difference","replies":[{"poster":"Dr40UR","date":"2019-06-11T06:47:47.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luther King Jr V,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IYmUAb46,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2019-06-11T06:36:41.951+0000)\n>\n> no that twitch example is not worth the flame dude\n> I'd at least bother talking about macro decisions but micro mistakes like this are not worth the hassle just tilting people for no reason\n> \n> also ppl are setressed while they are trying to win so their tolerance for criticism is expected to be lower than usual it's not about them having a gigantic ego that accept no blame it just isn't the right time to talk about it inside a match imo also ur tone could make the difference\n\nCould I put it any nicer? The meanest thing I said here was the thing about Sivir, and even that was just stating a fact. You think that small sentence is flaming? You obviously haven't heard REAL flaming dude. Micro mistakes? Wasting your ultimate as Twitch, and your Flash which is a 5 minute cooldown just to flash to your death is a MINOR mistake? No, he was practically inting, because flashing into melee range of someone who can kill you in 1 or 2 auto attacks is much more than a minor mistake. Twitch was our carry, meaning he is the one supposed to be doing the majority of the damage and killing the enemy team. So him flashing out of our protection and to his death is more than a \"minor\" mistake. It's a major mistake. He might as well be sitting in the base, but that would actually be more advantageous because if he was in base he wouldn't be giving the enemy gold and experience by killing himself. I could've told him that flashing into the enemy morde was moronic, and anyone who has ever qued for the role of ADC would know that, but instead I stated the mistake in a simple and concise way, without any personal attacks. \n\nPeople who are constantly stressed out while playing normals in League should look for a different hobby. If you find normals in this game that stressful that you jump down the throat of the first person who opposes you, even in the most minor ways, then you are in the wrong environment. I get that League can be a stressful game, but that doesn't mean you have the right to take it out on a teammate with good intentions. Taking your frustrations out on your teammates is what normal people call toxic. Especially when said teammate did nothing wrong, which I didn't. If I DID do something wrong, I would've had some kind of punishment, but I don't. Matter of fact, I'm honor level 3. \n\nI didn't say they had a gigantic ego, I said they have a fragile ego. When someone gets even minorly criticized for something and they immediately respond telling me I'm an idiot, and I should kill myself, that's the exact equivalent to having an extremely fragile ego. They think they can't do anything wrong, and that it's always their teammates fault. They think even though they flashed into melee range, or they got caught out, or they decided to split push bottom, that they were right and the rest of their team is wrong. And those players are the most insufferable to play with, because they can't just accept the fact they did something wrong and learn from it. Instead, they blame everyone else and take out their frustrations on their teammates. Those kinds of teammates are the ones who are going to stay where they are. They're going to keep making the same mistakes, doing the same thing, and wondering why it only works sometimes. Instead of learning from their mistakes and improving.","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-11T07:01:14.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh the post is too long so i didn't read details\n\nif someone tells u to kys for minor stuff they are just childish\n\nbut u have to understand that these people are strangers and so are you to them they have no idea what are your intentions from saying something to them so even if u had good intentions AT HEART it doesn't matter, if it sounds like flame to them they'll react to it as if it's flame \n\nmany players in this community are mean and childish and will curse their teammates when they do bad or they are losing so they could carry on with the negative attitude they acquired from other games and blow up at your game, finally, after tolerating a lot of abuse, yes even minor things could set them off then, it sucks for you maybe but that's how things are\n\nalso having honor level 3 doesnt mean u are immune to flaming others but ok","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr40UR","date":"2019-06-10T04:08:02.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Overall, I'm certainly not tiptoeing that hard.
