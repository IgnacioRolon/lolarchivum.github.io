Why would you give an assassin completely free sustain for doing nothing but chucking an ability at minions? And it's not like it's a little healing. I've seen Akali's heal over half their health with a gunblade simply off one Q. It doesn't take any skill. I'm okay with her being slippery, with her ultimate, and everything else in her kit. Even the (kinda stupid) \"true stealth\". But why give her such an easy accessible heal? Old Akali healed, yes. But after her changes to balance her out, it was only on an auto attack. And it wasn't nearly as considerable as it is now. Laning against Akali, seeing as she has no mana, is basically 100-0 her, or just get pushed out of lane or dove eventually. You will NEVER out sustain her on any champion. It's just not possible. As far as I know, there's only two items that are anti-healing in the game. One is a late game armor pen item, one that you wouldn't really want to grab early, and the other one only works below 40% health (or something like that, idr the numbers), which Akali rarely gets to because the second you try to do any meaningful damage to her, she shrouds and runs away. Then she can Q back to full health.\n\nEasy proposed change: Put the heal on her empowered auto attack. Focus her kit more on her all-in potential and aggressive, slippery play style. Instead of being able to Q the minions and heal a bunch for free, she has to actually get in range to hit you with a Q or E and then auto attack something with the empowered auto. It would increase her outplay potential, since she could suddenly get a heal after hitting her E and diving onto you. It'd feel more fair since the player could play around it, and could offer more counterplay to champions that can keep her back.","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-10-01T08:10:00.055+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":10,"body":"Because then she would be punished for mistakes, can't have that!","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-10-01T16:30:23.950+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"Mistake? which mistake?  being poked for free because you're a melee champ with no killing pressure until lvl 6 is now a mistake??\n\nBoards talking about design OMEGALUL","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-10-01T18:44:27.929+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"You want to talk about design?\n\nYes getting hit by every possible poking ability is a mistake\n\nWhy are we not giving Zed a heal on his Q then?\nWhy no heal on Fizz?\nDiana?\nKassadin?\n\nBelieve it or not but not every champ has to be good into every single scenario into every single matchup\nYou can actually add a weakness to a champion that opponents can use... you know... actual counterplay?\n\nTell me the weakness of Akali regarding laning phase pls\n\nAnd don't tell me \"JuSt dOdGe BrO\"","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-10-01T19:10:37.442+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Kassadin has magic shield to counter poke and his passive to counter poke\ndiana has shield on W\nfizz and zed can kill laners at lvl 3\n\ninform yourself","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-10-01T19:27:37.707+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Do you think I'm stupid or something?\nand Akali has stealth for 9 seconds?\n\nSo why does she need 2 things?\n\nAlso Diana + Kassa use mana so eventually they have to back and so does Fizz if he wants to trickster every skillshot the enemy throws at him\n\nFizz and Zed killing laners at lvl 3 has nothing to do with this discussion","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-10-01T19:30:42.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nelogis,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PwJfvG9e,comment-id=00010000000100000000,timestamp=2018-10-01T19:27:37.707+0000)\n>\n> Do you think I&#x27;m stupid or something?\n> and Akali has stealth for 9 seconds?\n> \n\nsince when stealth counters poke? especially when said stealth needs you to reveal yourself+ has 17 sec cd AFTER the shroud expires\n\n\n> Also Diana + Kassa use mana so eventually they have to back\n> \n\nThat is true for Diana, kassadin never goes out of mana because he has mana sustain in his kit\nalso right now mana is not an issue for any midlaner because of time warp that is fucking disgusting and won't be nerfed\n> Fizz and Zed killing laners at lvl 3 has nothing to do with this discussion\n\nwhat the fuck? why would they need to counter poke if they can kill the people who poke them?","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-10-02T07:23:49.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"good luck hitting something you can‘t see\n\nOh also the guy invisible is movementspeed buffed\n\nShroud -> spam AOE to clear wave and heal -> wait for next wave -> repeat until you can kill enemy laner\n\nNoice counterplay there 10/10 design\n\nKassa has to get close to minions to get mana and risks getting poked even more because of that\n\nAlso the fact sill remains, they have mana, Akali does not\n\nGetting killed from full HP down by a lvl 3 Zed/Fizz is really not something that should be happening anyways\n\nEdit: Also dont forget that if you yolo something into the shroud and miss then akali will just engage on you since you wasted a damage spell on lvl 3","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2018-10-02T07:33:26.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nelogis,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PwJfvG9e,comment-id=0001000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-02T07:23:49.298+0000)\n>\n> good luck hitting something you can‘t see\n> \n> Oh also the guy invisible is movementspeed buffed\n> \n> Shroud -&gt; spam AOE to clear wave and heal -&gt; wait for next wave -&gt; repeat until you can kill enemy laner\n> \n> Noice counterplay there 10/10 design\n> \n> Kassa has to get close to minions to get mana and risks getting poked even more because of that\n> \n> Also the fact sill remains, they have mana, Akali does not\n> \n> Getting killed from full HP down by a lvl 3 Zed/Fizz is really not something that should be happening anyways\n> \n> Edit: Also dont forget that if you yolo something into the shroud and miss then akali will just engage on you since you wasted a damage spell on lvl 3\n\nYou do know that Akali gets like... 80 health off her Q, right?

Math time. \nAkalis Q does 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 (+ 65% AD) (+ 50% AP) damage with 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% healing. \nShe has 200 energy. \nHer Q only heals at 180+ energy. \nRealistically, you get maybe... 100AP in the lane phase.  Factoring this in... \n125+60 (185)*0.4 = 74 healing at rank 5, meaning that in the lane phase she will not be healing very much.\n\nOn to her W... It lasts 7 seconds, gets smaller over time,  blocks your E,  and has its duration increased by 0.5 seconds each time you weave in and out. Also, since you didnt bother to look it up, Trundles zone lasts 8 seconds. \n_If you decide to stay and fight the champion who goes invisible or controls an area, that is 100% your own fault_. You dont have to back to base, you just have to fall back so you disengage the fight. I understand the whole concept of \"tactical retreat\" goes against the wanton \"GOTTA HIT HIGH AND FAST GOTTA FIGHT\" mentality so many players who whine about Akali have, but its the hard honest truth. \n\nAs for healing, Yoricks heal is 12-82 and 24-164 when below 50% health on a 4 second cooldown. Assuming level 8 (since one point in each ability+4 extra in your chosen skill).... Yorick will be healing for 30 and 60 on a 3.5~3 second cooldown. Meanwhile Akali will be healing for 74 if she has 100AP and only while she has above 180 energy. \nYorick has a MUCH STRONGER sustain than Akali does, by far. \n\nOnto your last points then; On a skill-shot based champion, a point which you seem to not understand, _dodge the easily dodgeable skill shot IS the counterplay_. Running away from _their relatively easily manipulated zone IS the counterplay_. Not _picking a champion that is only targeted damage IS the counterplay_. \nYou need to understand that compared to champions like Ekko, Zed, Talon, and Kha'zix the mostly skill-shot based Akali who cant instantly burst people unless ahead IS one of the most balanced assassins currently in the game. \nHell, you need to understand that the current iteration of Akali is _a thousand times more balanced than the previous version was_. Until you do, all of your arguments will revolve around \"BUT I SAID SHES BROOOOOOOKEEEEEEEEEN\". \n\nYour last point, sustain and healthy assassin... They are not mutually exclusive.

I'll admit he'll have a harder time than Akali in laning phase, especially if you don't know how to play him, but for the most part, he can stay healthy against poke way better than akali can just from that E of his\n\nDiana, can farm the most safely out of all of the 4 examples as her range is pretty damn long, and well she has a shield of course.\n\nKassadin is the only one that's really like akali in a sense that his Q is pretty short range along with his E, but in trades or even farming, should the enemy try to poke you, you get to mitigate some of that damage.\n\nZed and Fizz both risk of burning a major spell that's helpful for keeping them in lane, which are both mobility spells and high cooldown, so that's when you jump on them, or they'll play safe until cooldowns are almost up. Akali is similar in that regard, in which she can use her W to help her farm, or just avoid poke temporarily, but you can still hit her with aoe and skillshot abilities in that shroud, so the moment she pops up, you have an idea where you can hit her, so the shroud isn't the best tool to help sustain yourself in lane, but it's a tool none of the less.\n\nAkali also can't farm safely that well because her Q is a pitiful 25 base damage at level 1. Yea try last hitting with that, so most of the time you have to auto the melee minions which you'll probably get poked on, but oh goodie, her Q heals at 180 energy+ and it's a mere 20% of that Q damage. Oh the horror she can heal up when I poke, sure she can get gunblade to heal up more, but that's like ~10 minutes in the game minimum, at that time, she'll be around level 9, where the Q heal is 40% of the damage. In that time, she's healing for nearly jack shit with that Q, but over time it'll build up, and that's her way of being able to stay in lane or else there's barely any way she farm as she'll be forced to give up due to low hp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-10-03T16:12:12.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz can nullify all incoming damage with a mobility spell...why should he ALSO get a heal?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-10-01T22:50:27.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just dodge bro","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr40UR","date":"2018-10-01T16:37:16.534+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=D357R0Y3R,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PwJfvG9e,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-10-01T16:30:23.950+0000)\n>\n> Mistake? which mistake?  being poked for free because you&#x27;re a melee champ with no killing pressure until lvl 6 is now a mistake??\n> \n> Boards talking about design OMEGALUL\n\nLol what? No kill pressure until level 6? She has no mana, she has a stealth field, and she has a really reliable gap closer. Akali has plenty of kill pressure pre-6, especially with ignite. She isn't pre-rework Nidalee or something. Not to mention, I'm proposing buffing her all-in and trading potential over her ability to just have free sustain that is way over-tuned. I agree, Akali with short range should be rewarded for being able to get in on mages and trade. But she shouldn't be rewarded for throwing her Q at minions and healing, especially when she doesn't have to worry about mana on top of that.\n\nImagine if Riven's Q healed her. Just think about that. Every time Riven Q'd on minions, it would heal her. Now imagine that she had that from the start. Would people argue \"Well, she needs it, because she has to heal to be able to trade with the enemy top laner! She's a squishy bruiser, so it makes sense. It's always been there!\" People would hate Riven beyond everything, because she'd automatically win every single trade with you. The balance would be stupid, and you'd have dumb shit like Riven mid.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-10-01T17:13:20.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you get killed by Akali before lvl 6 you need to question yourself\n\nher Q is terribly low ranged, her E is blockable by minions and dodgeable, Q also costs 100 energy and E has 16 sec cd\n\nAkali before lvl 6 just gets poked non stop, she cannot do anything else and if she didn't have sustain the champ would not have been able to work","replies":[{"poster":"Dr40UR","date":"2018-10-01T21:54:15.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=D357R0Y3R,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PwJfvG9e,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2018-10-01T17:13:20.280+0000)\n>\n> if you get killed by Akali before lvl 6 you need to question yourself\n> \n> her Q is terribly low ranged, her E is blockable by minions and dodgeable, Q also costs 100 energy and E has 16 sec cd\n> \n> Akali before lvl 6 just gets poked non stop, she cannot do anything else and if she didn&#x27;t have sustain the champ would not have been able to work\n\nEven if Akali can't kill you pre-6, which good ones can, you still can't outsustain or pressure her in lane at all. Any mistake she makes is instantly gone in about 2 minutes. She can fully heal from a bad trade or poke in stupid amounts of time. And while you dedicated resources to that poke, Akali doesn't dedicate anything because energy regenerates and her Q has a low CD. Also, the healing goes up and the energy cost goes down as she levels it.\n\nAkali can easily bully people in lane, it just requires understanding her kit. Even if her E hits a minion, you can jump to that minion to get in free poke. Any poke you take back is non-existent since she can just heal it back instantly. She can use shroud to easily get 2 or 3 Q's on the enemy, since shroud and her empowered auto restore energy. You can E to a minion, if for some reason you can't hit the laner, Q shroud, walk out of circle then back up to them stealthed, empower auto Q. And any ability or poke you eat during that is completely negated because of the Q heal. She simply slinks back to safety, because Shroud is still up, Q's minions twice, and is back to full health.\n\nNot to mention, Akali should be weak to poke heavy lanes. It's natural for assassins. Since when were assassins noted as \"sustain heavy\" mid-laners? Any other melee assassin that's played mid doesn't have free healing. Kassadin doesn't, Fizz doesn't, Diana doesn't. Yes, Fizz has troll-pole and Diana has a shield and Kassadin has some poke. But they can all still be poked out of lane, easily. Yes Fizz can kill you level 3, but 1 you should know that and play around it, and 2 assassins are supposed to be high risk high reward and focus on their all-in potential. Akali is low risk high reward. Which is the issue with her balance. Hence my thoughts to put her healing on her empowered auto attack, because there's risk involved in getting that empowered auto. There is no risk to being able to eat abilities and make mistakes and just heal it back up. In my honest opinion, it's not healthy gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-10-03T16:10:47.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aight, guy, I'm stopping you here.\n\nAkali's Q heals for 40% of the damage she does in lane whenever she has *most* of her energy.

Balance, and discussions about it, are completely different than win rates. Akali is by no means an easy to play champion, and has a very high skill ceiling, therefore you'll have more games where inexperienced players try to play her, and don't do it correctly, which leads to her having a lower than average win rate. Seeing as she's quite a popular champion right now, I'm guessing there's a lot of people playing her, at least I tend to see her pretty regularly whenever she isn't banned.\n\nDespite win rates, it has nothing to do with whether or not a specific part of the champion's kit is balanced or not.
