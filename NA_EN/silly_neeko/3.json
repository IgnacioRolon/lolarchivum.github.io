Support takes the least amount of skill by far of all the roles. Most of the supports play out the exact same. It's just harrassing during the laning phase and peeling in teamfights. Support also probably has the least amount of mechanical skill required of all the roles overall besides jungling with tanks. Even the hardest supports really aren't hard at all when you don't have to focus on farming.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2016-12-25T04:37:19.274+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't possibly be THIS dense.

You can CC all you want but if your team and adc run with their tails between their legs, the CC was 'useless' no matter if your team would have won the fight. The support is reliant on their ADC and team to follow up. This is an issue in lower brackets.\n\nBasically the ADC and Support should play like they are one champion. It's the same concept as marriage where two people become one. The support relies heavily on either the ADC early game and/or the entire team late game. The team should also rely on the support but they don't always do that.","replies":[{"poster":"DemonikSoul","date":"2016-12-25T07:45:29.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"thats only true for support supports like soraka/janna/taric etc who anable their teammates.

You don't have to manage waves, cs, or actually do anything difficult in lane phase. After lane phase you kinda just get your jg to come with you and throw a few wards in some places. Mid-late game you just exhaust anyone who jumps on your carries and then shield your team. \n\nTheoretically, it should require a lot more game knowledge than most roles because you should need to know a lot of 2v2 matchups and how to play them. In all reality though, you're only going to see about 6 marksmen bot lane in league so you don't even need a lot of game knowledge.\n\nSupport isn't easy, but calling it harder than or even as hard as some other roles is a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-12-25T16:02:33.933+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.

I hope so much next time I end up in botlane enemy support thinks this:p. Sure you don't have to Cs but you have to contribute to settle the lane, especially if you get pushed in and have to prepare the Cs for your ADC to last hit, also if you are a poking one you have to make sure your poke doesn't push the lane in the wrong moments.  I am a mid main and managing the lane is way more easily in solo lane then in a duo lane where you have also to keep in count your actions have to accord with another person way of csing. Also roaming is more difficult: Shoving a wave and go bot as a midlaner when your opponent is not there results in the worst possible scenario in some damage to your turret if enemy mid and jungle were nearby in exchange for some pressure botlane ( they gonna back anyway when a high damage champion with 1-2 levels more then them shows up.. You can't possibly die asap on a roam unless you do something royally stupid like running straight in an under tower blitz ). Do a bad roam as support and you will loose the turret if more enemies are nearby, or lots of hp of it. Misplay in mid as a squishy support and you will likely die in an instant.\n\nAlso managing cc in a teamfight is way harder: When I 'm a midlane Lux I don't ask myself\"should I keep my Q for peeling my ADC\" I just throw it at the enemy ADC if I can and one shot them myself. If I'm a support however I can't mindlessly throw my cc at enemy carries without considering if team will be able to follow up to blow them  or if my use of that cc will end with someone insta jumping on my ADC without me doing able to do jackshit cause I am in cool down. And, if it's likely that their carry will be deleted and our jumped on is it a favorable trade? Do I have other tools to keep my dude alive?

But all the support really has to do is know how to peel. That's it. Sure, applying pressure in lane is nice but any monkey can spam spells towards the adc. You have a decent skill cap on champions without innate offensives because they can punish with AA's when smart when others cannot, but nah. Supports don't need to predict shit 95% of the time.\n\nYou ward the exact same spots every game around the same times.

Just no. Jungler should be shot calling because they are most in tuned with where and who they can make plays with because they are very aware of their power. The only reasons supports have ever shotcalled in competitive play is because they have CC and utility that's easy to use, and since most Bot's in competitive are farm fests they usually have plenty of time to look around the map in order to make calls.\n\n> \n> **It&#x27;s not just poke and ward**\n> \n> I saw that someone brought up that supporting is just making sure you get a sightstone.

You have some difficult champions that you can play as support, like Thresh for example, but that's because their kit has been nerfed to the point that they have to make proactive plays to be successful.
