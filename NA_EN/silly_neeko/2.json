Feel free to comment other things that you find helpful.\n_______\n\n1. This is just a game. I feel the need to state this first because people seem to forget that. There is no reason for you to stress so badly over a game that you start flaming and raging at other people. Whether you are being trolled or badmouthed, it doesnt matter who started it... it is not ok ({{champion:33}} ) to be flaming and raging at other people.\n\n2. Say it where they can not hear you. For those that just need to vent a bit, you can utilize yelling at them through your screen rather than typing it. Most of the time we are not in a call with the person annoying us, but on the offchance that you are.... leave call before you start badmouthing. If someone is badmouthed, there is 2 pretty much assured things that will happen. Either they will flame back, and then there is a flame war... or they will feel bad about doing bad. Both of which will cause them to about 95% of the time (assumption, no research to back this other than my own experience) play worse than if you didnt flame them. Best to not flame so you can avoid the issue all together.\n\n3. Listen to some music. As strange as it might seem, listening to music will reduce your stress levels and will possibly even make you play better because of it. Listen to some parodies from Instalok or Natsumiii or Plentakill.... listen to the songs that Riot has had released... listen to nightcore.... SOMETHING! Anything that you enjoy listening to and gets your foot tapping and head bobbing.\n\n4. You are in control of your own actions. People can not make you say things, or act in a certain way. You choose to. Trolls are in every game, and there is some people who are not actually trolling and are just bad or rusty. Flaming either of them doesnt help anything as stated before.... but to all those people who claim they \"had to tell them off\" you didnt have to. Nobody made you do it. Flaming trolls is not doing anything but making them laugh..... and flaming others who are not trolling is just you being a jerk because you feel like being a jerk.\n\n5. Utilize mute and report function for toxic people. Toxicity includes trolling, flaming, raging, intentionally feeding.... pretty much everyone knows the drill on this. You can ask if they can stop trying to be a jerk, but if they dont then there isnt much you can do. Mute them and report them after game. If it is a pretty excessive toxic case, after you report them after game... go to the game in your match history and click \"view on web\". Copy the link to the game and go to the Riot Support site... log into your account... and create a ticket with the catagory of \"report cheating, phishing, and negative behavior\". Fill in the blanks, and in the description paste the link at the top, make a space underneath it, then say who it was and what they were doing. You are not gaurenteed anything for doing this, but it helps get a human touch when it is needed.\n\n6. Stop cyber stalking people you report. The amount of times that I have heard people saying that \"this person is still doing games even for months after they were trolling me!\".... is rediculous. They were more than likely punished (severity is determined by multiple factors), and you were not informed of it because you just were not. You do not NEED to be informed. You want to yes, but you do not need to be. Reports do work, otherwise there wouldnt be all these people claiming their punishments were wrong (which after they show why they were banned is again about 95% of the time a correct punishment from my experience).\n\n7. There will ALWAYS be a winner and loser in lane and each game. Just because someone lost lane does not mean they are trolling or feeding intentionally. This is a game of win and lose, if you cant handle a loss, dont play. This is for your sake and everyone elses, because those who can not handle losing will be toxic and be stressed out. That isnt good for anyone. It sucks to lose a game, but it is still just a part of the game. There is no need to stress out over it.\n\n8. Take a break from time to time. Take a couple minutes after each game to do SOMETHING. Stand up and stretch a bit to loosen up. Doesnt have to be long, but just a random something that gets the blood flowing a bit more again. Can even make a sort of game out of it.... after every game you win, do 5 situps. Every game you lose... do 5 pushups. Just going and petting your dog or cat for a little bit will also help.\n\n9. Play some bot games if you are on a losing streak. As weird as it sounds, doing some beginner bots is actually quite relaxing and will help you in a few things. You arnt stressed over winning and losing.... its pretty much an assured win anyways... you can try things out that are way too absurdly risky for trying out in pvp...you can focus on last hitting minions.... stuff like that. Can also work on reflexes that way as well, though even beginner bots are way annoying to try and dodge.\n\n10. Add people who you enjoyed playing with. This could be for many reasons, whether they played great or they had a good can-do attitude.... no matter the reason try to find people who you enjoy playing with and you will find games going much better and be much more enjoyable even if you lost, though hopefully it turns out to be a very enjoyable win.\n\n11. Learn from your mistakes and look for counterplays. This simple and easy thing to do while grey screened will potentially save you not only in the current game.... but in future games as well. This can be as simple as \"I got greedy. I should have backed sooner instead of finished pushing the wave to tower.\" To \"They have lots of healing and armor and I am the ADC, so Mortal Reminder could be my best option. I see my Riven has Black Cleaver, so if possible then we can play around her, and since the Mordekaiser keeps using his ultimate on me I should work on a QSS at some point as well.\" Or it could be \"i knew that was a bad idea. Next time I will listen to my gut and not go in with them.\" There are many new things to learn in the game, so never stop learning and if you have any questions, ask other people or look up videos. Often times there is information all over about the topic you want to learn.\n________\n\nHope these tips help some people out.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2020-01-30T21:37:31.447+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that it is helpful to try and take responsibility for mistakes. If I'm looking for what it is that I did wrong, ... with the intent of improving, not berating myself, ... I am far less likely to blame someone else. Sometimes that does include situations where I followed someone else's shot call / decision. That sort of falls in line with your #4. They didn't make me join them in a 2v5. I should have let them die. My death was my mistake because I didn't have enough information, or I did have enough information and did it anyways. \n\nThat is another major point, assess the information available. Do you know where the enemy is? Check the mini map every 30 seconds, or every minion wave. Who is showing? Who is missing? Where were they last? How long have they been missing? If mid was in lane last wave with full health and you didn't see them fighting your mid laner, but they're not there this wave (30 seconds later) ... they COULD be roaming top or bottom. Don't wait for pings, expect that they're on their way and play as if they are until you know otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2020-01-30T21:56:59.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added in number 11 thanks to your commentary.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Waaaarrrrgggghhh","date":"2020-01-31T11:17:48.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will get disparaged for saying this but venting is an important part of keeping ones cool. We all do it in real life, it's not good for you to bottle up your anger forever. You need to be able to talk about it and have someone listen. There are ways of venting without getting punished, you just need to avoid the trigger words.\n\nIf you have a garbage bot lane that went 0-20 then say 'gg bot lane diff'. You're venting, the enemy team will empathise with you and you're not saying anything grossly offensive that will warrant a ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2020-01-31T14:22:54.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are ways to vent without it involving the chat at all. It is good to vent, but what if for example, someone is playing in bottom lane in bronze elo, and then got placed vs diamond smurf duo? Sure, there is a bottom difference, however whats the point in rubbing salt in the wound of someone who possibly was actually trying to win, but just got severely outclassed?\n\nYou are focusing on trying to avoid a ban. I am focusing with this post as how to not even worry about being banned because you are not going to be needing to say anything to vent.\n\nThere have been times that another lane is losing hard... they know they are losing hard... they even apologize for it sometimes. My comment? \"No problem. It happens.\" Sometimes due to me staying calm and cool like that, the person picks up their game and ends up doing very well in team fights etc and then we win. If I went and said \"yeah you suck\" instead then chances are they would have afk pushed a lane and been trying to surrender. That isnt helpful at all.\n\nPersonally, I do not play the game to surrender. I do not play the game to make the enemy surrender. I do not play the game to have anyone take an assured loss. Someone will lose for sure, but even seeing the enemy surrender is kinda sad because i was hoping to be able to play the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Amazitez","date":"2020-01-30T22:02:33.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bold of you to assume that it's an assured win if I play against bots.

You're far better off playing ARAMs or Normals until you get into the habit of playing against actual people. Trust me, struggling to learn from bots is a huge waste of time. It will take you a long time to get not-very-far. The amount of things that bots don't do leaves major gaps in your understanding of the game like jungling, roaming, dragon / herald / baron control, warding, wave control ... even solo laning top isn't represented accurately. And you have bots like Brand that are so impossibly good at landing their skills that it's insane. ... yeah, just a strange relic in the client that Riot really needs to overhaul, ... but I'm not sure it's even worth it anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2020-01-30T23:43:37.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is why when I started talking not about playing against players..... but more of playing vs the environment and yourself.\n\nYou are right in the fact that it teaches near nothing of the actual pvp aspect... but it certainly is not outdated and many people enjoy bot games. It was funny when they even made a minigame out of it for a mission for losing a bot game xD\n\nBut you can however still practice your warding, your wave control, last hitting.... junglers can get a feel for how fast they clear camps, at what point can they solo dragon, etc in a more game like feel than a custom and people can practice things like putting on a sweeper before ganking bottom lane... if you can successfully gank this target, etc. Then, you can try to get your team to work together to see how fast you can finish the game.\n\nThere is many things that you can learn from Bots depending on what you are trying to learn.

Once you're at peace with the idea that 40% of games are just going to be guaranteed losses, bad games become a lot less frustrating to play.
