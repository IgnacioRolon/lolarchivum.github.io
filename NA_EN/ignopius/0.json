I want to say this is absolute bullshit. I worked hard for my rank. It&#039;s always been a reward that you earned. Not being nice to your teammates. Give an honor ribbon or some shit don&#039;t take away the skin. I&#039;m starting to think Riot games is run by a bunch of SJWs. A mute button exists in the game for a reason. Oh well I own like 5 accounts anyways and they are all gold+ and I&#039;ll be receiving the victorious Orianna skin anyways. I&#039;m just pissed I wont be receiving it on my main. oh well","replies":[]}
