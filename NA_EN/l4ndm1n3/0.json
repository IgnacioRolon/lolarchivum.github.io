This is a huge problem... Curiously, after losing game after game where my team gets stomped I decided to do research into what my teammates were vs the enemies and look at these forums.  Surprise, Surprise! Last 3 games the team I got was worse than the enemy team. One of my last 3 ranked games, the enemies had over 4k total wins, while my teams was around 900, with mine being 828 of those...\n\nBeen playing LoL ranked since S2, made Gold S3 and I was high Plat by S6 - quit after having a consistently terrible solo experience and hitting that ceiling where I couldn&#039;t get to diamond because of plat players thinking they know how to play the game.  I decided to try to pick it up and see if I could enjoy ranked solo at all. I know my account decayed and the reset happened. But ... why am I in Silver 2? I think, oh well you know with enough time I can get up easily right? I carried myself out I can do it again! Haha!  I have tried and played every role. No matter where I go, it doesn&#039;t matter. This elo shouldn&#039;t even exist IMO. It&#039;s been a joke to watch look up my team; here is my last one:\n\n2 of my teammates are unranked for last 2 seasons. Can you guess the result?\nhttp://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ro2snm&amp;s=9#.WWLi84jyuUk\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=l4ndm1n3\n\nJust enjoy and relish those last 3 games. Fun!\n\nDone with ranked and this game yet again. Not sure what this game company is basing their matchmaking off of - it is beyond broken. I will never spend money on this game and no casual player should. Since I last played, it&#039;s now clearly a cash grab as well over - everything is RP now, nothing for IP - over 100k and nothing to spend it on. Good luck getting my money!","replies":[{"poster":"J4 Ulted Mexico","date":"2017-07-10T02:27:05.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I've climbed out of silver twice and just recently got to platinum so idk what to tell you.
