For a long while now though I've been wanting to play on the PBE, and yes I know that there accounts that have been disabled due to not active players on the PBE and I also know there are other players who have been playing longer than I and still have yet to touch the PBE. I know Riot probably gets asked about this a lot but honestly I think that there should be a higher number of accounts on the PBE or just make it like normal League and have as many as you want. An Yes I know this may stop people from playing the Normal League client meaning less money for Riot, there is also a high case of lag on the PBE in which if u don't want to lag play the normal client. I don't know if this is me being stubborn but I just think you should at least let a higher number of players play on the PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T20:13:17.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The PBE tries to look for candidates that can be a great fit for testing, and opening it up to more can cause some issues.  Some of those reasons can be increased login, server stability, and can make it difficult to foster an engaged testing environment.  We have a [PBE guide](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/pbe-faq) that provides some more information on this as well as the application process.  Thanks for your feedback, and good luck with your application!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-26T19:06:54.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL same Artficats same.... im downloading it now to play kled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"theArtifacts","date":"2016-07-26T17:35:57.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is kind of funny cause I have access to PBE and haven't downloaded it :P\nPerhaps I will start using it such that it doesn't go to waste :)","replies":[]}]}
