I am puzzled and frustrated.  How can these accounts be a full League apart?  The account that has more IP, more RP, more champions, more runes, is the Bronze IV account and I've had both accounts for more than one season of ranked play.\r\n\r\nDespite being able to carry a game where a Draven fed 0/35/0, I can't climb my account out of Bronze (despite hundreds of games played).  I am baffled and a bit frustrated.  I've read articles and watched videos and sought to improve my play, but my Bronze account continues to lose LP while my Silver account continues to gain LP.  Since I am the same player in both accounts, I am baffled.\r\n\r\nI've not believed other players who whine about not being able to get out of Bronze.  But since I have multiple accounts, I'm now wondering if there is truth to what they say.","replies":[]}
