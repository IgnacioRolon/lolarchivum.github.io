I cant access the email anymore, after contacting hotmail and many attempts to do so, i cannot.\r\nI have been using the account on a near daily basis and only ran into this problem on 08/17/17. i have access to another account and it doesn't seem any activity is happening since i myself last played so i don't believe it was a malicious third party, and like i stated before the information i used has been accurate every day until this incident.\r\nI have sent an email to support@riotgames.com and am awaiting a response.\r\nThe information i do have, is account name, screen name, and the old email in question, billing information and the dates they took place and contents of the loot i currently have.\r\n\r\njust wondering if i need to include any more information and the time it may take to fix, because i purchased the arcade quest bundle and some missions are available for 24 hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-18T23:11:05.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, our account team can help update your info.
