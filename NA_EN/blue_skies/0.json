In the future, please use the [report a bug feature](http://pbr.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/pbe/en_BE/bugReport/create) on PBE to report bugs on PBE, as opposed to live. It helps us better keep track of where issues are occurring. ^-^ \n\nThis is pretty common on PBE, as the assets aren't implemented just yet. This will absolutely be resolved before the skins hit live. :)","replies":[]}]}
