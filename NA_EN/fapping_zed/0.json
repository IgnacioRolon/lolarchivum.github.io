Half the things that your team does, is without you. \n\nIt really just sounds like you dont know how to apply pressure and where to apply it. You do nothing but get pointless kills, the game drags on too long, and you lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":" Elisheva","date":"2018-05-20T01:51:00.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let someone else play, so you don't look at a reflective surface.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DizzEwok","date":"2018-05-20T00:32:40.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I took a screen shot of a game of yours that matches what you described happen.

Says normal but Jhin is on both teams. And, this is just a guess, but do you rage on your teammates all game? Rarely does that help team synergy or help them play better. Type less, ping more. The game posted isn't ranked anyway.
