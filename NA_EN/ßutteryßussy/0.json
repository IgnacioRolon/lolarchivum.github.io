Gravekeeper Braum-his shield could be a Coffin lid or a tombstone his Q could be a skull his wall ability could be a ghost shield that has spectral particles and his ult could be a crack in the ground with ghoulish particles coming out of the crack in the ground and tombstones on the side.\n\n2. Taliyah De los Muertos or Day of the Dead Taliyah- Her Q could shoot bones and the unholy ground could be a sugar skull design. Her W could be a skeletal hand that nocks the enemy up. Her E could be a bunch of small sugar skulls. and her R could be a wall made of bones\n\n3. Pumpkinhead Bard- His meeps could be ghost his chimes could be wisp. His Q could be very ghostly and when it stuns the enemy to a wall it displays a scary pumpkin face. His W could be little pumpkins that grown in power. His E could be a portal that has ghost spinning in the entrance and when anyone goes in it shows you as a Bat flying through it. His R indicator on the ground could be a giant Scary Pumpkin Face.\n\n4.Snake Charmer Illaoi- Her tentacles are replaced with Cobras. Her Q could be her slapping them with a snake . Her W could be her jumping on them while it makes a Hissing noise. Her E could be a spectral Snake that pulls out the soul,the markings underneath them could be snakes that circle around them after they break the line they have a cobra icon above there head and have a green aura around them. Her ult could have the sound of like a snake charmer before slamming the ground and summoning Cobras that bite/strike enemies. \n\n5. Weather Lord Aurelion Sol- I could see them doing small tornados swirling around for his passive. His Q could be a giant Storm cloud kinda like a hurricane funnel. His W could be him expanding the Tornados they are further out and become a bit bigger visual wise. His E he could turn part dragon part nimbus cloud. His ult could be a huge Wind/thunder blast that nocks enemies back and emits the sound of thunder cracking when he uses it.\n\nThese are just ideas I had that I think would be really cool I tried to do some champs that didn&#039;t have skins mostly that I feel would be cool.
