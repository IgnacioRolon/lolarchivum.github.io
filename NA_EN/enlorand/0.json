Checking your firewalls and anti virus is a great start, though there's more steps ahead.  i recommend also going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help remove anything blocking your network from getting to us.  You'll want to test this in a custom game though, to prevent any penalties.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
