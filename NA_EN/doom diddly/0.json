We can check into this by running a traceroute log, which will provide us with an in-depth look at your network routing. I strongly recommend using the network app [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to grab this log. After loading up the app, plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace! After 5 minutes or longer has gone by, export the trace results as *text* and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nPlease let me know if you ran into any snags along the way. We'll get this figured out together, friend! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Doom Diddly","date":"2017-01-11T23:20:52.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-12T00:13:00.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually looks like your issues start within your home network, where the latency between your PC and modem is **as high as 193ms.** I'd recommend giving your modem/router a quick reboot by unplugging it for 2 minutes. If that didn't cause any changes after running a fresh traceroute, you'll want to reach out to your ISP about this. Providing this traceroute to a tier 2 agent or a supervisor will provide a lot of context and should help them launch an investigation into this.\n\nHit me up if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
