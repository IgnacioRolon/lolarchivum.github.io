I am a programmer, I have been coding for about a year and a half, and about to start my actual degree, I picked up c# while using unity3d and I mainly code in c# and use javascript for web development. Any who, I have heard many times it is best to master one language then to know a little about several different languages, so can someone get a job at riot with just focusing on c# as there main language. Not to worry about how difficult it may or may not be. But, is it possible (Please no trolls, I know we love trolling guys, but this is a serious ? and want to get one of the rioter programmers to see this and take it seriously)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T22:47:38.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think an important factor to consider is what type of programming you want to do.

After that point it's pretty easy to pick up whatever language people are using and adapt to the standards of the project.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hammuel","date":"2016-08-08T00:35:39.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I am in the Army right now, I get out in January 2018 to start my computer sciences degreee, everything I know is self taught. But, doing it thus far I have learned so much about programming and I still have so much farther to go. Anywhere I can get my foot in the door honestly, in-game design would be ideal, but any possible position I can get hired on to get my foot in the door and make my resume stand out rather then then the thousand of other applicants. I know I have to claw my way in so to speak and will probably end up interning for some company doing my little pony or some bs while getting my degree.
