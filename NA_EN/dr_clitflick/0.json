Turrets just don&#039;t do enough damage. A mid mage shouldn&#039;t be able to tank 5 shots and live to see the day. A turret should be something that is feared. That you are going to be risking you life if your in there too long.  It seems to me that any champ with 1/2 health can lollygag in there tank turret shots and not even worry.\r\n\r\nI think they should be feared as a scary obstacle and I agree they should do more damage. If your not in and out to get a kill say goodbye jabroni hope it was worth. \r\n\r\n(Atleast the increase amplification damage on consecutive hits so its harder for tanks to *tank* turrets)\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Zach Sandwhich","date":"2016-11-16T19:49:49.495+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes turrets are brain dead asf to dive right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr ClitFlick","date":"2016-11-16T19:51:58.698+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha I couldn't agree more.
