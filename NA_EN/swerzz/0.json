Price reductions/increases, Stat modifications, New items, rework items. I know CDR is a commonly brought up issue, and also mana regen options. This is why Frost Queens is so popular right know, it offers both at a reduced price.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-22T22:54:45.353+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll likely include some item changes with the mage update.

Why you dont attempt to make items like the ones you did in the Black Market Brawlers mode? Especially when we are talking about AP mids who have only one item with an impactful active, Zhonas. And Archangels but lets be honest, nobody builds Archangels for its active.\n\n You said that you view a day when items wont be stat sticks, yet you dont do much to make it possible. I was hoping that the items in the BMB mode was a testing ground for the classic mode but sadly it doesnt seem that way.","replies":[{"poster":"Swerzz","date":"2016-01-22T23:35:41.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love a AP version of a QSS for the active.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-01-23T10:32:56.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there going to be a work on Keystones too?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swerzz","date":"2016-01-22T23:35:13.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to hear.
