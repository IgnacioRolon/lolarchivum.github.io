The asterisk thing is bad\r\n• Add hotkeys for formatting (CTRL+B = bold, etc)\r\n• Red posts need better visibility - add a red, thin \"banner\" on top of their posts\r\nSomething like\r\nhttp://puu.sh/bKKK5/1b9354693f.jpg\r\n• Make deleted posts disappear, not show as -Deleted-, because some people like to bump their threads and delete the bumps after getting replies so they don't clog up the discussion\r\n• Make embedded images be as wide as the post or a larger percentage of it, currently it's too narrow\r\n• Make the sidebar a dropdown menu and expand the work area\r\n• Make it possible to search/filter a *thread*, and the search to include the names, so if i wanna search my own posts in a long thread, i can do it\r\n• Make the OP highlighted not by that thing around the names, but by a banner similar to the one mentioned above, albeit a different color, like blue, gold or green.\r\n\r\nThe rest of my complaints are the same as the majority of threads already about the subject like OP voting etc","replies":[]}
