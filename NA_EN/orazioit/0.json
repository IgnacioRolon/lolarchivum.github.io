I played games and followed all of the instructions but I haven't recieved neither the skin nor the icon differently from my smurf account where I did. I was wondering if someone can replay to my problem and solve it for me. Thank You!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-01T22:56:32.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eligible players should have received their anniversary gifts by now.
