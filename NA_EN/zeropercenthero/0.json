The amount of focus you can get from not paying mind to toxic chat, is actually insane.\n\nI do use the chat again nowadays, since reforming lol. Hard for me to have fun without talking AT ALL. But I'm extremely keen to mute people almost automatically when they show their colors.\n\nThe toxic players are just trying to drag you through a field of !@#$, and I rather like my clothes the way they are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-11-10T08:16:50.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[The Riot folks who put this up had a good idea going into it, I think.](https://tilttypes.riotgames.com/en-us/p/1) They encourage the use of /mute for certain situations.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Sa1nt","date":"2019-11-10T18:10:32.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightsky Pirate,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=UZ986m4o,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-11-10T08:16:50.701+0000)\n>\n> [The Riot folks who put this up had a good idea going into it, I think.](https://tilttypes.riotgames.com/en-us/p/1) They encourage the use of /mute for certain situations.\n\nLmfao why have I not seen that video yet, that was a funny watch.\n\nApparently I'm the barbarian, I'd like to think Riot Support would agree with that accuracy.
