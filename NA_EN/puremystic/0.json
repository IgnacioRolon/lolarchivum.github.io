It's one part of a very experimental test build I've been using. I can say it has worked fairly well early but when team fights start I get singled out massively and the League of CC means I can't use Rift Walk once I'm engaged. Worse, the League of Dashes Better Than Kassadin also kicks in. Getting a bit off topic there... the test build, mock if you want.\n\nSorc shoes or Boots of Swiftness, Rod of Ages, Abyssal Sceptre, Hextech Gunblade, G's Rageblade, and either Lich Bane or if you can get it, TriForce. It's basically a fighter build with mixed damage mixed with lifesteal and spell vamp. I tend to rush depending on lane opponent. If it's AP then Abyssal, if AD (Zed and co) then Zhonya's is thrown into the mix. Optional for last item is Rab's Deathcap for extra pain bringing but the build's aim was to keep it mixed damage roughly 50/50.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nublord","date":"2015-02-28T09:38:04.143+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ah4Asphz,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-02-28T08:22:08.305+0000)\n>\n> I don't think death's what Varus has to expect if the Blight finishes its work and overwhelms him, at least not initially.

Something along the lines of Blood Lord {{champion:8}} . Except being lost in the power other than gaining full control over it.\n\n\nAnd to OP: Miroku (monk from Inuyasha) had a fairly comparable 'disease' to Varus, and he stuck around for a good while. Only losing ground when he used the power a lot, and seeing as how the Institute of War isn't there anymore, and Varus/Ionian lore has been kind of stalled for the time being (other than I think Bard has some Ionian ties..but not much I can see Varus caring about.) I don't see him needing to use his powers much lately, so shouldn't be *too* hard for him to keep the evil at bay for now.\nMaybe even Zilean's helping by spamming that new 99% slow on him. ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"E Q W Qiyana","date":"2015-03-01T21:46:01.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ah4Asphz,comment-id=000600020000,timestamp=2015-03-01T07:55:03.223+0000)\n>\n> I'd absolutely love to see us do fully corrupted Varus as a skin, really play up how he's been changed by the Blight.

Changing it into a dark, horrible version of its self. This is why in Varus' league judgement it talked to him, begging him to let it be free and turn the world to hell, showing him visions of people's skin melting off, and oceans of blood littered with bodies (for what does a void creature want but carnage?). When Varus let it go free it changed all the stone in the temple into a black jagged glass before merging with Varus, the ooze absorbing his bow, his arms and legs, stopping only due to the magic of the Wise Owl tattoos (maybe the ooze once knew the Wise Owl? Maybe the owl was what originally imprisoned it there to begin with?). It merged Varus' bow to his arm, becoming a structure that he could absorb into his corruption gauntlets, it absorbed his plate mail on his legs, learning how to become armour in the process. It also likely absorbed some arrows too, learning how to detach parts of its self to fire at Varus' opponents like arrows that rendded their targets to shreds from within. This twisted form of a man and darkness became as such due to Varus' fury at the loss of his family, his pain and his desire for vengeance. Now the being formerly named Varus exists solely to hunt and slay as many Noxians as his arrows of corruption can reach","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-02-27T20:10:31.952+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why does {{champion:63}}  not take extra damage from water themes spells?\n\nWhy do {{item:1001}} help {{champion:34}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:56}} , and even champs that fly like{{champion:40}} move faster?\n\nThere are plenty of funny inconsistencies to marvel at in league :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-02-27T19:29:02.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be a simple contract made between him in the pact.
