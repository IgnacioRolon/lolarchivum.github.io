They were exuberantly determined to undermine everyone on our team. They were smack talking, being rude, swearing, and calling us names. Now, I&#039;m not the kind of guy that gives a single shit if someone called me a name, or anything. I just move on, or leave a witty comment. WELL, according to riot I am the 0.006 percent of the community that deserves a very nice PERMANENT BAN for saying one single swear word. According to riot, me saying &quot;Fuck off&quot; is the most toxic thing written in all of the summoner&#039;s rift. Not, &quot;You fuckin retard, look at your kills gp. LOL, fuckin idiot can&#039;t even spell! Drink bleach %%%got&quot; - Enemy team?????? I&#039;m absolutely appalled at the idea that I was targeted by multiple people to get banned. I am the toxic one I guess. To top the entire scenario off, I haven&#039;t received any email confirmation from riot, or an answer to my support Ticket. By the way, most of my text contained &quot;Lol, you&#039;re full of gamer culture bud&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-04-15T18:50:59.941+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should show us your chatlog!","replies":[{"poster":"hobocall","date":"2017-04-15T22:01:52.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Posted","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-15T18:46:30.996+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Permabans are the last step of escalation for consistent or extreme negative behavior, so it takes quite a lot to move yourself up the escalation path and reach one.

What may have seemed harmless to you and your friend, doesn't always look that way to the other people on your team, or the people on the other team.  It can look like extremely rude, offensive or mean behavior.  \n\nUnfortunately, since you were given a 14 day suspension, it does not take much to be permabanned from that point.  A valid report for a minor infraction of the Code of Conduct can be enough to trigger the ban once you have reached the fourth punishment tier.  And from looking at your logs, there are a couple things that would have been enough to do so.  \n\n> hobocall: like fuck off\n\nTelling your teammates/opponents to fuck off is pretty rude, but most people overlook it if it's said to an enemy who is camping their lane.  They don't tend to overlook it when it's said to a teammate though.  And it sounds like it was said to a teammate who forgot smite and was trying to duo lane with you for a little while.  Which looks like it led to the next few lines of your logs.\n\n> hobocall: everygame its always 3 trash people ganking me\n> hobocall: stop talking idiot\n> hobocall: jesus you guys are so brain dead\n> hobocall: i forgot everyone online has the iq of a toddler\n\nThese things are generally not overlooked.  Nobody likes to be called trash, in fact almost everyone finds it either a) insulting, b) an incentive to 3 man gank you repeatedly to keep pissing you off, or c) both a) and b) are correct.  And calling people idiots, brain dead, or saying they have the IQ of a toddler is definitely insulting.  It's all considered verbal abuse, and any of it is enough to garner the valid report that would trigger your permaban.  \n\nThat's the bad news.  The good news is that you are able to make another account if you wish to do so.  And now you will know what not to say in the future.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hobocall","date":"2017-04-15T21:58:19.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Game 1\nhobocall: oh\nhobocall: wonderful\nhobocall: just after 2 tilting games\nhobocall: why take farm\nhobocall: like fuck off\nhobocall: and you forgot smite\nhobocall: lol\nhobocall: your fault\nhobocall: dont put it on me\nhobocall: np\nhobocall: everygame its always 3 trash people ganking me\nhobocall: try me zed\nhobocall: was so worth\nhobocall: 1 for 1\nhobocall: yeah gamer culture\nhobocall: stop talking idiot\nhobocall: you're still talking?\nhobocall: yeah gamer culture\nhobocall: you dont even know what im talking about\nhobocall: jesus you guys are so brain dead\nhobocall: i forgot everyone online has the iq of a toddler\nhobocall: no, but youre full of epic gamer culture\nhobocall: i thought grammar nerds died in the early 2000's\nhobocall: why are you still talking about grammer.\nhobocall: \"sad excuse for a human being\" when all you talk about is \"haha im le epic troll on league of legends xD\"\nhobocall: jesuss","replies":[{"poster":"PlsCheckThisBush","date":"2017-04-15T22:09:01.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hobocall,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EURJkM1E,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-04-15T21:58:19.150+0000)\n>\n> Game 1\n\n> hobocall: just after 2 tilting games\n> hobocall: why take farm\n> hobocall: like fuck off\n> hobocall: and you forgot smite\n\n> hobocall: your fault\n> hobocall: dont put it on me\n\n> hobocall: everygame its always 3 trash people ganking me\n> hobocall: try me zed\n\n> hobocall: stop talking idiot\n> hobocall: you&#x27;re still talking?\n\n> hobocall: jesus you guys are so brain dead\n> hobocall: i forgot everyone online has the iq of a toddler\n\n> hobocall: i thought grammar nerds died in the early 2000&#x27;s\n> hobocall: why are you still talking about grammer.\n> hobocall: &quot;sad excuse for a human being&quot; when all you talk about is &quot;haha im le epic troll on league of legends xD&quot;\n> hobocall: jesuss\n\nhttp://www.dailyhaha.com/_pics/will_argue_with_anyone_about_anything.jpg\n\nThese are likely the reasons for your ban.  \"Full of gamer culture\" isn't offensive by any means, however you're consistently flaming and badgering your teammates for mistakes as well as egging the enemy team on.  You also seem to have an issue with /all chat, so I'd recommend either turning it off or learning better coping methods of dealing with people that antagonize you.  Calling everyone brain dead and having the Intelligence Quotient of a toddler isn't friendly material, and demoralizes the morale of a team.  It honestly looks like you're just wanting someone to argue with and/or blame someone else for your own mistakes when things go south, as you're very quick to point the finger at others.  It's a TEAM game, after all, and being part of a TEAM is important.  A little bit of introspection is fine by checking your replays and learning what YOU could have done better, but flaming your teammates is only opening up a can of worms that won't end well.\n\nAlso, side note:  If you flame and call out an entire group of people (yourself included) by \"everyone online\" expect to be reported as you're no longer directing your anger in any productive method, you're harassing a population.","replies":[{"poster":"hobocall","date":"2017-04-15T22:24:15.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm. I think you're missing something. I wasn't blaming my team, the only thing where I said anything to my team was when our gragas was taking my farm because HE HIMSELF forgot smite. That is not my fault and no amount of replays is fixing that. I understand it's a team game, the enemy team was talking about \"how they're all better individually\" That's why I was saying it takes more than 1 person to kill me. So i guess saying that the enemy team is stupid, because they are, is just the meanest thing in all of league of legends? It's truly depressing that some people get offended over a video game they point fingers and need report buttons. Like I said before, I don't talk much in game, but when I do i have a very, very good reason for it.","replies":[{"poster":"PlsCheckThisBush","date":"2017-04-15T22:46:02.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hobocall,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EURJkM1E,comment-id=000800010000,timestamp=2017-04-15T22:24:15.581+0000)\n>\n> So i guess saying that the enemy team is stupid, because they are, is just the meanest thing in all of league of legends?\n\nAgain, turn of /all chat if you have an issue with it, and don't flame your teammates.  The Mute button works wonders, and I would highly recommend you use that on your next account.  You've been banned before, so you're a frequent offender in the system.  You're also still flaming those people publicly here on the forums while trying to garner sympathy, I'm honestly not sure what you expect.  Perhaps one of them actually has a learning disability, how do you think that makes them feel?  There's no need to be toxic and flame teammates, and antagonizing the enemy team is only asking for a bad time as they immediately know you're prone to tilting and will, more or less, ensure it happens.\n\nA little friendly banter is fine, and will show you a person's true character and how they handle situations.  If you fail a tower dive and /all chat \"BEST DIVE NA\" then everyone will likely laugh it off and move on, however if you fail the tower dive and start flaming it's a quick decision for the enemy of \"Let's camp this guy, he's tilted and over-aggressive and will give us free kills.\"","replies":[{"poster":"hobocall","date":"2017-04-15T23:03:12.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you mean by flaming people on the forum.

By the way, I didn't have a frequent history of being banned like the summoner code wants you to think. I was banned 1 time before for flaming my FRIEND, AS A JOKE. This is my exact reason for being here, I was falsely banned before for messing around with my friend, and now I'm being banned permanently for an extremely stupid situation.

Please quote me on where I&#x27;m flaming and send it\n\nRead my previous post, I did quote it specifically for you.  You're not flaming us on the forums, you're specifically calling the enemy team \"stupid\" here on the forums even after you've been banned for toxicity for flaming.  It matters not how others act - you cannot change them - the only person you can change is yourself.  Make a world that you want to live in, not the one you hope for it to be.\n\nAnd not to sound condescending, but $50 USD isn't an incredibly large amount for a game.  Hell most AAA games go for $60+ not including DLC's and addons and will absolutely ban you outright forcing you to purchase them again if you wish to continue - this becomes a heavy money-sink if you're frequently banned from such activities.\n\nPerhaps now you don't see the ban being warranted or your own toxicity, but hopefully in the future you will - and will reform to become an honorable summoner that the community will appreciate playing with.  Yes, a permanent ban is a serious penalty and is usually reserved for the extreme players (such as Tyler1) who show a repeat pattern of offense.  You're always welcome to message Riot Support about the reasons for your punishment, but at the end of the day it's usually (barring false-positives, having your account compromised, etc.) your own actions that brought you there - much like the judicial system in our regular world.\n\nAnd again, for future accounts, utilize the Mute feature and/or turn off /all chat if you're unable to hold yourself back from being toxic to those that flame you.  Report them after the game and move on with your life, there's nothing more you can do.","replies":[{"poster":"hobocall","date":"2017-04-15T23:53:20.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"PlsCheckThisBush","date":"2017-04-15T23:56:19.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah and here we have the true nature of why you were banned coming out.

A place they can let loose and even cry if need be. Some find it in friends, some find it in games. \n\n> \n\n Honestly, I don't care if you offend me and make fun of me. I actually will joke about my culture or myself. I reserve that to comms or in private to potentially avoid upsetting people. I also clearly state why I feel it is okay. \nI.E. \"I am a jew, I know money.\" it is clearly a joke at my own expense but a simple change, \"Jews are good with money.\" And now it is stereotypical and possibly insulting.\n\n> \n\nThere is actually a small difference between friendly banter/smack talk, and straight up toxicity. In a recent game, Sona missed warding the bush. I saw it and called her out in /All. \"Sona... did you just miss the ward? I feel for that, Supp probs.\"\nClearly friendly banter, which admittedly could cause an enemy to tilt or perhaps even help calm them. Had I instead said something like \"Ha, way to fail at warding you crap support. git gud.\" This is excessive and walking the line between smack talk and toxicity. So if it was reported I would likely get in trouble for it.\n\nYou are right, in the real world we may get called worse things. I can promise you it won't be by someone working in a public job.\n A cashier does it? Probably fired. \nSome random person on the street? Who are you and why do I care?\nA public official?

You knew the guidelines for the game, you didn't adhere to them, you got banned as deserved. You are the most immature person in this post.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2017-04-15T23:49:40.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> hobocall (NA)  - 2 minutes ago\n>Please elaborate on what could possibly hurt someone so bad to the point that they will actually feel like their life is impacted by some random guy on a video game.

Hey everyone, I'm tired and I'm sick of seeing this be passed off as weak people on a game, let responsibility lay where it is !  \n\nDude your a bully and as soon as regular players speak up and speak often and load we will get the point to you.... You should not, and because you are perma-banned You know you Can Not talk like this....\nThis is not the 1st time this has happened to you, Dude just relax and have fun, it would benefit everyone !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siegfriedx2","date":"2017-04-15T18:46:48.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i don't believe in you, so you could just say: \"I authorize Riot to post here all my chat logs and punishments\" so we could avoid all the lies and proceed  to the part where we all trash you for being a beyond hope toxic person and you stop replying to this post out of shame.        \n\nIsn't exactly how it happens all the time?","replies":[{"poster":"hobocall","date":"2017-04-15T22:00:25.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted it bud, im totally cool with riot posting my chat logs.

They were exuberantly determined to undermine everyone on our team. They were smack talking, being rude, swearing, and calling us names. Now, I&amp;#039;m not the kind of guy that gives a single shit if someone called me a name, or anything. I just move on, or leave a witty comment. WELL, according to riot I am the 0.006 percent of the community that deserves a very nice PERMANENT BAN for saying one single swear word. According to riot, me saying &amp;quot;Fuck off&amp;quot; is the most toxic thing written in all of the summoner&amp;#039;s rift. Not, &amp;quot;You fuckin retard, look at your kills gp. LOL, fuckin idiot can&amp;#039;t even spell! Drink bleach %%%got&amp;quot; - Enemy team?????? I&amp;#039;m absolutely appalled at the idea that I was targeted by multiple people to get banned. I am the toxic one I guess. To top the entire scenario off, I haven&amp;#039;t received any email confirmation from riot, or an answer to my support Ticket. By the way, most of my text contained &amp;quot;Lol, you&amp;#039;re full of gamer culture bud&amp;quot;\n\n\nYou are an ignorant person, your fancy vocal isn't fooling us, you're a rager who flames people over the smallest mistakes, but can't climb, so you blame your mates, trolls, or wall building enthusiasts for bringing you down, to be honest if Gary Johnson got elected you'd be a challenger, but sadly your teams though, Amirite.","replies":[{"poster":"hobocall","date":"2017-04-15T23:35:42.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont think you understand the situation I was in.
