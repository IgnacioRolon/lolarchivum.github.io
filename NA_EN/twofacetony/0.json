You had to win with a champion you own to get key frags. I'm wondering since the key frags are tied to honor, and not necessarily wins.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-08T02:53:29.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you're getting those [**key fragments**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/honor) confused with the hextech chests. Key fragments are given simply by staying honorable (at least Honor 1) and not getting any penalties. With those both of those, you should be getting key fragments randomly after playing matches.","replies":[{"poster":"TwoFaceTony","date":"2017-08-23T02:22:37.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Key fragments are given simply by staying honorable\"\nThat's sort of that I mean. Before, if you played a champ you don't own, you didn't get key frags or chests. I know that you still can't get chests on champs you don't own, but I was asking about key frags. I'm guessing by logic and your answer, you can now.","replies":[]}]}]}
