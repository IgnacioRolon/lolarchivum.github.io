Has been permanently banned. I wish to have it unbanned. If I post this in the wrong area I apologize. I do not care for this to be public, I'd rather speak to moderators about it. If it has to be public, so be it. Idk the rules on forums, haven't read them. Will eventually. \r\n\r\nI am schitzo-effective, and currently take psyche meds. Which I'm willing to give pictures of this to a moderator only. It Isn't for public disclosure do to the fact that it has my personal information on it. I only say I'm willing to do this, because people lie... \r\n\r\nI'm far more stable than I once was do to my psyche meds, counseling and having a mental health manager as well as other support. I am legally disabled because of my mental illness which runs in my family. Other than that I'm not really sure what else to say. \r\n\r\nI do honestly still rage sometimes. But it Isn't nearly as frequent as it once was. I'm also 30, so I handle things different just because I'm older. I've been playing League of Legends a long time. Since season three if I recollect correctly. I understand the game better, and realize that my inability to climb. Was mostly because of me, not other people. \r\n\r\nI have literal stress balls that I use. I am more likely to curse out loud, versus typing it. I think getting frustrated just makes a human. How we handle it, determines rather or not we're an adult or not. A really important thing to note is. I am not self-medicating via alcohol anymore. I rarely drink, if at all these days. Obviously alcohol is an intoxicant, so if I have a rage issue. Ya... I'm sure you get me. I am still going to a substance abuse councilor. But it has been almost 20 days since I drank any booze. Considering how often and how much I used to drink. I'm doing good! \r\n\r\nI want this account back because it is so old. Call it what you like, but flashing my bronze season 3 logo makes me feel special. \r\n\r\nEh anyways, thanks for considering either way. I suppose to make it official. I apologize for past behavior. I know I won't be perfect in the future. But ever step towards progress, is a step not taken in vayne(lolz?). {{summoner:4}}  Have a good day!","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-25T07:54:25.167+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I certainly feel for you and hope you are able to continue taking control of your mental health issues, ultimately they are not Riot's responsibility.

You have exhausted your extra chances.\n\nFurthermore, the boards are not a place to communicate with Riot. You can file a support ticket if you wish to ask Riot to consider your statements. However, they will not consider anything you've said here as an excuse to give you an extra chance not afforded to other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Acropolis93","date":"2019-07-25T09:31:05.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"Tyler 1 got unbanned.

Board staff are volunteers and don't work for Riot. You'll need to fill out a support ticket.\n\nWhich brings me to the second point - you aren't getting unbanned. A person's personal issues are not an excuse to break the rules, and nobody is required to tolerate you or your bad attitude just because you have a medical condition. That's not League, that's life.\n\nPart of what we have to do as repsonsible human beings is avoid situations that harm us, especially if we have medical conditions. A person with very high cholesterol has to watch what they eat. A person with disorders such as yours needs to not put themselves in situations that exacerbate their condition. You owe this to yourself.

Yes? Now consider this: you don't know their situation, and neither does Riot. This is why using the n-word is considered unacceptable regardless of a player's skin color, why flaming is unacceptable even if the player is bipolar or a disabled veteran, and so on. LoL has no such thing as, for example, a Class III(a) Anti-Semitism License only available to Jews, or a N---a Certificate With N---er Stamp available only to African-Americans. Everyone has to follow the rules regardless of who they are.\n\nNone of Tyler1's accounts were unbanned. He was in the unusual situation of what's called an \"ID ban\" (not IP ban). This means that Riot employees would watch his stream and manually ban any account he was seen to use. It's a very rare punishment that's usually used only on high-visibility players (like streamers) with ongoing toxic behavior which viewers are encouraged (either explicitly or implicitly) to mimic. ID bans may be reversed if the player meets a variety of special conditions, which Tyler1 eventually managed, and his ID ban was reversed. He is now able to play LoL on stream once again. However, once again, none of his individual accounts were unbanned. He has never had a permaban revoked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acropolis93","date":"2019-07-25T09:40:43.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It seems as though you're right. :-(  \"We only reverse bans that are CLEARLY errors made by the system.
