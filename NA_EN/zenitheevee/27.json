Chat started with the normal bronze excuse to do something stupid now that Autofill is a thing:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/72dUe65.png\n\nSo, That out of the way, The start was pretty smooth, Team got FB, I, being Yorick and a confident pusher, Easily picks up first tower kill. EZ lane EZ game, Or so i thought.\n\nThen get to around.. Oh... 20 minutes in. I&#039;d think that having enemy inhib tower down, I could force them to surrender.. However, You know, Normal dont surrender bla bla have fun, I dont blame them. So, Our support is.. Feeding out the ass, I got a fairly even KDA, 1:1, more or less. Enemy team is actually grouping against me, And what is my team doing?\n\nJungling...\n\nNot major objectives, Not baron or dragon, Not even taking towers...\n\nThey&#039;re... Jungling...\n\nSo, i take it for granted that maybe they&#039;re just not getting the idea the first time.. I get to enemy inhib, Take it... Enemy team swarms..\n\nMy team is fucking runnign around in river, Dragons not up and they&#039;re not even near baron..\n\n#What the actual fuck is my bronze team doing\n\nSo, Again, I give them the benefit of the doubt and that they&#039;re waiting for that 1:26 timer to go down..\n\n#THEY FUCKING SPLIT AND DIE LIKE FUCKING ANTS\n\nSo, now i&#039;m sitting here, Half between my teams midlane inhib and nexus, And low-and-behold, Back midlane tower is fucked. We group to prevent inhib push, Success..\n\nand my team splits YET A-FUCKING-GAIN.\n\nFast forward a good 10 minutes. We&#039;re pushing mid, As a team this time..\n\nLux and LB split and go bot, thinking its a good idea..\n\nOfcoarse, when you got two women with a group of thirsty fucking guys and a butch lesbian, you know they&#039;re gonna get fucking raped out there. They&#039;re dead, And soon, so is everyone else. Enemy team pushes baron, goes all the way down, Takes inhib, Both bot and toplane back towers, Inhib towers, And then just decides &quot;Fuck it we&#039;ll win the god damn game&quot;.\n\nLux is flaming me the whole time because Fiora got fed off of mid and bot lane... \n\nAnd its MY fault that our team didnt win..\n\nI mean, sure, I didnt splitpush hard enough, or when i should of, Actually fucking wait i&#039;m bronze, i was split pushing and i WAS making the best of my fucking chances, But even then...\n\nEVEN-FUCKING-THEN, My team could not make use of the opportunities i gave them to push aswell..\n\nI&#039;m sorry to sound like a whiny little bitch to you guys, But the truth is..\n\nI&#039;m tired of bronze, and these teams are holding me back. \n\nEven though, this is in fucking normals, The lux is flaming me, Saying its my fault, Mentions that at the time i was 4/8 (She wasnt doing much fucking better at the time) And that i should kill myself.\n\nGotta love.. that bronze, fucking, spirit.\n\nedit: Also gotta love that anti-bronze-ism. So its fine when a plat/diamond says \"My teams are trash\" But if i say it i'm being an asshole. OK. ","replies":[]}
