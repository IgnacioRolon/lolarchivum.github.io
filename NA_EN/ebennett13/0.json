Why are they being so selfish and not making it so that the public can enjoy it. When I say this I am referring to rp and how you must buy it in order to get any character worth anything. I highly advise that they give better ways to obtain these point for free or else they are going to loose many people's interests in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wyrmfyre","date":"2017-10-25T22:02:41.648+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No RP is required to unlock any character in the game.
