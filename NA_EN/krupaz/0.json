But there&#039;s some stuff that just makes the game unplayable. Brand &quot;support&quot; is one such example. Caitlyn has a basic attack range of 650, the longest in the game.  Brand&#039;s w has a range of _900_, meaning that even if you pick the adc with the longest range you&#039;re never allowed to farm safely. This doesn&#039;t even mention the other support in lane who will be taking the damage as well, and the fact that I&#039;m really only talking early game. If the Brand can get his adc ahead then he just builds damage and becomes apc Brand like normal. But if he doesn&#039;t and you have a Brand &quot;support&quot; they never build support items and try to build damage, become useless and ruin the game. I really do get the appeal in the &quot;fun&quot; of playing off meta stuff but when it ultimately amounts to soft inting and ruining the game for others, shouldn&#039;t there be some kind of deterrent for these kinds of picks? I mean I don&#039;t honestly know what you can do but I know when I&#039;m top or even jungle for the game and my support locks in some selfish, power hungry champ or some &quot;fun&quot; off meta thing it feels like the game is already lost and playing through a game where it feels as thought the outcome has already been decided is awful.","replies":[{"poster":"k wìx","date":"2018-03-20T03:28:39.922+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you think Brand is oppressive, hoo boy I can't wait until you see my Support Xerath. You will not touch CS. without me taking some of your health. This is called good laning, my objective is to stop you from farming. It should not be easy to farm.\n\nIf I let you CS properly, and build up a huge lead against us, then I've failed my team. This is just part of the game. You just don't understand how to farm under pressure. \n\nFurthermore, A brand support has lots of viable counters. A Janna or Nami can really put the breaks on any damage brand deals simply by healing / shielding / outsustaining your team. Keep an eye on Brands mana bar. He goes oom surprisingly quick. \n\nBuilding damage as a support is perfectly viable in bottom lane. Let me repeat that one. You can build damage as a support, and the only thing you'll be ruining is the enemy teams morale. \n\nAlso: Brand support is NOT off meta, its played competitively, all the way up to low diamond. You just don't like how the meta formed. \n\nYou don't get the power to pick your allies champions just as they can't pick yours. Playing an oddball pick is not trolling and will NEVER be reportable. If you dont like the comp, then just dodge, otherwise? Suck it up and deal with it - Maybe they'll carry the game. \n\n**Judge someone by HOW THEY PLAY. and not WHAT THEY PICK. This couldn't be easier. \n**","replies":[{"poster":"Kythers","date":"2018-03-20T05:54:21.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:202}} {{champion:101}}  \n\noh boyee that was a fun lane to play against when the new runes hit live","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-03-20T11:00:01.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A \"support\", in the end of the day, is just someone who functions outside of the 4 major gold income chain, typically living off passive gold or otherwise indirect income sources.\n\nAnyone who can achieve that can function as a support.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's because you have tons of CC, or because you have high base damage so you don't really need items to do damage, or whatever, it doesn't matter.
