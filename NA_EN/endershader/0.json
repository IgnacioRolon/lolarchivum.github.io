I am an accounting major at Cal State University - Fullerton. I understand that companies have costs and when making large changes, such as moving servers and needing to hire/move team members, cost grow fast. One thing I have not done in a long time is not spend money on my account. The game is free, but a game needs people to make money in game. In September, I began working on an internship application for the QA Team. I played on my laptop, my surface, and 2 different computers and Howie&#039;s Game Shack in Mission Viejo. I have moved in 1 month and a half before the application from Gold 4 to Plat 4. I got home one day and found my account being banned do to MMR boosting. I was told after an &quot;extensive audit&quot; you have been found MMR boost. I have been in contact with a Behavior Support Specialist and have been continually told there is enough proof. I understand that the system need be kept a trade secret so people do not get away with MMR boosting. No one has ever played my account but me, I have not changed key bindings, I continually play top lane or adc (and all ways call that in champ select). I have not been given proof, told why, given a chance to appeal because when they ask to show proof, I do not know what to disprove. I don&#039;t even know if the extensive audit is over a long time or a short period going deep into 1 week. After talking with people I value and explaining my situation and how this is a GIANT catch 22 I have to ask.  My questions:_** Has my account been banned due to a long standing account that has not spent money (make a profit)? Is spending money a part of the audit? (you probably won&#039;t answer but I need to ask). And can an account be banned (or removed) because the account does not bring a profit?**_","replies":[]}
