Runeglavie built from a SHEEN, there are tons of AP junglers that DON'T want a SHEEN. So that's what got it removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Artful Lounger","date":"2017-11-11T10:48:41.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is wrong. Ezreal smite-runeglaive mid allowing him to overcome his greatest weakness as a midlaner (waveclear) very early and cheaply was the problem. The fact it built from sheen was irrelevant - more AP junglers are happy to get a sheen item (Nida, Fizz, Diana) than not (essentially just Fiddle, in the other side).\n\nHowever Runic Echoes is still good on all of the former group and also for the latter, and isn't useful on midlane Ezreal so doesn't skew the meta. So it works on several levels.","replies":[{"poster":"SailorPsycho","date":"2017-11-11T17:01:17.458+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, he was right.\n\nThe item was removed because not all AP junglers could actually use it effectively, since not all of them have synergy with Spellblade, or with auto-attacking.

Learn to play against it or use it yourself or just ban ezreal .\nFor the record a lot of champions not just ezreal are using this keystone so your basis of stating that its just ezreal abusing this is completely incorrect. You can literally abuse the ezreal as well he sacrifices some dmg to go this path. Ezreal hasnt been that great in the lane phase for some time now and now he has something he can use to bring him back  i see nothing wrong with it. Need to learn to adapt the meta changes all the time .","replies":[{"poster":"MyTeamIsAwsome","date":"2017-11-10T17:33:43.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Only time will tell if you and me are wrong.
