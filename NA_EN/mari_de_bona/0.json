He had pretty much everything except, like I said earlier, sustain. Not to mention his Lantern which is incredibly strong as it offers a unique way of engage and disengaging a fight that pretty much no one else can do.\n\nHe did too much at once while generally not being that weak at anything. He was a generalist that was great at everything instead of okay at everything. \n\nThresh generally isn't a problem anymore but that's because of him having to get changed constantly and other supports actually getting more gold income as well as getting new items as well as the introduction of new supports. \n\nHe wasn't that much of an issue for long (like obviously not as long as {{champion:40}}'s been an issue) but he had a very overloaded kit that constantly needed changes over the course of a year or two (at least if I remember how long he needed nerfing correctly).\n\nEDIT: Changed some wording so I wasn't exaggerating how long he was strong.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-07-16T17:41:44.118+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":6,"body":"Well this doesn't sound like CT's fault necessarily then.\n\nFirst of all I'm really biased against the balance team because I'm convinced they do not talk to Design team members and balance everything the wrong way (for example not touching Yasuo's damage but nerfing his Utilities, literally his defining features at the time). A champion taking a long time to balance is a failure of the balance team.\n\nAnd if we're comparing really old designs to Thresh on the basis that he brings a lot of new to the table, what do we say to modern post-Thresh Supports like Braum, Rakan, and hell Pyke. Would we hate them just as much for the same reasons? Or what if Thresh never broke the mold and we never get interesting designs like the ones I mentioned and we just get more Jannas.\n\nAlso for the generalist comment, remember over this same period of time Lee Sin, Elise, and Evelynn/Vi were dominating the jungle despite being generalists. Again, I see this as a mark against the balance team than CT and Thresh, as well as Lee Sin and Elise and Vi's designers in particular ('old' Eve is more debatable in my eyes)\n\nDesign and balance are two totally different issues by the way. I can see where you're coming from with the Balance arguments, but I really don't respect the Balance team's decisions and have played through a lot of their philosophies. However, I don't think the design argument that he stands out compared to other Supports in his release is a very valid one. Hell I know I've seen posts and videos praising Thresh for breaking ground and enabling more interesting playmaking Support designs. At best I can accept the generalist problem as a problem, but that can be handled with good balance decisions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"skulldeadboss","date":"2018-07-16T20:10:41.602+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TehNACHO,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dZ7AwKlM,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-07-16T16:52:02.680+0000)\n>\n> What&#x27;s wrong with Thresh?\n\nIt was the most gamedefining champ and had to be nerfed patch after patch for 2 years after his release","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-16T16:31:14.426+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:64}} _\"Blindness is no impairment against a smelly enemy.\"_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ayzev","date":"2018-07-16T19:50:20.263+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is like when children are thinking of super powers and constantly try to one-up each other\n\n\"I can become invisible!\"\n\"Hah!
