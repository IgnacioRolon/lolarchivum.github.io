(including missions, tokens from the pass, and first win of the day and the tokens you got from the 10 year league anniversary).\r\n\r\nSo if you want both prestige skins of this event but can't play league all day you would have to use money while the prestige skins are supposed to be obtainable for all people that buy the pass and grind some league.\r\n\r\nDont get me wrong there should be some grinding for  prestige skins but getting both skins in this event even with grinding is not impossible you would have to play 191 games in 56 days with a 50% winrate summoners rift (3.4 games everyday)\r\nbut if you just dont have the time these months and want both skins you are forced to pay money for it.\r\n\r\nThe prestige skins should all be obtainable trough grinding but it shouldn't depend on if you have the time to grind while the event is active.\r\nThat is why all the prestige skins that came out this year should be obtainable with prestige points.\r\nWe would all work just as hard for the skins and even the people that were unfortunate this month because there were 2 skins in the same pass and they didnt have the time to grind for 2 skins have a second change in the next event.\r\n\r\nI really hope I could get some answer and support.\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[]}
