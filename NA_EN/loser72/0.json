Some of them might work but why doesn't Riot Games shut them down? Whenever i go buy something in the shop with rp the game gives me none and then i have to restart the game and then the correct amount shows up after - does this happen to anybody else? -\r\nSo who can i contact at Riot Games to make a drawing like do i just go to their support page or what?
