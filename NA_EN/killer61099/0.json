First off, you aren't guaranteed a PBE invite simply by applying. The criteria we use to select testers changes all the time, depending on what we're testing in the PBE at the time. The most consistent bit of criteria is that we look for *really active players* that have a *positive impact* on the summoners around them. You can find out more on the PBE system in our [**PBE FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top), which I *highly recommend* checking out.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Proxiimus","date":"2017-01-11T05:03:36.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=GX0qOqOP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-11T04:56:00.638+0000)\n>\n> We can&#x27;t manually review your PBE Application, but I can provide more info on how we select testers.

I have over $4000 spent on this game, 3 years of ranked play.. 1000's of games a season, Got selected for the Alpha testing of the new client when it first started.. and yet I can't get ONE PBE account and yet some streamers have multiple.. What do I have to do to get one? Buy one online from the people who you 'selected' and are selling them online?","replies":[]}]}]}
