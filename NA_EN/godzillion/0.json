I agree now with the update it looks much better than it did in the past. Never quite understood why they would even do a skin update especially for a skin like this that probably less than 1% of the player based even owns!","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-07-20T20:00:40.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well they made a model update so all skins have to get updated or they wouldnt fit the model anymore. but as i said and as you repeated and as i totally agree with: once they visually update a champion, they should make ALL (even legacy or limited or whatever bullshit) skins available for a duration.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-20T19:48:48.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think alot of the limited skins should be made available again.\nI want King rammus and Black alistar.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-07-20T19:54:45.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the main problem with alistar is that his best skins (classic and hell alistar or whatever his name is) look bad now. like, his classic skin was amazing before the update but now its ugly. \n\nthats why i think once they visually update a champion, they should make all skins for the champion available at least for some time.","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-20T19:56:58.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly that is the difference between Limited and Legacy.
