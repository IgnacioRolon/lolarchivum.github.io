Okey so first of all I understand that and I 1000% admit it was my faulth that I recieved a straight up 14 day at first because indeed I was toxic but in the last game (before I got banned) I legit was trying my best to reform myself and not int because of the players while the enemy team was being toxic in all chat (mostly their adc) and my adc refusing to help, spoken in all chat to give the enemy our positions and was toxic back - and tbh she brought everyone&#039;s mood down but hey in the end I guess it was me (who was trying his best to not get punished again because I do enjoy the game) that got banned. So for what I wish for is if you go trough the last recorded game on my account once more and check the vod on what was actually happening in the game and consider my ban.. If you think I should be banned atleast give me a chance and ban me for another 14 days but I really do not think that game alone was worth of a straight up permanent ban.. Tbh there was legit no chance to reform out of it due to me aswell only playing 2 games on the account after my 14 day ban.. So If a RIOT member will respond I understand and know that you get these msg&#039;s 24/7 but hear me out and give me one last chance - if my account ever gets reported with a valid reason in the future just straight up permanently ban me. \n\n\n\nP.s. I just feel that I did not have a good chance to reform (in game that is) due to the 2 game limit. If a RIOT member will ever respond please read this. Yes I understand that the 14 day ban was my timeout and my time to reform but it's easy in those 2 weeks because you don't play the game on that account so yea. After the 2 weeks I log back in dying to play the game and hey there it was me not being 100% pure (reformed).. In the end I did a mistake myself but it for sure didn't help how the game went trough.. (Example: If you were addicted to gambling - being forced to be around the people who're still addicted won't help you to not be addicted if you know what I mean)\n\nAll I ask for is for one last chance (which I probably won't get but it was worth a shot)","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-11-28T19:52:47.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot does not overturn bans if those bans are properly applied. You can post your chat logs for community input, but your 14-day ban is your FINAL warning -- any additional toxic behavior, even in just one or two games, can result in a permanent ban at that point.\n\nWhat other people did or didn't do is ultimately immaterial -- it is always your choice to respond or not respond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-11-28T19:44:37.640+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think you quite understand.
