Sometimes it would take an absurdly long time, and sometimes I wouldn't even get to connect before my team remakes the game. Leaver buster than would then punish me with a 5 minute low priority queue before I can try and even test to see if my connection was stable. Custom games work fine for me by the way so no, I cannot test my connection through a custom game. Then when I am finally able to see if my connection was finally stable, I am punished with a longer queue time because the issue has still not been fixed. \n\nTL:DR I don't see why players are being punished for a remake when the impact is much less on players than a player who afks during game.\n\nUpdate: Got hit with the 20minute low priority queue. How do I even play this game?\n\nUpdate2: I loaded to 100% and then crashed. Sometimes it tells me to check my internet connection but it works fine for everything else. I just want to play. \n\nUpdate3: Still don't know whats wrong but after 13 minutes I've finally connected. We won the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-02T18:03:03.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnecting from a match, even if not intentional, will negatively impact all players in the match. This is why both Leaverbuster and /Remake treat all disconnections equally and will take action against accounts that have a trend if disconnecting from matches. This is also a key reason why low priority queue penalties cannot be modified or removed in any way.
