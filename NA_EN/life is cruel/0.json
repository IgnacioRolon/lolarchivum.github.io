I believe the issue to be some interference with the League Client and the communications. The problem is very infrequent which makes this process of repair even more difficult. The Issue is when I am in whatever third party application my microphone seems to disable, my friend who also uses whatever program to communicate does not have the same problem, I can still hear him fine on occasion but some other times the communication between the both of us is dropped, the issues is solely on my end as you can see when an input is picked up on the microphone through the application, his lights up and mine does not. The problem is very infrequent as I said, sometimes I can go a whole game without a disruption other times my game runs for 5 minutes then I get dropped from the call. I use Astro A40s which are still relatively new so I can rule out cable issues, i've reinstalled all the software for the Astros without any problems, my audio options through Control Panel>Hardware and Sound>Sound are fine and test to great result. (Windows by the way). The odd thing is I can use all these communication applications and have zero problems UNTIL I load into a game of League, onto the rift itself. I can still talk at the menu screen fine for however long, but when I do get into a game it seem very indecisive when my communications while cut out, at random times. I feel if there were any interference between the League Client and my settings it would cut out at the same point every time which would make sense. I write this in seek of some clarity, could it possibly be my internet connection fluctuating?\r\n\r\nThank you for any response.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-07T20:57:32.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I really empathize with this problem. xD I have a ton of friends across the states and getting voice chat to work while playing can be a real hassle.\n\nThat said, when you have voice problems that fluctuate, and it's specifically when you get into a game, it might be less of an interference thing and more of a connection or bandwidth issue. To start, I suggest trying to troubleshoot your connection and make sure it's in tip-top shape with [**this guide**](http://riot.com/12B7oac). Sometimes the fix is as easy as plugging in an ethernet cable, because having a hardline connection will definitely make things better! (Something I frequently forget, see 'empathize with this problem').\n\nDefinitely reach back to me after trying those steps out if it doesn't help; it is a big guide, but I promise each step is helpful. Even if it doesn't yield a fix, it can still eliminate Connection as a potential cause. Hoping this helps you stay in better contact with your allies!","replies":[]}]}
