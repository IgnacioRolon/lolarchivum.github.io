League of Legends scene is growing everywhere around the world and it's about time India get's in on it! ( IMAGINE THE PROFITS )\r\n\r\nWhen I went to a E-Sports Event in India for fighting games and counter strike, there were a lot of league of legends players playing in Garena Server with around 100ms or in NA with around 250ms ping because of smaller queues and bigger range of players. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to approach the person who is in-charge of server management and let him know that if you can open up the server here, I would be more than willingly to manage the server and updates and everything for it. Use me as a business partner but please introduce this game to the mass world. \r\n\r\nThink about it!\r\nJust another passionate League player!","replies":[]}
