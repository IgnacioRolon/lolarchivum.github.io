Can a Rioter please tell me why. Also the new client doesn't tell me anywhere how many games I have left of low priority, only every now and then when I get done with a game it will show in the top right of after action lobby. Please fix this and tell me why I'm still in low priority. Also, when in low priority, if another player doesn't connect to the game and the game gets remade, that game doesn't count as one of your games toward your low priority. This isn't fair as the person with the low priority still waited the whole penalty time. Why should they be punished an additional time because someone didn't connect and the game got remade? Please respond ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T23:54:07.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it doesn't look like you're in a Leaverbuster low-priority queue anymore. If you're in a dodge queue instead, that's a different story, and you'll need to let me know if that's the case.\n\nRegarding a remade game not counting towards working down an LPQ, that's correct. Unfortunately, a remade game is not a full match, therefore it doesn't work towards an LPQ. This is a pretty rare occurrence, but I understand that it kinda sucks when it happens. :\\\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
