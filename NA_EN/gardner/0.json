We can't afford to ship with bugs that could affect your match set up, ex. pick champion, runes, masteries, bans. We would kick ourselves if bugs like that could potentially put you at a disadvantage that would cause you an ELO drop. Also, the penalties for failing to join/start a ranked match are higher. If a bug would prevent you from correctly starting a game, you would be unfairly penalized.\n\nThe client is still on Alpha, ranked will come once we have a more stable and polished product.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terchuy","date":"2016-07-21T23:33:43.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not yet.
