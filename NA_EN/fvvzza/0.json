Getting a bugsplat sucks, and I'd like to help troubleshoot so it doesn't happen again.  :(  Our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide can help with this by ruling out most common cases like outdated drivers or bad game files.  I recommend testing it in a custom game, though, to prevent anymore leaver penalties.
