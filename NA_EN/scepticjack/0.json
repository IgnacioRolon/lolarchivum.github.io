All bots have all kinds of Actives but you no your stuck with the One's given to you , Like why can't you just unlock them all and let us choose what to use we can read right? like why keep it locked behind a level cap \n\nI can't stretch the gui on my desktop it's so small i had to reduce my resolution to make it fit the screen\n\nJust Overall , Most new players will just Leave , not because of the smurfs or something else but the Lack Of Info about this game the champions the actives , \n\nCould you not just give them a easy way to go like the videos on the frontpage Highlight them out they are so small , or you can just make them play before they start going into the Conquest mode , to give them a slight idea of what to do , like give a in game handbook instead of those Tips , Im actually Have a clue what A MOBA is and i am even stuck  \n\nIm not a Smite fanboy , it's just they seem to do alot better for newcomers? Like Me!\n\nIf anyone would like to help me out a bit i would appreciate it , thanks add me scepticjack","replies":[{"poster":"Tio Magique","date":"2016-10-10T02:29:40.579+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"i read like 70% of this and got tired, dude grow up, stop crying and pass trough that. we all started from 0, all what u experienced is normal. go see videos in youtube, play diferent champions, play aram and you will learn.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-10-10T08:24:17.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not helpful :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T23:35:49.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I encourage you to leave this feedback on the [Miscellaneous boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous), where feedback like this is intended to go.

I suggest you to get with IP the 450 champions, they are as good as 6300 ones and many of them got updated with modern skillsets and models. Just don't mind Nunu, he's a thing in its own.\nAlso remember that LoL is centered less about counterpicks and more about personal use, so once you like a character you can stick to it for a long time :)\n\nAbout client pre-game issues they are about to release a new one, i am in open (restricted ) alpha and let me tell ya it is shaping very very good :)\n\nYou can expect a major update around half of november since it is the end of the season, more or less. This probably will include the client and other system changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2016-10-10T01:26:23.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly League has never been all that beginner friendly in terms of tutorials or assistance for newer players...\nIt's tutorial and leveling experience sucks (is there even a need for levels to begin with?)\n\nThough it is a simpler and easier game then say DotA (though DotA seem to have a better tutorial and such but I guess they kind of need that?)\n\nAnd Heroes of the Storm is even simpler and easier than league not having to deal with items.... and items are a big deal since if you buy the wrong ones you can quickly become very weak (though I don't actually know Heroes of the Storm all that well)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GerAvos","date":"2016-10-09T23:55:49.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, please post this where it should go.
