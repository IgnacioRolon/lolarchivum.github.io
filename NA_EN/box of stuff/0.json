I turned off all outside applications, and I'm getting lag spikes every 30-60 seconds where it's only my character moving (And I can't control the champ) for 2-3 seconds. Then everything updates and causes the everything to jump around instantaneously. I've been playing Vlad, and other effects I've noticed when these spikes happen are the red blood bar being completely off sync with the cooldowns and essentially disappearing when I pool instead of the pooling animation. I've tried both 2.4Hz and 5G networks with no success.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-25T21:37:31.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh it sounds like you might be having problems with some packet loss. Goto our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and toss in the last game logs that game you though teleporting troubles. Take a screenshot of what it says, using something like Gyazo, and post it here so we can go over it together!","replies":[]}]}
