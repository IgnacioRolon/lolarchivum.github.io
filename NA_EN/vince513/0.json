Every division/tier in ranked League has an expected MMR that players would have being there.  If your hidden MMR is higher than the expected MMR for your division/tier, the system will give more LP per win, as its trying to bump you to where the system believes you should be, given your MMR.  It will also give you less LP per loss, as it wants to encourage you to rise through the ranks.\n\nOn the opposite end of things, if your MMR is lower than the expected MMR for your division/tier, you earn less LP for wins, and lose more LP for losses as the system is trying to challenge you to prove you belong in this division/tier, or else you will be demoted to a tier with a similar expected MMR rating to your hidden MMR.\n\nIf you were earning 25-30 LP before hand, it appears that your MMR was quite high for your division/tier!  After a number of losses though, your MMR has dropped to be about the same level as expected for your division/tier, causing you to only earn about 18 LP.  If you go on a winning streak, and keep consistently winning, you will see your LP values increase again!\n\nFor more info, check out our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ?flash_digest=59e93ac923f39efc87058731d2060628618fd583#h2q3)!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bodya23","date":"2015-03-26T21:50:01.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:68}} I LIKE IP!!","replies":[]}]}
