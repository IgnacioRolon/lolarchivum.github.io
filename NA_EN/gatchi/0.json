Do people from marketing or animation on the champion committees veto or downvote such a design as \"not marketable\" or \"not League enough?\"  Are the \"advocates for equal representation\" within the art department just not strong enough to stand firm and say \"No, this champ has to be done as a strong, brawny female.\"\n\nIt's one thing to _say_ that there's a desire for certain designs.  It's another to actually do that.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-10-11T18:50:40.846+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because Rito doesn't just have a meeting one day and go \"omg guys, we need big chix.\" No, they think of awesome stories and themes and concepts and slap em all together into one big awesome and cohesive champion.\n\nFor example, Jinx was more than just \"err merr gerrd guys we need flat chested chix!\" - _que development_\n\nAnd Rek'Sai wasn't just \"ermergerd GUYS!

It could just as easily that someone came up with a \"buff lady\" idea and it was vetoed during the process for some less than savory reasons.\n\nTake, as an example, Vi.  Vi, a champion with big gauntlets that punches things to oblivion, could have easily been a buff tank lady.  Maybe not to the level of the OP's suggestion, but certainly strong-looking enough to not need a harness to carry her gloves.\n\nInstead, someone at Marketing/E-Commerce might have said \"We can't market a concept this 'brutal' as easily as we could a more attractive female.  Please change it.\" Or, one of those \"strong advocate for equality\" concept artists might have said \"I don't want to draw this champion as a buff woman, but as an alternative model with a pink mohawk and a steel corset.\"\n\nHence, an opportunity is lost because of individual decisions within a group.  More than possible, either way...\n\n> For example, Jinx was more than just \"err merr gerrd guys we need flat chested chix!\" - _que development_\n\nThat's funny.

Riot already has a docket full of champs on the way, so while it's possible they may do this kind of champ in time, it could be a while before they are ready to release something like that.\n\n\nFrom what I've gathered over the past four years, Riot mostly works by committee.  They have game designers, artists, animators, narrative writers, marketers and other people gather to work on new champions, starting at the concept phase.  Then, after a period of time, they come back to review ideas and concepts before focusing on specific directions (art, story, animation, gameplay, etc.)\n\nI'll use Vi as an example, again.\n\nVi is a young woman who punches opponents with large gauntlets.  She can be built fairly tanky and still be effective in the game.  Now, at this concept level, someone might have had Sarah Robles (American powerlifter) or Beth Phoenix (WWE Diva/wrestler) in mind for a gauntlet-wearing tanky puncher.  Instead, the concept artist chose to use \"Suicide Girl in a steel corset\" as the basis for the champion.  For various reasons (easier sell, fun design choice, excited to draw and animate hot chick, etc) the committee chose to move forward with the \"suicide girl\" model concept.\n\n> IMO, the quickest way to get a champ like this in the works, the players need to jump in and put together ideas, concepts, kits, lore, all the works.
