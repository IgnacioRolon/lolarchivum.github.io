I hadn't thought of this, but I believe this could be avoided if Riot also added a limited ban to all \"premade\" members - like 24 hour ban.  That would help prevent folks doing this on purpose.\n\nwhat do you think?","replies":[]},{"poster":"aushigh16","date":"2015-02-28T18:49:35.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Someone always posts this. Its not good enough of an excuse to not fix losing a game in ranked because of afks and dcs. Also the whole \"the enemy team has the same chances at having a dc\" is total bs. I don't want ranked play to be based on whether or not the dc is on my team or the enemies.","replies":[]}]}]}
