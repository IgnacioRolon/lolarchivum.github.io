I have a really weird problem with my mouse buttons. A while ago I tried doing this thing where I bind attack-move to my left mouse button, and ever since then my right mouse button has been acting like my left mouse button, but also acts like the right mouse button. For example, using my right mouse button to click on towers, champions, and monsters displays their health and stuff, but also makes my champions move toward them. My left mouse button does not do anything. I tried deleting input.ini file, my entire Config file, and restoring key bindings to default in game, but nothing works. Another weird thing is that this is specific to this account. I've gone into games on my other account and did not have this problem. It's really annoying and I'm at a loss at what to do, please help! :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T02:27:57.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These things are prone to happen when attempting to make manual modifications to your League files. :(\n\nYou should be able to resolve this if you delete the entire *Config folder* while logged into the League account that has this issue. After deleting the folder, hop into a  custom match to confirm everything functions normally again.
