Still going well, then a second into the game, my computer freezes and i cant do anything at all, like frozen to the point where i have to hard reset my computer. This was a ranked game and of course the team is going to remake the game so i lose LP for something that isn't my fault. I do the same thing again but i freeze on the loading screen. BOOM, 2 games automatic losses because i froze. goodbye 40 LP. I was wondering if anyone knows how to fix this???","replies":[{"poster":"Floaturboat777","date":"2016-09-24T07:25:21.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how to fix it, I wrote a discussion on it, its on my profile{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T23:38:22.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, the anniversary update has had issues for some players and it may be due to a problem with the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  Disable that as your first step, which should get you fixed up.

The quickest fix I have found is to: \n\n-right click the League application and select \"Test Compatibility\" \n\n-This will run a diagnostic and open LoL in windows 7 mode. \n\n-Run a custom to make sure it's fixed. Close the App and save the setting.\n\nThe test will walk you through everything.\n\n\nhappy gaming!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-09-17T23:42:08.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mitchelb180!\n\nI had the same problem.
