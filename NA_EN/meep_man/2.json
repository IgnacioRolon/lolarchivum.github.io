These aren't major, but are enough to be noticed.\n\n**1. Her Passive Needs to Feel Rewarding Immediately**\nThis is a big thing. Her passive should make you feel more powerful EVERYTIME you gain a couple of stacks of it, not every 100 stacks or so. The reason it feels like a chore to a few is because you are working and for a good while it feels like you are not gaining anything from your hard work. Make you feel that passive power immediately, like every 15 or so stacks you get some extra AP.\n\n**2. Buff her Q Ratio**\nMake it around 55% or 60%. 45% is laughable and make it hardly benefit from the one thing Cass will have plenty off... Ability Power.\n\n**3. Buff her E BASE Damage**\n10/15/20/25/30 base damage is incredibly bad for how the ability works (over 7 seconds AND is avoidable). Increase the base damage and make the skill less of a joke. (I am thinking 15/25/35/45/55 or 25/30/35/40/45 personally. Even a little buff like this will buff it enough due to the E poison debuff and since the damage gained can be multiplied by seven since the area lasts for 7 seconds)","replies":[{"poster":"Wise Squirrel","date":"2014-12-15T15:38:25.482+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason her passive feels unrewarding is the fact that poisoning enemies early on doesn't actually damage them.\n\nThey can't make you feel good with stat boosts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemiluniS","date":"2014-12-15T15:21:44.355+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"too bad that this  cass post coming from someone who doesn't know that her E is her twin fang","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-15T19:36:17.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This made me chuckle as well, but to be fair: maybe he uses other keybindings?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2014-12-15T15:19:11.184+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"She has a 55% winrate in diamond.\n\nShe doesn't need *buffs*.

Perhaps a few tweaks to the passive are in order to make it \"satisfying\" (although I think it's fine now), but buffing any of her spells is not a good idea. The patch 4.21 buffs have made her extremely powerful - enough to catch a lot of pro players' eyes. Bjergson was spamming her the other day, and Scarra is convinced that she's probably going to break into the meta. It's pretty much agreed in high elo that she's laughably broken if she survives laning phase. The only thing holding her back is the fact that Leblanc and Zed are seeing more play.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-15T19:38:06.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I always disagreed with you and I still find her playstyle boring compared to before (since she is forced into 1 skillpath).\n\nBut her power definitely got improved by a lot with the last patch.\n\n( A link to the 4 Cassiopeia games I had today)\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/AV4U2IGY-477-passive-stacks-cassiopeia-at-1947?comment=0002","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sparrow89","date":"2014-12-15T15:28:10.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Do you think they'll go around nerfing her in a bit?

Rumble has always been an extremely strong champion but his low pick rate kept him from being nerfed. It was only recently he has seen a resurgence so maybe Cass will be the same way. That being said, if Cass does become popular, and needs nerfs, it will probably be to Twin Fangs damage or something.\n\nI doubt they will touch the poison amp. It is pretty useful in situations where you want to max Q. I think they'd probably look to nerf Twin Fang's damage early game if anything, but again, it's too soon tell IMO. She is definitely strong but she still has the same problems she always has had and even though pros are trying her out, those problems may be too much to deal with to make her a viable pick in the current meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-15T19:44:18.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tbh. I think people just have to get used to facing her again.\nThe last patch made her fairly viable, but facing many opponents I only meet a single enemy who was smart enough to start boots against me (which really gave my a difficult time).\n\nI am kinda scared for her to become fotm tbh.\nThe thing which destroys champions most often is becoming popular after being unplayed for ages since - as result - people forgot how to play against them and consider them much stronger than they truley are.\n--------------------------\nE.g. I have NEVER lost my lane against a pre-patch Gnar since I used to play him myself a lot and knew how to completely outplay him. Yet I have seen people make - obvious and less obvious - mistakes against that champion, it's just saddening. \nThe irony is that even pro players often make bad tactical decisions when facing him (not going all in when he is far from evolving and didn't catch Q while they have enough wards to be safe, or standing close to evolve when he was about to evolve).\n\nI feel like Cass could face similiar troubles. Hell, I had platin III guy pick Malzahar into my Cass....
