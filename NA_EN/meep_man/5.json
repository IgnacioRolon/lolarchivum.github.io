Lots more AoE CC going around much more often and more reliability on his Riptide at the cost of some base damage, which was never it's main use anyway.

It is usually pretty predictable and usually goes down with I walk into Q range and Q rather than something like in the cinematic where Nautilus just comes from no where and starts wrecking.\nAlso, I can see what you mean with the fully charged not applying the passive, it might reduce CC times by 0.5-0.75 seconds.

Does it pull you through the wall too or just pull them into the wall?\nI like the idea of smacking people so hard they get knocked back, but I think he would need a major size buff for that to feel proper.  Would it work similarly to Kalista's passive? In the sense that you choose the direction during the animation wind up?\n\nI know this probably isnt your field, but any chances of getting a little lore with the update?  I mean something else he is involved in, the cinematic and mention with the shadow isles mist were nice,  but a little more context?  Like I never understood why Nautilus was rivals with Nami and Fizz on the page.  I got the vibe it was just so that no one had an empty page, but I always got the neutral vibe from nautilus not villain.  Honestly though I tend not to assume champs are \"evil\" from their appearance, I dont see morg as evil like a lot of people do, more chaotic. Sure Nautilus looks evil and menacing  but I figured him to be more driven to find the people who betrayed him and not really interested in anyone/anything else.\n\nSorry about the many questions\nAppreciate any response","replies":[]},{"poster":"Koala Frenzy","date":"2015-01-11T03:34:12.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let him keep the damage buff for the full shield duration, even after the shield breaks.
