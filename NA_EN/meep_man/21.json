Shorten the cast animation on \"Mega adhesive\". Currently you can't combo it with fling effectively as it is so slow to cast.\n\n2. Let \"Mega adhesive\" stay on the ground longer. It is often used to catch up in a chase but by the time you have crossed the pool to fling them into it has already run out. This would also allow it to be used as a zoning tool more effectively (similarly to Ziggs minefield that currently lasts twice as long as \"Mega adhesive\", [10s compared to 5]).\n\n3. Allow Singed more control over his fling. For example allow him to throw towards the direction of the cursor if the cursor is placed behind him (cursor placed in front of him would result in the current fling). Currently it is extremely hard to predict the direction of a fling, especially when fighting inside minion waves where champions turn around a lot irrationally due to collision.\n\nNr 3 would probably be my favorite to test and see how it would play out, as much as I dislike the clunkyness of casting \"Mega adhesive\" I believe that some more fling control (that would also add another layer of skill) combined with a slight raise in duration time for the adhesive pool would be the most fun/interactive change gameplay wise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"X8ViEhkPS0","date":"2015-08-15T08:20:07.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repertoir is there any back end data that shows the usage of his snare when flinging people into his Mega Adhesive? As cool as it sounds being able to snare someone I have a hunch that is almost never used.

I was just wondering if you had any plans for him, even on a small scale especially since the Juggernaut update was coming out.
