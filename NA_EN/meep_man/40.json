Top Lane has to either be dealing tons of damage to carry or having huge damage reduction to block the carries. Middle Lane is all about roaming pressure, especially Bottom Lane, meaning that they have to have tons of quick damage. ADC has always been damage focused, but that is it&#039;s purpose. Support has become all about damage mitigation to weaken the extreme amounts of damage being thrown around. Jungle has become this weird ball of champions, which is fine, but you still hardly see CC focused junglers like Amumu and Sejuani played a ton.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;m saying is that we need more champions in this game that are entirely about disabling enemy champions. Right now, we have about 8, being:\r\n{{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:113}} \r\nOnly about 3 of these champions are currently being used due to nerfs or innate flaws in their kits. Note that I said entirely about CC, not CC+Damage. There are some champions that can disable enemy champions nearly as good as these guys while ALSO dealing tons of damage, but that is another story. What I want to focus on is the lack of CC focused champions. Most Initiate champions these days are all about that initial BURST of damage they provide, not some team crippling crowd control. The only champions that are currently somewhat like that are Hecarim and Gragas, but even they are more known for their pretty crippling damage along with their crowd control.\r\n\r\nTL;DR We need more Disable focused champions. Not Disable+Damage, but pure Disable focused champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-09-01T14:24:58.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"also {{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-09-01T15:43:35.379+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to say Cho'Gath is a high CC, little damage champion when he has a 650 (+70% AP) true damage nuke in his pocket.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-09-01T16:11:28.251+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho has a good amount of cc honestly.
