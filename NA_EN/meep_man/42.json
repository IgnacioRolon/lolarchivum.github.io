His ultimate is good for picking up kills early game, but that's about it. So here is my thoughts on Gangplank. What is he currently at least a little bit known for? His ultimate, oranges, and gold boost. So I decided to take these strengths and build a kit around them... with oranges included since it would be strange in my eyes to build a kit around removing crowd control with a heal. Also, I wanted to capture that sense of \"Hey you are a pirate captain, PLUNDERER AND PILLAGER OF THE SEAS AND LEADER OF A GROUP OF PIRATES! So without further ado...\r\n\r\n> **REWORKED KIT**\r\n\r\n**Passive- Plunderer of the Seas**\r\nInnate- Plunderer: Gangplank gives his entire team 2/3/4 gold every time he kills an enemy unit, increased to 6/9/12 gold for large minions, large monsters, and champions.\r\nInnate- Blow Him Down!: If Gangplank's basic attack would kill the target enemy unit, his basic attack range is increased by 400/450/500 for the killing basic attack against the target.\r\nLevels: 1/8/16\r\n\r\n**Q Ability 1- Rope Shoot-Out**\r\nActive: Gangplank swings on a rope from his ship across the target line. During this time, he can cast spells and basic attack with 70/90/110/130/150% attack speed increase and 500 bonus range on his basic attacks, using his gun. The rope will swing all the way across the line before beginning to swing back. At any point during this time, Gangplank can recast this ability to jump off the rope. Gangplank will automatically jump off the rope once it has gone full swing. The full swing happens over 2.5 seconds.\r\nCost: 70/75/80/85/90 mana\r\nCool Down: 18/16/14/12/10 sec.\r\nRange: 775\r\n\r\n**W Ability 2- Remove Scurvy**\r\nActive: Gangplank eats a large amount of citrus fruits, healing him by 40/80/120/160/200 (+50% AP) (+10% bonus health) health and making Gangplank immune to crowd control for 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds and removing any crowd control currently on him.\r\nCost: 50/55/60/65/70 mana\r\nCool Down: 21/20/19/18/17 sec.\r\n\r\n**E Ability 3- Explosive Barrel**\r\nActive: Gangplank throws a barrel of gunpowder in the air above the target area before shooting it, dealing 70/110/150/190/230 (+90% bonus AD) physical damage and stunning enemies hit for 1 second. Takes 0.2-1 second(s) to execute based on the range. If Gangplank is affected by a stun, silence, fear, charm, polymorph, suppression, knock up, or knock back when the barrel reaches the target point, the barrel will fall to the ground and explode, dealing 30/50/70/90/110 (+60% bonus AD) physical damage, but staying there for up to 4 seconds.
