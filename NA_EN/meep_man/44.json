No seriously, at 20 minutes. You can have your team get 40 extra AD and AP and sack lanes on a global scale since minions now are super tanky and any mistake your opponents makes that could cause them to leave the lane means one turret for Azir's team. It is an amazing strategy and Im not sure if this would be OP or not but Im really confused why people don't complain about how Azir can do this yet Pantheon shouldn't. Warding Dragon early on in the game could not only secure your team with a Dragon but also a free kill.\n\nEDIT: Here is some videos of an Azir soling Baron to show about how long it takes and he does it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZot2I5onXc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW2xw1zoL8E\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEuN51hcmuk\n\nSome points brought up by others:\n1. This would leave Azir's team at a disadvantage since he would be gone (although for only about a minute)\n2. Azir's team would already be at an advantage if Azir has the time to solo Baron\n\n1. First off, this doesn't take long. A proper Azir solo can take at maximum around a minute since his minions can't have their damage reduced against Baron. Second off, if your team has the chance to solo Baron with only one champion, this would allow your teams to force the enemy's attention elsewhere since you have 4 champions to \"taunt\" the enemy with. For example, you could send them to do a Dragon or have them push a lane (Bottom Lane when you can so that they won't go near Baron). If you can't distract them , defending the Azir for a minute for a Baron buff is majority of the time worth it so long as the enemy's aren't AT your towers.\n2. Once again, it only takes around a minute. Secondly, I never said they had to be at a disadvantage. If your team already has the advantage, what is better than only sacrificing ONE member of your team to assist other champions while they push. If Azir's team is at a disadvantage then yes, I would not recommend EVER going out alone unless you can split push. However, when you are evenly matched or are at an advantage, this is an extremely effective strategy that can give you a push to close out the game, make sure the enemy stays down, or tip the scale in your favor.","replies":[{"poster":"CoffeeHangover","date":"2014-12-08T19:11:35.603+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon so OP he stays afk until 20 mins and still solo's Baron when it spawns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2014-12-08T19:13:38.094+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Azir requires a HUGE amount of time to do this, and makes the game a 4v5 while doing so (hint, anytime you spend over 5 minutes stabbing baron and NOBODY ever passes by you, or takes multiple lanes and snowball everything anyway is a game you already won).","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2014-12-08T21:31:58.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This takes MUCH less time then you say it takes. An average Azir can take Baron down in around 60 seconds or less at 20 minutes (or around that time). Takes longer than Pantheon but still less time than you say it to be since a). Azir's soldiers are untargetable and therefore are not affected by Baron's damage reduction, b). Azir can have 2 soldiers attacking Baron at once for much more damage and c). if your team can communicate well enough, they will know to bring the enemy team's attention elsewhere while you get Baron. It only takes around a minute to do, but gives you 4 minutes of unstoppable siege and an offensive boost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-08T19:19:36.910+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, at minute 20 Baron isn't giving 40 AD and AP. The boost scales over the time of the game, so if you get it right as it spawns chances are it's giving something closer to maybe 10~15 or so AD and AP.\n\nSecond, if an Azir is busy with Baron for that long he isn't with his team, making them significantly weaker for it. There's a big difference between taking several minutes to successfully solo a Baron at minute 20, and a Pantheon who can get a Dragon at level 2 and provide all of his laners a boost to the early game, getting snow rolling down the mountain within the first five minutes of a match. That early Dragon affects more than the early Baron. Last hits and pokes are now slightly more potent, and the enemy is now whittling away at your team's health bars better than you're whittling away at theirs. \n\nBy the time the Baron shows up, chances are that if the Azir can be away from his team long enough to solo Baron, the match was already going in their favor. Moreover, if nobody saw Azir in a fight for that long, why not push the advantage? Assume he's either afk, or soloing Baron in the random circumstance that's the reason, and start forcing fights. Azir is going to have to either leave Baron to help in the fights, or he's going to let the enemy team start winning fights while he gets Baron.\n\nFunfact: Baron buff only applies to living teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2014-12-08T21:33:18.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir can solo Baron in around a minute.

That's not \"20 minute OP baron in  less than 1 minute\", that's extreme late game.\n\nWhich makes it a pretty useless video other than to show it's possible to solo baron with Azir, which no one was doubting.\n\n*EDIT*After seeing the other videos, okay, Azir can solo baron assuming nobody notices he's gone, goes near river, wards baron, or has killed scuttle crab.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2014-12-08T21:51:47.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lots of fun facts these days. There, I posted another video. The video is before Baron spawned at Level 20, but still shows how he can solo baron since Baron can't touch him in the current patch either.\n\nEDIT: The same goes with Pantheon. Ward it, he can't do it or a full on teamfight starts with Pantheon already injured from Dragon. Also, Azir can do this fairly easily with a pre-made. Without one, many strategies like these cannot be done as easily or at all.\n\n> EDITAfter seeing the other videos, okay, Azir can solo baron assuming nobody notices he's gone, goes near river, wards baron, or has killed scuttle crab.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shacos Day Off","date":"2014-12-08T21:42:03.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Azir can solo Baron in around a minute.
