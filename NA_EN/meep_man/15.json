I was wondering if you plan on doing the same thing with Runes to where, instead of giving stats, runes instead give a bunch of small passive effects with Quints giving larger effects and other runes giving lesser effects? Do you plan on doing something like this?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-12-03T22:15:45.803+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eventually, yes, we'd like to do some work on Runes to make them a more interesting and less raw stats based system.

I liked the direction but I feel the system still has a laundry list of flaws.\n\nFor starters there's extremely little variation (even moreso than before) because for example no one other than support will take Bandit leaving you with literally only one other choice and I somehow doubt your ADC will be picking up Sorcery (except for off builds ala mid Varus) or Piercing Thoughts. However this is less a problem with the new system and more an issue with the specific masteries available at this time. More masteries are needed like Assassin.\n\nThe other main issue is the 5 point tier. Does anyone actually put partial points into multiple masteries? This looks like it's only there for the lvl1-30 experience of accumulating your mastery points. But what if the masteries scaled non-lineraly? eg: instead of Unyielding giving a linear 1.2% AR/MR for each point it scaled for example, 1.3/2.3/3.1/3.7/4% with less gains as you get further in. This way if someone strictly wants all the MR/AR they can get they will drop all 5 point into it but if someone also wanted some health regen from Recovery they could split their points without feeling like they were wasted points because both values end up being so small. Though you could also argue this is the issue with stat based masteries (or stat based anything really), it's that there ultimately is one best 'correct' way to spend your points depending on who you are which is why we wanted masteries to move away from them which you guys only half did.\n\nDisappointing news about the runes. I was hoping they were an active project given you guys almost did a full rebalance of them a few preseasons back but backed off when it became clear how much of an overhaul they needed. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-12-04T03:43:25.103+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Pretty happy so far, though our expectations weren't that things would be perfect from the start. Our goals were to make masteries that were noticeable in game, that modified how you and other players played to a moderate amount and that had some meaningful choice to them. We feel we're hitting the first two goals fairly well. Choice is present in some cases, though some Masteries do feel mandatory or pointless for some champions. \n\nOne of the next things we'll be doing is gradually fleshing out the Tier 1 and Tier 2 keystones to 3 choices each. Intent there is to offer options for champions that aren't drawn to some trees at present to offer more choice between trees while also offering choices between masteries at a tier for those already using them. We also want to help out some classes that aren't currently being well enough served (assassins in particular). Additionally there's still a fair bit of balance tuning needed on some of the existing masteries, where there are potentially interesting choices to be made once the numbers are refined into the right spots.  \n\nThe 5 point stat masteries by contrast aren't intended to be choices generally. Stats are much, much easier to optimize, but do need to be provided to give champions appropriate functionality and define how attractive each tree is to any given champion. We're fine with those often feeling predetermined at some tiers as a result, with some options on certain champions depending on how you want to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-12-04T04:14:40.269+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like you guys succeeded in that regard.

IE, take up, say...all three quint spots for a large, special boost. Instead of this being a flat stat boost, it could be something \"odd\", like say, % damage or cc buff to Q/W/E/R. % crit reduction, maybe. Some of the unique item passives would also be kewl here. Similar things could be done to the other areas. Maybe instead of buying tons of CDR Glyphs to get that 5% you want, and then filling the other spots, a linked glyph for that % could be sold.\n \nI like the idea of Keystone masteries, also..I feel like the game needs more things like this. Going from, say, Thunderlord's to Grasp of The Undying, makes Volibear play differently, but are both viable. I think the game needs more things like that. I don't think anyone should be able to say, \"Oh, It's X vs Y matchup. This is what will happen at every part in the game. Okay then\". If masteries and runes do \"odd\" things that really alter the playstyles, viably...then this is no longer an issue. \n\nAlso, giving flat stats seems odd, to me, in runes/masteries. I feel like flat stats are gotten in game, on items. I understand, and enjoy, % stat buffs, like Max Health or MS quints...But giving flat stats? Underwhelming. That kind of thing becomes a numbers game, and there'll be an easy answer, by the math, as to what to use. But MS or Max Health quints on volibear? Both viable. Both are about as useful, in all parts of the game....So it's up to preference. \n\nI also miss the armor-magic resist mastery thing you guys had, that turned armor into MR or MR into armor, whichever you had more of...It was a lot of fun, it was great in so many games, and even if you ended up building both, the mastery still saw use. I really expected it to be a Keystone mastery, but it's just gone now....RIP. Rammus and Galio sadness. Well, tank in general sadness. It was also nice to be able to punish heavy AD or AP teams with this mastery. It gave you just enough Arm or MR to deal with the little bit they'd build to try to deal with your resists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2015-12-04T07:18:38.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply.\n\nFor your comments on the 5 point masteries, don't we already have pure stats served via Runes?

A cynical part of my mind might then say, \"of course its actual purpose is to be a giant IP sink coercing new players into spending actual money to both be able to have a wide roster of champions they like and be able to play them optimally,\" but I think everyone can agree that would feel really shitty if it were specifically intended to serve that purpose. (Besides, you have more sophisticated ways of forcing us to give you money now, like Dragon Trainer Tristana.)\n\n_I don't disagree with you _ that there are a ton of other improvements I am personally glad your teams are working on before tackling the makeshift prop that is the runes system, but maybe I feel significantly more apprehensive than you do about what your options are now that you have left it so long.\n\n It doesn't matter to me personally any more because I have already long since purchased as many runes as I intend to and I decided not to care about optimizing anymore as long as I can have a functional setup.  I do hate seeing new players struggle with the no-win situation of getting past rune purchases and personally wouldn't even care about being reimbursed to see the situation changes in their favor,. However, the longer this situation has been drawn out, the more entitled older players are likely to feel about having to have lived with the system for so long and putting their own time and money into rune pages. \n\nI know that as a new player I was originally excited with the possibility of customizing a handful of champions I really enjoyed with runes, until I discovered that it was all a lie. However, I don't see how you can actually make runes both meaningful to own a lot of and satisfactory to own a few of. Those two goals seem to require opposite extremes of power allotment. I feel like any changes made will continue to contribute to the frustration of the newer player experience as a sacrifice.\n\nTo sum up this entire ramble, I can't help but feel that the future of the rune system is going to hurt a lot of players no matter what you do, but everyone certainly experiences some level of resentment towards it in the meantime. I don't know. I'm kind of hoping you can reassure me with less bleak options being explored than the ones I currently imagine will pan out (including just an eternal delay of ever dealing with the issue)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Obechosc","date":"2016-11-03T05:43:26.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to reply by posting what I have just posted to a YouTube video discussing Runes:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rune Costs and Obtain-ability------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                             (Compared to Champions and Skins)\n\nInstead of making runes free, couldn't riot give more IP per game? Perhaps based on your champ score, or a new champ bonus for encouraging players to try other champs?(on top of larger parties of people) People who are new could then spend the IP on either runes or champs quickly and effectively. older players, such as myself, who have all champs and most runes, could just spend the extra IP on new champs as they come out and runes as they see fit.\n\nThe champs IP cost would go up to entice players to buy RP, but leaving the runes IP cost the same so as not to disrupt the older players peaceful experience and previous purchases. When the champ IP increases this will allow players that have bought the champ with IP not to feel cheated. The bottom line is, champs can be bought with real money, runes cannot. you can buy boosters with RP but you still have to grind the games to get the IP. IP in this case serves as a reward, a reason to play more games, or when a loss occurs having a \"well at least I am closer to a rune or champ\" effect.\n\nWhile runes being free has potential to create \"diversity\" in the runes chosen, I think it will have an opposite effect. If players are allowed to choose whatever, then players may easily go with what works best, from guides online. But if these players are in situations where they don't have all the runes listed in a guide then those players, such as myself, need to come up with creative substitutes.\n\nAll in all, riot has made an in game currency obtained by playing the game. At some point, and after many games, the player will obtain more in game currency than they can spend on the game. For those who play a lot or have a budget set aside for gaming and spend money on champs, and have accumulated all champs by now, which reading the comments seems to be quite a few, need something to spend it on.\n\nIf runes are free, then IP is only for champs, which have a more distinct advantage then runes for the most part as they are prioritized above runes. (I prioritized Volibear in 2011 because he looked awesome, [still same splash art= still same awesomeness]). In conclusion, should Riot actually make runes free? (rune pages yes, but runes?) or should they give more IP so runes are prioritized in their own right, and substantially easier to obtain? or perhaps there is something else that can be done?\n\nSomething else that can be done to allow players to obtain runes is to put them in the hextech thing, (which is a great addition for those youths who may not be able to buy cool skins, which I don't think riot gets enough notice or credit for) or win IP boosters.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rune Page and Rune Page Usage Before and During Queue-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        (In comparison to: Masteries and concerning: Champions)\n\nDifference of runes and masteries: I think one cause of runes being so set as \"run this page for this champ\" mindset is because you cannot change your rune page during queue as you can your masteries. If I'm playing top and my opponent picks a champ i dislike playing against, I can always modify my masteries before the game begins, but my runes I cannot. Thus causing me to have general pages for champs that can benefit them the most under all situations, or perhaps a few situational pages for my main.\n\nIf my choices are banned however, I feel as though my rune pages are not as good. In solo queue, I have not had a problem with this yet because I have 20 rune pages, 15 used for 3 junglers, 3 mid, 3 top, 3 support, and 3 adc. the other 5 for my fav champs. Others may not be so lucky as to have many pages in case of picks and bans.\n\nPerhaps giving champions (yes, the champion, as owned or playable) 3 or 5 blank rune pages, choosable by players before games will make for more diverse game play. So my Rammus can have a jungle page, a MR page and an Armor page. My Trynd can have a AS/Crit page, a Crit damage/health page and a Mixed MR/Armor page. Etc. This will allow players to not only set masteries before games up for success but also runes. \n\n----Re-reading this paragraph was a little misleading, so for further explanation: Aatrox, when playable, has 3 rune pages in his pocket. When I play Aatrox I can choose from one of those 3(or 5 or w/e) rune pages I modified before queue, during queue. When I go mid, I pick my Garen, when I get countered I then choose from one of 3(or 5 or w/e) rune pages I designated for Garen during pre-queue.\n\nI believe this will also encourage players to try new champs as they will be modifying the runes for each champ and thus looking up abilities and stats for the champion to best utilize the champion kit.\n\nI realize this was an old post and if needed to be posted somewhere else I can. These are my thoughts on the matter and may have been thought of already. I hope this is of help.\n\n\nBy: Your host with the most, Obechosc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Einhar","date":"2015-12-05T03:10:08.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe something similar to how Dawngate did theirs?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-12-04T13:28:08.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying and Im glad to hear it!
