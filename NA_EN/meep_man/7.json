For those that wanna get their Bilgewater on, here&#039;s this amazing 1 hour long piece made by some dude named Tobias (heh). I also want to take this moment to say that I would like more music like this added to the game. As in, different background music for when you are playing matches in Summoner&#039;s Rift/ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"Splision","date":"2017-04-29T21:26:19.383+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this was only a couple of years ago, but damn do I feel the nostalgia.

I hope Riot eventually makes another in-game lore event as big and pompous as the Bilgewater one. That was one of the coolest months of League. To be honest, I'd much prefer we get huge story events (complete with new announcer, music, quests for summoner icons like before, etc.) in place of the mid-season and pre-season class reworks. I know some players like the class reworks, but overall I think they are a bit controversial and leave players like myself feeling unsatisfied. Bombastic story events would be something a much larger portion of the community could enjoy! :D","replies":[]}]}
