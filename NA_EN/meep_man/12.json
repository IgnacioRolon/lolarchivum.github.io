Preseason's a bit different to other times of the year, in that we're much more focused on getting bigger changes (new masteries, big sets of item changes, game pacing etc) as good foundations to support balanced characters, than in trying to give each individual champion exactly the right numbers on day one. Foundation building, with a focus on the longer term, rather than a patch that focuses on short term balance. That's an approach that's normally not appropriate, given there's ranked play and the various competitive leagues being played on a regular patch. Preseason's the time where we can make bigger, long term improvements, even if that means some disruption in the short term though. Demonstrating what the effects of healing via crits are for example, to set up work for the coming year, is more important than a handful of champions being suddenly too strong or weak for a patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneakyy XD","date":"2015-11-12T21:35:22.485+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HQR5GVri,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-11-12T20:10:48.131+0000)\n>\n> That's the hope.\n\nWhy would you intentionally make the game agonizing to play for several patches instead of making small, good changes as time goes on?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-12T23:19:18.366+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":3,"body":"The changes in the preseason are all pretty heavily intertwined.

Honestly, I'm confused at how metal teeth clamping down onto your leg somehow doesn't cause injury.\n* Corki - The modifying of hits autos into half magic dmg makes itemizing against him easier, whilst the range nerfs to Valkyrie makes it even easier to assassinate him, especially considering he still suffers from the previous mana cost nerfs.  MS from The Package may be too overbearing to play against, but the enhanced Valkyrie is awkward to use and at times self-contradictory.\n* Quinn - Just straight-up nerfed.
