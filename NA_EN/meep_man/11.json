He is like Old Rengar nearly. However, I started thinking and that fits Trundle's theme SO MUCH! Pillaging and plundering troll that sacks towers. He fits that theme a lot. So I thought maybe possibly he could get some changes to make him kill towers and be able to sack them, making him the plundering troll he is in his lore.\r\n\r\n{{champion:48}} **Trundle**\r\n\r\nKing's Tribute\r\n\r\n- Now triggers half the amount for structures\r\n\r\nChomp\r\n\r\n- Now also steals attack damage from towers\r\n\r\nPillar of Ice\r\n\r\n- Can now be used on a tower to deal 45/80/115/150/185 (+50% bonus AD) damage to structures and slow their attack speed by 15%\r\n- Must be within 600 units of a tower to use it on them for damage\r\n- Still applies slow field around tower\r\n\r\nSubjugate\r\n\r\n- Can now be used on towers to deal a flat 100/150/200 (+50% AP) magic damage to towers and steal their armor and magic resist\r\n\r\nOf course he would have to be changed in other areas to compensate, but I think these would be some really cool changes to make Trundle be a troll... that destroys stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-05T06:18:15.562+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quite like some of what you're going for here. Trundle's already got a bit of a niche in poke/siege comps, given his ability to support team engages/disengages with pillar and ult that allows a tanky diving target to be killed much quicker than usual. Playing up that siege role a bit more could make sense as a result, sharpen why you want to pick him. Also very with you on the thematic tie ins, King's Tribute especially.\n\nWouldn't personally try and make the entire kit interact with towers though. Concentrating the building interactions on one or two effects would concentrate impact, reduce unnecessary complexity and minimize the amount of power you might need to pull from other parts of the kit. Passive, plus potentially Q or R would be my inclination for abilities to modify. \n\nI'll bounce this thread on to the balance folks for whenever they're next looking at Trundle - no guarantees this sort of direction will work out of course, but definitely worth digging into a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-02-05T19:58:09.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea of having his passive work with structures, though I don't think it needs to be half as effective on them. At most you would get 120 health from the destruction of a turret (Turrets having 2000 health) and that's late game when his passive has scaled to 6% max health and by then you'd get about the same from the death of most champions, and at the least you'd get 40 health early when he gets 2% max health.\n\nSo I don't think it having reduced effect against structures is needed balance wise and getting a larger amount of health from a turrets naturally large health would be a nice reward for taking it down.\n\nAs for the other suggestions, I don't think his entire kit should interact with turrets like that but what if his Pillar of Ice didn't deal damage to turrets but instead encased the turret in a pillar of ice, causing its slowing effect to project from a larger radius? This could be for enemy or ally turrets, enemy turrets to help with turret dives and ally turrets to help fend off turret dives. They might need to make it so if used this way on an enemy turret it would cause 1 tick of damage to enemies in the radius to give some risk to it but it might make for some interesting gameplay.\n\nMy only concern is that like someone else said, Trundle is probably the most balanced champion in the game and I worry that making any changes to him could potentially ruin that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PoE00dpWDk","date":"2015-02-05T19:16:13.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am kind of on edge about your proposed changes to his passive and Chomp, though I love the idea of him freezing towers. Just my two cents instead of having the damage scale with ad have the attack speed slow scale with AP instead and drop the damage all together. The reason for this change would be to have a more cohesive kit with his ult which currently and with your change scale with AP. Now trundle would have a more diverse play style, do you build some ad and tank for a more traditional role or build  ap for a stronger siege strat. if you keep both play styles scaling off the same stats than he has to be balanced around doing both (master of all master of none sort of thing), while if you separate stat dependence players could choose what they want him to be really good at each game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2015-02-05T00:50:03.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Trundle is one of the strongest duelists in this game. And he brings an enormous amount of utility to his team with ALL of his skills. No, Trundle doesn't need anything else. If anything he should be nerfed a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2015-02-05T07:20:06.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot decides to nerf Trundle before Lee, I'm quitting this game.\n\nTrundle has been one of, if not THE most balanced champion since his release. Riot has barely *ever* changed him, except for when in the rework they changed his W from tenacity to healing bonus. \n\nTrundle is -the- best melee duelist in the game due to his ult, but he struggles against people who can kite him. Not to mention that 95% of his damage only hits if you're right next to him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-02-05T06:24:45.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trundle does not need nerfs.
