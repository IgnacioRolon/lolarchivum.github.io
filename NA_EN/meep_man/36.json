If you haven't tried it as a joke yet, I highly suggest it. It gives a nice 80 AP and 250+30% instantaneous point and click damage to your burst.\n\nThat brings the full combo without considering meteor strike to be 730 - 980 + 165% - 240% at level 11 (if CrestKnight's numbers are correct). and it includes a slow. Not to mention since all these numbers are on single target burst damage, you heal for 33% of the damage dealt.\n\nIn any case, I think the conversation went off on a tangent that could be easily explained away. If Veigar misses his cage, and therefore can't hit meteor (even though he often can anyway), people might be able to escape his burst. If you miss the Q, then his R no longer 1-shots mages so you might be in trouble. However, if Yasuo dives in and misses his knockup, he ALSO can't instantly murder people. If we're going analyze a mage designed to kill champions by first assuming that he misses two of his basic moves, then what's the point? That's the same as saying a Lee Sin can't use his Q or E in ganks. He won't kill anyone either.\n\n**TL;DR If you miss cage and meteor, then it sucks to be you.
