His ultimate now deals bonus physical damage equal to 15% of the enemy&#039;s max health. This stacks with Bork, so Warwick can deal serious % health damage to his target.\r\n\r\n**Guinsoo&#039;s**\r\nA hybrid on-hit item. This just screams Warwick. Not sure if it will be built, but it&#039;s only a potential benefit in my eyes and cannot hurt the wolf.\r\n\r\n**Red Buff Changes**\r\nPretty big one here. Red buff&#039;s first tick now applies on-hit/scales with attack speed, meaning that it will also apply on every Warwick ultimate tick. Practically adds back the Booty Hunter Warwick from Preseason 5 with Challenging Smite (maybe not as bad, but it&#039;s like it&#039;s close relative).\r\n\r\n**Spirit Visage**\r\nSmall, but Warwick is somewhat of a Drain Tank, so the increase in healing from Spirit Visage from 20% to 25% is a benefit as well.\r\n\r\n**Experience Jungle Buff**\r\nThis means Warwick is reaching Level 6 quicker, meaning earlier ganks. This is a buff to most junglers, but especially junglers gated by ultimates.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-04-25T17:57:02.321+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"I for one welcome our new WW jungle overlord.
