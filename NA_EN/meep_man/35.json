I'll give you a pass for lobbing me a softball. \n\nA large part of the problem we have with Ranked right now is that the only difference with Normals is that Ranked gives you more stuff - not different stuff. Just more. \n\nBE, Leveling, Chests, and Mastery all come from both Ranked and Normals. But Ranked also gives you a chance to climb. Therefore, in the infinite greed of the LoL community, there is no reason to play normals unless you've made it to gold and you're riding out the season until you get your skin. \n\nTeamBuilder, to get to your question, provided a difference. As the OP said, it allowed you to play the champ you wanted. But not only that, it provided 3 important things you couldn't get in Ranked:\n\n1. Champ you want\n2. Lane you want\n3. Team agreeing to that champ/role up front\n\nYou don't need to offer a ranked position to affect ranked. This should be obvious to anyone who has ever looked at an operational structure before. If I fire half the Marketing Dept. that ostensibly has no effect on other departments, but HR, Sales, and Operations are going to feel it. \n\nlol.","replies":[{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2018-06-29T18:05:09.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol.

I don't think it will be brought back as it would reduce the player pool for Normal Draft. They changed Normal Draft to have role selection the same time they killed Team Builder to force Team Builder players into the queue for Draft. Think about it, why queue for mid in Draft when you can queue for Akali (or insert your favorite mid laner) mid in Team Builder?\n\nI would, say, however that if Team Builder were to return, you should get up to three choices (one for three different roles) and the system will try to get you your first choice, and will fall through to second and third depending on queue times if you have specified additional things you are willing to play. This way, if you really want to Akali mid, you can make the choice to wait for it. However, if you are feeling Akali mid, Akali top, or Morgana support, you can put all three in and have a shorter queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-06-28T16:59:58.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To start on a bit of a tangent, one of the biggest issues with League's matchmaking is that the game itself has very rigid expectations of what a team should look like. Even with marksmen no longer becoming mandatory, the game still follows a 1-1-1-2 map distribution, with a limited number of classes being viable in each position, and essentially expects everyone to follow it. Because player preferences do not follow this distribution perfectly, we're left with too many players wanting to play one position, and too few wanting to play another at any given time. As such, this forces a tradeoff, whether it be paid in time (i.e. through longer queue times), or just overall quality (i.e. by not getting the champion one wanted).\n\nBecause of this, I think the most durable improvement Riot could do to matchmaking is to make their game more flexible. If current \"troll\" comps were legitimately viable, it'd allow players to pick whichever champion they'd like, get matched with others without too much waiting required, and still have an enjoyable game. In a game where supports weren't mandatory, where most anyone could lane anywhere, and where more than one person could go in lanes other than bot, it wouldn't matter all that much which roles players preferred, because they could still all play together. Autofill wouldn't need to exist, as it would cease to have any purpose or meaning, and as a result much of the toxicity related to matchmaking, i.e. the dodges, the trolling accusations, etc., would die down as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-06-29T09:39:43.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason this idea won't work is {{champion:157}}.\nThis queue would be filled with all the yasuo mains (and there are A LOT of them).
