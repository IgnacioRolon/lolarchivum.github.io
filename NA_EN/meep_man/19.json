Don't even start. It so hard to see it. Dawngate was really _really_ good. And had some really good charaters. In some things League could even took some things.\n\nI really loved the idea of items be like \"Courage\", \"Wrath\" and etc. The idea of items not be actual items, but \"sides\" of personality It was really cool and suited champions perfectly. It's always was my dream to have this in League too., I still to this point bothers me a lot - why Ryze need some magical hat, why X champion use X item when they have their own item ingame, why ADC use Infinity Edge and not \"Bloodlust\" for example. I mean goddamn, it's a sword and they are Ranged!\n\nMines with workers was also pretty great idea.\n\nAnd some characters are pretty 10 out of 10. Renzo's personality, Support that can embody their ADC, ADC that has two arrows storred and if he strike 2 times and then does a little pause he does more DPS. Blind Otter Justice Cowboy.\n\nAnd _many_ more things..\n\nEh, Dawngate were super good game","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-08-24T11:38:34.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite part of Dawngate is if you lost lane, there was still something to do during the laning phase in the Jungle Well things. Enemy wrecking you? Steal their well thing and boost your income while decreasing theirs. Such a great mechanic.\n\nAlso, Renzo was the bomb. I dare say it, but I would say he even 1-Ups Braum in buff dude with mustache with a heart, mainly because he had much more lore with him and he had moments like the ones above.\n\nAlso, Tombstone Skull Dude as I like to call him. 10/10, best villain voice\n\nBest post-game Honor system too. This guy be cool? Give him bonus IP (forgot what it was called). Essentially half of the game's source of income was that system too so if you weren't nice in-game, too bad, you're broke.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Krabohod","date":"2017-08-22T23:47:12.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_Oh, right in the feels_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-08-23T04:54:36.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such an amazing show, I love Harold and everyone.
