My client itself works fine, up until I get into a game. Anywhere from 0 to 2 minutes in, I disconnect for about 20 or 30 seconds. Then, after the first disconnect, I disconnect again every 3 minutes on the dot. So if I first disconnect at 1:30, I disconnect at 4:30, 7:30, 10:30, etc.\n\nAt first, I thought it was the alpha client that I got to download and try. But after trying to repair my League and uninstalling the alpha client, I still have the same problem. Can anybody help me fix this issue? Please, I can't even play an ARAM without this happening.\n\nEDIT: I should add, by the way, that I checked my logs of lag. Everything was fine there.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkyard Guard","date":"2016-07-23T23:59:09.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you sooo much for your help!

Although, something different happened. I dced around the 1 minute mark, but reconnected 20 to 30 seconds later, like normal. After that, I dced at 4 minutes and then when I finally reconnected, the game was paused, as usual. But then, maybe 3 or 4 seconds later, the game crashed and showed a bug splat. I sent the report describing this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T23:45:45.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be a series of issues here ranging from connection to your game files.

I guess I should have specified. I didn't think I need to since I said that I uninstalled the alpha.\nBut yes, it's definitely happening on the live client. And no, there's no bug splats, just disconnecting every 3 minutes on the dot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T22:00:08.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for following up and the additional info!
