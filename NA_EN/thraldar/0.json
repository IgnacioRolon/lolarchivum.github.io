But if people can preemptively quit on toxic players, maybe those players would understand nobody wants to play with them. So they will either stop being toxic, or stop playing the game...","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Braum","date":"2017-09-09T10:18:42.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't want a way to encourage players to leave a game that's why there are penalties for leaving, because its discouraged","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-09T10:08:30.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean there already is a champ select quit option... it's called the log out button, it works really well; you see toxic people/trolls... you log out and u quit the champ select","replies":[]}]}
