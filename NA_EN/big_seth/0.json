Not many have entered the mansion but the near thousand creatures that have stormed and entered the manor have not returned. Master Burton can be seen roaming the halls and cleaning the exterior of the building, but has never been seen off plantation property. \n\nLegend has it that Noxus forces raided the building with their best forces in an attempt to set up a stronghold for a raid on the isles. The following day when additional forces arrived they were greeted by Master Burton who relayed that the whole army was absorbed by the manor but welcomed them to join their brethren. \n\nTo this day no army has marched on or near the plantation grounds and the creatures that dwell within the shadow isles are aware of the dangers of the manor. The only hint of the manor being inhabited are the occasional glance of passing traders spotting Master Burton standing at attention on the porch overseeing fields of empty, dead land. \n\nQuotes - \n\nI'm not blue cause I'm dead, this is just my fur \n\nJoin me in the manor, Master loves having guests \n\n\"HAHAHAHA - .. well? \"\n\nDance - Ballroom dancing alone \n\nPassive - Final Arrangements / The Isles are Calling\n\nFinal Arrangements -\nAt the start of the game, Burton must bind to an allied champion. Every 5 minutes beginning at 2 minutes, Burton receives 3 gold for every minion killed by his binded champion within any  5 minute period. \nFinal Arrangements is decreased to 1g per minion if Burton is killed at any time within any 5 minute window and is transformed into The Isles Are Calling at 22 minutes. \n\nThe Isles are Calling - \nBurton can bind to a new champion for the remainder of the game, If Burton or his binded ally participate in enemy takedowns, Both Burton and his ally receive full assist gold (Max Gold 999) \n\nQ -  Hauntling - Burton summons a hauntling to root enemy champions and deal a small amount of AP damage  (think a root the size of kog'maw ult w/ a channeling time/AP damage of Zyra's Q.)\n\nW - The Butler did it - Give allied champion or self temporary increased AD and Attack speed \n\nE - Coming, Master - Burton dashes in a line healing allied champions (Scales w. AP - numbers undecided) \n\nR - Happy Taunts (Welcoming Engagement) - Burton channels his ult and teleports into the enemy army, untargetable for 1/2/2.5 seconds with a degrading movement speed buff 25%/30%/40%, Burton has a 1.5 second AOE taunt, enemy champions may still use abilities on champtions that are not Burton if they are within range (Think fiddle ult  channel/jump w/ Rakan's E as the size of the AOE)\n\n\n\nNow this champion (and some of the abilities) are heavily inspired by the Haunted Mansion from Disneyland as that's my favorite ride and I thought, there needs to be more spooky champions, most champs from the shadow isle are kind of badass and lack a spooky factor. with this I wanted it to be an uneasy feeling playing him along with a lore that really doesn't give you much, but just enough to realize o\"oh shit, this guy lives in a houser where no one who goes in comes out\" and I think that's pretty crazy. idk if it would deflect from any outstanding lore, such as victorian manors probably not existing in the era of league, but then again it's a game, yolo. \n","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-11T20:43:59.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]}
