All the changes made to the game since I last played have been overall very positive. The visuals are great, the option to prechoose your lane is fantastic. I don&#039;t see an option to make premade item sets for individual characters anymore which is unfortunate. As far as toxicity goes, it seems to be less prevalent which makes the game much more enjoyable, although there&#039;s still some finger pointing and griping going on but it&#039;s nowhere near as bad as it used to be.\n\nI think my only gripes are the lack of premade item builds and the over abundance of too many items. I think riot should streamline the items in the game to be simpler and reduce the total number of items by atleast 30%.\n\nAnywho that&#039;s just my thoughts on the game. I was a gold ranked player when I quit, so maybe that helps give my opinions a little more credibility.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nEDIT: For those questioning my history I logged in once a few years ago to look at some of the changes but I did not play long term. I quit playing shortly after the game changed to the bronze,silver,gold and reached gold rank. Before that I was 1600ish ELO. I started playing shortly before they removed IP farming in AI games (around the time trundle came out.) Not that it matters. Point is, I've been inactive from a competitive stand point for a long time and I just wanted to share my thoughts. Thanks for all the responses.\n\nEDIT2: Are they reworking the preset item system? And do we have a release date?","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-16T18:36:52.550+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are planning on rebuilding Item Sets in the new client, but they haven't gotten to it yet.","replies":[{"poster":"EpicMusic","date":"2017-04-16T23:30:26.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"shiit you're the new client?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-04-16T21:18:43.293+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":">the over abundance of too many items.

Too many actives reduces the differentiation between champions and makes balancing (something Riot is really, really bad at) that much harder.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-04-17T21:46:14.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah?
