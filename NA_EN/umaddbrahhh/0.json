If you're reported it's cause your peers feel you've been breaking the summoners code. Riot reviews this and passes judgement and sentencing based on their outlines.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-01-07T22:34:04.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"new behavioral features in regards to visibility coming soonâ„¢ after the new client is up and running smoothly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-02-17T19:27:59.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't necro you, people were posting on the thread yesterday.\n\nAlso, I don't agree with you on why things should be completely transparent but I wasn't going to go into it because everyone else had already said what was needed to be said.\n\nI'm pointing out why exactly your example isn't correct to use in this scenario.\n\nNot only is your justification wrong by comparing Riot punishment systems to the American criminal justice system, you demonstrated why you had no idea the actual photo and video that are taken at court are outside the court.\n\nReporters are allowed inside and can take notes on what happens and report what is going on, which is why your comparison is flawed and not relevant.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2017-01-07T16:21:36.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are relatively open about it in that, if you do some research, you can learn what the system does. There's an automated system that gets rid of most of the fake reports, things like people reporting someone for just having a bad game. Any that make it through the automated system are given to a group of Rioters to be handled. The Rioters review the case and decide again if they should be punished at all. The punishments are always the same depending on the number of offenses: the first few is a chat restriction, then a 1 week ban, then a 2 week ban, and finally a permanent ban. Tyler1 is the only person who has ever pissed Riot off enough that they decided to permanently ban him as a person rather than as an account.\n\nMe, personally, I think we should go back to the old Tribunal system. Maybe have the automated system sift out the fakes, like we do now, and then anyone who gets through goes to the Tribunal on the website for them to decide whether or not to punish. The Tribunal had fans of the game be the ones deciding whether or not to punish, and gave them access to the chat logs and things like that.","replies":[{"poster":"UMADDBRAHHH","date":"2017-01-08T22:08:21.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want tribunal back.

If you don't get disregarded as a fake report, a rioter reviews it and decides punishment. I agree that it should be the tribunal instead, but it's not.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2017-01-07T16:59:52.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the context that punishments are given, to people breaking rules in an online game, I'd say yes their system is better.
