Picked Shyv jungle because I was bored, ended up doing pretty poorly 14/10/24 or something, but we ended up winning because of myself getting 7 solo dragons and I think 2 barons and pushing inhibs when my brain dead teammates were trying to fight an obvious lost fight, (then proceeding to bitch at me for not dying with them and actually getting objectives). \n\n>The second game wasnt awful, at least not for my time. My bot lane fed but I was playing Azir mid and got some decent kills ended up like 14/4/16 or something, so not too bad. The problem with this game though, is that the enemy team experienced what I was about toe experience the game after. They had a 1/11/0 Akali blaming everyone but themself. A miss fortune who was like 3/10/3 and just an overall feeding team that did nothing but type and complain about each other for being \"Toxic\". RIP.\n\n>The game I just played, that was more cancer then I could ever imagine, was an obvious defeat. Tried to dodge in champ select but I didnt realize that to dodge in ranked there were 2 \"are you sure\" style prompts, so I didnt get out in time, obviously. My botlane combo of Thresh-KogMaw both decided to take smite. \nThere were absolutely countless times where the enemy jungler would show mid and start heading bot and as much as I pinged and typed, my bot lane just didnt care and died over and over and over again with absolutely no wards. \nMy top lane Zed fed. \nMy Yi jungle thought he was a God. \n- More feeding from bot lane -\n\n>There were multiple very, very obvious roams from mid to bot, and I pinged many, many times and our bot lane still stayed pushed up at half health, still with no vision... just giving some free kills. \n\n>Yi didnt care about dragon. \n\n>I was like 5/2 to start, they gave me some easy kills on my Azir... but then you guessed it...\n\n>-Bot Lane Fed Harder-\n\n>The sad part is, this isn&#039;t the only time this has happened. This is actually a majority of the games I&#039;ve played on the account. \n\n>Another game we started 4v5 with our afk yasuo running to mid and giving up a free kill to Kat then leaving. I was 9/0 or something in the first 10 minutes on Irelia top.\nI asked Udyr to build tank because I was fed enough that I could easily build damage and 1v3 because I was so far ahead in every aspect.\nHe ignored me and build devourer, because bronze Udyr&#039;s know best. I pushed towers, single handedly won team fights but eventually you can&#039;t 1v4 anymore because they become just strong enough to take you out after you kill 2 or 3 of them, then the rest of my team was absolutely braindead and couldn&#039;t kill the last 2. They didnt get dragons or barons, no towers, nothing. Finished that game like 21/3/14 or something, a defeat. \n\n> This seemed to happen every game when I originally made the account and its even still happening now that Im a much better player than them and can easily get fed, but you really underestimate how hard it is to climb when you get 16 a win and 20 a loss. Im really starting to think its not worth it. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI feel truly awful for the players stuck in bronze who actually maybe deserve like Silver or something, because by staying in bronze it screws their MMR for the reset next season and they&#039;re just gonna get stuck there again because for whatever reason people find it entertaining to troll in bronze and they think they&#039;re for whatever reason, better than everyone else. \n\nIm not here to complain like a bitch that my original account is gonna be stuck in bronze for a while because I don&#039;t care that much, Im only typing out this post to share my experience of what Bronze is actually like and to literally say Sorry to players who are in bronze that actually care about climbing. \n\nIf you&#039;re hell bent on climbing, Id never recommend this usually, but get a duo partner that you can actually trust. It might make your teammates a little worse, but I mean you were probably gonna get terrible ones anyways. \n\nThere needs to be some way to fix bronze and make it an actual division for the players who care. \nIf there were some sort of system that took a players average KDA and paired them with people of a similar average KDA, then the people who go 0/15 could all play together and the players who actually try could play together and potentially climb.\n\nI will receive hate for this Im sure. People will say Im just too trash to carry bronze, but you have to understand that no matter how fed you get, you can&#039;t beat 4 other fed people. \n\nBronze is an absolutely broken division. Its really not fair that if a player is placed in Bronze 1 for example, that they&#039;re stuck there. The trolls aren&#039;t gonna make it to silver, but that probably means they&#039;re holding back the players who actually can climb.","replies":[{"poster":"phodi","date":"2015-08-17T11:17:26.573+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":5,"body":"like i suggested \nall games under diamond 1 should be a coin toss\nheads=win\ntails=lose\n\nthis saves a lot of time!","replies":[{"poster":"CubedJustice","date":"2015-08-17T22:18:44.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could go for this.

In team builder/draft, I was pretty badass (would use unorthodox things like mid shen, support heimerdinger, and top lane shaco) to great success, and the people in that mode seemed so much nicer/understanding (had opponents actually friend me in those games/give honors as the sets I used made them apparently learn quite a bit). Ranked has been the complete opposite of that experience, to the point of being entirely unbearable. I won 9 of my 10 placement games, and was immediately put in silver-1 (having the same experience I had in team builder in those matches). After that, I lost 26 STRAIGHT GAMES because of people either going entirely afk, people trolling on purpose, or people intentionally feeding due to not understanding the matchups. I can understand how some people might find it rewarding to get out of bronze/silver and move into the other ranks. For me though, it was more of an eye opener onto the other side of the coin and how disastrously immature/bothersome the community can be. {{champion:74}}","replies":[{"poster":"OhBoyItsaMegaman","date":"2015-08-17T22:59:35.270+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your match history tells a completely different story.\n\nIt shows that you won 7 out of 10 placement games, not 9 out of 10. It shows that during those placements, your combined KDA was 14/56/76. In 3 of the 4 games where you supported, you did not buy a sightstone or a sweeper.\n\nAfter that, you did not lose 26 straight games. You had 3 losses, 1 win, 1 loss, 1 win, 9 losses, then 2 wins. Far more losses than wins but clearly not 26 in a row. You do not have afks in all those games; you do not have intentional feeders or trolls. In many of them, you have double digit deaths. In many of them, you have the most deaths on your team. And in many of them, you have less than 4 cs per minute.\n\nIf you were mistreated by rude players in ranked, I'm sorry for that. That shouldn't happen, regardless of your performance. But your performance was quite bad. You lost a ton of games and you lost them because you weren't meant to be in Silver yet. There is a hidden rating called your MMR (Matchmaking Rating) that goes up when you win and down when you lose. If you generally do pretty well in Team Builder, it is because your MMR for normal games is low. You lost a lot of games on your way up to 30, and as a result you tend to get matched with other people with the same low MMR. Ranked starts you off at the default MMR so it put you up against players far above your skill level, and your performance since then has been the result of imbalanced matches, NOT because of your feeder team. The fact that you look back at those matches and can't see how you failed in them means that you still have a lot of learning to do.\n\nRanked is actually the best place to learn, once you reach the MMR where you belong. Compared to normals/TB, you will have more games where all 10 people are around the same skill level, and there will be more people who are honestly trying to win instead of goofing off or experimenting. If you do decide to start working on improving, ranked games are the way to go.

The people in bronze are somewhat near fresh level 30's that jumped into ranked.

Personally, I don't care to get higher than gold. I've dodged my promos into gold purposely losing it multiple times just to be sure I hover in the range of 1-2 so I can get myself to gold when I see who gets the victorious skin at the end of the year. \n\nBack on topic though it's honestly not hard in bronze silver was a headache but eventually you begin to learn how to carry because a lot of people are the same in the elo. I play ranked to keep myself in good shape to play a serious match. Once I get that insanely good start I just goof off and try to win but do it having fun. I don't want to be in some lame high elo. \n\nBronze is rough but Silver is 10x worse. People in bronze don't have the ego like in silver because they know they're the worst of the worst.

The key to getting out is to main champions who can carry harder. You can't main tanks and supports and carry your way out of bronze. You can't just win lane and do well and focus on objectives. You have to win the 1v3 fights, solo dragon, and solo the inhibs too. It's not fair, it's not reasonable, but it's how you get out of bronze.\n\nI just got to silver 2 today. 1st game of my promos we had an instalock who pissed off the other guy in his pick rotation with that so the second guy locks in the same role and takes clarity and clairvoyance and they both end up feeding hard and losing us the game. 2nd game mostly normal, not a big deal. 3rd game our support Blitz feeds super hard, our top gives up and we have multiple surrender votes with 3 yeses. I keep trucking, our Yi jg gets sated eventually, our adc gets enough kills with her ult (Jinx), and I keep making sure we actually win the team fights and take objectives. We won while still down 11 kills. Silver 2 is mine and well earned.\n\nSilver is way better than bronze, but yeah you still get idiots and asshats of all sorts. Just gotta shrug off the losses and keep carrying your ass off.

But apparently I'm on my way there. I managed to climb/hover in silver 3/2 for quite a while. Now where am I? After about 4 days of playing and practically 0 wins... 0 lp in silver 5.\n\nYes, Ive had some bad games. I'll aknowledge I need to work on a few things. But so far it seems like my issue is my team making bad baron calls, trying to contest unsafe and unimportant dragons  3v5 (we've already got 4, the enemy has 1) even when I ping/tell them in chat, and they just generally do not having quick enough decision making on how to close out a game, take objectives, or defend properly. The most notable was when I went 10/5/25 as Braum... I was not the most fed on my team, either. That was the unimportant dragon call. They went in, got destroyed, and the enemy closed out the game because we were all dead, then. The last game I played, we were down all three inhibitors and two people were pushing lanes out blindly. No wards in the jungle at all. They'd push up to the enemy tier two turrets without vision, get collapsed on, and be dead for 75 seconds. We were able to defend for a long time, and won the team fights every time at 1 for 3, or 2 for 4. We got the enemy team down by 4 players, so they decide now's the time to rush their base and close it out. What they didn't consider, was that we still had to get through the nexus turrets and vayne was up in less than 20 seconds. Nobody even seemed to notice vayne when she ran out and killed everybody on my team. they just kept trying to hit the full Health nexus while vayne made very short work of everybody 1 by 1 (she'd started picking them off as they were getting the last nexus turret). So here I am sitting at 0 lp in silver 5, with many, many recent losses. And am probably on my way in to bronze.\n\nI think I do fairly well at enabling my carries, seeing as I main supporting. Multiple times, my adc and I will just destroy lane. Why? I'd like to say because it's silver, and I'm able to take advantage of the bad positioning of my lane opponents. Getting grabbed by blitzcrank? Rarely an issue. I play Nami, and try to only leave myself open to grabs (yes, purposely) when their adc is sitting right next to them and we're ahead in terms of health. Why? I have the reflexes to shoot a bubble out as soon as he roots himself for the grab. How is this effective? Their adc is sitting right next to them, and doesn't react in time to get out of the bubble because they're concentrating on trying to kill the recently hooked Nami. So after I'm hooked, and they're both bubbled, I throw my W on their adc which bounces to me and heals me, and then hits blitz. I throw my E on my adc, and they clean up while I'm laughing. \n\nDespite these types of early game advantages my team gets, there's always failure in the late game. And I'm aware that i am also part of the problem. I'll own up to that. It's just frustrating when I tell people that vayne is up, ping her, yet I'm still the only one trying to remove that threat while my team disappears one by one.\n\nIf I drop to bronze, I'm done supporting. I'll have to learn to carry hard in another position because I know that no matter how well Im capable of supporting, my adc more than likely won't understand the difference between me making an engage or a disengage and effectively throw every opportunity I give them to either get a kill (or just to survive) out the window.","replies":[{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-08-17T19:30:05.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, crap.

And that's only in normals. In ranked, your opponents are there to win. They WILL take advantage of any opportunity you give them.

Find one or two champs that you really love playing, and focus on learning that champ. At bronze (especially bronze 5) it pretty much doesn't matter what the champ is, you can carry w/ anything from any position. If possible find a champ that can play multiple positions so you can play it more often. For instance if you love adc, playing corki or ez will let you play them as adc mid laners if adc is taken by your pick, and morgana can play mid, top, and support so you can ALWAYS play her unless you are 4th or 5th pick AND no one in the earlier picks grabbed adc or jg.\n\nA youtuber named Huzzy said in one of his recent episodes of an unranked to diamond series, that diamond rank has probably the most one trick pony players per capita of any rank. The reason is that if you \"perfectly master\" one champ and play it without any errors every game you can, then it's pretty easy to get to diamond. Most people don't come anywhere near playing one champ \"perfectly,\" but the same concept applies at bronze/silver/gold level. If you play a champ you know far better than anyone else in the game knows their champs, you'll probably beat your lane opponent hard, and play team fights and macro strategy decently.\n\nThe last thing I will say is that in my experience bronze and low silver are more about adjusting to your team, while above that you start to work with your team. Below about silver 3 people don't tend to listen and coordinate with each other very well, so it's about noticing the patterns of your team and adjusting to exploit them. If you have an adc who wants to push side lanes and not group and keeps getting caught out, it can be really funny to pink ward a bush in the enemy jg  if they keep flanking him, and then assassinate the enemy carry when they go to kill yours.\n\nFinally, carrying low elo isn't about winning your lane, but spreading that influence to other lanes and winning more lanes than just your own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-08-20T01:21:00.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gimilee,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=mcQRFbhG,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-08-17T15:29:59.550+0000)\n>\n> Hi guys.\n> Im a Bronze 5 for life guy, and I do care about climbing.\n> \n> My experience in bronze has been quite a journey.\n> \n> For the first few days, I was in s2.

Im always trying to learn new things. I am currently working on rune pages, as I only have 2. Im always ready and eager to accept new ideas. Please help me if you can.\n\nIf you only have 2 rune pages it sounds like your main issue is just a lack of experience.  I placed in Silver when I first did ranked, then plummeted to B5 over the course of that season.  I kept playing and learning and buying new champs and runes and re-tried next season to climb out.  The change in experience was huge and I managed to get out of bronze that season.  I just wasn't ready for ranked before.  I'd rushed into it hoping to shoot to gold and get the victorious skin.  Since then I've come close to gold twice but never made it before season's end, which I blame on a mix of mediocre skill and not starting to TRY until late in the season when they announce the damned skin you'll get for gold.  If you play enough you WILL get out.  \n\nYou don't even need to do anything special.  Play a lot of champs in normals.  Find the ones you like and that work for you.  Ignore guides and picking fad champs because some pro, streamer or guy you knew picked them.  TRY them, but don't say \"that guy is challenger with Rengar, so I need to main rengar\".  No.  Try rengar and if he's not a fit, don't force it.  Practice the basics, like CSing and avoiding dumb mistakes.  Cut back on your number of deaths as much as you can.  A champ with no kills and no deaths can do fine if they have good CS.  Don't rage.  Try to keep your team's morale high.  Don't go overboard, of course... but dropping a \"gj\" or \"nice\" in chat sometimes works.  Hell, you don't even need to pick carries to get out of bronze.   The two champs I played the most when I pushed out into silver were Janna and Skarner!  (This was before riot gutted Skarner hard, but even then he wasn't really a popular or strong pick).  Learn every role and get comfortable with a champion or two for each, even if you always jump to your main if given the chance.  You won't always be given that chance.  Play every champ you can in normal pvp a few times, if only to learn their strengths and weaknesses first hand.  Be a team player, but don't be afraid to mute anyone on your team who is raging, and don't stoop to their level or even argue to defend yourself if you're being attacked.  Just mute and play your best.  It won't be easy, but you'll get there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saixos","date":"2015-08-17T13:42:03.529+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The absolute best suggestion that I've heard regarding this is to make the bronze division require being in the top 80% of players to reach.

I could have sat in lane and babysat the whole game I guess lol.\nThe prior game we had a yas mid feed before I could make any attempts to roam. He was constantly running solo. Our yi soon began to follow suit. I was relatively calm that game.

DON'T PLAY HIM in bronze unless you know your team comp is gonna support you. I've made this mistake when I was bronze. Also, just because you're against a counter doesn't mean all is lost. That's just a mentality that you need to get over. Counters are much more crucial in 5's anyways. Yeah sure some champions are hard counters to others.

Just because the minority of your games are due to teammates doesn't mean you're stuck because of that. You're the one that decides to play on tilt. You're the one that decides to pick a champ that doesn't actually synergize with the team. You're the one playing a champ where you probably can't play them. You're the one that doesn't learn from your mistakes.\n\nAdvice: Find a champ you can play well and one that brings a lot to the team. Champs like Jarvan are really good at helping to snowball games.

I don't have a smurf in my opinion, but I have a second account from leveling up w/ a friend when they joined the game. I placed both my accounts in bronze at the beginning of the season bc I was pretty bad and out of practice after not playing for 4-6 months. I worked and focused on learning and improving and got this account up to gold V. I was in promos for gold IV once or twice, but started to get burnt out on the champ I was maining so I switched accounts to level up and get end of season rewards while practicing.\n\nThe difference I noticed in my skill from when I did placements was huge. I played stuff I am not used to or good at and did okay, not holding my team back but also not carrying. When I switched over to stuff that I played at low gold level I crushed and won like 80-90% of my games. The skill difference of teams at gold V compared to bronze III or bronze II is huge and it was pretty easy to climb. I'm silver II on that account now and my win rate has dropped much closer to like 55-60%. The difference between gold V and silver I/II isn't as big, and sometimes it's just about grinding enough games, or can come down to if you're playing tired/frustrated/otherwise off your game. \n\nThat's the thing though, to get to higher levels you have two main options. First, you can play at a level significantly higher than your current division and have a big influence on your games. When I was up for gold IV promos I played a decent amount of gold III and gold II players because winning consistently raised my MMR to play against people who made balanced opponents. The second option is to play a large amount of games and grind out the small advantage you have to prove you're slightly better than your division. To me it sounds like you're having issue w/ the later. You have good mechanics and win lane, but you don't have as strong a map awareness maybe or practice roaming that a high silver/low gold mid lane would be expected to have. As a result you win your lane hard, but don't influence the map and your team as much as a higher elo player likely would, and it takes grinding out lots of games to get games where the teams are matched evenly except for you and you can turn your lead into a win because people got through lane phase w/out your help.","replies":[{"poster":"S2C2Xd9KOy","date":"2015-08-18T02:59:55.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im gold 3 currently.

There were even a few games I threw (yes in bronze) bc I went in at the wrong time (bad at assassins like I said). However, when I played heimer (what I was used to in gold) and utility tanks like Maokai and Nunu (my favorite champ style, rather lock someone down than blow them up) I was calm, confident, and crushed. I had never played Maokai before (even in bots) and picked him up in bronze and bc he was a style I'm comfortable w/ I wrecked that game even though I don't lane well enough w/ him to play him consistently in gold yet.\n\nYou may have no interest in it, but if you're willing to try an experiment, I think you may find you change your mind about bronze. Play 15 games in bronze (doesn't matter over how many days), but only play stuff you're at least comfortable enough with that you know you'll go even w/ if you play it in gold. At the start of the game mute both your team and the enemies if you're not having fun after the first 5 games. Last, but most importantly, assume your teammates have all recently been given concussions and will struggle to make decisions and react to anything. Adjust accordingly by not relying on them to do anything, backing off when you know they won't follow up w/ you and you may die bc of it, rotating to cover them when you know they will pick a bad fight w/out you and you can clean up some kills and still escape if you go over to it, that sort of thing. Use your team like you would bots that played w/ you and let them be bait, but don't expect much out of them other than that they will draw the attention of the other team. If you want you can even throw in a game or 3 of Anivia, if you lose a single Anivia game in bronze the way you play it, well, then it wasn't you playing Anivia on your gold account :P","replies":[{"poster":"S2C2Xd9KOy","date":"2015-08-20T01:04:48.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, i could totally use anivia in bronze and probably win every game, but as I stated, I hate her. She's just super easy to carry with but I dont like her play style. I figured out how to play her just experimenting with champions and I got surprisingly good on her so I knew I was gonna use her for provisionals. Its not that I'm not Gold level with other champions, its just I dont know which champions I _want_ to play so I play like one game with a champion, do poorly and rule them out. Thats why I have decided to take a break from ranked for a bit then kind of just only queue for ranked once I actually want to climb, right now I'm just content playing some normal and fucking around.\n\nOn the bronze account I just play Azir, because everyone expects an Azir in a bronze game to be trash, then they get angry when they can't just kill me for free and end up dying a bunch and tilting, its pretty funny. \nIm just gonna leave the bronze account, wait for the reset, hopefully 10/0 my provisionals on the account  and get placed probably at best bronze 3 or 2 then just climb out from there a month or two into the season. I say a month or 2 in because I wanna wait for other players to get back into their normal Elos because if a bronze 5 player gets into bronze 1 by some touch from god, i dont wanna play with them. i wanna wait for them to sink back down to bronze 5 so i dont have to worry about them on my team lol\n\nMost annoying thing about this post is people are reading it as if Im stuck in bronze 5 and are trying to give me tips or saying I dont get out because Im bad. Meanwhile Thats not the point whatsoever.\n\nSorry about bad grammar and sentence structure btw. Tired, bored. No reason to try.\n\nEdit: Just to credit how much I dont enjoy Anviia, I refunded her after getting to gold 3 because I wanted to try one trick Zyra mid, didnt work out ;p","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-08-20T21:20:32.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, I've never really been able to just pick something up and be reasonably good at it. Only times I've hit gold was by finding a champ or two I love playing and practicing them. I'm really shit at video games in general though, so I'm pretty happy w/ low gold bc it's top quarter or third or something of players, and I'm only ever any good at video games by understanding the strategy and what to do better than my opponents. My reaction time is shit, and I push the wrong buttons too much, but I learn strategy decently. Wish I had something as strong as your Anivia, but if you hate playing it I understand not being willing to do it to climb. I never hit gold season 4 bc I just couldn't find something I liked that was any good in the meta, and kept trying to play meta instead of just learning something way off well enough.","replies":[{"poster":"S2C2Xd9KOy","date":"2015-08-20T23:50:52.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Realistically, my Azir, LeBlanc and Zed could all half the stats my Anivia does, but I go too balls to the walls on them lol. I get a lot of Quads with Azir then die to the 5th, lol. \n\nAnd yeah, I've been playing video games since I was a kid. Need for Speed, eventually to CoD a few years ago. Ive also been playing sports at high level all my life so my hand eye coordination is probably a really big factor in any success I have in gaming. \n\nJust play what you like man.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-08-21T00:58:25.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I was all strategy/Rpg video games growing up and I played a bunch of sports but I've turned out a better coach than I ever was a player and always did best at slow thinking stuff like judo or jujitsu rather than basketball/lacrosse/soccer or whatever I was playing that year, so still have shit reaction times.\n\nHell even cod and battlefield I am only good at bc I can memorize maps and common player patterns so I do well at killing people as they come around corners to get me.
