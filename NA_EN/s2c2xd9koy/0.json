Either his Q had a delay after it got off cooldown before it would activate, if I try to summon soldiers anywhere in turret range it makes the noise and puts it on cooldown but theres no solider and usually if you use his ult forward and theres an enemy very slightly behind you, the ult will catch them, but now it won&#039;t and i just look like a dumbass?\r\n\r\nOn top of all that, his slide/drift seems like its a lot harder to pull off at the moment? Like Ill E and Q immediately after behind an enemy and once I get to the soldier, I stop and THEN my  Q goes off... making me look like a  Bronzir here Rito..","replies":[{"poster":"Tsumikiri","date":"2015-08-23T13:34:14.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found another issue playing Azir last night. I accidentally made a sand soldier (that part was my bad) next to an enemy turret (the purple team bottom outer turret on twisted treeline) and I tried to just attack the turret with Azir and it wouldn't let me. I spammed right-click and moved a little bit and it fixed itself. Really weird interaction. Maybe the soldier was trying to attack the turret, but it can't so it locked up? Not sure.","replies":[{"poster":"MysticFlameHaze","date":"2015-08-25T02:43:33.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think his auto attack function is glitched as well, sometimes i cant auto attack as azir and i have to move  before i can use anything","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xyes","date":"2015-08-21T05:30:44.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played 3 games with him and nearly ripped my hair out.  My ult kept *NOT* knocking enemies away.  This is seems like the opposite of what the patch did.  \n\nI can't help but feel they stealthily made it so his soldiers come out in front of you instead of slightly behind you.  SO MANY TIMES, I used my ult and it didn't knock them away.\n\nEDIT: Played some more and I can't quite say what it is exactly, but Azir feels really different.  I normally don't feed out of my rear, but the last 4 games I did were just awful.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-08-22T05:35:04.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the feedback. \nCan you describe to me what exactly is different?
