Its hard to practice top/mid if the bot is pushing a different lane. I don't know if this is possible but it would greatly help those practicing.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T04:24:38.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I believe training only lets you have 1 champ on each team, you can actually add a full team of bots when creating a custom game! Once you add in a full team of opposing bots, they will all pick individual lanes as if it were a real game.","replies":[]}]}
