However, that doesn't mean that topic is necessarily better than one that's only three hours old. And with the current appearance, that three hour old topic may never get its chance to be the \"best\" because nobody ever sees it by default.\r\n\r\nA great example of the issue with having topics that are months and months old as the \"best\" is in the \"Gameplay & Strategy\" community. I'm sure we can all agree that the game has changed quite a lot in the past five months. Yet when I meandered over there... multiple topics on the front page were five months old. How are topics on gameplay and strategy that are so outdated considered to be the best? Live Balance and esports also seem to have an issue of older topics frequently being the best - whether or not they're still relevant. The number one topic in esports? How do people think Cloud 9 will do in the S3 worlds.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if there was some sort of ratio of upvotes compared to time since the thread was created to allow older topics to fall down the list of \"best\" and newer topics to rise to the top.\r\n\r\nThis does fall in a similar pattern as the threads which point out the difficulty of garnering visibility if you are late to a discussion as well - but is more expansive to the overall relevancy of the original post. And it could potentially stagnate the community as the casual browser will always see the same old topics and presume the official \"forums\" are dead. (That was my initial thought on those sub-communities.)","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-02-04T20:16:41.969+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It'd be nice if there was some sort of ratio of upvotes compared to time since the thread was created to allow older topics to fall down the list of \"best\" and newer topics to rise to the top.\n\nThis is how the \"Hot\" filter works.","replies":[{"poster":"Minehead","date":"2014-02-04T22:57:30.403+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although this is how the \"Hot\" filter works, perhaps more in-depth filters would be useful such as 'Best: All Time', 'Best:Year', 'Best: Month' etc. \n\nI know it's not really necessary but it could be a useful feature in particular circumstance that wouldn't be too hard to implement (I think :3)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-02-06T13:03:08.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This is how the \"Hot\" filter works.\n\n~~i´ve only got a best and a resent filter?~~\nEdit ok nvm, there´s a hot filter for threads, but not for disscussion/posts.\n\nBut i think the OP really hits the trouble i see in this system aswell, it´s very hard to join in discussions later on while some 1-3day old posts already have 100+upvotes and the thread isn´t that much frequented anymore. I feel People don´t tend to read the recent posts then in all it´s lenghts/at all, and posts that join in late won´t get near as much upvotes ever, even if they´re exceptional in their quality. So i think the System is somewhat toxic to ongoing discussions, only ok-ish for mayflies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Luck","date":"2014-02-05T21:45:42.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. I did not know this as I'm not a redditor and have no clue how the system works. I just came onto this beta, looked at some of the sub communities and realized all the posts I saw were extremely old. I then found the option to change and went to most recent.\n\nThe difference of \"Hot\" versus \"Best\" does not seem readily apparent to me - as I lack the context of frequenting similar sites.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-02-05T20:02:13.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, so, very ironically you may want to check your claim. Using some of my experience and some time I actually have a post (A guide of all things) that *just* broke into the top 10 of G&S in less than a day.\n\nPlease don't take that as boasting, I'm just using it as an example that it's less the system not allowing the posts to rise but the viewers simply gravitating towards specific subjects. All posts undergo the same trials and the current bests had to go through the same thing other posts did. Does that mean the best category is immune to sensationalism and trends? No. But with a little time and effort it is possible for a post to get to the top still.","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Luck","date":"2014-02-05T22:02:20.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prior to asking me to \"check my claim\" please note the time stamp on your post compared to mine. I congratulate you on reaching the front page of the best category, but your post is 22 hours old at the time of this posting. That was more recent then my \"claim\" was made. I did happen to take a screenshot if you need me to prove the validity of my \"claim\". I'd be happy to upload it if you need verification.\n\nThat aside, I am glad that you can break into the best category with newer posts. It is nice to know that people can still reach the \"best\" level of posts.\n\nHowever, whether or not an individual can reach the best isn't the core of my issue that I had with the system.\n\nFirst of all, it can create a snowball effect. It's at the top of the list so casual viewers are more likely to see it and thus more likely to upvote it potentially. This reaffirms its position at the top of the list meaning that in the future more casual people will be able to see it, et cetera.\n\nThe second issue is the relevancy of \"best\" topics in a dynamically changing game such as League. As I used in my example, the number one best topic in esports is asking how people think Cloud 9 will do (future tense) in the World Championship for season 3. Given how long ago this topic was relevant it seems really strange to me that it would be considered the absolute best topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-02-05T22:56:30.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My apologies, I had really meant \"re-check\" my phone's spellcheck got me there. I was aware my post had been after yours, I meant no offense.\n\nAs for the \"reign\" of the Best topics, yes them being at the top does increases exposure and chance of upvoting, but downvoting chance increases as well, especially for an outdated post. A lot of these posts were tackled by trends and rushes of specific audiences following a link (ala Sion Relaunch Thread) and the small devoted community can't really stabilize a sudden surge of upvotes like that easily. Personally I feel it's more of a problem of a small community that will lessen over time due to the Beta tag. Not necessarily the Beta itself.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Josephd55","date":"2014-02-05T02:17:53.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:84}}","replies":[]}]}
