With the recent changes to his (W) it has completely ruined what the champ was made to do. This change has made him into a burst mage and less of a control and kite mage with the new cool-down on his (W). This new ability takes away the skill to master a very unique champ that focuses on kiting and positioning, and turns him into a \"blow all abilities at once and hopes he has enough ap to kill\".\r\n\r\nThe issue with his early harassment was a issue and needed to be addressed, but in my opinion this was not the right fix. So below is my way how they should go about Asol\r\n\r\nMake his (W) kinda like Kayle passive. Asol thematic is that he is this big dragon that can create planets and expand the universe (kinda like how his q works), and you can expand on this. \r\n\r\nWhen you put 1 point in your \"W\":    it works how it currently is with the short duration of range and has cool-down. Remove the increased speed on it\r\nWhen you put 3 points in your \"W\":  it turns into the old Asol \"W\" and has the constant toggle and no cool-down unless hit by cc.\r\nWhen you put 5 points into your \"W\": It gets the increase ball speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should fix the issue of early harassment to some extent but its still possible. If it becomes an issue where Asol is rushing his 3 points into \"w\" too fast, they can always make it so you have to have two points into q before 3rd point into \"w\" (kinda like how yummi works.) It also expands on his thematic of constantly expanding the universe.\r\n\r\nSo I would love to hear feedback, maybe even get a word from a rioter on what they think about it. \r\n\r\nTLDR: combine both the old Asol \"W\" and new \"W\" \r\n\r\nThank you for reading and hope to hear from others :D.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-04T02:21:35.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turning him into a late-game abomination.\n\nThere is no way to combine both.","replies":[]}]}
