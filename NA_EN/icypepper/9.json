From \"dive the carry\" to \"protect the carry\" to Stephen King&#039;s Carrie, this guy is up front and center. While assassin victims go from a hundred to zero faster than Hell freezing over, this guy melts towers faster than steel memes. \n\nThis guy keeps teams together, he&#039;s the guy who makes everyone look good. If he/she (let&#039;s not leave out the ladies of league) is amazing, you&#039;ll be making labels and/or LP faster than CertainlyT inventing a new guitar solo (g-get it?). If they&#039;re shitty at what they do, everyone&#039;s going to be facepalming and/or clawing their eyes out. Nothing tanks a band faster than a bad lead guitar.\n\n**Support**\n\n*Bass Guitar*\n\nhttps://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwvrvzzprT1r5ea5ko1_500.gif\n\nThis guy gets a lot of grief, barely any of the credit, and almost none of the bitches thanks to his job: making the lead guitarist look good so he can get less, more, and all of it. Sometimes. Other times you get that one god bass guitarist that causes earthquakes across the globe as people drop their underwear (why is it always the underwear? Why don&#039;t people drop, I don&#039;t know, their shoes or something?) faster than I can complete this sentence. \n\n**Jungler**\n\n*Drummer*\n\nhttp://31.media.tumblr.com/683b52e592926fbe66a885092699437c/tumblr_mw7egcihSI1rzqkj9o2_400.gif\n\nThis guy keeps everyone&#039;s shit together. No matter what instrument you play, percussion keeps the beat so you can too. The knot that ties every string together. The dad of the team. Christmas or whatever family holiday you find most appealing and/or believe in because I don&#039;t discriminate. Blah blah blah, this guy holds everyone who is separated, together.\n\nThe beat can be everywhere at once. The beat can be focused so one instrument in particular looks good. The drummer does it all.\n\n**Mid Lane**\n\n*Lead Singer*\n\nhttp://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m39cp9N6h11qaus67o6_250.gif\n\nLike the lead guitarist, but flashier. Sure, the lead guitar can have those cool guitar solos, but have you heard what amazing singers sound like? If your favorite artist is Justin Bieber or some boy band I&#039;ve never heard of, then no you have not.\n\n[Here&#039;s what real music sounds like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuYeHPFR3f0)\n\nA good lead singer will have fans screaming your band&#039;s name, and sometimes the singer too. The band doesn&#039;t always have to perform well, but some good vocals will touch the hearts of fans everywhere.\n\n**Top Lane**\n\n*Lead Singer*\n\nhttp://38.media.tumblr.com/4105b219b0cadee30f7bf9f4f36e21ec/tumblr_nh9kwszGDH1t89rpeo1_400.gif\n\nWait, no, the top laner is not an anime girl.\n\n{{champion:92}} \n\nI stand corrected.\n\nhttp://25.media.tumblr.com/f00136ad7a07fd178887dfd49008cadd/tumblr_mkcllhJOdd1rs6skro1_500.gif\n\nSometimes he&#039;s the guy telling everyone what to do... despite, you know, not even contributing at all. Sometimes he&#039;s the heart of the band, showing up when he&#039;s needed most to lift everyone&#039;s spirits and keep shit organized (and protecting your PR, and your future). Sometimes under-appreciated, sometimes despicable, but several bands have one anyway.\n\n.\n\nSo what do teams look like to you?","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-07-29T16:23:32.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't the support be the roadie?","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-07-30T09:19:02.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, uh, close.
