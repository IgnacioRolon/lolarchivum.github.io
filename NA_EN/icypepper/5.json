You most definitely should roam if doing so is a net gain for your team, or not doing so would be a net loss for your team. Like, if I roam mid real quick and force a kill, tower, back, or prevent those things from happening to us, and my adc is smart enough to not die, then its totally worth. \n\nEzreal is an example of an ADC where you would almost certainly be looking for opportunities to roam as a support. He's safe, can easily farm under pressure, and has relatively little kill pressure in lane anyway so there isn't much opportunity cost to roaming. \n\nI probably would be very hesitant to roam if my adc was Kogmaw or twitch on the other hand because thats just asking for them to get dove and killed.\n\nObviously you will tend to spend most of your time in the bot lane, but there are definitely times you should be roaming.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-04-20T15:42:00.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, all the this.\n\nA support is no the ADC's Slave, they're a support for the whole team, something Flame of Passion either doesn't seem to get, or wants to make sure all supports are his bitches.","replies":[{"poster":"Flame of Passion","date":"2016-04-20T16:28:07.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Im a girl, and supports aren't maids they are SUPPORTS if you roam and leave bot and your ADC dies early game that is your fault. your job is to SUPPORT to heal to keep your team living most defiantly the weak ass ADC and if you aren't doing that than or dont intend to do that then don't pick support! \n\nIf mid is getting 1v2 the jungler will come he IS the roamer and the ganker, let the jungler handle it don't gank for mid if you are support i would understand if it was a 2v4 then you go and help! supports are the doctors they heal and help champions!\n\nI mainly play support and ADC","replies":[{"poster":"Arcticblast","date":"2016-04-20T18:18:23.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) idk what being a girl has to do with any of this\n2) \"support\" doesn't mean \"ADC's ride or die\" it means \"support;\" you should be looking for opportunities to support the entire team\n3) yeah just put everything on the jungler's back, that's why you lost because the jungler was farming when he should have been counterganking even though the support didn't ward the river!\n4) Braum can't exactly heal the ADC\n5) {{champion:432}} chimes bro\n\nsorry for unorganized response","replies":[{"poster":"Flame of Passion","date":"2016-04-20T19:30:20.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

It can also secure mid lane kills and objectives. It requires your adc not being garbage and being able to make smart choices. Most adc's tunnel vision on cs and don't see anything else. I don't blame them. CSing isn't always easy when you're also watching for a gank, looking for an in on your opposing duo and being wary of enemy initiation. But if you just killed bot lane and the jungler is top then you can bet your butt I am roaming mid.\n\nSupports should roam. They just should.
