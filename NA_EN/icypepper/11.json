Moments when the enemy is at 1 hp and *just* outside your autoattack range and not a spell will reach it. Your well is dried up. You're having a dry spell. You're having a premature #LCSBIGPLAYS flashing in your eyes. Thirst, baby, and now it's time to learn how to handle it.\r\n\r\n1. Take a deep breath. You're level 3. Your flash is gone because of a jungler gank, but you see him in another lane so it's okay. But now is not the time to tower dive.\r\n\r\n2. Catch some cs while you're alone. I mean, 18 cs is like a kill, right? Get that advantage, then recall and get some items while you have the gold advantage.\r\n\r\n3. If you're in bot lane, give your support a hug. Not only will this calm your nerves, but your support will feel appreciated for forcing the enemy to retreat. And if your support is someone like {{champion:37}} or {{champion:44}} , she'll/he'll be able to manage your thirst just fine.\r\n\r\n4. If you're mid, consider blue buff. Ask your jungler so you can get that one last spell in your next utter kill combo. If he/she says yes, let 'em take the small monsters at the camp while you take the buff. Junglers love it when you leave them a little gold for their trouble (make sure they're actually there, though, otherwise just kill them so the buff can respawn).\r\n\r\n5. If you're top, you're probably always thirsty on that island. Consider roaming to mid and lending a hand.\r\n\r\n6. If you're the jungler, just take some jungle creeps or minion tax while you're there. If you're in their jungle, consider stealing a few camps or dropping a ward here and there.\r\n\r\n7. Contemplate your life, and your gameplay. *Is it worth it?* *Is my worth really valued in a KDA score?* *Why is bacon so crispy yet delicious?* Shake your head as you realize you've been staring at your Sejuani jungler, and envisioning her with an apple in her mouth covered in ba—\r\n\r\n8. Take an objective.\r\n\r\n9. Call your mother/father/uncle/sister/hot cousin/former roommate to distract you from your thirsty thoughts. Tell them about your day. Let them know how much you love them. Consider buying them a gift, or if you hate them and want to ruin their life/marriage then introduce them to League.\r\n\r\n10. Get off your computer, head to the kitchen, and grab a bottle of water. Damn, honey, you're *thirsty.* Satisfy that thirst!","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-03-19T14:23:25.518+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:121}} \n\nBut if I can just get... that... **reset**.\nhttp://38.media.tumblr.com/5aabc7d12d5752791be65dfad88626d1/tumblr_my30huER1M1st18yzo1_500.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Robert Smith","date":"2015-03-19T20:08:39.462+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:55}}","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-03-19T20:44:57.533+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"No.\n\nKat needs to die every time.
