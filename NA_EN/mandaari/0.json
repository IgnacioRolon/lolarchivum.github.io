All of her abilities excluding her ultimate have strong damage components.\r\n* Kalista's ability to kite is much more reliable and **actually works against the dashes that the vast majority of champions have**. She both has a gap creator *and* a slow, albeit not a permaslow.\r\n* Kalista's Sentinel is on a lower cooldown, two of them can exist, and they're much more reliable for use as a passive warning system.\r\n* Kalista's ultimate keeps her Oathsworn safe, bypasses a front line, immediately sets itself up for follow up, has a shorter cooldown, and **cannot be cleansed**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe reason anyone competitively picks Ashe is for her utility, yet Kalista fills in that niche in nearly all of the same ways ***and more***.

Ashe's W poke is far stronger than Kalista's Q poke, and I find the global range and lack of cast time on Ashe's ult makes it far easier to use than Kalista's ult as both an initiation and as follow up to an initiation. I also find Ashe's ult is better when you need more immediate peel and disengage, like when a talon or rengar is about to be on top of you, if they aren't already. Kalista's passive is obviously much better at keeping her alive if she can survive the initial dive though. \n\nFor me at least, I still think Ashe is better than Kalista in solo q, and Ashe's higher win rate reflects this. Kalista's full power is just too hard to use in the chaos that is solo queue, especially her ult. Obviously that power has the potential to be devastating as shown in LCS, but this is solo q.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2015-02-09T04:11:06.410+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll agree with the poke, but I don't agree with the rest.

Sure, Being able to throw someone like Annie, Leona, or Alistar in can be amazing, but I'd certainly never want to throw a Nami or Soraka in there. And to me, the fact that Kalista's ult does absolutely no damage cannot be glossed over either. \n\nAs someone who plays both Ashe and Kalista, I find myself preferring Ashe more and more lately. Her ult is just such a good asset in solo q where people lean towards picking low utility, high damage champions {{champion:238}}. Being able to just force a play from a safe range is so huge in solo q where people just don't know how push a lead or end a game. I also find that I get alot more gold on average with Ashe with similar performances, simply because of her E passive and the fact that get a guaranteed assist on nearly every kill once teamfights start.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-02-09T19:00:59.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> never want to throw a Nami \n\nPersonally supports like Nami and Sona are some of my favorite to combo with Kalista (when you don't *need* a tank) because Kalista's ult perfectly sets up Sona/Nami's ults without putting them in much danger. On top of that someone ranged like Nami/Sona would be able to proc the %hp damage more often, and both Nami/Sona have AA buffs on top of that harass. A melee tank like Braum/Leona while they might set up a good initiation, aren't praticularly great at proccing her passive unless it's in an all in. Thresh is iffy on how capable he is at proccing it. Since he is ranged he can get that devstating poke off with his Flay + Kali passive, but when thrown into a team he doesn't really have the same good follow up that a Leona, Braum, Nami, Sona, Janna would have. He could throw a hook, they aren't really in Ult range and actually he gets displaces *outside* of his flay range (AA range 450, Flay range 800 but it's actually 400 in each direction)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2015-02-09T05:39:15.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind Kalista's ult places you at your max auto attack range, so it's not like whoever you throw is now stuck in their team. Nami can easily follow up with a bubble or wave, both of which can finish casting before Kalista's CC ends. Soraka though... definitely not a great pick. Still , just don't pick Soraka with her. Kalista has the liberty of not working well with only a few supports without CC. Ashe has the requirement that her team needs to be built around her entirely. You need to bring those high damage champions to make up for Ashe. Kalista brings the damage herself.\n\nI think Kalista's lack of ult damage is more than made up for in the rest of her kit. It's just not burst. Though I'll agree that someone who hasn't played with Kalista and/or someone who isn't in their lane partner's mind can have a hard time landing the ult, but that's more the player than the champion.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-02-09T18:41:35.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista can't assassinate/1v1 like Ashe can.\n\n{{champion:22}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3172}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3035}} 26 (cdr)-1-3 (ms), 15% scaling cdr\n\nThis build order (changed situationally):\n\n{{item:3031}} > {{item:3006}} >{{item:3087}} > {{item:3035}} >{{item:3078}} > {{item:3134}} > {{item:3172}}  (sell boots) > {{item:3142}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-09T19:48:09.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She very much can.\n\nLategame all she needs is maybe 3-4 spears into a target and then she can e them for the kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-02-09T19:55:27.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But she can't do those 3-4 spears while her opponent is stunned, like ashe can.
