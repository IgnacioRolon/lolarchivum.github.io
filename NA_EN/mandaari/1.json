They are matched against other new players, NOT SMURFS. \nLet's say you have a friend, he plays for the first time. First 5 levels (coop) work as a placement matches. When he finally gets level 5 he's given MMR that compliments his skill against bots. This MMR doesn't change by playing against bots, only against/with real players. It changes VERY rapidly until level 10, based on game performance, so even if smurf tried to cheat the system and play terribly against bots, he would get boosted up very quickly.\n\nThis means new players won't see much smurfs, and if they do, these smurfs are just terrible (i mean bronze 5 terrible). But there's one slight problem. If you try to play with your friend together, his MMR (say 0-300) and yours (1500+) are calculated together and you face enemies with your skill level. If you manage to win and carry that friend, one game is enough to give him like +500 MMR, just because he's low level and he won against superior players. This means he will be seeing very skilled people and smurfs often.\n\nYou can check this normal MMR on pages like Op.GG and such, i couldn't believe what happened to my noob friend's MMR after i played with him...\nOh, and this matchmaking works very well... i was sitting at ~2400 MMR with my smurf since level 20, and i've been regulary playing with/against people with plat/dia/master borders (Meaning they're level 30 and very skilled). Also even in normal blind pick, queue times take up to 20 minutes for this smurf of mine. My \"noobish\" friend falled down to like 500 MMR and he can find games pretty much instantly, with queue times not longer than 30 seconds.\n\nEdit: one last thing, MMR gains/loses MIGHT be affected by your mastery grade after a game. I've noticed im gaining like 30-40% more MMR when i go S-/S/S+. But that's not confirmed, just a thing i noticed. What IS confirmed is you can GAIN MMR is you LOSE but did very well (S grades) and lose MMR when you win but you got totally carried (Think C and lower)","replies":[{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-02-19T18:52:24.850+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">New player experiece is pretty good tho.

We're talking about a company that finds it hard to believe that advertising that there are three champs they can get for free by following them on Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter and get them easy skins. \n\nEven with this limited amount of money, they always come though. They took the time and resources to make Dominion for us, and allow us the privilege of free RP for playing a tournament we have to win in order to get said amount. They even made a separate map of ARAM, with completely new turrets and everything.\n\nIts also unfair to call them cheap, not when they have to take time to get ready for the LC$ and other events. They finally have a shop open for awesome shirts, knick-knacks, posters, and more. And when you want to be fancy, you can spend some money on a better (or rare) look for you favorite champion (before the meta picks a new one for you).\n\nLuckily we get to play a free game, and have the option to buy champions out of Influence Points. And look how colorful the whole cast is. We have weirdos, freaks, heroes, a king, a demon, and even a talking fish. All you have to do is play for years to earn and unlock them, or play them whenever they might be free. Oh, and if you want to buy a champion on sale, you can buy them for a cheaper amount of real world cash money. Half off.\n\nAnd when you finally decide to get Runes, you are tricked into buying lots of Runes you'll never use again after you get better ones from the next teir up. And be sparing with how you use them, because you only have 2 free sheets at first. Spend a extra 6,300 IP for other 18 when you feel like it.\n\nDon't worry that Season 1, 2, and some of season 3 have everything and say it doesn't mean anything, because they're right. Its seriously okay to not have the full champion line-up, nor is it necessary to have any Rune to use for Ranked. If you are a completionist, make sure that your computer is top notch because this game takes a lot out of computers. Battle away for possibly moths at a time. Try and somehow win around 12 matches a day to earn around 1,000 IP a day. Then by about 800 days later, unless Riot has a double or quadruple IP week or something, you'll have the whole champion pool. Then, you can start on your Runes, which will take about another 400 days or so, getting only teir three and the Runes pages. Don't worry, though. Its a free game.

Saving up may take awhile, but they get to learn a few basics, maybe save up for a 4800 or 3150 champ, and if they don't like them they can refund and get another when they have enough.  The only problem is that most new people don't know just how limited 3 refunds is, which is why I would suggest giving people 1 refund that refreshes after use over three or four days until they hit level 10 or buy something with RP, at which point they get the standard three.
