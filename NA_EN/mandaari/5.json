I really hate items that give champions new abilities, but this is way over the line and a marathon in the wrong direction. Riot, have you ever realized that a desirable aspect of low mobility champions is their low mobility? It&#039;s fun to play champions that you need to position perfectly with and that _aren&#039;t_ flashy. It wouldn&#039;t matter if this item was perfectly balanced, I&#039;m personally not interested in adding dashes to anyone&#039;s kit. I&#039;m not interested in a game where Ekko is going to get yet another dash in his arsenal, and I&#039;m especially not interested in a game where Orianna is going to get a single dash in hers.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of a dash (blink) everyone already has: Flash. Flash has been in the game since alpha and early on in League there were pleas to get rid of it before it was too late. Well, it&#039;s _way_ too late and now everyone is balanced around flash. You tried to justify that by saying you wanted everyone to be able to quickly reposition. Flash already serves the proposed purpose of HRB. We don&#039;t want or need another flash. Honestly you should be looking at ways to globally reduce mobility, not add more.\r\n\r\nWhat I really can&#039;t believe is that you even tried to justify a change like this by saying that APs need a way to opt into flashier combat patterns. Get that BS back to the LC$ brainstorm board and then just light the board on fire.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-04-07T17:36:41.428+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":21,"body":"It's a 30 second cooldown Vayne tumble.\nI wouldn't be shocked if Annie was the only one that bought it.
