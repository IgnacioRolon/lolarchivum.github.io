Every time I play and I open the shop, it takes up about 85% of my game screen and I can barely see anything. Not to mention, when I open the shop, that's when it also gives me more into on my champ... For Example: Champ Health regen per second, current Magic Pen, current Armor pen, Lethality info, etc. (It pops up right above your stats for your champ but its hiding behind the Shop popup screen.) Can we please have an option for that in the Options menu? I would like to check or uncheck it as an option... not only appear when you open the shop. Please Riot? Made the screen adjustable for the in-game shop.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T19:20:14.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you recently change resolution or monitors?  Your configuration settings may not be updating properly or has become corrupt and giving you oversized screens.  Try performing a config reset to see if that will fix up your in-game shop:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"JuannyBear","date":"2017-05-01T04:43:15.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply.

I deleted the files you mentioned, but the In-game Shop window still takes up a lot of space. :(","replies":[]}]}]}
