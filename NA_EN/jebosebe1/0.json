I wanted to buy Lucian, had enough IP and so i bought it. Did not receive champion but my IP went gone. Checked my purchase history and it shows that T bought that lucian but I can't play him and he doesn't show up in my champ list. (no, its not because he's black on black background) what do i do now except contacting support (I did already, didnt get respond).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T02:54:28.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and checked out your account and what the heck did that store do?! I see where you bought ol' Luce, but for whatever angsty reason he refused to go into your account. I gave him a little nudge and it looks like he's heading your way now, but go ahead and let those agents in your ticket know what was going on so that they can start tracking it!","replies":[]}]}
