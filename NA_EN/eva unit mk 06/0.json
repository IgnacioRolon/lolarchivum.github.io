I've recently noticed that with only 99 ping that I get the attempting to reconnect error w/o having internet issues. This bug goes deeper than just forcing us to reload, its probably bugging out the system and determines that were D/C when we are infact still connected. Really odd.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LegitMatthew","date":"2014-10-26T03:46:34.286+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is anyone else experiencing a bug as the following?\n\nAt random in game for the last several days or so I will seemingly d/c and get the \"Attempting to Reconnect\". It never reconnects or if it does it would apparently take quite some time to do so (having waited 5+ minutes).\n\nThe problem is that it is not on my end. No one else in my match seems to d/c or at most one other person maybe (not premade). My ping is a stable 80 and doesn't spike and during the incident every time I can alt+tab and do a speed test, freely user the internet, browse the forums to see if there are any issues from others at the time or even talk in the Adobe Air client to friends.\n\nUpon simply quiting the game and then \"Reconnect\" from the Adobe client I can get in freely without any abnormal wait (vs the never actually reconnecting in game issue). The issue may occur multiple times in a game with the exact same results and a quit->Reconnect fixes it instantly until the issue occurs again (sometimes 2-3x in a 30+ minute match). It is never able to reconnect on its own and my internet is always fine despite the connection issue in game nor do I experience any lag in game.\n\nHas anyone else had this issue?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PuissantPike","date":"2014-10-25T16:14:59.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having this problem also, I first noticed it around the release of 4.18.  Same thing, my ping in game and my internet connection will be fine, and then all of a sudden the game freezes up and I disconnect.  I get the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" message, but no matter how long I wait it never does.  However, like some here have said, if I manually leave the game and then reconnect it joins up no problem, until 10 minutes later when I disconnect again.  My internet isn't the issue; my Skype call never gets dropped and I can still access webpages online.
