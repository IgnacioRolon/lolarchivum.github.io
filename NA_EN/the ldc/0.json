Generally I would say baron is \"harder\" to get in that your team is more vulnerable while doing it. \n\nBaron buff provides a longer lasting impact on the game. The buff itself is longer, and he gives the team a hefty chunk of gold to invest in items. Elder dragon, on the other hand, lasts for a short amount of time so the team using it is highly pressured to do something with it less it gets totally wasted, as I don't think it gives any gold for killing it. Elder dragon's usefulness also varies drastically depending on if your team has been keeping up on nabbing drags throughout the game. \n\nI would say that with no dragons baron is much better, but with 3+ drags then elder is more valuable of an objective. This is likely intended, so I am personally happy about where the epic monsters are at.","replies":[{"poster":"The LDC","date":"2016-07-17T09:14:30.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ehh I know  where your coming from but idk why they make elder take so much longer to get than baron in my opinion I've seen much more people lose games because doing elder drags take a long while then baron is much more easy to get bc baron has a lot less health and armor than elder drag","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-07-17T09:20:07.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although elder dragon takes more time to do, the team is also pretty healthy afterwards, meaning that they can immediately move to take objectives. Teams clearing baron often have to go back to base afterwards and regroup, so I think the clearing time is a little less of a factor than you make it out to be.\n\nThey wanted it to take longer because they wanted to introduce an epic monster that wasn't just a baron reskin. there is contrast between the fights beyond what the buffs afterwards give.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
