Probably not.\n\nSlight touch-ups IF they're too weak? Likely.\n\nGenerally speaking, Riot seems to be moving assassins away from being able to kill everyone indiscriminately, and make them more focused towards actually hunting down and killing squishies.\n\nAD assassins will probably be in a decent spot once the dust settles. They're losing the current core build, with the early power spike of Brutalizer and the all-purpose power of Last Whisper, but get better AD items in return, like the redone Ghostblade, the access to cheap, offensive CdR in Caulfield's Warhammer without the draught of useful upgrades Brutalizer had afterwards, get a sustain option that covers their abilities and auto-attacks, get a more powerful anti-AP option in Maw, a more offensively tooled Black Cleaver, Executioner's Calling as an option against that pesky Lifesteal of ADCs...\nAP assassins will be hurt a bit more, with the general increase in MR. However, AP assassins now get the option to snowball the game right out of the gates with the new Dark Seal - you'll never want to die against that LeBlanc, like, ever.","replies":[{"poster":"DogIsGod","date":"2015-11-01T11:21:28.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've got some great points and I totally agree with you. I don't think the changes will go through as they are right now and Riot will fine-tune the champions and the items, but I would still love to see a major rework being done for assassins and mages which will probably happen in the near future. Champions like Talon, Anivia, Heimer etc, these are just a few examples of outdated champions. They are not in any shape or form weak currently, but they could use a little bit of help, either in the visuals category or maybe a gameplay update.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-11-01T11:42:02.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now, that is certainly true.

Oh, I hope you're joking... I truly hope you're joking. I'm like, sitting here praying that you're joking...\n\nAD Assassins have Youmuu's and Death's Deal, plus Cleaver is now a better item for them whereas AP Assassins are being allowed to start with a Doran's Ring that turn into a Mejai's, plus it starts the stacks on top of those stacks being transferred to the MSS when you upgrade it. MSS is also only losing 8 stacks on death while you get 8 per kill. Trust me, AP Assassins can comfortably buy even just the first ring and get snowball stats to sell after they've died once or twice.\n\nAssassins are so well off it's not even funny... The RoA+Archangel mages also got buffed since RoA has 20 AP more base while the ruby and sapphire crystals are more slot efficient.","replies":[]}]}
