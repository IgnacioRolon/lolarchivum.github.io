No counterplay nothing it gets applied and you just going to have to deal with it period.\n\nI can understand true damage as a flat amount on powerfull spells adequate cost be it cooldown mana etc. But not too much of it in the game. It has been getting more and more abundant which is bad.\n\nStealth is the runner up, not ebcause its always op, This depends on other factors of a champion too. But it is fucking annoying to deal with especially now that vision has been gutted, well at least the measn of detecting stealth by removing pink trinket.\n\nA good third is hyper mobility, you know like Riven has, it removes strategic thinking and decision making. Its pretty much i go ham when i please and if it doesnt work out well then ill just gtfo. It pretty much puts all other champions in a reactive position. For example, Shen has balanced mobility, Riven does not. Low cooldown on 4 dashes  it makes it so only you decide when a fight happens meaning you can always opt out of it but the opponent never can.
