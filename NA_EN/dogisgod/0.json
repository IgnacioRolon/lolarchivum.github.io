I played Yasuo three times today and if I were to give a rating of reproduction it'd be 10/10. It seems to happen if you use your ultimate then try to AA without using any other spell. It seems to work fine if you E or Q and then AA, but if you just try to AA it doesn't seem to work.\nI hope that's enough to get you going.\n[This guy](https://youtu.be/3pmO_qfcx1A) seems to have it recorded.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-09-02T06:15:01.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope, not helpful.

Which he can't. Because his target is dead. So you have to wait for the duration to wear off or use another ability to reset him.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blackridah","date":"2015-09-02T06:52:45.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright I'm getting it to happen now at 1.5 attack speed, lvl 3 ult using the steps above.

Use Q tornado on target champion\n2. aa target\n3. ult target\n4. Don't click on target again yasuo should automatically continue aaing his target (my automatic autoattack option is off)\n5. See that Yasuo pauses around 1 second before resuming aaing.\n\nThis doesn't happen everytime, sometimes he will immediately resume aaing after ult.\n\nHere's my final build, runes and masteries if necessary.\n\nhttp://tinypic.com/r/149tb4o/8\nhttp://tinypic.com/r/1zpjqm8/8\nhttp://tinypic.com/r/25ja6q0/8","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackridah","date":"2015-09-02T06:31:12.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this has happened to me a few times, try doing a q knockup, followed by aa, followed by ult, then try to aa after.
