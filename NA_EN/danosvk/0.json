I have never had problems with countering any hero until now. I tried everything. He uses abilities 24/7, their dmg is huge. Full armor build did nothing, he still nuked me. And ulti? He ended up with full hp in 3v1 fight against us under out own turret (in late game), means we just couldnt kill him in teamfight and game was unwinnable just because of him. What to do against this brainless champ? Thanks for any USEFUL advices.

So I know what to look for. I usually can just walk away from first q by walking into him, then if he w I will q dodge the next q and aim for a mark. Then if I’m still being pulled I’ll w because he’ll usually throw the last q. So you can stun him and go all in. \n\nSo Aatrox q1 (I walk into him to avoid knock up), Aatrox w (either dodge or if I eat it) Aatrox q2 ( use my q to hit point, he will usually have one and I’ll be close enough), Aatrox w pull or q3(I w to stun him). Then I go all in especially if I have ult.","replies":[{"poster":"DanoSvK","date":"2019-06-27T07:51:20.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was planning to try fiora, thanks for these advices.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2DEMONIC2","date":"2019-06-28T11:38:23.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 champ can kill aatrox  for me JAX,FIORA,TRYNDAMIRE","replies":[]},{"poster":"SurgicalStriker","date":"2019-06-26T15:37:19.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"grievous wounds hurts his self-healing a lot.

That's huge part of the issue. I am pretty confifent at my rank on my lane, but there is nothing i can do. Freezing lane won't help, he still farms enough and at some point he just easily kills me under turret with or, in some cases, even without his jungler.

Make sure to play around his cool downs. Aatrox has huge cool downs now after the recent changes. If you see him use W to farm a creep, that W won't be back up for like 20 seconds. Fight him when he spends his abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"DanoSvK","date":"2019-06-26T15:55:23.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats good advice. I tried using jax but it didn't go well because early aatrox relies on his abilities which aren't blocked by jax' E. I tried sion but aatrox dmg is just too big, my shield was useless.

Grievous wounds are a must. \n\nWatch for his power spikes at level 6 level 9 and when he finishes death's dance. Other than that stick to banning him if he is the only match-up you are not sure how to play into.","replies":[{"poster":"DanoSvK","date":"2019-06-26T15:57:49.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. The best thing would be some hero with strong early like rene but at the same time someone who scales mucgh better later in game than rene. Maybe taking a mage with huge range like xerath would be good or some other mage who cant keep him on one place like lux? Can't see any melee fighter defeating him early and scale better later.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Noodle Wacker","date":"2019-06-26T15:48:03.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally when going against him I'd play {{champion:17}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:54}}.
