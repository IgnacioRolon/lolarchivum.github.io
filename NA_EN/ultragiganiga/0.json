When champion select ends and the game is about to load, it sends me back to the client and shows the reconnect button. When I press the reconnect button, it says \"Game already in progress\" for about half a second and then the reconnect button reappears and this loops on forever. There is a glitch I know of where you can't load into the game until everyone else has loaded but this was not the case as I couldn't load in for the entire game. \n\nEDIT: Also the same result for custom games.
