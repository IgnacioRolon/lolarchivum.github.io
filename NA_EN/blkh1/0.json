Before you grab grandma and provide anecdotal evidence to the contrary, just consider that the gateway of payment restricts young players from playing some games without say...getting parents/guardians to pay for it. This means League is populated by players who are literally immature. Attitudes are not set in stone, however being young means the average League player has less years of life experience with gameplay realities like losing, teammates you cannot control, mistakes, etc. Frustration is exactly that, but a young person just has less experience with knowing how to cope. Lashing out at teammates, blaming, pouting and sitting at the fountain because the enemy jungler stole your blue...these are all signs of someone whose coping mechanisms just aren't developed. This is also relevant to communication skills. \"Don't feed\" is not helpful communication. \"If you're under tower and having trouble trading, ping and I'll roam from my lane\" is far more helpful. Taking responsibility for your own mistakes, keeping a positive mindset...these things typically come with experience, and a little maturity.\n\n3) The culture of \"win\" - People like to win, duh. Games require a multitude of things to get the reward of winning. JRPGs for example typically require time. You grind your level past the adequate level, and you can stomp anything. League requires a few variables to be in your favor to assure victory, and many of them are RNG or luck of the draw. You can pick your teammates perhaps, but you can't cherry-pick your opponents. You also cannot directly control all the decisions your own team makes. Just because you say \"fall back!\" doesn't mean a teammate might see an opportunity you don't, and go for it. All this factors into people getting frustrated when they are not winning. Winning seems to be the only value some players see in playing League at all. Forget that you could be learning how to farm better under tower, how to play against a really good Zed player and not feed, or how to manage lane momentum because you've got a jungler who ignores the lanes to farm. If things aren't going ideally, it doesn't mean you can't win, and if you can't win it doesn't necessarily mean the game is a waste of your time. The most common misconception I've observed is that many League players have the delusion they know everything about League, and therefore a game that is not snowballing towards a fast victory (for them) is a waste. If you want to play League, just enjoy the fact that you're playing! Winning is always better than losing, but commit to playing first, then actively _seek out ways to make victory happen._ If you committed to queue up, you should be prepared to fight for victory, not throw in the towel because you might actually have to work collaboratively with 4 other players to win as a team.\n\n4) League/MOBA culture - When someone makes a dingbat play and dies, someone types out \"why?\" in teamchat. That behaviour came from somewhere. That specific phrase is deemed relevant to the situation because of MOBA culture, not because the English language has constructed it that way. A small part of toxicity is due to MOBA culture influencing players to be toxic. Imagine if you just didn't know what it meant to \"feed\". You know all the League mechanics, just not that specific term. It doesn't make you a bad League player...knowing the ins and outs of the jargon, jokes, insults etc will technically not make you a better (mechanically speaking) League player, but it will absolutely make you more effective at being toxic.\n\n5) Riot's game mechanics - The other 4 points feed into this one, but Riot does hold some responsibility for toxic behaviour in League. This shows up in things like the nature of farm and gold accumulation. League is a team game, yet you can actually end up competing with your own team for gold. The fact that you can actually \"steal\" farm from a teammate is not an accident, it's just a gameplay rule that Riot has in place with (unforeseen?) consequences. Other MOBAs have found ways around gold competition by making it collectively shared across the team. I'm not saying the other games are better, but there are certain aspects of League that do not necessarily promote teamwork. Another example is Ranked play and how it is set up. Once a player hits level 30, they can jump right into ranked with incomplete rune pages and exactly zero games played at level 30. Sure, they grinded up to 30 in Normal queue just like everybody else, but they haven't sat at level 30 and played at that level necessarily. Riot allows players who are ill prepared  for ranked to just dive right in. This is frustrating for both experienced players, and the new players who don't understand how ranked is different. Some MOBAs require a minimum number of games to be played before ranked opens up, and for the most part those games have to be played with the **full** set of features. The leveling system incrementally introduces game systems to the player, but it also is a terrible system for preparing a player for high MMR play, or ranked play. The fact that a player is prevented from draft play if they have fewer than 12 champions makes sense. Why is there no check to see that a player has a complete rune page, or at least enough runes in their inventory to complete one? Why is there not a cap of 'games played at level 30' of 50/100/250 before ranked opens up?  These are decisions Riot made, and they do influence player behaviour, although not as much as the previous 4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IWrath","date":"2016-04-05T05:58:52.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna some form of Tribunal come back.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerfallen","date":"2016-04-05T13:39:25.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It _should_ be getting worked on Soonâ¢ according to the last update a Rioter put out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"66191767DEL1","date":"2016-04-06T03:27:52.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot has the means and money to change any aspect of their game they see fit, including their matchmaking and the way reported people are handled, instead they choose to make aesthetic updates and new champions, not even new features.
