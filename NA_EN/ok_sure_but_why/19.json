Its better to have kayn transform and not get bugged out of transformation than let him heal during the animation.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2018-05-02T09:38:06.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More likely they just didn't notice.  I mean Kayn was released almost 10 months ago and this is the first boards post I have seen on the subject.  I highly doubt that the guy/gal who programmed it decided to go and get chunked to 10% HP on their testing server before walking back into fountain to transform.  When testing that sort of thing you usually just set up a simulation that lets you set whichever of his bars you want to max as soon as you load in so that you can quickly test and reiterate.\n\nHonestly I don't get where all this preconception about lazy programmers comes from.  I mean yes, we are lazy.  We tend to take the shortest and easiest way so long as it a) doesn't break things and b) is usable by whomever else may need to work with it, adaptable tools and all that.  Being lazy is basically our job description because the point is to get things working and move on to the next thing.  So long as something seems to be working correctly after trying all the main things then we call it good and pass it along to the people actually in charge of testing.\n\nProgrammers do not go \"Oh, it would be hard to make it heal during that so I wont do it.\"  We might go \"Yes, that issue that you are having is not something I know how to solve, and after talking it over with other members of the team that is not something we can fix without breaking other things.  That means our options are a) remove the first thing or b) remove the second to allow us to add the first thing.\"\n\nAlso considering that healing during stasis is something that champions have been able to do in League for years I doubt it is that, especially since you could hard simulate the healing if needed because you know they are in fountain.\n\nThe chances that none of the testers noticed or didn't think it was worth mentioning are far more likely than someone going \"We don't have the tech to heal him.\"  It is honestly sad how much shit programmers, especially League's, get for missing something that took a million players 10 months to make a thread about that got on the front page.  Sorry that the one guy/gal who was probably in charge of making an animation work missed something so small, they are clearly completely incompetent and don't have the tech to change a champion's health/mana values so they purposely left it in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2018-05-01T19:50:19.479+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"When Kayn completes transformation, he should just be set to full hp and mana, instead of slowly regenerating HP while transforming.
