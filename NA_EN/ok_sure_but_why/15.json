It is typically applied to currency when there is a large amount of it being introduced to an economy. A lot is introduced, making all of it worth less.\n\nWhat you are suggesting would lead to inflated damage in a way. That would mean it would take so much of it to matter that nobody would bother and just go strait tank. That is poorly worded but you get the point.\n\nWhat I think needs to happen is what is happening. Tanks need ways to prevent large amounts of damage for a ahort time. Things like Galio's new W and Braum's shield accomplish this. In the tank rework I am hoping to see more of that.","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-03-23T01:10:41.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's what happened\n\neveryone has a lot of damage, making it all worth less\n\nthe people who win most games build mostly tanky since that's the rarity everyone but adc's are allowed to have","replies":[]}]}]}
