I think this works perfectly.\n\nMy thinking is that breaking it into two- where you play as one while the other supports you- really screams _\"Hunter & Pet\"_ (or something along these lines, in a way) rather than _\"Two parts of the same whole\"_.\nI think that they should be working together at the same time, rather than having one of them become, as _Martensitic_ said, an over-glorified projectile.\n\nThe switching mechanic might have both Lamb and Wolf work in one kit, but I just feel like that, even with whatever synergy that will tie them together, you may never feel like you're playing the duo at the same time.\n\n_However,_ I just thought that, _maybe_ if switching/transforming (whatever you wanna call it) could work, then there's one way of going about that. I'll explain below.\n\n-_-\n\nIn the meantime, I'm gonna try to be creative and think of a possible gameplay concept that fits how I personally see them (with their thematic potential); For now, I have the following, but I'm not sure how I really feel about them- Here goes:\n\n- **Some kind of (said) transforming/switching:** You start out \"as Lamb\" (similarly to how they're being controlle right now), perhaps even with a kit that is at least similar to what they currently have- only with more emphasis on Lamb's arrows rather than Wolf's teeth.\nBut after a few seconds of the enemy fighting back or running away from a fight with the Eternal Hunters, Lamb gives Wolf the permission to chase, and so, (Whether very controllably or less so) you \"switch\" to Wolf as he is unleashed- That might just mean, though, that the temporarily-transformed kit will have simply more emphasis on Wolf, with Lamb still being in the player's control as well.\n - This whole mechanic slightly resembles Gnar's Rage-based transformation to me, and perhaps, for synergy within the kit, Wolf can become more active when interacting in some way with a Marked target.\n\n - What if they had some sort of a \"Flee\" effect that helped activating Wolf in a more controllable way, rather than something Gnar-esque?\n\n\n- **Every ability has TWO casts:** Think that this concept would play similarly to Lee Sin, but in a thematic take that fits Lamb and Wolf- With the first cast being Lamb's swift, calm and subtle arrows, and the second being a much more aggressive, hyper-active and brutal chase by Wolf.\n - Going back to the previous, \"switching/transformation\" gameplay concept- What if the second cast- Wolf's cast- would require something special (more than Mana) to be activated?\nThe enemy fleeing/fighting back for a few seconds, like I mentioned earlier.\nOr maybe something akin to Warwick's Blood Hunt? (Although, that might take away from Warwick.)\nWhat if it had synergy between _that potential something that is like Blood Hunt_ and Mark of the Kindred?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-12T00:31:53.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DwarvenGiant,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=74q4eWk3,comment-id=0001000100010000,timestamp=2017-02-11T14:40:15.407+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, that&#x27;s what I thought they meant.\n> \n> My thinking is that breaking it into two- where you play as one while the other supports you- really screams _&quot;Hunter &amp; Pet&quot;_ (or something along these lines, in a way) rather than _&quot;Two parts of the same whole&quot;_.\n> I think that they should be working together at the same time, rather than having one of them become, as _Martensitic_ said, an over-glorified projectile.\n> \n> The switching mechanic might have both Lamb and Wolf work in one kit, but I just feel like that, even with whatever synergy that will tie them together, you may never feel like you&#x27;re playing the duo at the same time.\n\nLamb and Wolf are a different \"duo\" in a sense that they are not supposed to be a tag-team like Quinn and Valour where the 2 function together as 1, Lamb and Wolf are 1 that function as 2 instead. It was the goal of whoever it was to split themselves into 2 halves so that \"he would always have a friend\", it's thus unreasonable to merge Lamb and Wolf together mechanically because that would be just the same as before the split and thus self-defeating; and instead, they are supposed to be 2 distinct entities that complement each other. Therefore, the best way to work it out is by allowing the player to interchange between controlling Lamb and Wolf, while the unused one is still a support to the one currently in control; and together \"they\" are \"one\" champion called Kindred.\n\nIf you want another example that may or may not support what I was referring to, think about the colour design of Lamb and Wolf. What do you see? Lamb is white who wears a black mask, Wolf is black that wears a white mask; it clearly alludes to concepts like Taiji (the supreme pole/goal) where it's symbolised as one circle that is divided into two distinct halves, the white side has a black dot, and the black side has a white dot, and together they are One.\n\nHence the kit-swap idea similar to Elise and Jayce where you could control either as Lamb supported by Wolf or vice versa since lvl1 is more sounding, as opposed to say the kits similar to say Gnar (the 2 halves are not equal by default, though it is better than what we currently have but it's still not cool) or Lee Sin (2 halves merged back into 1, goes against the theme).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2017-02-11T09:08:09.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would.

In other words it didn't actually offer much but it was a barrier for new players to get past.

It offered quite a bit, really. \n\nIt removed complexity but not needless complexity. It wasn't its own mechanics like Kled or Warwrick's ult.

Needless complexity is bad but so is making something simple for the sake of making it simple. \n\nFor example: The old kindred ult gave you trouble, but do you play the new kindred?

The only time you can't do it anymore is if someone is about to die outside your range and there is another ally between you two.  \n\nLulu ult is primarily a lifesave unless you happen to have something like a Yasuo on your team and are trying to combo.  The slow/knockup happens to be a bonus and unlike Kindred ult the effect is different for whomever you cast it on.  Yes there is an aoe component attached to an ally point and click but it very different from an ult that influences all allies the same and as such doesn't matter who you target with it.\n\nAlso I greatly preferred Kindred with the ult change over the original Kindred.  I found them to be much more streamlined because it felt like a needless mechanic.  The reason I don't play Kindred anymore (beyond not playing a ton of League right now and jungle/ADC being my two worst roles, I picked up kindred as a novelty Kalista is the only ADC I actually enjoy playing) is because they got nerfed into the ground.  For me the ult change felt like a power neutral change.  It was a nerf because you lost some flexibility, but it was also a buff because it streamlined the champion and made their abilities easier to use (Not easier I the sense of easy champion, easier in the sense that the ability didn't feel needlessly complicated while still performing the same role.)\n\nThe old ult only added difficulty to the champion in very rare cases.  However there are two types of difficulty, there is difficulty that adds to gameplay and difficulty that makes it harder to play that game.  Old kindred ult made her harder to use without actually adding to her gameplay at all.  An example would be if you had to solve a puzzle to use Taric's ult.  Sure, it adds difficulty, but it doesn't actually add to the gameplay, it hinders it.  In the same way Kindred ult only offered gameplay that it doesn't offer now in very rare and niche situations, while it hindered gameplay much more often.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-02-10T10:55:59.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Soooo.....\nIf I'm inting, I can prevent the transformation to wolf?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2017-02-11T15:44:44.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many times i'll need to repeat?

Yeah. I love them half to death. They're my second fav champion. Right now, a lot of her power is budgeted in her passive and ult that it just crowds out anything else they could have done. I would prefer if they just scrapped the ult and made wolf a pet. \n\nPlaying Greymane from Hots feels more like Kindred than the current Kindred do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Langhof","date":"2017-02-10T18:42:17.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like kindred ult is just extremely underwhelming now, due to things such as redemption and taric ult.
