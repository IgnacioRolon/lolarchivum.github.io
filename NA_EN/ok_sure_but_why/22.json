If it's giving you negative feelings or has encompassed your whole life, you may want to consider finding other outlets for entertainment.\n\nYou're allowed to be upset by trolls. What's not allowed is retaliation, and this is spelled out in the terms of service. Your actions are your own, whether you were defending yourself or not. It's best to mute and move on...don't let them upset you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rythmatic","date":"2019-01-12T23:57:45.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Been going downhill since tencent bought them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snarf of thunder","date":"2019-01-12T23:04:17.825+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"pbe sucking fuck now. developers just dont care.
