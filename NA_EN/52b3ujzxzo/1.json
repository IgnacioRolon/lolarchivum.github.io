Because you're complaining about trolls not being punished on the same breath you tell people to kill themselves and call them worthless over having a dissenting opinion.

In your example, you reported varus for what exactly? Not following the orders of other people? Get over it. He's the one playing Varus, not you. Your teammates are not required to follow your every whim. So long as they doing what **_they_** think is helpful to win the game, they're allowed to do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jpguy902","date":"2017-02-15T21:06:12.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Faco,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=701mtePg,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-02-15T13:23:39.842+0000)\n>\n>  this is a competitive game, atleast in ranked. so why are treating people their like 12y old children?\n\nCause when you flame, you are basically acting like a child.
