It has been up there for two days or so and even accumulated quite a few up votes.\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/pZcKY75/3453454354.png[/img]\n\nten minutes later she removed one of my response\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/t8RHjYs/5675676576.png\nbecause of how specifically this is, she doing both these actions and in short duration of time between. I cannot help but feel this is targeted.\n\nFive days ago she removed one of my response basically just to tell someone to back off from harassing me. Today I made a thread and statement I&#039;m tired of the harassment. Even at the moment I said I&#039;m leaving this person continue to harass me. The golden rule of don&#039;t be a jerk should apply to everyone\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/pjQcfPd/57567567.png[/img][/url]","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2018-11-30T18:02:50.563+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI'm sorry for any confusion regarding that first removal.  I saw it more as an artist piece which is not a meme but something to be showcased on Concepts & Creations, the sub-board for fan made creations.  Memes usually involve words or inside jokes rather than just a nice piece of artwork.  Please note that anything removed for being in the wrong sub-board is not a mark against your account so no need to worry about that and feel free to post the image in C&C if you'd like.  With regards to the meme's you've seen:\n\n> https://i.ibb.co/Qc23PFt/45654654.png[/img][/url]\n\nIt's a reaction meme of him \"pining\".  It's sort of the same as a TFW meme\n \n> https://i.ibb.co/0ZksvTQ/089098.png[/img][/url]\n\nThis is meme'ing about how these images look like T1, a well known streamer who has recently been featured in memes for an image where he looks kinda ridiculously short compared to someone else.\n \n> https://i.ibb.co/QFrcTCB/56756765.png[/img][/url]\n\nThis is meme'ing that Voli is never touched and is sad that he isn't being fixed while other popular champs receive tons of nerfs and buffs.\n\nRegarding the second removal, commenting that people are part of a conspiracy has only brought in negative commentary and isn't really good for discussion.   Since you have posted this removal here, I can break it down a bit more for you.  It's not cool to accuse someone who is making a simple suggestion with what they consider to be fun (driving a forklift -- can confirm, they look fun as heck having worked in a factory before) of being out to incite harm against you.  In addition, this.....  \n\n> Remember that the moderators aren't always available 100% of the time. They're not employees of Riot, just volunteers that want to help out. That's probably why your post was removed a few days after being posted.\n\n.....is 100% accurate.  Sometimes things don't show up or we have other pressing matters that need attending to first.  Generally unless a comment is really inappropriate, we don't remove things a week or so old, but given this was just a few days ago, I felt it appropriate to remove it.\n\nRegarding the comment you believe should be removed, I don't see any issues with it.  The person is saying that it's been a bit of a weird journey with your return after so many years given there were some ups and downs, but is jokingly saying a typical GD response of \"see you tomorrow\" of which others have posted on the thread as well.  \n\nI would like to assure you that I am not targeting you or anyone on the Boards.  The number of removals, edits, and locks I have done personally today is quite a few and you are not the only one to have had a comment fall into the \"few days have passed\" category.  The only reason you may see yours as being close together is simply that I review reports person by person so yours were evaluated together.\n\nIf you would like to discuss this further in private or speak to a Herald on the matter, I do recommend coming to the [Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification) as we can go into more detail there.\n\nI hope this helps explain things a bit better and let me know if I can better clarify your situation.\n\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jinzaburo","date":"2018-11-30T18:09:16.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jikker,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=HAIxxyRE,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-11-30T18:02:50.563+0000)\n>\n> Hey,\n> \n> I&#x27;m sorry for any confusion regarding that first removal.

Don't get me started or I'll have to remove my own hate filled rant towards the lack of ability to move, but we cannot move threads.  Not even one.  Sadly, that means incorrectly posted threads have to be deleted and reposted by the original poster.  This is just a limitation of these ~~terribly~~ wonderfully programmed Boards (I told you not to get me started!)\n\nI didn't see a common meme in that thread as I did in your examples and it seemed to be more a description of the artwork.  I can ask for a second opinion from the mods if you would like.  Again though, this is not a mark against your account or anything negative.  Pretend I moved your thread only you have to \"approve\" (recreate) the move.\n\n> The guy is right here in this thread\n\nI am not seeing any harassing from him in this thread or elsewhere.  People are welcome to post on whatever thread they please with whatever opinion they wish so long as it follows the Board Universal Rules.  If you are having trouble with someone from an unofficial 3rd party discord, it is best to solve such things there than to bring the problems here.  We can't take action against something that doesn't happen on the Boards or the official Boards Discord.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinzaburo","date":"2018-11-30T18:25:19.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jikker,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=HAIxxyRE,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2018-11-30T18:19:03.704+0000)\n\n> \n> I didn&#x27;t see a common meme in that thread as I did in your examples and it seemed to be more a description of the artwork.

The Boards are a big place and often without reports, things do fly under our radar.  It is no different than the guy that speeds and doesn't get caught simply because an officer isn't around.  It doesn't make it right.  I don't frequent M&G so often I don't see things like that.  Your thread just happen to be reported so I noticed it.\n\nIn regards to that, I would remove it as well since it is not a meme.  However, it is 11 days old so it falls in that category of \"too old to matter\".  I will look into it nonetheless.\n\nEDIT: Upon further inspection, that thread would be borderline as it is not Twitch's new skin, but rather trying to meme his old one.  I'd probably still recommend it be in GD.  It takes a long while to scroll to and has died off the first few front pages so it has passed the mark of removal worthy","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Asamas","date":"2018-11-30T18:25:15.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jikker,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=HAIxxyRE,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-11-30T18:02:50.563+0000)\n>\n> Hey,\n> \n> I&#x27;m sorry for any confusion regarding that first removal.

She is not targeting you or anything of the like.\n\nMemes and Games is a tough board sometimes because the meme might not be obvious to everyone else, but I generally agree with her that if you want to post cute art that there is no general joke revolving around then the best place for that is [Concepts and Creations](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts). I'm almost positive they would really love your fan art posts there (Or even on GD) especially if you condensed them so there were more than 1 piece of art in each one. You're very good at finding good art. We do the best we can trying to catch all moderatable posts, but as we are volunteers we inevitably miss some. You can help us with this by reporting posts that you feel violate our [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE).\n\nAs per the other removal, while the moderation team understands that you are having some problems with a Discord server, Boards unfortunately is not the place to discuss it. Nobody here has any control over external things such as Discord servers and while some who post here might also be in that Discord we always ask for -everyone- to be treated with respect while on the Boards (externally we cannot control). Being accusatory and posting that people are part of a conspiracy isnt really respectful. My best suggestion would be just to ignore those people if they post on your posts. If you dont think they have treated you well just do not engage with them at all. If you believe they are harassing you on Discord or from the Discord you can contact Discord support though their twitter I believe, or if it is very serious you can follow these [steps](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932-How-to-Properly-Report-Issues-to-Trust-Safety).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jinzaburo","date":"2018-11-30T17:18:33.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are examples of discussions made in Meme & Games that share the same format style to my discussion \"Lulu goes to sleep now\"\njust a picture and a caption\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/Qc23PFt/45654654.png[/img][/url]\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/0ZksvTQ/089098.png[/img][/url]\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/QFrcTCB/56756765.png[/img][/url]","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-11-30T18:27:30.739+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Jikker explained, those really aren't the same kind of thing.
