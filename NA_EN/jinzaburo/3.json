But in Asia that is not the case, In Asia moba especially the ones on phone is quite popular with girls. Well for girls who do not value education or have the integrity to work like a normal person and who enjoy shopping very much.\r\n\r\nOnly a few months ago I dated a young lady about ten years younger than me, she&#039;s in her early twenties I&#039;m in my early thirties. One of the problem dating her I remember I had something important to discuss with her this was back at her apartment. She continue to watch esports telling me how stupid a player is(I have no idea what she is watching)\r\n\r\nWhen I talked more she actually put her arm around my head gripping me under her shoulder. Just a piece of my mind I wanted to share. I don&#039;t know what to think of gamer Asian girls even now.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://preview.ibb.co/htSZnA/23423432432.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nI gave her a small parting gift","replies":[]}
