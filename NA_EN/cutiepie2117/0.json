As DTN mentioned, you're safe to play the tutorial and leave whenever.  We ask that players stay committed to any matchmade games, or games where other real players are participating.  \n\nRegarding the issue you had in-game, it sounds like your network is having a connection problem that is unable to relay information from the game server.  This in turn can cause your game to delay or become unresponsive.  As a first step, go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to work on getting this resolved.
