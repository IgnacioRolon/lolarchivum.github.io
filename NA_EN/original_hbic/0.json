Sucks this happened, though.  :(  Is everything okay now?","replies":[{"poster":"Original HBIC","date":"2017-10-04T21:18:10.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"everything is ok except i lost the game which is not a big deal. but i do hope technical teams can look into potential drop hack for this game. I have experienced this 3 times (including this one i mentioned) during last month. All happened when we were winning the game or about to start a fight (entire team discconnect while the enemy team just fine). I do think a possible hack ware is targeting the game again and i remember it was an issue back in 2013 and a lot of account got banned back then.","replies":[]}]}]}
