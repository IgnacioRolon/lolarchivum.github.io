Or it may be a completely different direction entirely. But one thing&#039;s for sure - it&#039;s always one side that&#039;s displeased when going back and forth between these directions and unless you&#039;re an outlier (overperforming), Assassins aren&#039;t seen much in Pro play for very clear reasons:\r\n\r\n1. They suck at teamfighting, they focus on solo performance\r\n2. They focus on taking the target down first, without much utility (mages do both but without the added mobility and that&#039;s why in Pro play, they are mid lane kings to this day)\r\n\r\nI&#039;d personally love to see Katarina more but the reality of the situation is that she&#039;s a solo queue champion with a high skill ceiling. She holds so much power in her basic abilities (for an experienced Kata player) that she sometimes can feel like a problematic champion if she gets access to early snowball. However, for teams that can zone her or are packed with CC, she can almost never get an opportunity to initiate a fight or even stay in it to do damage, not even with her ult. And in these situations, she feels like dead weight more than a champion that can contribute to her team.","replies":[{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-07-30T09:08:31.574+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ok here's my take:\n\nAn assassin should fit these 5 things:\n\n1) Burst without 100-0.

Ahri is an assassin. She can 100-0 someone. It take her hitting charm, both parts of her Q, her W, proccing electrocute, throwing ignite down with some AA's. This requires timing, practice, hitting her skill shots, and her being able to use EVERYTHING in one go. All of that isn't enough without a few AA's.\n\nNow lets look at Talon. He hits his Q, throws out a W, AA and ignite. That's it. His Q is point and click, his W can't miss from melee range, the single aa can't miss from melee range, and the ignite is point and click. Swap W and Q at the beginning to add the \"risk\" of missing the W for a guaranteed kill level 2-6.\n\nZed can W E Q at any point after level 3 to proc electrocute. If he hits EITHER ability then he can just press W again, AA once to proc electrocute and then ignite.\n\nThe difference between the AD and AP side of this is the AP champion HAS to hit her CC which is a skill shot and blocked by minions to have any HOPE of killing you. Even then it takes EVERYTHING she's got to do it and several AA's. Whats more she doesn't snowball off this, but must do this 2-3 more times before she could be considered about as strong as Zed and Talon are naturally. Even then, they can 1 shot her while being 2 level (ish) behind and 3 kills down while she can't do the same to them because ignite is on CD and hexdrinker exists.\n\nI'm not hating on Assassins. In almost every game I play I play them (In league I like Ahri, Talon and Kassadin), but the truth of it is there's outplaying someone and using timing and skill to secure an early kill, and there's it being handed it on a silver platter with a note from your opponent saying \"be gentle.\" Currently the latter is true for way too many, and yes it is mainly the AD ones who lack hard CC, but the thing with CC is you still have to hit it. Currently AD don't need to hit half their abilities to kill you. Hell Talon doesn't even need to have LEARNT all his abilities to 1 shot you xD\nThis isn't just on squishies, the same applies up against ANYONE.\n\nDuskblade just adds insult to injury, which is why so many other champions are making use of it rather then their normal builds. It's a \"get this item and you have 1 shot potential.\" So yes, Graves etc will build this, and why wouldn't they?","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-30T18:20:29.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But this is what I am saying.

Some champions can use electrocute and not be overly damaging, others are damaging WITHOUT it, so become broken with it. That's not even counting in items like {{item:3147}} and {{item:3095}} which just add insult to injury.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-07-31T08:58:35.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't personally mind Electrocute simply because the champions that take it, don't also go for every available item burst option as well.

What I want to see is some RISK involved. Some INVESTMENT made to get that kill. \nCurrently it doesn't take your ult or summoners on most to kill a target. They can escape in a second after deleting someone with no counterplay and only have to wait 5-10 seconds to do it again. They have no COUNTERS; they 1 shot everything from ADC's to Tanks. Their powerspike is 1/2 an item+ (can be {{item:3134}} or {{item:3155}}, makes no difference to their 1 shot capability).\n\nDivers are another issue, as are fighters, and while I agree they also need to be looked at, right now assassins are by far the biggest problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-07-30T09:42:46.433+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"OK, these look like some good points.\nBut i'd like to ask you a question:\n\nIf Assassins aren't threatening enough to dangle the death carrot in front of their target's head (a squishy), is it justifiable for them to be equally squishy and be dropped in one chain CC burst combo from their enemies?

Therefore, there will always be better picks than Assassins.\n> \n\nOk lets look at this in 2 parts, starting with the \"is it justifiable for them to be equally squishy and be dropped in one chain CC burst combo from their enemies?\" Yes it is. They are all hypermobile, so they can choose where they attack from, and when they will do it. They can dodge skill shots and can escape before being 1 shot themselves. Will this make them weaker in lane? Yes, of course it will. But a mage's target will be to CS. An assassin's target will be to kill the mage.\n\nSecondly risk vs reward. Assassin's get rewards from almost everywhere. They CS better then most, they can 1 shot almost anyone, they are tankier then mages AND they have mobility. That's not really much risk. Their rewards? 1/2 item power spikes. They literally don't even need a kill to snowball anymore lol.\nThe idea of risk and reward is that it is risky for them to be in the lane in the first place. The risk is that when they go in they RISK getting CC'ed and bursted down, and have to use timing and their mobility to be successful. This is why they required to be played tactfully. Think of akali pre 6, or Diana pre 6. Their early game is PAINFUL unless the opponent makes a mistake. They pick their moment and strike, but otherwise they know they aren't safe and have to play appropriately. This is what assassins should be.\nNow don't get me wrong, both of these hit 6 and can 100-0 which is WRONG unless ahead. The rewards of taking the risk involved with coming out ahead needs to be more then \"live until 6\", but currently most top assassins don't even need that. it's live till 2 for Talon, and live till 3 for Zed. reaching level 6 just guarantees the kill.\n\n> If it&#x27;s not, then this means Assassins have to have some form of teamfight maneuvrability as well (a way to engage a target in a teamfight, and not entirely be sitting ducks waiting to be target focused instantly - my mentioned &quot;Katarina effect) and a way out if something goes wrong. But then we have the opposite issue - Assassins feel too slippery (to easily disenge bad fights), and feeling like you can&#x27;t punish them fast enough for them to regret a bad play.\n>\n\nThis is already the case for most assassins. Zed played well is always hard to get hold of. Same for Kat. Talon can just jump over a wall. And of course they all have flash should the need arise. It's why champions with point and click CC were always so important; there had to be a way to lock these guys down. Sadly those mages have been nerfed out of the game which is imo a large reason for the current dominance of the \"hypermobile Hypercarry\".\n\nThere simply isn't any risk to most of the assassins, whether they be level 6 and 1 shot, or less. They don't NEED to get kills to snowball, though most can anyway. The simplest way I can put it is think about when you have kill pressure. Mages: 3 items (ish), Assassins: level 2-6 with 1/2 and item. That's a LONG time to be dominant without risk. Who COULDN'T snowball in that time? xD\nThis means that laning phase goes from being the hardest time for assassins to suddenly being a buffet of gold. No risk.

I do think there's currently a slight problem with tanks being weak, and that's why we're seeing an influx in complaints about assassins all of a sudden. If these tank changes look promising in Patch 8.16, we might get one step closer to a healthier assassin experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-07-31T09:10:23.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with Meddler on some of his points.\nI don't believe that all Tanks are bad, i think that the Tank experience is not that good.

If there's no one to soak that damage, of course that lower HP pools wouldn't be able to withstand a standard spell rotation from a burst champion and therefore, leading to the feeling of everyone \"one-shotting\" everyone. Turrets in mostly squishy team comps don't even feel weak because these champions cannot take more than a few shots before having to disengage a turret dive.\n\nBut the same problem exists - if the turret dives end up with a few damage champs ganging up on a single squishy champ, it feels as if the turret isn't responding fast enough to protect someone under it as the dive lasts around a second before everyone clears its range.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2018-07-30T11:21:36.355+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":7,"body":"I agree with the other's Somewhat but i'll adjust a bit.\n\n1. Burst, assassins should be able to 100-0 you in less than a second, the difference is the amount of Set Up it takes to get there. Evelynn for example marks you and it takes 2.5 seconds for the mark to activate, you have ample time to get somewhere safe most player's just chose not to.\n2. High Mobility, this is the thing they get for having to dive into backline by themselves, they aren't tanky or shouldn't be tanky and this is the reason why.\n3. CC, no assassin should have a CC ability without some sort of caveat, again, evelynns is Delayed and requires her to land an ability after the delay, for example and she also doesn't have any mobility to make up for having this+perma stealth.\n4. Single Target, Assassins should be able to single target burst anything that's just as squishy as themselves, reset, and try again later. Assassins should be able to burst 1 person and reset to get a different person/same person later, they shouldn't get more than 2 kills in one skill rotation.\n\n\nThat about cover's it all, i think that assassins often get bunched together but a large majority are actually pretty fine right now. The few that aren't are from a different Era in league and should be adjusted to fit new parameter's such as Burst Window VS Prep Time.\n\nBurst Window VS Planning Time is basically just, how long does it take to burst someone VS how long did it take your abilities to allow for burst, so for instance Evelynn's W is extremely important to allow her to burst, especially early so most of the time her Prep Time is 2.5 seconds at the least.\n\nEvelynn \nBurst Window: .5 Seconds\nPrep Time: 2.5+ Seconds\n\nZed\nBurst Window: 1 Second\nPrep Time: None\n\nTalon\nBurst Window: 1 Second\nPrep Time: 1 Second\n\nKatarina\nBurst Window: 2+Seconds\nPrep Time: 2+ Seconds\n\nKha'Zix\nBurst Window: 1 Second\nPrep Time: None\n\nPyke\nBurst Window: 3+ Seconds\nPrep Time: 1 Second\n\nWhat i mean to show here is that if an assassin has a short Burst Window, the Prep Time to burst must be high, if the person has a long Burst Window, the Prep Time has to be Small. If all assassins were made to these parameter's, more likely than not they'd probably be Balanced, for a long time Zed was pretty balanced since he had to land his Q's but that's changed recently. \n\nAnd of course this doesn't apply that well if the Assassin is super fed but i mean at that point anything can one shot you so it doesn't really matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Cogito Ergo Sol ","date":"2018-07-30T12:27:34.112+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm sorry but how is Zed's prep time 1 second?The only time he can do that is if he's fed and if you're facechecking a bush, which means element of surprise+duskplade proc.\nIn all other cases you see him coming, you have 1 sec until he shows up after mark and 3 seconds until it pops.

Not just through shitty, forced delays (as part of the assassin rework did), but rather through more natural delays (Something along the lines of Zed's R, or Evelynn's W) and through having reasonably dodgable abilities that *set up* their kill (Such as Ekko's stun, Eve's W, Ahri's E, etc.). An assassin ***should not have the damage to kill a healthy target*** without landing at least 2/3 of these reasonably-difficult skillshots. If the skillshot can *easily* be used point-blank and is near-instant, it's not a valid ability for this, because it's not reasonably dodgeable. Zed's Q coming out of R just isn't reasonably dodgeable, because it's point fucking blank.\n\n>What do you think a fair Assassin would feel like to play as/against?\n\nA fair assassin would feel like a test of skill for both the assassin and for the opponent. Nearly every death to one should feel like *you* failed, not like you were just fucked to begin with. Everyone should have a reasonable chance of surviving one - even in a 1v1 - And the assassin should have a reasonable chance of killing nearly anyone - Even in a 5v5. It should have less to do with positioning (that's more against mages) and more about proper outplay.

Assassins had to make good picks and decisions to catch enemies off guard, giving them **an advantage** in the ensuing fight. For example, Twitch gets an attack speed boosts upon getting out of stealth, allowing him to get a few hits in before the target can retaliate. If the target wasn't able to fight back, they still had the chance to retreat, and then perhaps the poison would finish them.\n\nNow it's just like... you were out of position? You have 0.3 seconds to regret your decision.

Uses his utility to set up that damage and scales very well. Using ult as an escape allows him to get out safely, but in other he can use it to outplay a mispositioned enemy (that the enemy can see). He has wave clear with Q, but this is only a signal for the midlaner to play around this and take an aggressive position around the creep wave. \n\n{{champion:55}} : Huge aoe potential, high mobility, obvious weaknesses. Her daggers are telegraphed and she is very prone to CC heavy comps. Her waveclear is ok at best and isn't entirely feast or famine which is generally what makes an assassin broken in the first place through several patches. The only issue right now is her interaction with {{item:3146}} which gives unnecessary amounts of strength which can't be deal with by numerous midlaners\n\n{{champion:238}} : Zed kit wise is balanced. You can dodge a lot of his poke in lane and work around several laning patterns zed uses. You can build zhonyas to negate his ultimate damage; however, several patches has frontloaded his damage and has made a bit of a safety net for his dominance. Electrocute in particular has made his trading too strong for any sort of retaliation. Hexdrinker in particular delays damage yes, but it makes it practically impossible to kill him as he is incredibly nimble, and nullifying orb on top of that makes him practically an anti-mage. Duskblade lowered the skill floor for him to do his job. \n\n{{champion:103}} : (I still consider Ahri an assassin): Aside with how frustrating it is for Ahri to ult out of every dangerous situation. Her numbers basically means she is pidgeon holed into landing charm, which is sortve her main power budget. If I get hit with charm then thats 100% my fault.

He does illustrate a \"cat and mouse\" / pick oriented kind of assassin that cannot build more health. \n\n{{champion:76}} : Dodgeable spear, has low utility so she performs a niche role that only OTPs can usually be successful at. I do feel like if I got hit with a spear that is 100% my fault\n\n{{champion:28}} : I'd put her on the list since she has a dodge able form of CC, but the charm is really, really forgiving at times so I'm pretty neutral about her\n\n{{champion:7}} : Bad waveclear so can be dealt with with wave manipulation, outplayable in lane, becomes more and more difficult to use outside of lane.

Ult is barely dodgeable, E grants invulnerability. His early cheese is basically a reminder to mages to not even misposition for a half second and level 2-3 and only becomes more unbearable to play against. E flash interaction says \"fine you flashed away to avoid my E? Get outplayed nerd\" And electrocute and ignite on top of that made him even more problematic to the point where you're only option is to hard counter him in champion select.\n\n{{champion:107}} : Killed for existing. Counterplay usually involves a leap of faith prediction kind of CC\n\n{{champion:121}} : Killed again for existing.

Ex- poison, bleed-out, etc.**\n\nReasoning: Assassins as a \"class\" shouldn't be dealing AoE since that's more of what a Mage is for & to keep them unique, they should be primarily single target. In terms of damage, they need damage, but they don't have to instantly kill a chosen target before they can react. That shit's for single-player games. Giving the enemy time to react in order to save themselves leads to interactive gameplay, which in turn creates \"hey, I could have done this to survive, or my teammate could have saved me\" situations as opposed to \"there was absolutely nothing anyone on my team could have done in that time-frame.\"\n\n\n**2) Self-defensive utility, at least one.**\n\nReasoning: If an assassin doesn't have the damage to 100-0 a target without fail, they need to be able to A. survive to rejoin the fight, and B. provide support to the team in some way, esp. in teamfights, in order to be viable. However, an assassin that has good offensive utility (ex. stuns on chosen targets) or defensive utility that applies to teammates (ex. ally shielding / healing / defensive buffs) can be delegated to the support role.\nThe concept of Akali's shroud is a good example of self-defensive utility. It keeps the assassin conditionally safe while providing minimal assistance to teammates and doesn't prevent the enemy from acting-- if Akali is the target, it provides the team some safety as the enemy spends time trying to damage Akali, and if Akali isn't the target, the ability has done it's job in keeping Akali safe.\n\n\n**3) Need Mobility spells / Lack of Raw Defense (Shields, Damage Reduction, etc.)**\n\nReasoning: Mobility should be self-explanatory. They need to be able to get to their chosen targets in some way. \nAs for lack of raw defense.. Let's start with an example-- If the defining trait of an ADC is attacks from range, then they should logically be weaker at melee range than melee champs, yes?\nThen if the defining trait of an Assassin is mobility (barring a certain man's atrocities with uncountable dashes), then they should logically be weaker at face-to-face fights against the champions that are LESS mobile.\nIn order for this to happen, they can't have powerful shielding or damage reduction, else they'll be able to choose their fights, escape unwanted fights, evade skill-shots, AND win fights against anyone that can't out-dps them (which only gets easier with raw defense). Let them choose their fights and escape if need be, but if they decide to fight, they shouldn't be able to beat out beefier opponents easily.\n\n\n**4) Scouting / Intel Gathering / Vision Denial Utility**\n\nReasoning: There's a severe lack of scouting abilities and intel gathering abilities in this game, and that's reasonable given how powerful Intel is! However, I believe this niche can be filled by assassins because knowing where enemies are / aren't is even more important for them than any other class. Vision denial from Duskblade should also be moved into select Assassins' kits imo.\nThe only example I can think of that fulfills this Scounting function from an Assassin's kit is Rengar's ult. Yes, it tells them that you might be coming to attack, but it also tells you where they are, allowing you to think about where to go, and choose whether to engage or not. It gives _choices _ to both sides. The opposite would be Nocturne's ult, which denies Team-Vision for a period for the enemies, preventing them from knowing what's going on without voice-comms, and even with it, leaving them unable to accurately influence the outcome of a fight that's not in character range. Both are powerful tools that can take some of the \"power-budget\" in a given kit to reduce damage for point 1).","replies":[{"poster":"IceAYon","date":"2018-07-31T01:30:33.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How weak does #2 need to be in order fit with #3? or Talon'E fits #2 description.

However, that's only in the case of self-defensive utility, specifically, with something for the opposing players to play around.** That's probably the most important part-- there needs to be something they can do / avoid (a lot of abilities lack this).\n\nI do think Talon's E could be considered #2 self-defensive utility, but it's pretty extreme in the level of mobility (instead of mitigating / redirecting attacks like a spellshield or a clone, etc.) so I would actually classify it as #3 for him. Mobility that's not target-dependent, especially if it allows hopping of walls, can be used both offensively and defensively, so it's not strictly self-defensive. Kayn is a pretty good example of mobility doing both offense and defense as well.\n\nTalon's #2 self-defensive utility would be his ult-tied stealth, if anything, but I don't think it's a healthy form of self-defense. It's completely undetectable except by red trinket / damage ticks that give off a blurry shape, and it's also attached to a large amount of Talon's damage, which makes it not-so-ideal to run away with it unless auto/Q/W/Ult [no order] was enough to kill the target without a follow-up recast of Q / recall of Ult.\n\nThat's in comparison to Akali's shroud which has a limited area, making it much easier to find her with the same red trinket / damage ticks, will reveal her if she does try to run off, and is unattached from direct damage, but in return allows her to re-enter stealth over and over within the allotted AoE.\n\nOverall, I think League's current self-defensive utilities are pretty lacking in imagination. Akali's shroud, Leblanc's clones, and Ekko's ult-tied \"rewind\" are the best in the game imo. Of course, I think there could be things done to make it more interactive, like Leblanc never entering stealth, or Ekko not dealing damage at the return point and healing back to his previous state instead (rewards predicting and sticking to Ekko instead of punishing for it), but they're at least interesting and have something to play around.

That social contract entailed a handful of things:\n\n- An Assassin should be able to kill you in lane easily, but they should have extremely poor farming mechanics and must expend key abilities in order to achieve moderate farm.\n\n- An Assassin killing you should mean they are staying even, not getting ahead. \"Getting ahead\" for them should entail outleveling you and ganking other lanes, applying pressure, etc.\n\nNow an Assassin is allowed to just farm perfectly under the tower and their scaling is guaranteed, whereas they used to be forced to get kills and light/moderate farm to scale. You know, because they were Assassins.\n\nAssassins designed today just have the best of all worlds now. They kill you repeatedly in lane and they can maintain perfect farm. There is no analog to this privilege in the game. It's hard to even think of a hypothetical one. Imagine an ADC scaling heavily without needing farm, in other words, their late-game is guaranteed and nothing is required of them to get to late-game. The community would not tolerate this, but this is analogous to what we currently tolerate with Assassins. Nothing is required of them to hit their stride. The 0/3/0 Zed who failed to be an Assassin in lane was able to farm well enough, so he will just meander on down to Bottom lane and 100-0 someone because he safely farmed a core item under his tower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ranmaru","date":"2018-07-30T15:31:11.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:76}} I'd say shes reliant on spear and she can be peeled while going in","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rumkatten","date":"2018-07-30T09:12:09.893+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":7,"body":"As far as I understand: In high elo and proplay, assasins are fine and mage players are skilled enough to counter them.

And given that they snowball easier, it can quickly get out of hand and feel like you can't stop them at all. But comparatively, Talon (who's an outlier in our queues) was played in Pro play and he wasn't a top tier mid pick.\n\nI feel like the moment an jumps over 51% winrate, we quickly start making posts that Riot needs to nerf bat them, all the while they don't show the same trends in Pro play/high ELO games.
