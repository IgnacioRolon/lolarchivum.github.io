Last week, we kicked off Season 2019 with new tiers, a reworked placements system, split rewards, and—for North America and Korea—a preview of position ranks. Today I want to give you a quick update on how things are going so far, let you know what we have planned for the next few patches, and talk a bit about the things we’re investigating.\n\nYou can find the key information below. If you want all the details, read on!\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AJEPJmn.png\n\n#Fixed\nSeason start was relatively smooth, but we encountered and resolved a few issues already. Here were the big ones:\n\n##Issue: Some players were unable to queue together when they should be able to.\nEarly in the season, we discovered some players were unable to queue together, especially if either player had lost their season rewards as a result of punishment. We also uncovered some other issues with premade restrictions, so we fixed them.\n\nWe determine [premade restrictions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h1q3) like this:\n\n* For position ranks, we use your **_highest_** provisional or non-provisional position rank\n* For other queues, we use your provisional or non-provisional rank\n* If you don’t have a provisional or non-provisional rank, we use your past rank\n* If you’re new to Ranked, we use **Iron IV** to determine restrictions\n\nWe will continue to monitor and investigate any reports of premade restrictions not working properly, so hit us up if you feel like you’re encountering issues.\n\n##Issue: Some players were experiencing abnormally low LP gains.\nWith the introduction of Iron and Grandmaster, and the season reset, some players—especially players who were high Diamond in Season 2018—were getting lower LP gains than expected. There were a variety of reasons for this, but we believe we’ve corrected most of them now.\n\n#Planned\nBased on the feedback we’ve received so far, we have some updates planned over the next few patches. Standard disclaimer: Any of these are subject to change if we encounter bugs or need to prioritize more important work.\n\n##Patch 9.3\n\n* **New Loading Screen/Borders —** We’ll roll out the updated loading screen and dynamic borders which reflect your current rank\n* **Dynamic Split 1 Emote —** The Split 1 emote will become dynamic and evolve with your current tier. It locks in at the end of Split 1\n* **Clearer LP Splashing Visuals —** The amount of LP splashing will be displayed more prominently on the scoreboard screen after a game and doesn’t disappear \n\n##Patch 9.4\n\n* **Splashing Can Trigger Promo Series —** We’ve heard a lot of feedback from players that you should be able to enter a promo series when you splash to 100 LP so we’re doing it. You’ll still get a free win from Promo Helper if you’re eligible, which should cut down on the grind\n\n##Patch 9.5\n\n* **Autofill Protection in Promo Series —** We have heard feedback that it’s pretty frustrating when you get a position into a promo series, queue up for it, and then get assigned something different. After this change, you’ll be guaranteed* your primary selection if it’s in a series\n\n\\* There may be some extreme situations where we can’t 100% guarantee you’ll get your first choice. We’ll update you again as we get closer to having this ready.\n\n#Investigating\nIn addition to the work we already have planned, we’re investigating a few other potential changes to the system based on the feedback we’ve seen so far:\n\n##Increasing Autofill LP Bonuses\nPosition ranks and splashing are tricky to balance. On one hand, we’ve seen feedback that many players appreciate how the new system makes losing off-position games feel like less of a setback. On the other hand, we’ve heard feedback that it doesn’t feel good to win off-position games.\n\nIn patch 9.3, we’ll make splashing more prominent on the scoreboard screen. Many players don’t realize they get bonus LP for their main position when they win while autofilled and we think clarifying the current incentive will help.\n\nHaving said that, we’re also considering additional changes to make those games feel more rewarding, like buffing the bonus LP you earn for your main position when autofilled. We’re _also_ looking at ways we can reward players for hitting Gold or higher in multiple positions as part of season rewards.\n\n##Increasing LP Penalties for Throwing Off-position Games\nWe’ve heard from you that negative splashing isn’t visible and in some cases it doesn’t punish players hard enough for throwing off-position games. While we haven’t seen a measurable increase in players throwing games, we’re considering tuning negative splashing so it ramps up faster. At the same time, we want to be careful not to punish players who just get unlucky despite trying their best to win.\n\n##Removing Negative Splashing Between Provisional Positions\nPart of the promise of the new placements system is that you’re protected from losing LP. This is generally true, except with splashing it’s possible to lose LP from a position that’s still in placements. Splashing in general is an important part of preserving competitive integrity, but we’re digging into whether it would be safe to modify the rules for this particular situation.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re seeing other issues that aren’t captured here or you just have feedback about the system, let us know in the comments. Thanks for all your help and feedback, and we’ll see you on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"donger b0t","date":"2019-01-31T10:30:12.061+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you have a legitimate conversation with your players about matchmaking and MMR when you keep MMR hidden?

My point here is that you can't really even speak on it, and neither can I - it is hidden from us completely. We are not empowered to have a discussion about matchmaking, only our anecdotes.\n\nMy understanding of the Riot given reason for keeping MMR private is overall with a 50% WR your MMR will hover about the same, however you will still be able to climb divisions with that WR. People like to watch their numbers go up so have them climb divisions even if their MMR hovers around the same area, until their division approximates their MMR. So the reason given so far is psychological, to create a more rewarding climb. Unfortunately there are a few very bad negative psychological consequences of hiding our MMR from us, namely confusion, frustration, and erosion of trust.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kaisa Sona","date":"2019-02-11T18:22:13.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like of all the possible changes in the game going forward, I wish this one would gather steam more than any other. It is exceptionally frustrating to me when I start making decreased LP gains on wins, for what \"appears\" to be an arbitrary reason. I recently jumped a tier with a 55% wr and was getting 23lp/win. I lost 3 games in a row, and now I get 18lp/win. It's maddening. The 3 game lost streak came after >100 games played mind you, so it didn't have some large impact upon my win rate. If I could see my MMR versus that of the median of my division perhaps this would be more palatable. As it stands, as the OP mentioned, it feels like some dark force behind the scenes controlling your fate. Honestly, it makes the game feel like such a grind, the kind where you don't have strong control over your own fate - unless you're SIGNIFICANTLY better than whatever tier you're in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZaneShadow","date":"2019-01-30T23:17:48.929+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Auto fill protection for a promo series sounds amazing.

Changes to premades (DynamicQ) or positional ranking change the fundamental motivations behind people playing. In the case of DynamicQ: “I’m not playing to win I’m playing to have fun with friends”.

The system isn't really about giving you 5 ranks as much as it is about making games with autofills more balanced. However, since people visually see 5 ranks and can probably check that for others, it emphasizes unfun grindy elements regardless of intention. \n\nIt gives people another way to flame too. \"Plat Mid but Gold 4 ADC... lul. Just abusing OP mid role. No mechanics or positioning. Someone boost you to Plat for Mid?\" You get the gist... people will often focus on your lowest rank and for players who only really want to be good at one role, that can be frustrating. \n\nThus, there should ONLY ever be one rank displayed. Your highest rank. Every other role should be hidden or at least opt-out. The splash should be high enough so that people still care though. This would be a sort of half-way solution which I think pleases both groups.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2019-01-30T23:50:23.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My main concern with this system that I don't think was answered in a Q/A yet (or haven't seen);\n\nHow does elo decay work with the new positional queue?

I personally dislike the format of \"Place really really low, but rapidly climb and lose nothing\" as opposed to \"Average your bests and worsts, and place you somewhere in the middle\", i am hesitant at *best* to want to place in any queue other than my main role whereas i used to be totally fine autofilling to top, bot, or even support when they were given. I wasn't happy, but i tolerated.\n\nNow, since you gain *SO* much less LP for autofill games, and you lose less, it feels like a waste of 30-40 mins to me.\nInstead of getting a sweeping +18 or +21 LP to my rank and helping my climb keep its steady pace, now i get.... well, the same but *only* for a role i do not play frequently enough to value whatsoever, so that number is going to be dramatically lower than it would be. Sure, there's splashing, but does a whopping -3 loss or maybe 5-6 for a win matter for a *forty minute* game?\n\nAside from that, it's a good idea, but i don't see execution working out. It's nice to see \"Oh, this dude's a good player, he's just off role\" or \"Oh this dude's on-role\" so the MATCHMAKING aspect would be nice\nIt's exploitable as fuck and there's no amount of safeguard to stop it\nBut it's nice. Better than \"wait hold on this dude's both a bad player AND off role? why is he in my game\"\n\nGripes aside, here's what has been done correctly:\n**1**: New loading screen is nice\n**2**: Iron was much needed, though the fact that every division sub Old Gold3 division was pushed down feels bad. Still a nessacary division for the worst players to be sorted apart from anything from 'Slightly sub-average' to \"there is no rank low enough for these players\"\n**3**: As clunky as the game is right now, i can say that the pacing and balance is slightly better than last season. Not by much, but noticable enough to mention here. Refine it a little, reward good play, and soften the blow a tiny bit from that 1 guarenteed throw player ruining your every game, and you'll have a very satisfying ranked experience once again.\n**4**: Having 1 less division to climb between ranks is nice, i personally disliked stagnating at silver 3 last season until i got over that bump solely because i knew after slogging through that division i'd have 2 more to go equally as difficult, and i was only halfway through so far.\n\nHopefully this critique serves some purpose, or is at least noticed. \nThanks for reading\n-AA","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurryKhan","date":"2019-02-04T18:32:40.172+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a couple thing which u already should have done:\n\n-Everybody know about toxic community. especially low elo.\nWhy no algorithm about instantly chat bann/perma on account which spam really rude things like \"kys\" etc...  why only through report system??? 10 years old game and no one thought about it yet???\n\n-The smurfs makes serious damage on low elo, still no SMS verification on ranked like in Clash....\nDota2 already implemented it cuz they listened to the players.

Theese players make a hard lose cuz they cant play and never played with that champion and Riot let them doing this without punishment.

In season 9, I've needed 8 provisional matches per rank. I can understand one reason might be to reduce the grindy-ness of provisionals from 50 matches 40 matches. But were there any other factors? I'm not complaining, I'm just wondering. \n\n---\n\nNaively, I'd have thought that playing off-roll due to autofill would reduce both LP gained *and* LP lost. I.e. in order to make autofill matter less. Are you confident that giving autofill victories bonus LP and therefore giving it more gravitas is the correct decision?

I like morg and the pose, but the big ranked thing hanging off the bottom a bit chunky and heavy looking. Plus, the victorious skin color scheme is based on the Challenger gold/blue colors, so the only rank that actually looks nice (in my opinion) is Challenger. Realistically, I and most people are not going to get Challenger, the only rank that doesn't look mismatched/awkwardly tacked on the bottom.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pandorax13x","date":"2019-02-03T22:56:42.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you lot ever plan to do anything about the report system?? because i'm not being funny but being matched with trolls and feeders and afkers in ranked matches is really starting to piss me off.
