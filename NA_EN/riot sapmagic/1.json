However, reception of _position ranks_ hasn’t been as positive, and we’re investigating issues with Diamond+ matchmaking/ranks. We’re exploring fixes for these, but if they won’t yield significant improvements, we’re considering ending the position rank previews and partially resetting the top of the ladder.**\r\n\r\nHey everyone, Ed “SapMagic” Altorfer here on behalf of the Ranked team. We’re a month into Season 2019 and today I want to share an update on what issues players are still experiencing, our thoughts on fixing them, and a timeline for next steps.\r\n\r\n#But First, the Good\r\nSo far, we’ve been happy with how some of our core changes were received, especially the placements rework which has led to a more transparent and less stressful experience. We’re also excited about the potential of splits and the ability to grant rewards that dynamically evolve with you as you rank up. \r\n\r\nWe’re happy with the impacts of positional matchmaking—not to be confused with position **ranks**—as well. Queue times have improved for many players and off-position win rates have gone up. On top of that, primary position rates have improved and autofill rates have gone down with a couple exceptions—we’re looking at you, Mid/Fill and Mid/Support players. \r\n\r\n#Position Ranks\r\nPositional matchmaking aside, we’ve seen a pretty mixed reception when it comes to position **ranks** in North America and Korea. Despite the work we did to address several key pieces of feedback before the feature was released, we’re still seeing frustration in these areas:\r\n\r\n- **Too Grindy**—When we designed the feature, we were targeting players who feel stuck right now because they have to specialize in one position. Position ranks opens that up, but the feedback is it takes too long to pursue those different paths to mastery.\r\n\r\n- **Doesn’t Feel Rewarding**—On top of slower progress for fill players, we’ve heard feedback that it doesn’t feel like there’s much payoff for ranking up in multiple positions. And—for specialists—it doesn’t feel like you make enough progress toward your main position when you win off-position games.\r\n\r\n- **Lower Competitive Intent**—Some players feel negative splashing hasn’t proven to be strong enough of a punishment to dissuade others who are committed to ruining games when they play off-positions.\r\n\r\nWe’re investigating how we can solve these, including further changes to splashing and bigger bonuses to your main position. Based on the feedback and reception, **we’re also evaluating whether we should end the position rank previews and go back to a single rank.** If we do this, players in North America and Korea would retain their highest position rank and all progress toward split rewards. We'll detail the actions we’re taking here on **March 8**.\r\n\r\n#High MMR Matchmaking/Ranks\r\nUnrelated to position ranks, we’ve been seeing issues that **specifically affect players in Diamond and above**. These feel related, but the underlying issues are varied and don’t affect every region in the same ways.\r\n\r\n- **Players in Master Who Shouldn’t Be**—We’ve seen reports about low win rate players managing to get into Master+. Most of this appears to be due to how we did the season reset in some regions and how we determine LP gains.\r\n\r\n- **Incorrect LP Gains in Diamond and Above**—Several weeks ago we identified and corrected an issue that was allowing some Diamond+ players to get to higher ranks than they should’ve been able to. Some of those players feel stuck after our fixes since they’re losing more LP than they gain, and we’ve heard feedback that the top of the ladder feels less legitimate.\r\n\r\n- **Master+ Players Matched with Low Diamond Players**—We identified an issue where Master+ players can sometimes be matched with lower-skill players even after short queue times. While this sometimes happened normally even prior to Season 2019, it’s occurring more frequently right now due to a bug that can result matchmaking for Master+ players prioritizing shorter queue times over tighter skill matches.\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of options for fixing issues like this, ranging from changing matchmaking configuration values to making decay more aggressive. In the worst case scenario, we could consider some form of partial reset aimed at Diamond+ players, but we wouldn’t do that unless we can prove there’s a widespread issue that can only be fixed through such drastic action.\r\n\r\nWe know this isn’t the most satisfying answer for players who are experiencing pain now, but we’ll provide another update on this **on or before March 8**. We want to be sure we pick a solution or set of solutions that help the most players without hurting others who have just been doing their thing and climbing the ladder.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/z2D0KoC.png\r\n#Meaning of Diamond and Above\r\nEven after we resolve the high MMR matchmaking and rank issues, the ladder will look different from last season. This is because when we added Grandmaster, we recalibrated the top tiers, including Diamond, Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Diamond represented an extremely broad skill range, meaning players in Diamond V and Diamond I looked totally different. Many Diamond players looked a lot more like Master players, and some Master players looked more like Challenger players in some regions.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we’ve adjusted the number of spots in Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger to smooth progression, reflect actual player skill, and adapt to the size of the active Ranked player base in each region. We believe these changes more accurately reflect skill at Diamond+, but in practice it means it’s not super meaningful to compare Season 2018 and Season 2019 ranks.\r\n\r\n#What’s Next\r\nIt has been a bit of a whirlwind so far and we still have some pain points to fix. We’ll be back with another update on **March 8**. In that update, expect us to share:\r\n\r\n- Specific solutions to the problems with position ranks and high MMR matchmaking\r\n- Exact timing on when we’ll be making changes\r\n- How the changes will affect you\r\n\r\nUntil then, if you’re seeing any other issues that aren’t captured here or you just have feedback about the system, let us know in the comments. Thanks for all your help and patience, and we’ll see you on the Rift.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Maokai.png","replies":[{"poster":"lol you wild wyd","date":"2019-03-01T17:12:20.572+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":2,"body":"Matchmaking in general is wonky, even in lower elo.

The reason this is suggested is that you learn and improve at the game the fastest. The more roles/champions you play the more games you will need to climb and improve.\nYou won't climb faster just because only 1 rank is visible.\nOf course to be fair, for smurfs it is true, for them it's faster to climb with one rank only.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2019-03-08T01:39:31.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a fair point. However, in the context of my remarks, \"being able to show off multiple ranks\" implies that someone is comparably proficient at more than one position (unless they're going for a weird \"I'm Plat Mid, but Iron everything else\" thing). Having only one rank thus means that they don't have to grind through the same division/tier multiple times and thus avoid \"wasting\" LP. The current LP splashing sorta mitigates this waste, but not nearly enough to offset the increased grind. For instance, at least based on my personal numbers, ranking two positions roughly doubles the total LP required, but splashing only increases total LP gain by about 16% (+24/win, +4 from splash).\n\nEssentially, you're correct for players whose rank already matches their skill. My argument was that positional ranks vastly increase the time it takes to get to that point.","replies":[{"poster":"Enjutsu","date":"2019-03-08T05:47:50.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That just means it takes a bit longer to get to your actual rank, but i don't think in the long run it really matters unless you play a very small amount of ranked games, like some tend to play 10 games just to have a rank.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rou","date":"2019-03-01T17:31:54.505+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"@Riot SapMagic, what are your thoughts on bringing back a single ranking system, while adapting the position rankings into something still visible to the players, but with less of an impact on LP gains? Perhaps the way those position ranks are determined would be slightly different than the overall position rank, to avoid some unsatisfying situations that might come up if someone is for example ranked higher in their most prioritized role than their overall role (say, high gold in mid while overall ranked silver). Maybe the ranks themselves would be called something different to reflect mastery in a specific role rather than overall success in the ranked queue. It might be appropriate in that case to change/remove promotion series and LP (or whatever it would end up being called) gains/losses in the position ranks. The benefits to this sort of system to me seems like it would still be satisfying to see your progress and success in a role that you main, while still having off role games matter for your rank. I like positional matchmaking and mmr a lot, and think those could be adapted into this new sort of system as well, where games on your main role (or highest ranked role) would give you the biggest LP gains/losses in your overall rank, while off role games give you slightly (important that it's only SLIGHTLY so that it's still considered important to win and try) less. I'm thinking like a game that would give you +20 LP on your main role would give you +16 LP on your main role. That sort of thing. I'd love to hear your opinions on the matter.\n\n**TL;DR: Bring back single solo queue rank, keep position ranks but change them to be slightly less visible/impactful than your overall rank. Thoughts?**","replies":[{"poster":"Riot SapMagic","date":"2019-03-01T17:43:37.487+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think ideas like this are pretty cool. Early on, we considered systems like this. One of the designers on my team kept referring to the pitch as \"Position Reflection\" which drove me insane, but basically the idea was you'd have position ranks that would update and you could see them in your profile, but they wouldn't have LP or promotions.\n\nThe advantage of this system is it mitigates all the potential competitive intent risks since you still have a single rank with LP and all that. The disadvantage is it requires basically all the same ongoing work/upkeep/complexity and probably isn't super useful to players. We think players are most motivated by high stakes achievements and rewards and I think this would end up being more akin to something like stats.\n\nNot to say it wouldn't be cool. Personally I would love something like that, if we roll back position ranks I'm not sure we'll do something like this. It might be more valuable to invest our time in optimizing the core experience and trying to keep positional matchmaking or something.","replies":[{"poster":"rou","date":"2019-03-01T17:58:17.929+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I could definitely see how that could be the case.

In one of those games, I was playing top role and the player that got auto filled support came top to troll me.....both of those games, the players died 10+ times. There's no incentive for players that get auto filled to do good at all and it just ruins other peoples games. Who knows how many times this is happening in our games, I'm only counting 2 games where people told me they were auto filled.\n\nAnother issue me and my friend have ran into is when we duo que, we play different roles and change it up depending on the rank we are (For example, silver, gold, plat, or diamond). My friend will play jungle at lower division ranks because they don't know much about objectives (Barons &amp; Dragons) then play mid or top when we get high enough ranked where people understand that. We used to do this for past seasons but now we can't do this anymore because of Position Ranks. Instead of encouraging us to learn and play different roles, all this has done is made us both stuck playing one role.\n\nAbout splashing, I don't think someone that is playing a lower ranked role from there main should splash any points into your main role. That honestly doesn't make sense and now you're talking about making bigger splashing rewards.......I mean, your saying I can just boost my main role by playing lower ranked off roles, then when I do play my main role, I'm playing at a even higher rank that i probably shouldn't even be in because of this system.\n\nAnother thing I would like to bring up non related to this topic. You guys won't punish people for trolling/intentionally feeding. I get it, there's no way for you guys to really know but can you at least implement a system where you lose more points for having to many deaths in one game. I've played so many games where one guy is doing bad, he just gives up and just intentionally feeds, then he just ruins the game for the rest of the players. At least there's some incentive for people to actually try even if they're doing bad if a system like that was in place.\n\nLast thing, please include a way for us to voice chat with our team. There's so many games that have this, i don't get why this game has not done this yet. This is such a team based game revolved around working together but yet, we can't communicate with our team......only through typing but nobody really has the time to type while actually playing the game. You know when you see people typing? When there being toxic to there teammates about who knows what because people are not on the same page on whats going on in the game. Me and my friend went to a few of those Microsoft League Tournaments. We had silver/gold/plat/diamond mixed ranked players on our teams and those games were actually fun. Even though we would have people dying or making mistakes, we were actually all playing as a team pretty well because we were able to communicate with people using skype. Please please please do this already, if people don't want hear anyone talk, its so easy for someone to be muted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xîmon","date":"2019-03-01T17:34:02.596+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":22,"body":"JUST RESET RANKEDS HARD RESET would be the best!!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot SapMagic","date":"2019-03-01T17:40:15.113+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"We won't do a hard reset.

One player is clearly better than the other, so we wouldn't put them together in matchmaking.\n\nNow if we do a hard reset:\n\n- Player A goes from 3000 MMR to 1000 MMR\n- Player B goes from 2000 MMR to 1000 MMR\n\nNow those players look identical in terms of skill, and if we put them together in a game we would think it's a \"fair\" game but it will actually be a stomp.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"shik3","date":"2019-03-01T20:02:26.062+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"the lp gains arent only wrong in diamond man..

The game already has a system for evaluating the performance of players in the game (the S,A,B,C,D Rankings), so why not use that evaluation to weight the Amount of splash LP gained?\n\nFor example If a player is off-role and loses got an S or A rating in the game they would have reduced or no Splash LP, If they lost with a D- (because they were trolling etc) they would lose More splash LP.  The Obverse could be true for wins, off role wins where a player performs well Splash more then ones where they perform worse. (these examples assume that a B rating is the \"average\" performance, which I don't actually know if that is the case).\n\nMy experience this season(compared to s8) has been one of very very very lopsided games, very few close games, Lots of AFKing, feeding, etc sometimes with the players explicitly acknowledging in chat that they are autofilled.

Our idea going in was there would be a good balance point, but we haven't reached it so far.\n\nThanks for the ideas!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phat Pat","date":"2019-03-02T06:10:00.556+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"So tired of blatant lies when it comes to ranked.  I've seen not one post, youtube video, Twitch streamer, tweet, or otherwise that would even remotely communicate that this ranked system is in a good state.  It has never, not one time, been in a good state.  I've played this game since season 1.  Ranked is trash.  It's not transparent, and does not feel good to play.  If I reach gold, I want to play and see gold.  Regardless of what mathematician at your office who thinks his uber neat algorithm is working well, and the ignorant yes men next to him telling him it's okay, it's not.  Just match me with and against gold only (or whatever my rank is).  I don't care what division.  Make the system make sense from the outside, otherwise it's frustrating, regardless of whether you think it works.\n\nLet's not talk about the clear ramp up of asshole players in ranked who find the need to type more than they last hit or ward.  The stark difference from normal game atmosphere and ranked is ridiculous.  The simple fact is players are not discouraged from raging or tilting in ranked.  They come into queues, already pissed from last game, looking for a reason to start letting loose on people. If it's more rampant in ranked, it needs to be punished harder and quicker.  \n\nLastly, let's talk about solo queue being anything but.  Why is duo queue allowed in solo queue?  It is abused every season in one form or another.  The players who abuse it are never punished because it's part of the system you created.  The whole motto \"League is more enjoyable with friends\" holds no weight here when the whole point of ranked is to uphold the competitive integrity of the game and see who's the better player.  There is NO way to properly calculate the relative skill of two players working together from champ select verse a blank slate of players on the enemy.  There's no enjoyment from a mid jungle bullying an enemy jungler who queued solo or a support/adc voice comming perfect engages against two randoms picking whatever their good at.  You can't state ranked is in a good place when you are choosing fun over competitive integrity in ranked.  As it stands, the current system makes me not want to touch this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FoxGlove","date":"2019-03-05T08:21:46.595+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I'm going to list the personal problems I had this season that caused me to just quit ranked.\n\n1. Match making - people this season are not where they should be.\n\n2. You can't carry a game anymore, you can go 30/4 but just because your team fucked up a bit you will lose.\n\n3. The game punishes you for doing good - the cs bounty system is just flawed in general, the whole point of league is to cs and get an advantage over your opponent but now if you cs right you will get into the situation where if you die you just lose because you give the enemy team way too much gold.\n\n4. The games are not competitive anymore, you either stomp the enemy or the enemy team stomp you. Sometimes you just lose because the enemy team has a better team comp even when you did good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QïQï","date":"2019-03-01T17:25:45.986+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I understand the benefits you supply with Position Ranks.

It was implemented because of the population drop from Season 8.  They had to rely on the auto-fill system.  It was also designed to hold players hands when they get autofilled.  So, it was a deceptive and strategic move by RIot.\n\nLeague turned into a casual game.  There's nothing competitive about it.  Season 8's \"Runes Reforged\" system was designed for casual players with all of the over-excessive damage, RNG elements, and overloaded kits from new/updated champions.  \n\nThe sad thing about this is that casual players don't enjoy the game either.  RIot is consistently making bad gameplay design.  Not only that, the balance team is non-existent.  \n\nSo, they tried to mask the problem by creating \"Clash.\"  However, that failed.  Then they tried to make a permanent Battle Royale mode for the casuals.  I don't know what happened to that. \n\nThe state of League of legends during Season 8 was so bad that the existing player base who were both competitive and casuals stopped playing the game.  Which is why Riot implemented positional rankings because they knew that they are going to be forced to rely on the \"auto-filled\" system. \n\n\n* Ghostcrawler leaves Lead Designer and is relocated to a new Riot Games' project.\n* Meddler gets the Lead position\n   * Meddler and his goons admit that the state of League is garbage\n* Tyler1 was gaining so much Twitch viewers, Riot had no choice but to unban him to help bring new players into League.\n* missions are forcing players to watch their LCS/World live streams and vods\n\n\n\nRiot has been in panic mode since Season 8.","replies":[{"poster":"ŚtrongMental","date":"2019-03-02T13:12:40.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Douglas Funnie,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=voxV8l2u,comment-id=0032,timestamp=2019-03-01T23:05:18.717+0000)\n> - missions are forcing players to watch their LCS/World live streams and vods\n\n> Riot has been in panic mode since Season 8.\n\nSimple fix for me, I stopped watching LCS//Worlds - Wont watch streams or vods :) I'll wait till there are reviews up on youtube about it, and then watch the breakdowns :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reserve","date":"2019-03-04T09:22:11.072+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait is this a serious post? I'm not sure if you can tell or not but it's not just a small pool of people having problems. From streamers, pro players, high tier players, and low tier players this season feels very off-putting. Sure people can get mad here and there for the occasional troll or bad team but this season it's far worse... It seems as though if you start losing it spirals into a 9-loss streak, while the win streaks sort of follow fashion. The games feel so one sides that it seems like the game victors were already decided as you clicked accept, and the picks don't even matter. Either the opposing team feels like they are just outright better than you, the opposing team has a smurf and your team gets stomped, or finally you just destroy the enemy nexus in 20 minutes. It feels like there is no balance to it anymore... no struggle in the game just a instant win or loss (usually due to skill difference, not even champion picks). Sure there may have been improvements, but it's time to actually have some clarity and talk with us, your players... the ones keeping this game alive. Stop forcing updates into our mouths because you think it's better. You said that upon release we could have a discussion of how the positional ranks are going, yet there hasn't been a single shed of light to us except decisions set in stone made behind closed doors. Obviously there is something wrong when 70+% of your daily posts are people begging you to revert these changes. Sure a decent amount might be from salty players... but a lot, and from a average rated player I can tell you nearly every one of my games this season has had a least one complaint about positional queue, of people truly do not enjoy it. I'm not saying to out-right revert it, but would it kill your for once in your entire history as a company to finally have some clarity with the community of at least HOW it works and the possibilities of fixing it? It's time to suck up your pride and take the loss on your behalf this time around. Truly, I only want what's best for this game... but it keeps getting harder and more frustrating the more I play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SearedXD","date":"2019-03-02T00:38:56.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey , good job changing what most people dislike ( positional rank lul ) . but there is this issue that hasnt been brought up yet and that is skipping of divisions. prior to s9 , when you have insanely high MMR , you can skip from for example , gold 5 > gold 3 > gold 1 ; however , right now , you cant and i think this is an issue. is there anyway for you guys to fix this ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Póles","date":"2019-03-01T21:42:25.328+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has here been any recent update on the state of clash?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Professor Zen","date":"2019-03-01T19:11:20.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ridiculous LP gains in the first couple of weeks have ruined Dia+ Soloq [EUW]. Hundreds and hundreds of players climbed ridiculously fast at the start of the season, to ranks WAY above their average from last season. Following this, you severely reduced LP gains as a means to 'fix' this issue, but instead what it's done is leave genuinely skilled players with an incredibly tedious climb, made worse by the appalling quality of games created by this issue. Realistically, I'm disappointed in the current state of Soloq. In the semi-pro scene, ranks are considered meaningless and teams are looking at last season ranks to make decisions. Loads of people refuse to even play soloq at all. I immediately placed in P1 (3-7 placements from D1 good MMR last season), went on holiday- and came back after the LP gains had been cut. It's honestly the worst experience imaginable trying to climb at this point (because of wildly inflated ranks which are not indicative of player ability at all), and I've been playing for years.\n\nIn juxtaposition- I have another account which was around D1-low masters MMR last season, which I haven't played soloq on until a couple of days ago- which now has ridiculously good MMR. Fundamentally, game quality is at an all-time low in diamond as a direct product of Riot's early-season mistakes. The only way to fix the issue created by allowing huge LP gains, then cutting them drastically after plat/low dia players abused the gains, is by resetting ranks for Diamond +. This is the only way of restoring some semblance of value to soloq, which has disappeared with mistakes made this season. The alternative is to leave things as they are, hope that the ranks will 'eventually sort themselves out' through the massive individual grinds of thousands of players, who are vocal about how negative their experience is each and every game. Please think of the players.\n\nSincerely,\nEvery national/regional league player ever\n\nEdit: Booking scrims is an absolute nightmare as ranks are so misleading, and I guarantee that if you  somehow obtain feedback from teams that scrim often using popular discord servers/skype chats/whatsapp groups to book, the response will overwhelmingly express a concern for the varying quality of games based on apparent ranks (In previous seasons, you knew roughly what level/quality of scrim you'd get if you booked with a full d1 team, for example).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smashed Hash","date":"2019-03-01T17:47:06.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you not mention the lower ladder?

Nobody I’m playing with likes them. I feel like my time and investment in this game is useless. Climbing is a super fun part of every year, and pretty much the only reason I log on unless my friends are on. I struggle to find a single part of Positional Ranks that actually works. It’s so cluttered and extra and over the top for no reason. Your rank used to be indactive of your skill as a player. That includes how well you handle champ select, auto fill, everything. Now it’s so focused, I feel like there’s no point. It’s caused a bigger divide in the community (jg mains, adc mains, etc) and opened a new door with new incentives for toxicity. I know perfection is impossible to achieve, but this just feels like change for changes sake. It isn’t functional, and there was nothing wrong with the previous ranked system. Hell, I’d very honestly take S4 ranked back when we had to call our roles in champ select over Positinal Ranked.\n\nI don’t have important numbers or data, all I know is that I’ve invested time, money, and most importantly a lot of heart into this game. A lot of my friends have. A lot of people we know have. Idk if we’re the minority, or the “little people.” All I know is it feels bad to play ranked. It feels useless to judge my skill in this game.\n\nIf a revert is in the table, and it is a sound decision that the team and community can get behind, I’d love that more than anything. I know not everyone can be happy, and maybe PR stays and myself and people like me are in that demographic, but I’m praying we luck out here and Ranked gets reverted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EloSIut","date":"2019-03-01T17:52:35.593+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've reached Diamond 4 few days ago with 58% winrate, started from g4 and played around 200 games.
