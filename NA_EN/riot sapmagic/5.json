Last week we [shared our thoughts](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/03/dev-state-of-ranked/) on Ranked and detailed several matchmaking and rank issues affecting players in Diamond and above. We're ready to share the timing of the partial Diamond+ reset and more details based on common questions.\r\n\r\n#Who is affected by the reset?\r\nDiamond+ players from **all ranked queues** in Riot and Garena regions.\r\n\r\n#When is the reset happening?\r\nWe’re planning to do the reset alongside **Patch 9.6** which will be early morning on **March 20** for Riot regions and **March 21** for Garena regions. We’re doing some final testing this weekend—if we encounter any major bugs, we’ll update this post accordingly. \r\n\r\n#How will the reset work?\r\nHere are the full details of the reset:\r\n\r\n- Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger players become Master 0 LP\r\n- Diamond players demote by one division, **floored** at Diamond IV\r\n- You keep rewards, but they’ll match your new rank\r\n- Grandmaster and Challenger lock until March 27 and April 3, respectively\r\n\r\n#How does the Diamond demotion work?\r\nIf you’re a Diamond player, here’s what will happen:\r\n\r\n- Diamond III, II, and I players are **demoted by one division**, preserving promotion series progress and LP\r\n- For Diamond I players in series, 2 wins or losses become 1 win or loss—for example, 2–2 becomes 1–1\r\n- Diamond IV players become Diamond IV 0 LP no matter what\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe expect the reset to help fix LP gains and losses for players in Diamond+. Having said that, since this partial reset _does_ affect MMR, it won’t be an immediate fix in terms of matchmaking quality, but we expect that to improve over the next few weeks as the ladder stabilizes.\r\n\r\nAs always, if you have questions that aren’t answered here or just have feedback on Ranked, let us know in the comments or hit me up [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RiotSapMagic). Thanks again for all your help and patience, and we’ll see you on the Rift!\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Maokai.png","replies":[{"poster":"edoa","date":"2019-03-16T01:44:09.040+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm already d4 0 LP get played riot {{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"yvMtq4k84l","date":"2019-03-16T02:27:00.534+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=edoa,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=wMEru8cE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-03-16T01:44:09.040+0000)\n>\n> I'm already d4 0 LP get played riot {{sticker:sg-ezreal}}\n\nWhat does this mean for us?","replies":[{"poster":"Clementine","date":"2019-03-16T02:42:21.168+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireBurnXD","date":"2019-03-18T20:46:53.603+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Jzjax , US you are gold bruv","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rain Blue Flames","date":"2019-03-16T01:30:38.259+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":22,"body":"I think u should reset every elo to Season 8 rank to make it  fair..But whatever its a start! :D","replies":[{"poster":"abdxd1","date":"2019-03-16T12:06:40.568+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":7,"body":"I'm currently Master (was diamond 2 in preseason before huge lp gains).

It is unbelievable that i get matched with grandmaster people that have 45>% win rate.  Back in season 2 and 3 the game was incredibly one sided towards splitpushing and abusing the tank meta.  0 macro whatsoever.  I finished d1 back in season 3.  That d1 is the equivalent of plat 5 at best today.  The game couldn't be more challenging at the moment, with 99% of the playerbase being veterans.","replies":[{"poster":"Nadatari","date":"2019-03-18T18:02:43.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"It kinda did!\nI started new account for quest rewards few months ago!

You go soloQ and you get autofilled support. No problem for you! You got Ezreal as your teammate on bot. You decide to see his profile while loading screen and look at that lvl 40, 1024 Mastery Points! No problem, either he is smurf or he really knows how to play!!! I mean, he wouldnt go and play ranked if he never picked Ez right? Only for him to spent whole game of 20 min, missing his q, jumping in Morganas q ( Morgana is their support ) and flame you since you cant \"protect\" him bcs you picked Sona. Hmm yeah! If only had that experience I had farming for runes maybe he could put one or two q on his enemy adc!! \n\nOr imagine this, you are in WoW, decided to do Mythic Raid! You have 20+ ppl in your raid group! You ask them if they ever did this Mythic, I mean you did it soo many times on normal, heroic and few times on Mythic so you prob know what you are doing, but still you ask to maybe help them understand better mechanic!! I mean, there is always, few who forget some mechanics so its safebet! Then you realize that atleast 10 ppl never did any raid, other 10 only did once or twice raid on normal ( and not the raid you are doing ) and you have only those few people that know mechanics! But since grinding/farming isnt skill nor is it accounted to BUILDING FOR SKILLS you will probably start that raid right? I mean in WoW you grind equipments doing dungeons, keys, raids and slowly going on harder and harder difficulty? You probably wont start doing Mythic if you have never done Normal first?\n\nIf there were restrictions to ranked that were harsher ( like they were before ) maybe we wouldnt have soo many toxicity?\n\nBtw, if you can't find connection between grinding for levels/runes and EXPERIENCE gained in that grinding then I really feel sorry for you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GodOfTeemo10PT","date":"2019-03-18T19:21:17.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank meta was one meta like others in season 3 or 2 like the support with ignite stiling(stolling?steeling)) your kills and stuff like that.

However, if they re both in range, the enemy did something wrong. So focusing the enemy carry in every fight without exceptions is an extremely bad advice.\n\n>So why are tanks so hated?

Tank meta is the healthiest meta this game has.\n\nAlso, there seems to be a thing that you don't understand... Garen is not a tank, no matter what he builds. Tanks are defined by their kits, not by their items. Champions like garen, darius and mundo are not tanks. They are juggernauts, which is a subclass of fighter/bruiser. Tanks can take damage and they either have strong engage abilities or strong peel abilities (so vanguards or wardens). Malphite and zac are vanguards, tanky champions that have strong engage. Maokai and nautilus are wardens, tanky champions with good peeling abilities. Garen, darius and mundo are tanky champions with high damage but lack cc and gapclosers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xbloodthirster","date":"2019-03-16T01:38:04.742+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":7,"body":"+++","replies":[]},{"poster":"RCN Psclly","date":"2019-03-18T18:40:21.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=whitebeard2,realm=EUNE,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=wMEru8cE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-16T01:30:38.259+0000)\n>\n> I think u should reset every elo to Season 8 rank to make it  fair..But whatever its a start! :D\n\nNot good for people who have improved greatly over time :/\nI have worked really hard the last few months, and I can confidently say I am above Diamond 1 level.

A reset would mean you would get placed around Silver 4/ Bronze 1. Thats how the fkc resets works, placing you a tier strenght down as how Challengers and Grandmasters get allr eseted to Master. That would be an equal power down, not just a division cause a division in low elo is nearly nothing compared to a divsion in Diamond.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Sleep On Stream","date":"2019-03-16T15:12:15.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2019-03-16T17:07:42.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you didn't play season 8, season 7, any season before (cause not even one season shows you even near plat) and you complain over ranked even if you not play?

The only people that are really complaining about it are the onese that don't belong there in the first place.\n\n######Also gj getting your own thread nuked\nhttps://l56spuxk1t14k3seci6s2bja-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GIF-laughing-funny-LOL-haha-hehe-hilarious-fun-happy-laugh-Kevin-Malone-Brian-Baumgartner-The-Office-GIF.gif","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-03-20T23:48:48.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Us under Diamond also want the reset.
