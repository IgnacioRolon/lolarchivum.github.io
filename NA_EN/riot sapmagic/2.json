Ranked‌ ‌has‌ ‌been‌ ‌out‌ ‌for‌ ‌a‌ ‌little‌ ‌while‌ ‌now,‌ and things are looking pretty good overall. Even so, we’re‌ ‌taking‌ ‌stock‌ ‌and‌ making ‌a‌ ‌few‌ ‌tuning‌ ‌adjustments.‌ Specifically, a couple ‌inconsistencies‌ ‌have‌ ‌made‌ ‌it‌ ‌a‌ ‌little‌ ‌more‌ ‌forgiving‌ ‌than‌ ‌we‌ ‌intended,‌ ‌so‌ ‌we're‌ ‌making‌ ‌the following changes **which are heading to PBE for testing before we push them to live**:‌ ‌ ‌\n ‌\n#Demotion Protection\nIn TFT, you’re supposed to demote if you lose at 0 LP in any given division (barring a few rare exceptions) as a tradeoff for the lack of promotion series you see in other League ranked queues. Due to a bug, we weren't demoting players during their first couple games after promoting. **From now on, you'll be demoted if you lose LP if you were at 0 LP when the game started.**\n\n#Challenger/Grandmaster Demotion Protection (Also Affects Other Ranked Queues)\nFor players in Challenger and Grandmaster, you’re supposed to demote into Masters if you are at 0 LP at the end of the day, and then demote back to Diamond if you lose at 0 LP in Master. However, when there aren't enough Masters or Grandmaster players, it results in a situation where Challenger players can't demote. **Moving forward, when you lose LP while at 0 LP in GM or Challenger you'll immediately be demoted to Diamond 1.** One last note—we're making this change across all ranked queues, not just TFT.\n\n#LP Adjustments\nIn concert with the changes to demotion protection, we're making a few other tweaks to LP calculations to prevent extreme edge cases where you could gain more LP than you should. For the most part, you will not see or feel any changes based on this optimization.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's it! We're still building this thing with you, so please continue sharing feedback as we go through the first beta season of Ranked. Don't forget to have fun, and we'll see you in the arena!\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Maokai.png","replies":[{"poster":"TheWutangRZA","date":"2019-08-07T03:32:15.758+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi, I'm a challenger player in NA, and can I just say I thoroughly hate this change? What is the point of GM and master if one bad game means dropping all the way from challenger to D1? What is the point of the daily promotion/demotion timer?\n\nAs someone currently sitting at the lower end of challenger it just makes me not want to queue at all, which I imagine isn't the intent. Like, this actually just makes me want to walk away entirely from the game.\n\nA loss at 0 LP will result in instant demotion from challenger to D1, but being above the LP cut in Master isn't going to result in instant promotion to GM or challenger. What exactly is the point of the promotion/demotion countdown now???\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I'd be fine with it in situations like NA GM right now, where it's literally impossible to demote, but in challenger right now in NA everything is working just fine. Players below the LP threshold get demoted, those above in GM get promoted. Why exactly should a loss at 0 LP challenger result in instant demotion, not to GM, not to Master, but all the way to D1--especially when there's no instant promotion back up; still have to wait for the cutoff. Seems extremely punitive for no reason.\n\nJust to point out to those who might think I'm just being a crybaby. It's possible to lose upwards of 80 LP for an 8th place in challenger. Currently, 80 LP is rank 82 on the ladder. That means nearly every single player in challenger in NA other than the top 80 are one loss and one 5th away from being Diamond again. That's absurd. Just a reminder, not everyone in challenger is an esports streamer that plays 8 hours a day. As a person with real life obligations, I can safely say that if I have two bad games in a row and immediately drop to Diamond, I just won't touch TFT again. I think most people who are currently in D1 or those who were some combination of skilled/lucky enough to make it out have near PTSD with being D1 again. \n\nThe inherent variance that exists in a game like TFT makes an instant demotion from challenger to D1 after 2 losses insane. If I don't deserve challenger because there are 300 better players on the ladder, then so be it, I'll get demoted once the timer hits zero if I can't maintain the LP required to be in challenger. But losing 2 games in a row doesn't suddenly mean a top 100 TFT player is now a Diamond player.\n\nFinal point:\n\nIf Riot is insistent on these sorts of changes, I would say that master should be the lowest someone can drop to. One of the biggest feelings of accomplishment for a semi-casual player in Hearthstone is reaching Legend. Once you do it, you're legend for the rest of the season. You made it and no one can take that away from you. Sure, you might not be a top 100 Legend, but that wasn't why you played in the first place--you set a goal, to make it to Legend, and you achieved it and it feels good.\n\nIf I demoted to master either due to decay or bad play, cool, I'll fire the game up the next day and give it my best. But if I demote to D1, the equivalent of dropping from Legend in HS to rank 1, I will just quit. No one wants to do that grind again. Doing it once was a huge challenge, and cresting that mountain felt immensely rewarding. If you shove me off the cliff after I've reached the top, I'm not climbing the mountain again. I'm going to go look for something else to do.\n\n**If you really want to see challenger queues skyrocket, the solution isn't to punish and frustrate your players. It's to provide a backstop for them so they don't dread losing what they've worked for.**","replies":[{"poster":"surtrdotu","date":"2019-08-07T05:08:39.954+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've heard the opinions of many fellow challenger players and every single one feels the same way, these changes feel horrible and discourage queuing up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vrontis","date":"2019-08-07T12:52:14.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the \"and one 5th away\"\nIs the lp losing on 4th and 3rd place also a thing up there?

ESPECIALLY when the game changes every week, you must be a challenger level player throughout any change the game makes. (P.S. hearthstone ladder resets every month and you start at the equivalent of diamond 4 if you are a legend...)\n\nhaving the mindset to \"just quit and do something else if i drop out of challenger\" is such a rotten, non-competitive attitude that doesn't really fit a pro-level player...\n\nanother thing: he clearly states that if you were at 0 lp gm/challenger by the end of the day, you demote to masters and the highest lp masters move up. because there are not enough masters/gm/challenger players, no one could demote out of gm/challenger. once the slots fill up, anyone at 0 lp would have demoted to masters... and if they lost at 0 lp masters they demote to diamond 1 -- it's the same thing, they are just future proofing it to prevent immunity when it's this early into the season.","replies":[{"poster":"TheWutangRZA","date":"2019-08-07T20:20:48.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Orgs scouting players? Pro player? We're talking about TFT here. It isn't some serious esport, it's a fun little children's strategy game.\n\nAs far as demotions, they're working just fine in challenger in NA. If you finish below the LP cutoff in challenger you get demoted down to GM. The only issue in GM right now is that it isn't full, and so there is currently no way to demote out of GM. That problem will rectify itself in around a week or two once GM fills up.\n\nSo right now, it's already entirely possible to demote from challenger. After these changes though, if you finish 8th and then 5th (a reasonable expectation in a game with as high of variance as TFT when playing against the strongest players in the world), you will be instantly demoted from challenger not when the nightly ladder update happens, not to GM, not to Master, but to D1.\n\nThat's ridiculous.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-08-07T21:06:12.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so very true you might as well stop at some lp to preserve your challenger rank (not 0 lp due to this dumb change) the fact it turns from King to Elo hell is over yes one game is trolling the player who basically put their hands in fire to earn this reward.\n\nits like going on a long wary journey then  \"FINALLY im here the Lost City Of 'insert name here'\" then suddenly your buddy trips over the gates are shut forever due to some mistake, what happened next is a trap door plunges you into another journey (diamond 1). thats how i see this change as. punishing high performance players for 1 lost game. its bad design imo. im just a Silver player but i see this as outrageous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NigerianFoxLickr","date":"2019-08-07T13:57:26.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Unfortunately, Riot doesn't listen to anyone except sometimes streamers.

Losing close to 100lp for an 8th is punishing enough, risking dropping 3 tiers will just make me never wanna queue ever again and I know for a fact that i am not alone having these thoughts. I will just let my account sit and let everyone else demote because they have a couple of lowroll games in a row.\n\nDropping hundreds of lp a day is normal in tft and it happens to the best of us. Even some of the current top players in the game who make it to 500+ lp and compete in tournaments are now low challenger/gm because they are just simply having a bad day. Them dropping to diamond is not only unfair for them but also unfair for the people in diamond who struggle to hit masters or even gm/challenger since they have to play vs players that are just out of their league.\n\nWith this new system, people from diamond to challenger will just rotate. And there wont be as much competition for reaching high lp on the ladder because of the fear of low challenger players dropping 3 tiers at low lp. And i know for a fact that people will just play on their other accounts while they are safe and make the cut, resulting in challengers crushing low elo in unfair and demotivating games for both parts.

You can also gain 75 lp for taking first, because honestly it's really impressive to beat all 7 other people.

The same goes for losses, when you can lose almost nothing of lp or just lose like 70lp in one game.\n\nIts a mess, we need more clarity on how this is calculated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1M Gold Udyr XD","date":"2019-08-07T08:05:23.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please remove tier promotion.

Also some items were not working correctly... For example guardian angel made the champion die when coming back without taking any damage.\n \nAlso the balance of the drops are very random and inconsistent... One player could have it all while other have nothing. How can a player be so lucky to have 3 champs fully levelled up (9xchampions) of the same early game? Why can't other players be that lucky on their investment? Also i have noticed that sometimes i get gold instead of an item like everyone else... The drops, the item rewards are just very unbalanced, this should be improved. The drop ratio should be increased for the classes/types of champions that i am selecting along the game. Sometimes the game will simply never give the champion that we invested for a specific strategy while others are just 100 points from start to late game because they have 3 level 3 gold champions and many atk speed, ap, mana items and are unbeatable due to luck and getting what they want while others stay in inferior position with weak drops that are against their composition strategy.. sometimes it feels too RND for a ranked game mode :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gamod","date":"2019-08-07T06:10:22.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel that lp gain is inconsistent...
