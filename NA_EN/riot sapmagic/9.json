We’ve been pretty blown away so far by TFT’s reception—a _ton_ of you are trying to play TFT. Unfortunately, that excitement means our servers are under a lot of stress in some regions and we’ve encountered a few issues as a result. In this post, I want to detail the issues and what we’ve been doing to fix them.\r\n\r\n#Issue: Unusually long off-peak queue times for North America\r\nShortly after we went live in North America, it looked like our servers were overloaded even though we were below capacity. We were also seeing some unusual errors in North America and a few other regions that we hadn’t seen in OCE and JP. We started looking at configuration differences between our servers and found all the regions with the errors had a slightly different configuration and we used that info to identify the problem.\r\n\r\n**Status:** A fix was implemented around 1:00 am Pacific Time (UTC -7) Thursday and the server looks healthy. We will continue to monitor over the next few days to make sure North America stays stable.\r\n\r\n#Issue: Unusually long queue times and players unable to play other game modes in EUW \r\nThe configuration bug from North America thankfully didn’t affect EUW, but as we approached peak hours throughout Europe we saw instability and long queue times as a result of tons of players queueing up for games. We implemented queue time delays, but still saw issues crop up with the services that power parties and matchmaking. We temporarily disabled the queue while we investigated those issues.\r\n\r\n**Status:** It took a couple tries but we identified a fix which is now live and EUW is looking relatively stable. We will be continuing to monitor the region for other issues throughout the weekend.  \r\n\r\n#Other Regions\r\nWe expected the issues we saw in EUW to affect other large regions, so we temporarily delayed TFT’s launch in a few places to give us time to find a solution. Now that we have fixes in place, our plan is to finish deploying Teamfight Tactics to all our remaining regions within the next few hours.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, if we encounter any issues in those regions, we may need to take actions to preserve server stability, up to and including temporarily disabling TFT.\r\n\r\n#Going Forward\r\nWe’re cautiously optimistic that queue times and demand will stabilize, and we’ll continue to keep you updated through the client, boards, and on social media. For up-to-the-minute info about all things Teamfight Tactics, check out [Riot MapleNectar](https://www.twitter.com/RiotMapleNectar) or [Riot SapMagic](https://www.twitter.com/RiotSapMagic) on Twitter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese issues have been painful to say the least, but on behalf of the team, thank you so much for your excitement—and more importantly, your patience—as we find and fix them. If you’re seeing other problems that aren’t captured here, or you just have feedback about Teamfight Tactics, let us know in the comments.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help, and we’ll see you in the arena.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Maokai.png","replies":[{"poster":"Keikomatsui ","date":"2019-06-28T21:35:19.416+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hope y'all are looking at the RNG item mechanics in place right now and how they create an incredibly feelbad experience for players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-06-30T22:25:04.776+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some TFT feedback after spamming it over the last few days:\n\n #**Tech:**\n\n- Melee units often stand around doing nothing cause they can't be bothered to move 1-2 tiles to find something in range\n- Melees after reviveing with GA do nothing if they don't have anything in range, they just won't move to seek targets\n- Zephyr + assasins causes issues with the AI cause assasins complete their jump while also getting into stasis\n- Sometimes two units occupy the same tile\n- Targeting for line-skillshots needs work, especially on ahrie and varus, they should try to hit as many targets as possible. I often see them going for a single target then another angle would have hit 2+ targets, sometimes they even aim for out of range targets.\n- Heal/shield stuff should target the lowest %hp ally, not the lowest total hp ally. Lulu and nida often use their skills on a squishy in the backline that isn't attacked at all beacuse it still has less Max hp than the 50% Chogath, it get's worse if elise and her spiderlings are involved, as they will always waste your heals and stuff, makeing elise even worse than she already is.\n- We need more information to the units, show ALL stats, not just HP and the basevalues of the abillity. Especially knowing what exactly AP does for each unit would be important so you can judge if giving them an AP item makes any sense.\n- I'd love to have a toggle for showing the grid mid fight, would help alot to actually see what happens and eventually adjust your formation.\n-----------\n # Lore \n(or how well mechanics/iconics were transitioned from LoL into TFT)\n\n- Why use arbitrary classes and origins instead of useing the LoL lore and class systems? There are enough regions/groups in lol lore to give a proper framework, and maybe exept for marksmen, the class/subclass system would give enough to work with in this kind of game. Just feels like a missed opportunity.\n- Why use wiered items instead of those that exist on the rift and are iconic to most players? Some examples would be redbuff instead of sunfire as armor/hp, or cursed blade instead of wit's end as AS+MR item\n- Why are the damagetyps and scaleings of many champs fucked up? I get giveing AP ratios to all to make use of the random item drops, but why does garen spin for magic damage while getting immune to magic? Why doesn't he have ad ratios or crit on it makeing ad items usless on him? Feels more like you reskinned juggernaut from dota rather than actually turning garen into a atochess piece. At the same time, for some reason Volibear's Ult does physical damage, procs on-hit and scales of AD for no reason at all. Why not keeping them as close as possible to the actuall LoL version? And those two are just few of the examples...\n------------------------\n#Gameplay\n- to much RNG**\n-** Item balance is off, some items are just to strong and off-items overall are just to impactfull while tank-items feel lackluster\n- base AS of most pieces feels to bad, which is why AS items are dominant\n- Managain beeing dps based makes dps(especially AS) items rather strong and even better than actuall mana items for getting mana.\n_i'd love to see some simply mp/5 here_\n- Managain overall seems to low, on many pieces you **need** mana items just so they have a chance of useing theri skill befor dieing, and if they don't get to lvl 2 there is no chance at all. Katarina for example is usless if you don put alot effor into her cause it takes years for her to get the mana. _I think managain really needs to be looked at given how crucial the abillities are_ \n- The field is to small, running melee heavy comps(without assasins) just ends up with your setup spreading damage and/or blocking each other while ranged setups focus down one target. Also, high ranged units in the corner are impossible to deal with without rnage your self you just can't reach them and the field is to small to lure them out.\n- Tankiness gets outscaled rather hard, both cause most of the fitting pieces are low tier and the trait boni are flat and fall of later. Probably doesn't help that tank items are shit either, with belt giving 25-35% hp on a lvl 1 piece while BF grants 40-50% more damage.\n- I really love the idea of shared drafts, but items beeing so impactfull twists the purpose of the shared draft imo, everyone just looks for the item he needs and sells the piece. It hardly ever gets used to get a certain champ for your setup.\n_ I think there should ether be differnt drafts for items and champions, or atleast seperate the item from the champ after it's picked so you don't have to sell it. Takeing items away without selling pieces would be awsome anyway._\n- The neutrall dragons beeing immune to magic feels unfair for caster setups\n- some units are really underpowered(elise and the guardians) while some others are absurdly strong(hello Draven)\n- Looses cost a bit much HP, especially on early loosing streaks. You take damage for every enemie piece left at the end, which is the same as in DAC, so far so good, but in addition you get another 2-3 damage no matter what, just why? it basically doubles the damage you take from earily losses and feels uneccesarily punishing.\n- XP costs at higher lvls are to big. 70g to get from 8 to 9 is insane and even the 46 from 7 to 8 is rather harsh. This makes lvls rather snowbally as really need a solid winningstreak to ever get lvl 9. and even lvl 8 often feels out of reach in a bad run.\nTo comparision, in dota you need 48xp(60g) TOTAL to reach lvl 8, 100g total for lvl 9 and 150g for lvl 10, in TFT you need 114 total for lvl 8 and 184 ttoal for 9, so you need more gold to reach lvl 8 than you need in DAC to reach lvl 9.\nThis heavily favours RNG over strategie, cause you can't reliable reach the needed level to finish your composition(the least rng impacted part). In DAC, i often just survive till lvl 9 and then can turn it around with many synergies in a good setup. in TFT, i just never get to that point cause without an already strong setup, you don't get enough gold for the levels. I really wish levles were a bit less expensive later on, 40 and 60 would be more than enough for lvl 8/9\n- I love the spatula and i wish it had a better droprate or everyone starting with one. The class/origin giving items are by far the most interesting thing in comapred to DAC and i want more of that. I'm also fine with max-lvl beeing 9 rather than ten for that. I just dislike hurricane, i'd prefer more class/origin items instead and it also feels very random to have it built from negatron. We still lack items for brawler, gunslinger, ranger, noble, imperial(maybe to strong i guess), pirat, guardian, dragon, wild, elementalist and yordel\n\n\n-  **Far to much RNG:**\n\n - The setup you draft is alot RNG, which is fine as that's the core concept of that mode. However, unlike autochess, there are no mechanics in place to mitigate that. Maybe i'm wrong, but it doesn't feel like TFT uses a shared pool, cause i frequently face multiple people haveing the same pieces on lvl3 while i struggle getting a piece that only i use to lvl 2.\nTher are no 'joker' units like [Io](https://dotaautochess.gamepedia.com/Io) in TFT, Neeko or a poro would be fitting imo\nIn DAC, if you reroll pieces they can't appear in the directly following draft, which helps a bit at mitigateing RNG on rerolls.\n - Item drops beeing a per minion RNG is horrible\n_Imo DOTA Underlords does this the best, you can choose one out of 3 items on a win and get 1 random on a loss. This could be modified to allow for more than 1 if it's to few items overall. You still have RNG in what items you get, but atleast you always have the same amount and can slightly mitigate the RNG by picking 1 of 3(with the current 8 coponents, still only 37.5% chance for a specific drop, so certainly not to reliable)_\n - Crit chance(seriously, WHY?!?). don't mind a small varity in AA damage like DotA has, but crit goes way to far. I think up to 10% more damage would be fine and not to impactfull.\n - Assasins(and IE aswell as PD) amping the impact of crit RNG into infinity. _Why not just give Assasins (hybrid)flat pen? No need for RNG, works for the more abillity focused ones aswell and fits by makein them beeing stronger vs squishys than tanks. _\n - Bladmasters haveing a 35% chance,_ why not simply proc ever 3ed hit instead? (Nearly)same average but independent of luck_\n - Gunslingers haveing a 50% chance, _why not just trigger every other hit for basically the same effect with no RNG?_\n - Rangers haveing a 35%/65% chance to double their AS for some time, _why not give them simply a %AS increase, or every X-sec, they gain double AS for Y-sec rather than haveing vayne going godmode one fight and beeing a ranged minion the next_\n - Yordles haveing dodge chance. _Either let them dodge every X hits or similar to rangers get 100% dodge chances every X-sec for Y-sec_\n - Demons mana burn beeing chance based, _why not a small flat amount like kassa? Though i'd prefer a different mechanic anyway, manaburn feels very punishing given how crucial abillities are at the current tuneing of the game. Especially most frontline pieces are totally usless if they face manaburn cause nearly all of theit power is in the abillity. It's bad enough how devastateing a single kassadin can be if not focused down quickly, not need for more of that._\n - Worst of it all, Glacial stun chance. If RNGsus loves those guys, it doesn't matter what you do, your setup is stunlocked and GG. no tactic or anything involved(elementals in DAC atleast only work vs melees) RNG based CC is terrible, and i can't think of a way to make that CC reliable without also beeing broken. CC is such a powerfull tool for a trait..._maybe change it into a movment+as slow._\n - items like sush, SotD or cursed blade also are RNG based with piotentially huge impact\n - Targeting and movment also is somewhat random, which is fine, but it's worth noteing cause there is enough variance in the base mechanics so you don't need to slap RNG onto every perk in sight. Two fights with the same setups wouldn't play out the same even if you didn't have all that RNG ","replies":[{"poster":"Sephi51","date":"2019-07-01T17:08:57.221+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your post.

Never played Autochess before so I'm not certain what is or isn't supposed to be a part of the game.  But here are some thoughts.\n\n1) The balance on the origins or whatever they're called probably need to be looked at.  Some just seem way too strong while others seem too weak.  Now I understand that some are supposed to be transitional groups and aren't meant for late game.  But even then, some of the origins just feel useless.\n\n2) Loot drop.  I get there's a degree of RNG in the game, but where the wheel of rotating champions gets refreshed so frequently it more or less evens out.  I've played a few games where I've got 1 completed item where my opponent has 2 completed and a base item or similar.  That just seems excessive.  I think the game would be more fun if the loot came at certain points so the randomness comes more from how you use what you're given rather than just praying you get something.  Or let loot drop rate be something you can invest in somehow.\n\n3) Something's not quite right with either your AI or your graphics.  Several times I've had my pieces just sort of stand there doing nothing rather than fight.  Maybe they were stunned?  But if they were I did not see what stunned them and they had no indication that they were.  It just seems buggy.

At some point, I made a switch to a different comp, but had to replace 4 units simultaneously. I was very confident that that comp was the strongest in the board and would bring me from last spot to a possibly winning position(or at least keep me in the game for a long time). We get into a carusel round, I get first pick and grab an item that I needed, happy that my comp would benefit so much. THEN I GET THE 5 SECOND TIMER and don't make the switch in time. I'm matched with the top dawg and get knocked out of the game. I'm forced to wait for my friends to finish(who end up dueling in the end - making me wait for a VERY long time) without being able to talk to them(the voice client threw me off the party) regardless if I was able to spectate their fights, without being able to see the choices they made(so I only saw the part that's boring to me).\nThis is the base experience that I'd like to stop having with TFT.\n\n1) Voice Chat client and spectate tool(these go together):\n\nThis is the first and most annoying issue: We cannot use discord or any other client in my play group, because a friend's computer is a toaster and cannot run both LOL and a voice chat client at the same time without major fps issues. That means that when we play TFT we have to use the in-game client. And whenever someone loses, he gets disconnected. \nThat leads to horrible situations, like being in a winning position with your friends having lost and being unable to talk to them, so they have to wait for you, and you're now playing alone.  Or losing fast and being unable to keep talking to your friends. We need people to not disconnect from the party, regardless if they chose to spectate or not, and if they chose so they should be given the option to leave the party afterwards in the lol client ui. \nThis way it will not be a pain for groups of friends to play together and they won't have to rely on a bad spectate tool(they should be able to see draft options and money etc so that they can partake and discuss options and be relevant in the game discussion.  There could be an argument that this makes ranked games a liability since you can be boosted, by being helped with choices, but that's something that can be done with just sharing screens with skype or discord, so I think that should that argument arise, it shouldn't hold much ground.\n\n\n2) Little Legends and the Carusel Round:\nI play DOTA Underlords and really love how sleep and crisp the UX is. Then I come back to TFT and my most useful tool(the mouse) is bound to moving a useless figure that does not contribute in the game in any meaningful way(the carusel round was probably invented to address this rather than the other way round). I do find the legends really cute(I also bought one) and I think there should be such a way for RIOT to monetise the game, and since the legends are already in, I think there are other ways that the models can be used, and even improved, to maintain income for the game, while freeing up mouse space: I could see, for example, having the LL standing by the arena being silly, and having emotes affect him, and maybe replace pings with purchasable(or unlockable) emotes that can bring the LL to the mid and have them do something silly like bm the enemy or whatever. \nThat being said, I don't like the carusel rounds either. I much prefer the way Underlords handles neutral rounds, with a choice being given and the player using what they think is best for their current plan, or taking a build-around and plan accordingly.  The carusel has some nice elements to it, namely player interaction(**** YOU GOT MY SPATULA!) which can be fun, but other than that, I feel like it's just there to make use of the little legends being around. I don't know if being built on the league client forces having to control a single unit(I guess that's the reason we have the same mechanic in the mod version of the dota AC, but not in the mobile or underlords) but even the company that originally made it steered away from having a unit to move and just put their champion figure beside the battlefield).\nAlso, the time after a carusel round is remarkably low. You get off your screen, so that you no longer can see your board and current items to  help you make a choice, AND you get thrown back into a fight with only a 5 sec timer, being unable to make use of what you just chose. I've lost games because of lack of mechanics, for not being fast enough to make a transition from one comp to another, and that's horrible for an auto-chess game. We need time to think and make decisions.  I think that underlords has hit a really sweet spot in their timers before and after combat.\nAs for the carusel round itself, I don't think that it offers enough player interaction to justify it's existence, nor player choice, and I'd much rather have a board pop up in my screen and giving me a choice to pick, or even have a selection of picks just like the carusel round being given to the players, and having the option to chose unlock consecutively beginning with the last player upwards, giving a total of 1 minute, with the most time on the last player, and then 5 seconds each to make a choice.\n\nApart from the above, this is a game that's awesome to play on mobile as well as PC, mobile provides a huge player-base compared to PC. Having the carusel there doesn't help expanding to the mobile market.\n\n3)RNG!\nGetting random amount of items from neutral rounds is, imo, horrible rng. Getting the same amount of items is really important, especially if you want to implement ranked play. Getting 3-4 items from the 3 neutral rounds for a lucky person against 0 items for an unlucky one makes for a really bad game experience, especially when you start playing for points. Some rng is nice(like have a small chance for a bonus item starting on the 3rd round - or having the items revamped and finding another way. Regardless, I feel that the randomness of the champions offered is random enough, and little randomness should be added in the items section, especially when items here are affecting the game more than others(being able to equip 3 on a carry and have them carry you through).\n\n4)Information, Time, Items and other stuff.\n\nI'll gather all other stuff here, as they feel secondary to me, and if the above were fixed I'd be really happy with TFT, regardless of whether x mechanic makes y auto-chess game have more depth or not than tft, etc.\n\n-Information: Having no information on Champion stats, damage meters, and all the cool stuff that auto-battlers have is not good for a game where choices, rather than mechanics matter. If you can't make an informed/educated choice, a huge part of the game is lost. People should be able to click on units and see their armour,attack speed, range, mitigation(mouse over armour) etc and be able to make informed choices in the game. Have an encyclopedia with items, recipes, champions, factions etc(just like Underlords). Give us damage meters, healing meters, stats on item dmg etc. Lol has some top notch game infographics in the base game(rune statistics, post-game statistics etc), give us some of that in-game so that we can make better choices.\n\n-Time:\nSlow the game down a little bit, give us some more time to make choices, and remove time not looking at our boards(carusel rounds) so that we can be constantly evaluating our next moves. Not all timers need extending, most are good where they are, but some, like the post-carusel timers are really short and make for a really bad experience losing a round(or even the game) just because you had 5 seconds which are not enough to reroll, make a choice and reposition your board.\n\n-Items:\nAs for items, I like the choices that we have, but it feels like we're always building a hyper-carry, with 3 slots per champion. I don't know if it would be better to have less slots or different items, but it does feel like there's more power to the individual, than the comp, which I don't really like for an auto-chess game. I like having comps matter more. I like the items so far(although I would like to be able to see recipes in-game and not have to alt-tab to Scarra's cheat sheet to see what combines into what) but I'd rather see some more power in the group compared to the individual. It's teamfight tactics, and protect-the-hyper-carry should be just one of them, I think.\n\nThanks for reading! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ALTIERl","date":"2019-06-29T13:36:54.211+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be beneficial for the state of the game to have less RNG influence that can easily auto win or lose you the game. Beyond RNG there are some factors that still decide the course of the game and should be looked at. In this brief discussion I will go over some things I have found to be annoying and overlooked in Teamfight Tactics, for example:\n\n1) Establish an exact number of items each player gets each PvE round. Sometimes one player ends up getting 4 items on stage one and other 0. This leads to that first player winning almost every fight in the early stages of the game and either winning the game or placing in the Top 3. By having control of what each player gets each stage, every player will have the same amount of items and the gamemode won't feel unjust and punishable for not making mistakes. (Items should be RNG'd though but not the amount)\n\n2) I think the Pirates class needs to be addressed as it might be the least played class. The benefit is close to none when taking in account the champions one has to buy in order to achieve its goal. Graves is an extremely weak frontliner and gunslinger, Gangplank rarely appears in the champion pool (might be a bug), Pyke is an assassin which has no synergy with any of the last two mentioned and Miss Fortune appears late game  where gold income rarely matters. Pirates bonus skill should be addresses to read something else like \"When all Pirates Have used their Ability, call in an artillery (Gnakplank's Ult) \" or \"If you have 3 Pirates, at the end of each turn gain 15% chance to 'dig out' a treasure (Treasure contains three things: Gold, Champions and Items. The player chooses one by walking over it) or \"After every pirate who is available have used their ability, they each eat an Orange and heal for 25% of their Health). Maybe, I am being biased and still haven't found a correct way to make them function, but it seems everytime i try to go full pirate I end up losing  in the Bottom 3 because I can't compete with any of their comps. It seems to me that Pirates, the way they are now, are just too slow and a waste of gold and time.\n\n3) Also, players should be able to get experience for playing the gamemode. They should also be able to complete their Missions by playing TFT.\n\n4)I am sure people would also enjoy for their collected champion skins to be available for play and choosing in TFT. (This should come later when players get a full grasp of the Origin and Class of the champions as most skins drastically change the look of the champions and might cause confusion for new players.)\n\n5) An urgent change that should be made is an Item List Keybind. A preset \"TAB\" keybind should be added as soon as possible so it opens up a list, at any point of the game, which details the build path of each item prioritizing the ones you have available to build. This is one of the things I have found the most tedious.\n\n6) Players should be able to see the champions card (where it details the champ, its name, its origin and its class) in the champion roulette. This should be helpful for both experienced and new players.\n\n7) It would also be helpful for the champion's card to contain a detailed description of the champ before buying the champ. Such as Base HP, Base Mana, Base Attack Speed. Base AD, Base Armor, Base MR, Attack Range by Units, etc.\n\n8) I suggest toning down some items or limiting their equipped amount per champ and per game as some items tend to see play every game and some rarely see play. However, it should be done later in the game when it comes out of beta state and the meta settles.\n\n9) In some cases some champions bug out, they stand still without attacking a near enemy or they don't try to walk around allies to fight an enemy, instead they wait for another ally to die to start attacking or moving. So, AI pathing has to be adjusted generally.\n\n10) I do not think any champion balance changes should be made this early, not until some of the changes i mentioned are made as it would shift drastically the way games are played  (Unless it fulfills _Number 11_  ). Players are still experiencing TFT and the common \"This champ/item/origin/class/composition is broken\" argument will always be thrown out as players tend misuse the term \"broken\" constantly. Some players argue that Draven is overpowered or \"broken\" because it tends to win most matchups against other ranged attackers. However, we have to look carefully and notice that Draven is a 4 Cost champion who appears late game and as the rest of the 4 Cost champions, he is designed to be strong.  Just as any ranged attacker form other costs, Draven too struggles against other 4-Cost champions. A player investing in a 4 cost Champion should be rewarded a little bit more than players investing in lower level champions. It is the logical hierarchical  design of the game.\n\n\n11) This being said, I think you should give players more time to explore and understand the game better to make drastic changes. Arguments that are constantly mentioned and fall within the parameters of reason and what the game is not trying to do, (scenarios which ruin the game drastically and consistently  at a high pace) should be accounted for. \n\nThese are some of the comments I had to make about the game, Nevertheless it's an incredibly entertaining gamemode.

Ok, this one is a classic but is so needed i'm gonna put it on the list too. ITEMS RNG: I'm ok with the RNG being on what item you get but NOT on chances of actually getting them, it should be the same amount of items per neutral wave for every player in the game. OR, you make another \"resource\" to spend over than gold, like, i dunno, \"scraps\"?!, and killing neutrals gives you (the same for everyone) some of that and you spend it on items (that's the least RNG ever but may have problems like everyone not having to adapt and just running the same comp with the same items even more than nowdays)\n\n2. Getting high level units is a bit too good over synergies most of the time, early-middle mostly. People just start to put in the most units he manage to get in high amount, level those up and even with like ONE small synergy (like all random an maybe 2 wilds or 2 knights and that's it) they stomp everyone. (yep, that's why hyperrolling is a thing and it works often)\nOne of my friend got like at the second/third PvP fight a lvl 3 ww and a lvl 3 nida(yeah...), then he had to go afk, he putted in 2/3 random lvl 1 units and he was able to stay first place for A LOT(while not even playing the game), just cuz the lvl 3 nida and ww where litterally 1v9ing everyone.\nAlso this increase the idea of \"getting my choices lead by the RNG\", cuz even if i want (maybe just to try out) a certain team comp the best thing is to buy the most smiliar units you get, rush a low price lvl 3 units and AFTER that start building a team comp around it (with relax, cuz if you get an early lvl 3 you can sit on that win get rich and than build the teamcomp around it). \nThis also goes way against team comp that have a lot of unit with 2 or more gold cost (sorcerers for example) while people always goes noble-knights or wild cuz they have a lot of 1cost units to spam early, lvl them up, do early synergies, and stomp the early-mid game, and still manage to be strong late cuz the synergy is pretty solid too.\n\n3. Ahri should go for the most damage possible with her ability, or if you want to make her going for the carry at all cost or stuf like that, at least not make her do that when the unit is OUT OF REACH, sometimes she just stop attaccking an unit, turn around, shoot the orb in the enemy carry direction, does nothing cuz he is out of reach and no one is in the middle, and he goes back at autoing... not nice xD\nDunno if this happens for other champs too (Varus and Sol having insane range never go for someone out of reach at least).\n\n4. Not a fan of noble and imperial buff going randomly on one unit and same for the phantom debuff, but that's just personal taste so...not saying you should choose, just that i don't like that type of mechanic and i hope to see less of them in future origjn/class that you will add/replace.\n\n5. Demon synergy is a nombo with himself xD it does damage based on the mana, but if you proc it more times the unit has less time to build mana back so you do damage more often but less damage so actually it doesen't change much xD (didn't do proper math and the RNG is still a thing so it depends a bit of course)\nIMO, it should aways have 35% proc chance (a bit more than the lvl 1 synergy 30%) but it should go 90%  of the mana as true damage, than 110% than 130% or something on those lines.","replies":[]},{"poster":"You stole my KS","date":"2019-06-30T21:52:43.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with most of the comments, So I just extend the list with my thougts.\n\nGame is fun and very addictive, but after a few days its now very annoying. \n\n0) **Most importantly: Give more freedom! Let people build what they prefer! Currently I feel that RNG is always holding my hand and forcing me to a direction, where I usually dont want to go.**\n In league of legends, the more skilled players gonna win.\n In this TFT:  luck > skill\n\n1)\n**Make an option to remove item from a champion without selling it (maybe for 10gold? )! **\nThis is one of my mayor problem. I can win early with items on T1 T2 champions, but then I must sell lvl3 T1 champions to use items for late game. Its too risky, and not fun to lose buff and a strong character...\nMy other option is keeping my  items, but then I usually lose early game, what ends up with defeat.\n\n2) \nRushing lvl3 low tier champions usually worth more than going for a higher tier champion. The best tactic for me currently is RUSH a lvl3 before others, then GG I can sit back and wait for gold.\nI tried many time to rush for XP  and get some mid tier champions early, but its now work since a lvl2-3 T1 champ is a stronger than a lvl1 higher tier  champion. A lvl2 Darius eats my lvl1 Seju before she could use ult or something.\nUsually when I can finally stack those high tier champions I have 10-30HP then I lose after the first mistake.\nI dont want always play with the early stuff, its boring.\n\n3)\n-AI fixes/update: Pyke doing his job awesome, making those perfect stuns, but many time I see MF ulting a single champion who already have only 50hp. Same with Ahri , Seju, Varus...\nBlitz grabbing an enemy then everyone ignores it.... etc\nAlso rethink Kata, I think she should not jump before X amount of mana, and  before that,  she should be ranged.\nKayle using ult on a full hp champion in the back insted of  using it on the dying front line.\n\n4) \n**From time to time give more time** to think:  For example after picking a champion from center, give more time to re-think strategy, sell characters, merge items etc. \nAlso give more time late game, after battles! Often I have no time to transfer items and add new champion, so I just don't riskt  to make a mistake because the short time. \n\n\n5) \nWhen we pick a champion from center with any item, the** items should not merge automatically** with the older 2 champions in my inventory.  For example I pick Zed with NLRod  and I have already 2 zed in my inventory with BF then it should not merge the items to Hextech Gunblade. Its just too annoying when its happens.\n-Also if I have no free space, then my newly picked champ should not be placed on the battlefield.\n-Also in picking phase: We should see the half-items we already have, because many time I forget what I need and I accidentaly pick wrong item :/.\n\n6)\n**Give more items, and make them less overpowered**. Having 1 or 2 champion with full items makes them super op, forcing me to building the same items, on the same champions... its not very fun longterm. \n\n7)\nIf there are no more Garen cards in the deck so I decide to sell all my Garens and then I use a reroll, my recently sold Garens should not show up instantly.... Its a bit frustrating.\n\nRNG) \nOther gameplay ideas to reduce annoyance of the RNG: \n\nMaybe there should be a selector (for tier / class / role) where people can pick which kind of champions should be prefered after a reroll? Or same selector, but limited for the first slots, and its a guaranteed champs for a higher price.  \nLategame its annoying to see all those T1 T2 cards.\n\nItems drops from monsters should not be random. It would be more strategic if people could pick one from a random pool, or we get currency for items.\nThe problem is:\n- Some items are not worth the same value as other (BF sword, Attackspeed, Tear, and rod  are the most valuable. Tanky stuff are always less important.\n\nReduce RNG stuff like the Noble buff where 1 random champion will be super op. If you are lucky, then its your carry champion.\nSame with phantom's passive where one enemy will start with 100 hp.\n\n\n(Sorry if something is not clear, I was super tired when I wrote this post)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonsInfernal","date":"2019-06-30T08:30:12.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Game mode is fun but it's bs when it comes to the Item RNG, I played multiple games where the first round i will kill all the minions and not get a single item but my first opponent already has 2 and sometimes 3 full items on their champion, Yea it's RNG but i don't think the items need to be that RNG when it comes to chances of even obtaining them, Make it so people will get 1 RNG item every minion  wave so it can be more fair, also I found it really annoying that i am trying to build something and i can never found the champion even if i refresh so many times, I check all the other peoples champs and they don't have that champion at all so i'm just wondering where is it, I was looking for ashe and i only had 1 ashe and i never seen another one ever again and the match lasted quite awhile, Then in my recent game I refreshed and I haven't seen a single garen or darius in my store but in a few turns i seen that there was someone that already had a 2 star and a 3 star garen so early, like why does that happen at times where someone just constantly gets that champ while others just don't even when they burn all their money on refreshes.","replies":[{"poster":"Starraka","date":"2019-06-30T15:24:47.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Items are the only thing bullshit and unfair about this mode. riot should really just make an item shop and have it use the same mechanics as the  champs shop but give them there own currency pool","replies":[{"poster":"DragonsInfernal","date":"2019-06-30T23:18:30.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Albino Kitty ,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=mvvroLh7,comment-id=00190000,timestamp=2019-06-30T15:24:47.225+0000)\n>\n> Items are the only thing bullshit and unfair about this mode. riot should really just make an item shop and have it use the same mechanics as the  champs shop but give them there own currency pool\n\nThey also need to nerf Glacial, it's so broken, If someone builds it you can't do anything at all for a long time and you basically just die all the time because of perma stun","replies":[{"poster":"Fl4yd","date":"2019-07-01T00:32:27.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"assassins counter Glacial since you go for their carries and without dmg cc is kinda useless{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"DragonsInfernal","date":"2019-09-22T10:49:41.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fl4yd,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=mvvroLh7,comment-id=0019000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-01T00:32:27.816+0000)\n>\n> assassins counter Glacial since you go for their carries and without dmg cc is kinda useless{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nnot if they put all them in the corner then NO it doesn't counter it","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonsInfernal","date":"2019-07-10T19:37:17.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fl4yd,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=mvvroLh7,comment-id=0019000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-01T00:32:27.816+0000)\n>\n> assassins counter Glacial since you go for their carries and without dmg cc is kinda useless{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nI kinda call bullshit on that though, Because i barely defeated this guy because he had his ashe in the corner and was basically invincible until i managed to get a blitzcrank, so I would say that it's 100% unfair unless you get lucky like i did, If i didn't get that blitz then i would've lost to bs, I had 100% hp until i fought that guy and he was the only one that was able to do anything because he had glacial, I seriously find it unfair and unfun where just building 1 thing like that could just instantly fk over my whole match because he went glacial.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Desdinova","date":"2019-06-29T21:03:56.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, it's okay to have RNG with champs and item types, but not with item number.

The amount of effort you put into bringing my post down could be used towards fixing the game mode.  Try doing something useful, youre falling far from grace Riot.

With that being said, list of things you should actually have an employee with an IQ of 100+ take a look at before pushing through the ranked mode.\n\n1.) Right from the very start of the game its a horrible introduction to RNG with the choosing of your starting unit system.  It would be 10x better to just give everyone a random unit and item at the start rather then get some sick pleasure watching everyone scatter to the middle while some players start out in front of the recurve/stronger units.\n\n2.) Equal amount of items need to be given out. Dunno who was on the drugs at Riot when they decided giving one person 5 combined items and another person .5 items at the same point in the game is going to make people want to sit through that game and get reamed while they get to sit and watch.\n\n3.) More balance to the unit pool, one person getting 6 3stars while another player has had 0 opportunities to create even one 3 star.  Need to keep the RNG  at a healthy level. \n\n4.) Items, Units and Passives need to be balanced so that they arent so over the top in comparison to others, issue can easily be solved by having balancing team put down the crack rock.\n\n5.) Unit AI is about as responsive as the TFT team that allowed all of these things through.  Stands there picking at their butthole even when they are legit getting wailed on by 5 enemy units.  Dont know about you but if this is supposed to be good AI and they are doing shit like that, the world is doomed.\n\nOverall rating for TFT 6/10\n\nWay too much RNG, a wooden block with a mechanical arm attached to it that only left clicks to place/buy random units could win matches on this game just due to the excessive levels.  Have your dev team take a few days off the crack rock, come back to work sober, then implement some good changes while using actual logic.  Other than that, you guys have a solid game mode right there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yesaul","date":"2019-07-03T23:04:25.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Props to the devs for the awesome game. RNG is on rampage though.\n\nOne thing that I could add to RNG feedback from others is how it skews chances to see a specific champ from a common pool.\nIssue: \n\nTo cap the number of champions of the same type (i.e. 39 copies for each tier 1 champion), program effectively skews the chances of drawing that champion for subsequent players. The order in which players are chosen to draw cards must be chosen arbitrary. If the order of players is constant, only first player always gets proper chances, that diminish with each successful draw. To clarify, the draw (randomization) of champions happens before every player is presented with its results.\n\nFor the following demonstration, I assume the following is true:\n\n1. The 5 champions choice display is shown at the same (or virtually same) time for all 8 (at the beginning) players.\n2. The champ pool is shared between players.\n3. The number of copies of a champion is limited.\n\nFor demo purposes let's assume that the number Garen copies is 7. Because the number is limited, the program needs to choose an order in which it draws Garen for each player. So, first player has all 7 copies available when the draw happens. If at least one copy was drawn for display, next player has only 6 copies to be drawn from. If all Garens were drawn before the turn to draw comes to the last player, that player has 0 chance to see a Garen on display.\n\nCan /devs comment please?","replies":[{"poster":"thefance","date":"2019-07-04T23:17:32.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suppose Alice and Bob play a 2-player version of TFT game where: A) the deck has 10 copies per champion of 10 unique champions (for a total of 100 cards); and B) each player only draws 1 card per round. Alice has a 10% (i.e. 10 / 100) chance to draw a Garen. If this outcome occurs, Bob has a 9.1% chance (i.e. 9 / 99) chance to draw Garen. Conversely, Alice also has a 90% (i.e. 90 / 100) chance to not draw Garen. In which case, Bob has a 10.1% chance (i.e. 10 / 99) to draw Garen. When we tally up the probabilities ... Bob still has a 10% overall chance to draw Garen. \n\n> a := outcome where alice draws garen\n> b := outcome where bob draws garen\n> \n> P(b) = P(b | a) \\* P(a) + P(b | ~a) \\* P(~a)\n> P(b) = (9/99) \\* (10/100) + (10/99) \\* (90/100)\n> P(b) = (1/10)\n\nThe reason it feels bad is probably due to Positive Bias. I.e. ignoring the 90% of scenarios where Alice doesn't draw Garen. \n\n> P(b) = P(b | a) ~~ * P(a) + P(b | ~a) * P(~a) ~~\n> P(b) = (9/99) ~~ * (10/100) + (10/99) * (90/100) ~~\n> P(b) = (1/11) ~~(1/10)~~\n\nBut in practice, Alice gains a tempo advantage over Bob only if she's given control of her own draft.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"darknessphantom","date":"2019-07-04T00:46:01.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nerf rageblade and RFC,make each champion can only have 1 item of the same (ex:rageblade that ppl abuse),ner brand,nerf draven,nerf noble and knight,nerf glacial,nerf sejuani aoe ability,nerf pyke stun and damage of his ability,make items to always appear,nerf kayle (lvl2) ability (shouldnt be able to put 2 characters with shield),some itens almost useless,tanks need to have more health and ban hackers (yes your game has already hackers).
