Earlier today, we dug into a few position rank-specific bugs that could affect the quality of matches in **North America** and **Korea**. In this post, I want to detail the issues we’re seeing and what we’re doing to fix them.\n\n#MMR Linking and LP Updates for Position Swapping\nWe found a couple bugs that affect how we handle position swapping and could lead to diminished match quality or incorrect LP updates in certain situations.\n\n##Issue: The links between MMRs are not tightening correctly for high-skill players.\nWe talked in [/dev: Addressing Your Feedback on Ranked for 2019](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/06/dev-addressing-your-feedback-on-ranked-for-2019/) about how, behind the scenes, we link your position MMRs together. We tighten those links the more you swap positions to prevent abuse or when you’re close to Master Tier where you have a single rank.\n\nIn our investigation, we found the link tightening wasn’t responsive enough for high-skill players. As a result, players who position swapped at Diamond+ found themselves in much easier matches than we intended.\n\n**Conclusion:** We have fixed this bug for both North America and Korea as of **today, January 31 at 2:00 PM GMT-8**.\n\nWhile some players were able to abuse this bug, we want to avoid solutions like resetting the Master+ ladder, which would punish the vast majority of players who earned their LP legitimately. Instead, now that we’ve fixed the issue, players who took advantage of it will get harder matches regardless of swapping, and their ranks will recalibrate as they lose games. We will monitor closely and make additional changes if needed.\n\nWe thought there was a possibility we could run into issues like this, so we preemptively locked Grandmaster and Challenger for the first few weeks of the season to ensure we could make fixes and respond to player feedback.\n\n##Issue: Some players may not receive properly diminished LP gains when they swap positions.\nThe issue above should’ve been mitigated by another detection system which determines when you swap positions and adjusts your LP accordingly. When you swap into a slightly easier game before link tightening has kicked in, you _should_ get significantly less LP and have larger LP losses. While the actual position **detection** is working, it isn’t being taken into account in some cases when determining LP gains for the match.\n\n**Conclusion:** Patching the previous bug should prevent the vast majority of cases where this logic is necessary, but we still believe adjusting LP like this is an important fallback for situations where—as we discovered today—MMR linking doesn’t work as intended.\n\n~~We’re aiming to roll out a fix for this one before the weekend, within the next **24–48 hours**~~ We fixed this bug on **February 1 at 9:00 PM GMT-8**.\n\n#Correctness of Match Data on Third Party Sites\nWith the introduction of position ranks, new information is necessary for third party sites to show all the right ranks. We’ve found some issues with the data we’re providing which can lead to inaccurate match details.\n\n##Issue: Some players are displayed as Master when they aren’t and vice versa.\nDue to a problem with the underlying tech we’re using to calculate and track rank information we’re sending to the Riot API, we were giving third party sites incorrect data.\n\n**Conclusion:** We fixed this bug **yesterday, January 30 at 5:00 PM GMT-8**, so players should be able to see who’s actually Master Tier and who’s not on third party sites.\n\n##Issue: Some matches may display the incorrect ranks for position played.\nWith position ranks, displaying the ranks for an individual game got a little trickier. Third party sites will eventually be able to display the ranks for each player’s position played, but we don’t currently provide the right information for them to do so.\n\n**Conclusion:** We’re collaborating with the Riot API team and third party sites to provide them accurate data as soon as possible. Once a fix goes out, you’ll be able to rely on the ranks shown for matches again.\n\nWe’ll update this post with an ETA after we’ve resolved the other issues.\n\n---\n\nThese bugs are painful to say the least, but on behalf of the team, thank you for helping us find and fix them as quickly as possible. If you’re seeing other issues that aren’t captured here or you just have feedback about the system, let us know in the comments. Thanks for all your help, and we’ll see you on the Rift.\n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Maokai.png","replies":[{"poster":"donger b0t","date":"2019-02-01T22:41:40.519+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you have a legitimate conversation with your players about matchmaking and MMR when you keep MMR hidden?

That would lead on that person performing bad or even the whole team because of preoccupation.

Any guess we have is just a guess. There are many imaginable matchmaking scenarios where a silver and a gold get matched together.\n\nFrequently what happens in my games is our team will have a Diamond, two golds, and a plat. Their team has three diamonds two plats. Or vice versa, whatever. What conclusions can I draw from this? There are so many possible matchmaking scenarios where this would occur, we really do not know what's going on. \n\nPlayers are confused, LP gains have not been consistent. Transparency is a good thing and would increase the quality of matchmaking.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2019-02-01T01:01:27.995+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":7,"body":"What about this issue: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/hAg2X9qZ-you-lose-full-lp-on-all-roles-when-you-dodge-ie-you-lose-more-lp-for-dodging-than-for-losing\n\nCopy/pasted below:\n\nYou lose full LP on ALL ROLES when you dodge. ie: You lose more LP for dodging than for losing.\n\nThese scenarios will be assuming you already dodged at least once, and are receiving the -10 LP penalty (which resets to -3 LP after 16 hours of no dodging).\n\nScenario 1: I get my secondary or autofilled role. I either don't want to play it because it's boring, or because I suck at it, or because I have trolls in champ select, etc.... Here are my options:\n\nA) Play out the game, risk losing, and lose 3 LP from my main role and lose 20 LP from my secondary role. I also have the chance of actually winning, and gaining 3 LP on my main role.\n\nB) Dodge, and lose 10 LP from all roles, including my main role.\n\nWhat do you think I'm going to do?\n\nScenario 2: I actually care about climbing on all my roles, but I get my main role 90% of the time. I dodge a lot on my main role, because my preferred champions are high pick/ban and I don't want my team to suffer through me playing a champion I'm not good at (and also trolls and stuff happens as well). I have played my main role 10 games in a row, and have dodged 5 times in that time period because of picks/bans/trolls (I have been assigned my role 15 times, dodged 5 of them, and played 10 of them out). Because I am consistently winning, I am still climbing on my main role despite the dodging. For game 11, I finally get assigned a different role. I now have 3 options:\n\nA) Dodge, and lose 10 LP on all roles.\n\nB) Play it out and try really hard to win.... And this role is at negative 50 LP because I dodged 5 times, so I will win and still be far into the negative.\n\nC) This role is going to be **_permanently_** in the negative LP, why should I care about tryharding at all? Just play it out and whatever happens, happens.\n\nSo.... Good job on your new ranked system I guess? This encourages intentional griefing (not caring/giving up) as well as unintentional griefing (people who would normally dodge and eat the LP loss.... Are not encouraged to change their behavior and just play it out even when it is highly likely they won't win). You shouldn't lose LP on unassigned roles when you dodge. It's as simply as that. And the system is going to be garbage until this is fixed lol.\n\nBonus points: you can't even check your LP on your secondary roles until after a game, because your profile only shows your main role's LP. So a lot of people aren't going to notice for a couple weeks, but then when they do, they're going to troll **_HARD._**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iAtH0Yy.png[]\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that the \"ranked\" tab in your profile now shows your roles and LP instead of simply showing you your position on some obscure ladder like it used to. So you can actually test this easily yourself by dodging once and checking your profile (just note that if you normally don't dodge, you will lose 3 LP from all roles instead of 10).","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-02-06T09:44:27.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like pretty extreme LP optimization and is probably only necessary at Diamond+ MMR. I feel for you, but at this point I believe that the pros for 99% of the player base outweigh the cons for the top 1%. And not even that, since Master+ only get 1 rank anyway, so this is really only an issue for Diamond players.\n\nThe underlying problem here is that dodging is NOT intended to be used as an optimization, it's meant to be used only to avoid trolling. If you don't dodge auto-fill games/banned games, you have no problem, and the system is working correctly. And Riot is certainly not going to facilitate dodging auto-filled games. The whole point of this new Rank system is to make them more interesting/fair to play, so they clearly don't want players to dodge them.\n\nAgain, if you previously managed to find a way to optimize around dodging and lost that possibility, I feel for you. But understand that what you describe is a tiny corner case and was never an intended feature to begin with.\n\nEDIT: there's one point I agree with you, though. Dodge penalty shouldn't be applied uniformly to all roles, it should be scaled a little. Say -10 LP for the position you dodged, -5 for your main, or something like that.

It's supposed to be a security to use in extreme cases, not something to optimize around.\n\nIt's still a problem that dodging can be more punishing than losing *sometimes*, but if you dodge once per day or less on average, as it is intended, well, it is not more punishing. It's -3, just like a loss.\n\nSo, again, since the message didn't go through the first time: the issue you describe, it's a tiny corner case that matter to a vanishingly small proportion of the player base, so no it won't noticeably increase griefing or trolling. I'm sorry you are affected by it, and I hope that Riot will find a satisfying solution, sincerely (because *I* am not a dick).

They should also have to have a certain amount of mastery or xp on a champ to play them in ranked.

It's not fair to be playing and putting your best foot forward while someone else is ruining your games by having no idea what their micro is, much less macro.\nAlso frustrated that after my first month playing last year I was placed silver, no ranked partner.

Why are you asking for input on something that is hidden from us? I don't want to assume, but the best reason I can come up with for you guys hiding MMR from the player base is that it's formula is terrible and you guys are too lazy to progress a system that needs working on. There is no room for conversation on the topic of ranked when MMR is hidden. You guys shut down any conversation when you suggest on your support site that we belong with the team we get matched with and do not get anyone who shouldn't be with our MMR. However, the difference between someone who is 0/22/1, 0/1/18, 2/4/27, and 17/4/10... The outlier is clearly the 0/22/1. Your matchmaking has problems. It's time to own up to it. I've already quit your game because of how garbage the system is. Just because you still have a high player base doesn't mean you can't lose it. It's time to swallow your pride and fix it.
