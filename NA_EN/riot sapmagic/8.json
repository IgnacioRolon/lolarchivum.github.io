SapMagic, the lead for Ranked, reporting back in. A couple weeks ago [we announced some big updates to Ranked](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/04/dev-updates-to-ranked-for-2019/) for next year. You spoke up with valuable feedback on forums, social media, and surveys across the world. On behalf of the team: thank you. Today, let&rsquo;s talk about why we&rsquo;re working on Ranked at all, what we heard from you, and lay out how we&rsquo;re gonna build this together over the course of summer and fall. \n &nbsp;\n---\n&nbsp;\n**Why change Ranked now?**\nOne of the big questions we heard was, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s asking for changes to Ranked?&rdquo; We embarked on this journey because we saw a bunch of long-time Ranked players had started to burn out. That makes a lot of sense given they&rsquo;re doing the same thing over and over again for the same result. And it makes even more sense when you consider that our last major update to Ranked was more than two years ago when we added Position Select.\n\nWhether it&rsquo;s a champion update or a big system like Ranked, we try to stay focused on what makes that thing fun and special. Then, we try to look at those essential elements from as many angles as possible. Are players telling us there are parts of it that suck? Is it under-serving players it should be serving? Is it driving a certain way to play that makes League less fun overall?\n\nIn the case of Ranked, it&rsquo;s really a combination of all of these. New tiers and placements are aimed at fixing obvious problems, and other changes are aiming to better serve players of all skill levels and add fresh ways for you to challenge yourself in Ranked.\n\nWe think these are the right goals, but we still have a lot of work to do. So let&rsquo;s talk about what we heard from you.\n&nbsp;\n---\n&nbsp;\n**You&rsquo;re worried we&rsquo;re making Ranked too grindy.**\nWith the addition of position ranks, it feels like you&rsquo;d need to play twice as many games to reach your rank across two positions, let alone three, four, or five. We&rsquo;ll go into detail on this in our next blog, but flat out you won&rsquo;t need to play double the games to hit your peak rank in two different positions. \n\nWe also heard we need to keep true fill players in mind. For those players, the prospect of making way slower progress in Ranked than they do today feels really bad. This is a great point, and we&rsquo;re doing some homework here. Alienating fill players would be a clear failure to meet one of our goals: to give better recognition for breadth of skill.\n\n---\n\n**You&rsquo;re worried other players won&rsquo;t take games seriously.**\nPosition ranks promise to let you challenge yourself in off-positions without hurting the accuracy of your main. For a while, we&rsquo;ve worried that that if we do this, some players won&rsquo;t try to win off-position games because there&rsquo;s less on the line. Worse, a few players might actively try to ruin your experience because they know it won&rsquo;t affect the rank they care about.\n\nMatch quality and competitive intent are critical because they keep Ranked legitimate. We&rsquo;ve explored a number of solutions already, but your feedback reinforces this concern. We need rock solid fixes before moving forward.\n\n---\n\n**You&rsquo;re worried positional matchmaking can be abused.**\nWe&rsquo;re worried about this too. It&rsquo;s actually the thing we&rsquo;ve spent the most time figuring out so far. Specifically, there are two major cases we need to handle. First, we&rsquo;re worried that players could queue up for an off-position and swap in champion select for favorable matchmaking. Second, some players could take that a step further by queueing up with a duo partner and consistently swapping positions.\n\nI want to be direct: we believe in position ranks as a part of the overall changes to Ranked because if we get them right, they could help refresh the game&rsquo;s challenges. We&rsquo;re in the middle of finalizing our plans to solve or mitigate these abuse cases into non-issues, but if we don&rsquo;t believe we can, we won&rsquo;t ship position ranks as part of Season 2019. Period.\n\n---\n\n**The good stuff.**\nOutside of grindiness and abuse cases, the majority of the Ranked changes went over well for most players. Smoothing out progression with a couple extra tiers was a big hit, as were revamped placements. Splits and revamped rewards need some more work. We plan to do a deep dive on those later in the summer when we have all the details ironed out.\n\n---\n\n**What&rsquo;s up next?**\nOur next dev blog will target crossing big concerns off your hit list. Then, we&rsquo;ll do this whole loop over again. Pitch. Listen. Iterate. Repeat. All summer and fall long. Buckle up and come along for the ride. In the meantime, let us know if we missed anything major.","replies":[{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2018-05-24T15:26:11.743+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thank you for considering player's feedback and even keeping the possibility not to release this feature if issues are not addressed in a satisfying way.

Unfortunately I don't' know what to suggest to combat it and I also concede we all must start somewhere. I really hope that at some point all new players to ranked are auto placed no higher than Bronze 3. A couple times this year I've been paired with a guy who is only wining 47% of their games, yet they were placed in Silver5?\n\n \nA few times last season and a couple already this season considering the 4 bot laners on both sides, I've either faced a player who had significantly less games in bot or with BOT lane champs.

It will be similar to how the system works today in that you will be placed lower than where you/the system actually think you should be. The reason we do this is because we make a lot of changes around preseason; in addition, lots of players come back and others might take a break. It's an opportunity for you to re-prove yourself.\n\nThe difference next year is your placements should get you closer to where you ended the season by the time you complete them. You won't be able to lose LP during placements since we think your rank should be higher than your initial provisional rank.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Morning Raven","date":"2018-05-24T15:47:06.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well you seem you got a good start to this and are investing the time to make it the best it can be.\n\n I just want to know what the names of the new tiers are.

Copper is a useful metal but weaker for the purposes usually given to Bronze-Gold. And sounds more pleasant than 'wood'. So my mind hasn't moved from **Copper for the lower tier**.\n\nLast week I tried looking up synonyms for a term weaker than Challenger and Masters but none really fit nicely so I figured finding something rarer/more precious than Diamonds would make the most sense. Wikipedia has a list of the most precious metals being:\n\n* Rhodium\n* ~~Platinum~~\n* ~~Gold~~\n* Palladium\n* Iridium\n* Osmium\n* Rhenium\n* Ruthenium\n* Germanium\n* Beryllium\n* ~~Silver~~\n* Indium\n* Gallium\n* Tellurium\n* Bismuth\n* Mercury\n\nThe biggest issue I think is most of them, being rare metals, are a shiny silver color. So you need it different than Silver but still impressive. And most of them are so bleh with names you could just go with Titanium/Steel and be happy. Rhodium is easy to pronounce and is more commonly heard of. \n\nSo for the **upper tier, I vote for Rhodium, and perhaps Bismuth**. If you don't mind making a hyper shiny silvery metal, Rhodium could work. Bismuth, being rainbow and angular, has a lot of border/art potential. Only real issue with Bismuth is it's also a B like Bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot NaKyle","date":"2018-05-24T16:26:27.582+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"O A K B O I S","replies":[]},{"poster":"Advacus","date":"2018-05-24T17:55:31.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there are two options here, either you add a tier between Diamond and Platinum or you add a tier between Diamond and Masters.

I'm really liking how at least _you_ guys actually WANT feedback and are actively listening to concerns and taking them into account.  I'm still not sold on this whole position rank setup since your rank should ultimately tell how good you are as a player by still maintaining a high rank even playing off roles, but take your time.  \n\nDon't rush something like this to be in time for the next preseason as Riot's new \"flashy idea we're going to shove down the playerbase's throats and plug our ears for over a year when they complain\" addition.

Plus we had the stone age in the past followed by the bronze age so i think that works out.\n\nNow i have never heard of rhodium outside of a few video games.  Something more likely to be heard of would be Steel, but this has the problem of color.  There is also Obsidian which being black brings a new color and it would feel awesome( black is a popular color).  Also there is mithril.\n\nThe only thing else i think can think of would be reversing the thought process and going for color first and then deciding the physical representation of it.\nColors we already have= silver, gold, shiny green, brown, blue/clear, silver/blue, and gold/blue.\nSo way too much silver \nColors available=pink, black, white, red, orange,and purple.\nSkipping yellow because its similar to gold and usually unpopular.\nSo would could there be...\npink> Alot of people are not fond of this color and irritated getting stuck with it.\nBlack> Popular color, coal for lower tier and obsidian for higher tier.\nWhite> odd color, chalk for lower tier and marble for mid tier?\nRed> popular color, bloodstone for lower tier, ruby for mid tier, and lava? for high tier\nOrange> odd color, citrine for low tier but not widely heard of by teens. Other then that all i can think of is sunstone.\nPurple> popular color.  Amethyst for lower tier.\n\n1 thing i agree with that was posted before is that Masters tier makes more logical sense to be ABOVE Challenger tier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrSoupPort","date":"2018-05-24T21:12:47.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Rioter. \nI hope I am not late to ask a question.\nSo recently, I started to plat Twisted Treeline with my friends and I saw this post.

You also solve the problem of player who only play \"fill\" and the problem of much fair game, bacuase the MMR will depend to the position. I dont know why you dont do that, bacause i think is siplier, clearer and will offer better result.

Loads of problems have been mentioned here, no fixes, yet still you say you are going ahead with it. The position ranks are only detrimental to leagues health. No matter how many free skins you promise to people who don't int in auto fill games, people will still int and run it down mid and afk etc. Even if they don't, do you really think players will be trying their very hardest? Or will they instead just half-heartedly play until they can surrender. Of course they will. It also severely punishes multi-role players, and rewards one-tricks. It's all I've just bad, and creates more problems than it solves. (I can't wait to have to remake 30 games in a row before I get one where everyone is in their preferred role and no-one is afk).\n\nThe problem I'm seeing you trying to solve, is one in which people filled are not as good in that role as their main role, so they let their team down.\nFirstly, I say: isn't that what league ranks are about? Isn't it supposed to show how good you are at league of legends? Not a very particular champion or role. That's the whole point. People who are good at every role deserve to be a higher rank than those who are only good on one.\nSecondly, if you really want to solve this \"problem\", my solution is this: have one rank for all roles (like currently), but have different MMR for every role (maybe not hidden anymore to show what's going on). So all wins and losses contribute to the same centralised rank, but you can be getting some LP from platinum level midlaning, and some from silver level supporting, at their respective MMR's. It all just contributes (in both positive and negative ways) to the same goal.\nThis would solve most of the problems the current model shows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtomToast","date":"2018-05-24T15:57:33.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, what would you think of adding like a general background mmr that influences all position ranks?\nMaybe not all equally but like if you lose alot on your offrole you also get a small damper on your lp gain on your main and when you do well you gain more etc.\n\nOr are there any downsides I am not seeing with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot SapMagic","date":"2018-05-24T17:22:09.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's basically what we're doing - we'll go into more detail in the next week or two about how this works.
