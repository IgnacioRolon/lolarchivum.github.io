We don't share information like this as it can be essential towards helping players with recovering their accounts in cases that becomes necessary.  A good way I like to share how long I've played is by how many seasons I've participated in!","replies":[{"poster":"KyRazie","date":"2017-10-28T03:03:02.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realize this was a year ago, but I've been searching since seeing the patch notes.
