This was my first time banned (14 day ended on Nov 21), just bad timing. Had no chat restricts or other punishments after the chat restricts I got at the BEGINNING of season. Some players who got banned multiple times before still kept their rewards. I have been positive for the majority of the season and always enouraged teamwork/diffuse fights when I see them in game, but messed up due to a few bad games near the end. However I have shown positive gameplay during the last week before season ended.

When you contact player support, you get the same answer. I was wondering if there is any way to talk to someone who can help us. I also heard that if you were suspended as the season was ending they took your rewards away, is this intentional or a bug? Also, what happened to the \"worst of the worst\" thing Lyte mentioned, because by no means did I ever go to any extremes so I don't really understand where all of this is coming from. Also, he said if we we show reform. I've played quite a bit since my suspension ended and I can 100% guarantee you that I have said nothing negative at all.  In fact I have actually had a positive outlook on the game and I feel like I and my team have been playing better.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhojin","date":"2014-11-25T20:02:28.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Marotte I took a look into your account due to your claims to verify that your punishment was deserved.

Please, and thank you for your time.\n\nLyte have said that players who show reform will still get season rewards. I got some chat restrictions at the START of the season and after that, I was neutral/positive in all my games therefore not getting any punishment, including bans, ALL season.\n\nI realized that I just lost all my season rewards today. I am asking for a chance for you guys to re-look at my punishment. Please, I have never been banned before and always encouraged teamwork/diffuse conflicts within teammates when I see them. I am not a toxic person in real life, but I had a bad week A FEW WEEKS ago and got some SERIOUS insults in game towards me including death threats, just because I was doing badly in game. So I basically just lost it and insulted them back. I SINCERELY apologize for what I did and the next time, I will just mute them WITHOUT saying anything. \n\nI was really happy and looking forward to the ranked rewards that I've put many hours into. It's my fault that I messed up near the end of season, but I hope that you guys will give me another chance on this considering how neutral/positive I was for the majority of the season, as well as all my games after the season ended. Together, lets make my favourite game's community a better place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xAlexStar","date":"2017-09-13T10:55:48.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if i will be sportmanlike and i will not get any reports i will get my rewards back untill the end of the season?","replies":[]},{"poster":"JCBeastMode","date":"2015-01-26T21:45:22.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my gold banner and border was gone and my victrous skin i took me a while to s4 to g5 i did get ban i left a game because  i was using my  sister pc to play with him but it wont let me enter and i coundt connect back and i got ban because of that i never a person when i play league can i get them back plz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marotte the Fool","date":"2014-11-25T23:15:33.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey Marotte I took a look into your account due to your claims to verify that your punishment was deserved.

I do want you to know that I am truly sorry and did in fact take this as a wake up call. I understand that the point is to reward positive sportsmanship but I feel so bad now that I lost the rewards; I wish so hard that I could take everything back. I'm not a bad person, and I regret deeply everything now. I know I deserved the suspension but I feel so helpless and lost now. So maybe, if you could, ask if we show reform that there may be a chance to get the rewards back? A second chance if you will.  Please. As shown in any of my post-suspension logs, you can see I clearly changed for the better. Please and thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marotte the Fool","date":"2014-11-25T20:47:45.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey Marotte I took a look into your account due to your claims to verify that your punishment was deserved.

I'm afraid that the punishment issued to your account is justified.\n\n432? I don't recall near that many. Yes there was a streak where I was climbing plat 1 where I was toxic (getting promoted and demoted has that affect on people), I was not denying that. It was so hard to get people to cooperate. But after the suspension was issued (yes I am not denying that it was unjust) I took it as a big wake up call. Especially after I read about the ranked reward thing. I asked numerous times if I reformed will I be allowed to keep my rewards. And each time I was told yes as long as my attitude changed. I was scared of losing those hard earned rewards, I mean it took me over 1000 ranked games after all, that's a lot of invested hours. After the suspension was lifted I haven't been negative at all. If I was warned during the season instead of at the end that I would lose my rewards I am positive I would not have been so angry at times. It's a competitive game after all, and I guess I took it a little too seriously, but I wanted to be diamond so badly. Upon achieving diamond, my outlook changed but it was too late. Damage was done. \n\nAs far as abusive, I don't think I ever took it to extremes, I never threatened anyone, or was racist or anything like that.  Yes I threatened to afk, but I never did. I never fed or intentionally caused us to lose. \n\nSo basically there is no chance of this getting overturned? I mean no chance of getting my rewards back?\n\nEdit: I mean I have been really good since my suspension, if I continue to show positive and change my attitude, is there any chance I can have my rewards reinstated? I beg you, I worked hard for them and I am very deeply sorry for my attitude and I swear that I will change for the better. Please riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stealth Panda","date":"2014-11-25T02:20:25.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya I just lost them too. if you recently got banned or chat restricted I think they take the awards away.
