Normally in game I get about 27 ms but today I have been getting on average 165 ms. I have Verizon Fios 20 down 20 up and I really haven't had a problem with this kind of thing before. The link is to an image of a traceroute i just did. If it helps I also live on the east coast.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T22:27:29.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time when I see issues about latency (ping) increases, they're caused by ISP routing changes. If you didn't make any recent changes to your network configuration (switch to WiFi or a new router) then we can take a look at your specific network route to one of our test IP addresses. \n\nI'd like you to grab a network tool called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/). After opening the tool, plug in the IP address 104.160.131.1 and start the trace. After it has run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply here. Don't worry, your real IP address isn't listed in the traceroute, so no problems there.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedkooIaid","date":"2016-09-14T03:43:38.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't understand why NA doesn't get a west coast/east coast thing going...

Love how riot says How far they have come after 10 years. I would like to tell them Not much. Maybe start fixing your Core. Sad to see lags as bad as this in 2016. I really cannot name 1 game that i am currently playing where i see this bad of lags. This game slowly going to start dying all the people and friend i have are moving on because of the lack of response by riot of this people want. Its a shame","replies":[]}]}
