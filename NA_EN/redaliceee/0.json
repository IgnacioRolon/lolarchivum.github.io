Then when the game attempts to load it hangs. No bugsplat, no error message, no nothing. I have to kill the process and then when attempting to reconnect it simply hangs again. I've used both the beta and legacy client repair tools and neither have worked. At this point I'm at a loss for what to do about it and I would love some sort of assistance with it. It was working just fine last night but during the day my client restarted and now this is happening.","replies":[{"poster":"La Sankt","date":"2016-12-14T03:19:22.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i fixed it by re-installing and not using the new client basically","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-10T20:04:58.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's an issue right now where some players are being met with the reconnect screen after champion select.
