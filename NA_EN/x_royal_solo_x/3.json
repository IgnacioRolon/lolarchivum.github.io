You are basically asking them to take away what makes these champs special.\n\nThings I agree on: \n\nDraven damage could be toned down a bit.\n\nLissandra might need changes, but I don't feel like her identity is in late game burst damage, more like a diver that deals aoe cc instead of damage. If she needs a buff I would like to see it help her with that.\n\nHaven't brushed up on Kayle and Morg's lore lately.\n\nFor Nunu, visual upgrades are always welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"x Royal Solo x","date":"2017-11-08T06:59:28.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never mentioned to take anything away from the champions.

If you weaken them like you are saying then they would be more like the other characters and make the game \n\nA few detailed examples:\n\nRammus's taunt is a huge part of what makes him Rammus. It has already been drastically shortened, and loweing it further would take away from his identity.\n\nMaster Yi having immunity to slows (not unstoppable like you said) and blinking everywhere when he gets Q resets is basically his whole identity. Not to mention he is already very weak.\n\nVayne's Q is basically her entire identity, without it she is basically a three it passive basic attacker. It being off of cooldown often is what makes her feel dofferent from other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"x Royal Solo x","date":"2017-11-08T10:39:00.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what your saying is that these things shouldn't be nerfed because the champions would be to balanced to all the others?\n\nPretty sure you're just being a troll but ill play along.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-08T11:27:17.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Balanced\" doesn't mean \"the same\". All of the characters you listed are fairly well balanced, they just have unique strengths that are easier to see in action than others and thus bother people more when they lose to them.\n\nFor example, one of the champs you listed is Master Yi, who is considered to be very weak right now. You don't like that he can ignore slows and go untargettable because that is a unique thing that you probably have difficulty playing against. That doesn't make him too strong, that makes him unique. \n\nEvery champion has something that makes them unique and strong, just not all of them are as noticable by you. For example, Ashe's E gives her uncontested vision of an area for a short time, which is one of the most powerful things you can have in the game, but you didn't list her because it doesn't help her dodge or defend against your spells or deal damage to you/cc you.\n\nBasically, if you weaken these things about these champs there won't be any reason to play them. They won't be good enough at what they do to be unique. In some cases they will be \"right click until someone dies but I will probably die first\".","replies":[{"poster":"x Royal Solo x","date":"2017-11-09T07:40:12.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These changes offer some counter play during fights, because as they are now if these champions are played expertly they have little counter play unless the whole team gangs up on them.\n\nI didn't add ashe and her vision arrow because it has counter play, you can see it.\n\nI'm down with the uniqueness of the champions, but balance and counter play are more important as this is a competitive game and not an art gallery.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-09T17:40:44.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That isn't counterplay, that is seeing that your opponent did something and being completely unable to do anything about it other than back off from that area.\n\nI agree that balance and counterplay are very important in this game. The issue is the things you are pointing out aren't particularly unbalanced and already have plenty of counterplay. And are you really saying that if every champion was basically the same you would like the game better than it is now? I am pretty sure that the vast majority of this game's player base and dev team stands against that.","replies":[{"poster":"x Royal Solo x","date":"2017-11-09T23:25:14.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you think they have counter play would you care to explain what it is that can be done against them.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-10T15:45:32.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure. Let me go down the list.\n\n{{champion:84}} : Akali doesn't have quite the burst of other assassins when not fed, and her smoke cloud costs a lot of energy. If you use your abilities on her face right after she R's you then her smoke cloud channel won't have enough time to go off to dodge your skills. In lane (I assume top specifically? Since her heal is hard to get off early in mid.) early just try to stop her from farming to delay her hextech gunblade until it is less relevant. Don't worry as much about killing her. If she starts to snowball you will have to play safe until you are clear to shove lane and teleport bot or go for an objective.\n\n{{champion:268}} : As melee this one is rough. Watch the timing on his Q and try to get on top of him right after he uses it since he can't reposition his minions for his jump while it is on cooldown. Basically, avoid the minions he spawns and he has no dps. If he ults defensively just peel off unless you have an easy way around it.\n\n{{champion:119}} : Like I said, a little reduced early game damage would be fine here, in my opinion he is a little strong. When fighting him attempt to CC him out of catching his axes, since that is where all of his damage comes from. If you can cause him to drop an axe or two you will be quite a bit better off, or try to start a fight after he misses one while farming, but that won't happen often. Another thing you can do is aim your skillshots where his axe is going to land so he either has to tank it or miss the axe.\n\n{{champion:90}} : Quicksilver sash for his ult. Kill the little minions when he spawns them. Dodge the Q. Don't stand near minions with aids when they are about to die. Also try to poke the bubbles off of him before you engage if you can. Most skillshots outrange everything he has but the Q.\n\n{{champion:11}} : Him using his ult is a very good indication of what he is going to do next, and you need to have patience. He is either going to run strait at you and attempt to alpha strike you after you stop to cast a spell, or he is going to take a longer route to the side of you and attempt to circle you to make it hard to hit him.\n\nIf he is running strait for you then you have a couple options. You can either wait until he is so close that he can't alpha strike out of cc due to the limits of human reflexes and the inherent delays of online games, or you can try to bait the alpha strike by casting a non cc spell or autoattacking and then CC'ing him after it is done.\n\nIf he is circling you it is a little trickier, but basically just wait until he is so close that you cant miss and he cant react.\n\nAlso, grievous wounds helps here. If he is getting super fed thornmail will lower his dps on you a lot. If you already have grievous wounds in another items I really like having randuin's omen vs him though, the active doesn't slow him during his ult but the lower crit damage helps a lot. If you still need more damage and can't invest that much gold into one of those items, then even just a warden's mail or bramble vest help a ton and are only 1k gold.\n\n{{champion:2}} Even with his ult it is very difficult for him to get on an important target and stick to it. Just kite him until it is over. Remember, if he has to move between attacks it will drastically lower his dps. Also, if you can try to lead him away from his axes so he cant lower its cc. If he stops to attack a tank or something then turn on him. And don't forget to get grievous wounds against him to help against his inherent lifesteal.\n\n{{champion:33}} When he is powerballing towards you remember that he can't go through your minions so putting some between you and him can be the difference between getting caught or not. Don't panic too hard when he catches you though, he can hold you down for a long time but he doesn't do much damage by himself, so you will probably get a chance to run after he catches you if his team can't catch up. In lane his taunt won't be very long since it raises with level and I believe he maxes W for fighting or Q first for ganks. Been a while since I brushed up on his skill leveling order so the thing to do might be taunt first but I doubt it.\n\n{{champion:67}} She is a late game hypercarry, avoid letting her get fed early. If you only fight when you are sure to win and back off when she ults you should be able to outdo her late game with fairly even farm if you don't let her get fed. When you are fighting her stay away from walls and save your skillshots until just after she uses Q so she can't use it to dodge. Her Q is a big part of her dps so if she never uses it then you should be coming on top in dps.","replies":[{"poster":"x Royal Solo x","date":"2017-11-11T07:47:24.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I almost started making a long ass reply. \n\nthen I realized all of my nerf ideas were very small and wouldn't even effect their game play that much.
