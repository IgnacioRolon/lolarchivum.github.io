But for the past month or so (About 40-50 games maybe, i don't know how much i really play), I haven't gotten a single key fragment at all. Which actually makes me kinda sad because i love how riot let's you get skins for free with this mechanic, but i can't get them for some reason. If anyone can tell me why thanks. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T17:02:43.874+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zombiemaster's information is spot on.  Key fragment drop rates are more of a curve, and have a reduced chance of dropping the more you earn them.  This is then reset roughly ever 30 days.  More information is available in our [Hextech Crafting ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide)guide. I  hope that helps clear some things up!","replies":[{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2016-09-03T21:35:10.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are there any plans to get key frag drops more in line with chests? as it is right now you get about 4 chests for every 1 key leaving you with 15+ chests saved up and no way to open them. why not let players trade chests for keys? or better yet let them buy keys from the shop for IP?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-02T06:30:58.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever you earn a key fragment, the drop rate for the next one is lowered, and this continues to happen every time you earn one. The drop rate does reset approximately 30 days after you earn your first key fragment at the original drop rate.\n\nIf you truly has been around a month, then you should start earning keys very soon.","replies":[]}]}
