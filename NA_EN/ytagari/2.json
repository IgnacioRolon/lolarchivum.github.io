Some people just dislike the new client or just would rather have the old client, I'm not saying to bring back the old client obviously, but maybe, either let us download the old client and use it, or make this new client a little less graphical and laggy so at the very least, i can pick and ban my champs without the client crashing. I do love this new client, it looks very very beautiful in my opinion it just crashes a bunch for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T03:29:36.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beta applications are prone to some bumps along the way, so I understand you wanting to play more on the Legacy client.
