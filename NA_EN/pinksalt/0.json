THE. SAME. GAME MODES! \r\ntwo weeks will be ascension, then poroking, ascension, doom boots, (the thresh game mode.. don't remember the name), then ASCENSION. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\nand so on, what is the deal? where's arurf, one for all, hexakill (haven't seen hexakill in ages), nemisis draft, etc. Why are ascension and poroking on repeat? I get they took away the \"summoners queue\" for the \"surprise\" element, but it's just made the game modes worse, instead of a scheduled and balance of each game mode, we get \"random\" gamemodes. (aka, ascension and poroking) \r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T03:23:43.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak 100% as to how the game modes are chosen but keep in mind that they do rotate through all the modes based on popularity (how much the modes were actually played when they were active).
