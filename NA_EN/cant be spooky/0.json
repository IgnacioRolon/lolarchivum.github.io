I am going to school for this area of work and was just wondering.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2016-03-17T20:11:43.320+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey spooky! \n\nThanks for reaching out - there are a ton of different toys and pieces of software that sound designers use here at Riot. We don't have a standardized DAW that every sound designer uses - some of us, myself included use Pro Tools HD, some use Nuendo, and a growing number of folks are making the switch to Reaper, which is a really awesomely deep DAW, for a fraction of the price of the other two. =)\n\nIn terms of plugins, it's a lot of the standard stuff like Waves, Soundtoys, GRM Tools, Eventide, Native Instruments, the Audioease stuff (Altiverb, Speakerphone.) and iZotope's stuff. I personally have a lot of fun with a combination of Iris 2, Wave Warper, and Zynaptiq's Morph. \n\nAlso, having some type of field recorder is an absolute must! There are some really great, affordable ones out there, like the Zoom H4/H6 that you can get some great stuff with. If you find yourself really getting into the field recording aspect (and I hope you do!) you'd probably graduate to something from Sound Devices like a 744 or the newer (and awesome!) 688.\n\nAlso mics - all of the mics.\n\nGLHF!","replies":[{"poster":"cant be spooky","date":"2016-03-23T21:40:38.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you that was really helpful and interesting to hear! Not sure if this is the place to ask but how often, if ever, does Riot take interns for Sound Design, live sound for LCS broadcasts or anything of the sort really?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpookyNeedle","date":"2016-03-18T07:54:21.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you \"can't be Spooky\", because I'm Spooky.","replies":[]}]}
