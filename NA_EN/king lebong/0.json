I haven't changed anything that could make it go up by 30 and stay in that spot permanently.\r\n\r\nIt has been going on for about 2+ weeks and the ticket I sent about it was useless to say the least. I submitted network info and a netalyzer in the initial ticket, the first reply asked for a netalyzer so I sent it again to make sure they received it and the reply after that once again asked me to do a netalyzer, so I just gave up and stopped responding.\r\n\r\nAs of right now after I just restarted my router, my ping on all servers has gone up by 30 once again and my LAN ping is currently sitting at a consistent 100.\r\nBeing that I play in challenger my ping being over double what I'm used to is extremely hindering and I would appreciate if someone could help me resolve it quickly so I can get back to playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T16:53:57.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could have a degrading connection to the game server, but your ISP may have also changed how you're routing there too.

Let me know if you have any questions!\n\nI went through the steps and got no improvement at all, all of those troubleshooting steps seem to be geared towards disconnections which I'm not having.\n\nI've had higher ping consistently, I had 35-40 last season when I played and this season it has not gone below 63.\n\nI think you're right in that it must be the routing, when I ping the LAN server IP it returns with around a 40 ms response time which isn't far from what my ping used to be, but when I actually get in game it becomes 64-70.\n\nIs there a way to force an optimal route?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T22:24:14.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For sure, the configuring dns steps in the guide might be able to adjust your routing.

I contacted LAN support a few days ago and they just repeatedly asked me for a network analysis after I gave it to them 3 times so I just looked for help elsewhere.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
