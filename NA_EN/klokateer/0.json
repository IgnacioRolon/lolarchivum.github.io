The few of us that know it, every single game type that they have come out with has been previously invented by players themselves. Just before Riot released \"All for One\" there was a custom game client add on that allowed players to host and bug a custom match to make players all pick the same champ.\r\n\r\nWay back before Dominion even existed, there was a client add on that allowed players to play on Twisted Treeline with six players on each side. It was a crazily fun game mode that only appeared for a few weeks, and all of you DOTA players remember the game mode with zero cooldown timers, and some crazy shenanigans. Riot implemented this into their own game and made it something absolutely awesome.\r\n\r\nLet's look at a different game that had a wild success due to its ludicrous custom game modes. Back when Bungie released Halo 2, people played zombies on a few of the maps, with many many many house rules, and they picked up on it, and made it a legitimate game mode with Halo 3, and created forge mode for the players to make maps and game types with them.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying Riot should make a Forge game type, but even by releasing the ability to change starting gold, income, base traits, and allowed characters, lots of game modes can be created. I would love to see Hide and Seek become a realistic game mode to be played on a regular basis by players, and I want to see what we all can make of custom game modes. The custom game community will flock to a player's idea, and take advantage of something fun.\r\n\r\nSimple things can make a huge impact on the community.","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-05-07T22:17:39.707+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having worked on a number of customization engines for various games, I can say that it's quite an undertaking to support customization by people without full access to source code etc.\n\nI don't know whether or not anyone is working on this sort of thing for LoL, but I can say at least that I'm working on making this game easier for *us* to change and update, so maybe someday that will make it feasible to be changed externally.\n\nHaving done a fair amount of WC3 editing in my day, I can say I would love to see the creativity of our community unleashed on game modes someday.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-05-08T01:30:24.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Movespeed times 4.\nImagine it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rakah","date":"2014-05-30T21:49:41.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol this is cool o.o{{champion:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Senzin","date":"2014-05-08T04:14:03.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo Riot has to bring \"fun\" in LoL. It's been years for a lot of us playing all over again the same and even worse not having fun at all in the end.
