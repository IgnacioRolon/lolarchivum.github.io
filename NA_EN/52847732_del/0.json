Thanks guys\n\n**Edit:** Wow guys, thanks for all these answers! I might try Xerath because he looks cool. I unintentionally made it look like I only play mid champs but I play all champs in any lane. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2015-01-08T20:35:14.028+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malzahar is one of the safest champions to push a lane with safely.  On regular (no cannon minion) waves you can E on a ranged minion and then Q the whole back line (range minions).  On a cannon minion wave you can cast E on a melee minion, then cast W on the front line + cannon minion, then cast Q on the front line + cannon minions.  Once you have enough ap you can just...leave after casting the spells this way and the wave will push itself allowing you to get 5/6 of the cs per wave.\n\nNote: If you can do it safely, you can cast Q on an entire wave by arrange yourself parallel to the wave.  Example:  Facing the minion wave in mid lane from the river bush entrance.\n\nSion is a great pusher for top lane.  Max your E, cast W as a wave comes in to lane, start charging Q to get everything low.  By the time Q goes off your wave should have weakened one minion, shoot this minion towards the back line with your E.  This will push an entire wave within a few seconds and it can potentially net you some free harass as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Sachabot","date":"2015-01-09T19:55:33.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No Viktor love?

While Yi can sort of work in mid lane and push/poke safely, if you want premium mid pushing power and safety I'd recommend {{champion:268}} , {{champion:61}} and {{champion:238}}: Azir can push the hardest, Orianna can push the safest and Zed doesn't run out of his resource. All of these champions can last hit extremely easily, and can shove lane hard while always maintaining a measure of safety due to their constant ranged harass and defenses/mobility. Another advantage to these champions is that, in addition to a decent to good early game, they scale extremely well into the late game, and can all be extremely strong even when behind, so no matter how things go, you'll always be a relevant part of your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xtremey","date":"2015-01-08T21:33:24.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ap rengar double roar","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-01-08T21:32:40.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ziggs, Xerath, and Lux are pretty well known for having super long range wave clear; Lux especially at lvl 16 and 40% CDR can laser every single wave, lol. Caitlyn and Sivir are also renown for their waveclear, Graves is also pretty good, you can also use spells like Lucian, Ezreal, and Draven ults to clear waves from long range. All of these strategies are mana hungry, though, as you found out; Waveclear is a super powerful tool and Riot does not tend to balance it lightly; you're going to have to interact with your lane opponent at some point, for the most part. As far as champions that sort of shove a wave while ignoring their opponent, for the most part, Kayle comes to mind. She has shorter range but good sustain with her heal, you typically just hard shove a wave and back off, waiting for the next one, and her E isn't terribly costly as far as mana; she typically doesn't build a mana item except maybe a Dorans ring or two. Morgana has some good waveclear with her W as well, though it costs a fair bit of mana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tin Tarantino","date":"2015-01-08T20:54:36.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle is pretty good for this with E","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-01-08T20:43:34.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vel'Koz.
