Tyler1 is just a toxic man on stream and in game chat but that doesn&#039;t affect the person on the other end. Jensen has been caught fucking DDosing people and he is allowed to play competitively and it &quot;Seems&quot; that Riot was just bias at the time. Of course they aren&#039;t now as Tyler is supposedly being unbanned. I was actually given a perma ban for telling someone to KYS and actually have a post up on it. If riot could treat everyone equally and not suck all the famous league players that would lead to a better community and getting rid of people who troll and are toxic and etc.... \r\n\r\nRito help{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}
