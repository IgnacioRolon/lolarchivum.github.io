What the fuck? this is the third or so person I've reported for having blatantly hateful or gross usernames. You say you have zero tolerance for racism but apparently only if it's in mainstream esports level. Great job. That is all.\n\nEdit: Here's the original screenshot of the report and how long ago it was vs now, seeing this POS is still playing with the same username https://imgur.com/fueYFM5","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T01:22:12.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely NOT okay!!\n\nReports can sometimes take a little bit to process, mostly due to the sheer number of reports we receive on a normal basis. It looks like that report is only 2 days old as of posting this reply, so it hasn't exactly been *too* long. No worries though, I'll make sure this gets sent to the right people.","replies":[{"poster":"djigglybits","date":"2017-09-15T03:47:58.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks. I apologize - I'm just kind of irritated because this happens more times than I'd like to see. As someone who has dealt with the auto-response system first hand I just don't get why something like that wouldn't get caught automatically. In-game chat usually warrants a notification of punishment before I start my next match...","replies":[]}]}]}
