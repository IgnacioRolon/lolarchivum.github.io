My biggest issue with this is that you can easily find tons of videos showcasing the hilarious and elaborate lines that skin had (ie: Skin Spotlights videos) and now anyone else who goes to buy the skin will be a victim of false advertising, even if indirect. Since my support ticket has, and will continue to be ignored I&#039;ll just ask for my rp to be refunded here.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-10-20T05:18:07.612+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is most likely just a bug that they need to fix. \n\nI own the skin myself and just tested it out in a practice to see and yes, the voice over seems to be missing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-10-24T22:38:41.522+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi djigglybits,\n\nSorry for the inconvenience on this!

I've filed a few bug tickets the past few days myself. (I played a game with a Championship Ashe recently, whose Hawkshot only traveled a few feet away from her no matter where she clicked... Kind of a hilarious fail, actually.) {{sticker:poppy-wink}} \n\nAnd yeah, I suspect this is a bug. It's happened in the past, often when we update gameplay and it changes how things work in a way the CAC system doesn't account for. (More on [it here!)](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/08/tech-giving-champions-context/) \n\nI passed this on to the sound designers, if I hear anything official I'll letchu know.","replies":[{"poster":"djigglybits","date":"2017-10-21T05:37:58.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the response.
