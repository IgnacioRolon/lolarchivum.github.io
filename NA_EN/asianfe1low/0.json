LeaverBroker issue *kinda*","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys this is my very first time posting a discussion so bear with me! \r\n\r\nTo start things off.... I have a horrible laptop, it lags in most situations and takes a while for me to load into games but it still is viable to run league (decently). So I started a game but then had to leave after 10 min. (because parent issues) so I only was marked afk/leaver for one game. Then after the issue was over I played another game on the same day, as I was loading into the game my laptop sent me a windows popup that said something like \"Network crashed please try again to connect\" or so. So I tried to connect. By the time I tried connecting another popup came up and said that the game ended (my team voted for a remake). I then was marked for the LeaverBuster. I've been marked before for LeaverBuster but this time it wasn't my fault, it was my network connection. Is there any possibility for me to request to be removed from LeaverBuster? Or do I just have to grind my way out of it again? {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T20:22:55.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Wolfess* is correct, unfortunately, there's no way to remove or modify Leaverbuster penalties. This is because regardless of the reason for disconnecting, it negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a key reason why all disconnections are treated equally by the system.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if your issue persists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-08-31T09:47:35.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have to play through the leaverbusters.
