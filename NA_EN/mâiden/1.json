You can still grab a rylais or a ludens or even a liandrys for a double burn. Its a great way to climb as a support main in ranked! Since most players automatically assume you're just a troll because you didn't build what they thought was \"the best\" build.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2017-03-04T05:13:56.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am pretty sure that guy isn't smart enough to keep a backup account ready : )","replies":[{"poster":"M창iden","date":"2017-03-04T18:11:59.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=deathgod5,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=QAEqRac9,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-03-04T05:13:56.379+0000)\n>\n> I am pretty sure that guy isn&#x27;t smart enough to keep a backup account ready : )\n\nMaybe!
