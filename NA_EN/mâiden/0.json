Since it&#039;s SOOOO EASY! Only support players know the struggle of trying to climb as support out of bronze/silver. Every laner i&#039;ve come across has just said that they don&#039;t play support cause they &quot;don&#039;t want to get carried&quot;, yet every laner has less jobs then the support does.\n\nSupports Job laning:\n1. Keep vision in tri bush and river\n2. Keep vision in lane\n3. Deny enemy vision in lane\n4. Poke enemy team\n5. Keep adc alive\n6. die for you adc to survive\n7. peel for your adc\n8. don&#039;t get kills\n9. don&#039;t feed\n10. Keep vision on dragon\n11. Ping MIA\n12. position correctly/don&#039;t get caught out\n\nAfter Laning Phase:\n1-12\n13. keep vision on baron\n14. ward behind baron/dragon so the enemy team cant steal it\n15. Buy only support items (or get flamed for k.s&#039;ing because your slow janna missile last hit that 10 hp)\n\nAll of this while still recieving less exp and less gold then all other roles.\n\nTop, Mid, ADC Roles all game\n1. Position correctly\n2. Don&#039;t feed\n3. Get kills\n4. Ping MIA\n\n\nYet support players get hassled repeatedly for being a &quot;get carried&quot; role and are more often then not treated as if they do not understand how the game works. I really hope players do realize that every player in the game should have at least 2-5 comfort picks for a minimum of 2 other roles... so ya... we aren&#039;t just a bunch of monkeys with keyboards. We play your roles too, we just don&#039;t care about getting the kills and the fame and glory that a carry gets when they get that pentakill even though the support made it all possible.\n\nStop treating supports like door mats. We do 10 times the stuff laners do get less credit and usually do about the same if not more damage then laners do. Just because most people get auto-filled into support and they don&#039;t want to play the role doesn&#039;t mean that the players who actually like supporting play like they do. So hopefully you take the time before you claim that &quot;the support role does nothing&quot; and ask yourself, if the support role was so easy wouldn&#039;t everyone play it and be challenger?\n\n{{item:3683}}{{item:3682}}{{item:3681}}{{item:3680}}{{item:2054}}{{item:2052}}{{item:2010}} \n^ Heres some poro snax for the trolls about to post!","replies":[{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2017-03-08T05:06:58.449+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any player worth squat knows a good support is worth his weight in gold.

In fact, your support would probably appreciate it.  However, as a support, I often am required to keep vision on dragon, in the enemy tri-bush, and the river all at the same time, not to mention just using them to cover my behind whenever I'm roaming.\n\nYes, you are responsible for managing your creep waves.  Guess what! we have to worry about that too!  Especially if our ADC is not quite grasping that concept.  We have to make sure that our ADC (a COMPLETELY SEPARATE person) is even in a safe enough situation to farm his own creeps.  Supports are also expected to harass, so the enemy ADC fails at the aforementioned endeavor.  You do have to keep track of your opponent's very crucial TP summoner spell.  In reality, the whole team should be aware of that.  Not only do we also have to worry about ganks (just like you, except we're a juicier target because there are two kills to be had) we are facing an enemy support, who most likely has an array of CC.  We have to know the cooldowns of not just 4 abilities + 2 summoner spells + items, but 8 abilities + 4 summoner spells + 2X items.  Otherwise, we can very easily make a bad engage.\n\nThis brings me to the one line that irked me the most:  \"a second player who has my back for the first 20 minutes of the game.\"  Has my back?  Unless we are duo-ing, we are forced to try and communicate with a player who probably isn't even in the same state as us!  The whole lane long, we are not leaning on them, but RELYING on them to play well.  We hope that they have the same level of aggressiveness, skill, experience, and drive as us.  Every game you have to foster a good connection with this person if you want any chance of doing well.  Having a teammate is a gamble.\n\nSo yes, if you are duo-ing with a friend you can speak to vocally, and have played with before, then yes, support can be an easier role than a solo lane.  But if you are a true support player and play solo queue, you are rolling the dice every champ select.  No matter what the dice show, you are forced to make it work to the best of your ability, while simultaneously doing all those other support things.\n\nBut rock on in top lane!  Your TP ganks are appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Mâiden","date":"2017-03-09T18:48:09.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly i cant tell you how many times I have an adc refuse to heal me because he needed it for ghosting? or how many times my adc was like no that last caster minion is way more important then this gank that i just got 10 gold for instead of two kills and 4 assists for my team but hey yanno! Sometimes you just get a bad adc sometimes theres a bad support i always follow my #1 rule though and that is to support the player who is most valuable for the team your adc keeps running off and dieing for nothing? but the mid laner is 10/1 go support your mid laner .... there is no use in making it a 3/5 just because plauers feel you have to be with your adc there really isnt.
