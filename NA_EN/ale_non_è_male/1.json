Everyone but you Cassio players hated it\r\n\r\nWith the new rework you got a much cooler kit that give you a larger field of possibilities to make plays. Accept that no one else except you wanted or liked your main champ old kit and stop moaning about the changes to the kit. The only thing you are obtaining by keep moaning and crying is bother the other people, and being honest this does not help to have the rest of the playerbase have sympathy for your struggles, if anything you are just bothering the rest of the people to the point theyare getting tired to listen to your whining requests\r\n\r\nI mean, it is fair that you ask for your champ to be viable, and it is fair that you can ask for buffs and QoL adjustements. And Riot will have to answer to your voice if you are correct in your assessment and they will have to buff Cassio if she end up being too weak.\r\nBUT, you must first drop the attitude where if Cassio can&#039;t just spam E mindlessly she is not good at all, you have to first accept to adapt and play her new kit to his fullest extent, and then, if Cassio is actually too much on the weak side, the rest of the players will support you in asking for buffs... if you don&#039;t do this first, you have no right to ask for balance adjustments for your champs, I&#039;m sorry\r\n\r\nP.S. I completely despise the E CD hotfix Riot decided to release basically in advance for the fear of Cassio players revolt EXACTLY for this reason. It was way too soon to make the call given that most of Cassio players didn&#039;t even try to play in a different way. This way they only encouraged the syubborn Cassio players to NOT change their playstyle at all, not even by an ounce. They had to let it play out at least for a full patch forcing the Cassio stubborn players to actually explore the new different gameplay patterns and then eventually make the change","replies":[{"poster":"Zerolera","date":"2016-05-13T15:32:52.373+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's still E spamming so I have no idea what point you're trying to make in your thread.

The same Cassio fanbase has to decide what they want, because they are split up between being accustomed to the E spam only gameplay pattern, and the fact that this gameplay pattern did not satisfy properly the Cassio fantasy\nRight now there is a problem with Cassio power, BUT Cassio players can't react asking straight E buffs, because that would defy the scope of the rework theirselves asked for\nThey got to get accustomed to the new style and when they have adjusted tackle the power issue, starting from the other spells other than E spam to force Cassio players even more out of it and only then eventually buff E again\n\nIdally you buff MS (either base or the passive) and Miasma's AP ratio and functionality  first which are the obvious thing underpowered, and then you go revaluating the other spells including E","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-05-13T15:29:43.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the strong majority of Cass players hate the E spam and want poison to be a theme of her kit rather than the set up to the E spam.\n\nThis kit is certainly closer and thematically, its definitely hits the point better than her old one, however there are still some issues with her.\n\nHer Q mana cost is ridiculous in comparison to her starting mana pool. \nHer W is just awkward, the fixed cast range means its pretty useless in many scenarios unless you're a psychic. \nHer E is better, this is the one part that is actually good.\nAnd her R still has some prevalent problems. Wonky hit box, they nerfed the slow on it for no evident reason, and I think there are other problems which I'm not remembering off the top of my head.\n\nThematically yes she's closer, gameplay, she's just as poor as before, IIRC she's sporting around a low 40% win rate atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2016-05-13T22:31:20.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Droogzy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UnHBBwhT,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2016-05-13T15:29:43.637+0000)\n>\n> I think the strong majority of Cass players hate the E spam \n\nNah, that's just NOT true\nCassio players generally like a lot the E spam because it is was make Cassio the difficult mechanically champ Cassio players are looking for. They just want to have more than the E spam, but actually it doesn't seem they were willing to sacrifice power on E to get more on the rest, at least a part of them\n\nI agree that there are still issues on Cass, but what I was pointing out is that the protests done by Cassio fanbase weren't on the excessive weaknesses to fix but that most of them were along the lines of \"Cassio sucks because she don't do damage with her usual E spam gameplay pattern \", rather than suggesting improvements for the new gameplay patterns that ended up being too weak\nAnd they forced the hand for Riot to actually lower the E CD from the release, which was a bad thing to do in that moment where they were trying to make Cassio players learn new gameplay patterns alternative to \"mindlessly spam E\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Romans 8","date":"2016-05-11T16:25:38.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, I hope Riot reworks your favorite champion into something that isn't what the champion is supposed to function as, with a less synergistic kit. \n\nIf Riot goes to all this trouble to reworking Cassiopeia into something she isn't, I hope the rest of the League community will actually play her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2016-05-11T16:45:38.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Romans 8,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UnHBBwhT,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-05-11T16:25:38.543+0000)\n>\n> Ok, I hope Riot reworks your favorite champion into something that isn&#x27;t what the champion is supposed to function as, with a less synergistic kit. \n> \n\nCassio was supposed to be a posion dps mage.
