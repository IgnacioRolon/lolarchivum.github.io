I had just bought him that day and it was my first game. Sadly, I fed. After that game I reopened the client and got a pop up that said I had a 14 day suspension for chat behavior (I can&rsquo;t truly recall what it said). I did curse a bit that game but not in an offensive way and not directed to anyone. Also, I used the /pause command in chat ( someone on my team said there was&rsquo; such a command and I tried it) so idk if that&rsquo;s why. I&rsquo;m just kinda confused and please tell me if I did anything wrong and I&rsquo;ll try to learn from my mistake(s). Or if this is a bug or something else non related to the game, I would appreciate you guys unban me. Thank you!\n\nEdit: This is my first suspension/ban. Also feel free to call me out Riot (I’m not trying to be mean).","replies":[{"poster":"SparklingLama","date":"2018-05-09T22:35:03.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't get a 14 day for ONE game.
