The problem is that this new client makes my programs freeze and I have to reboot my pc. I tried to change compatibility mode but it didn't change anything. Could you guys help me please?\r\n(Sorry for my english xd)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-09T01:43:40.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's try a really quick and simple fix before we start messing around with your system too much. In the updated client we introduced a new feature called low-spec mode which can help with a lot of the stress the client can sometimes put on lower end machines. You should be able to find that option in the client settings at the top, but I've left a screenshot for reference as well!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/122e3c15565316f47d8ac752ee894bc5.png","replies":[{"poster":"haha counterplay","date":"2017-05-09T16:29:50.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried this, my client works for the first 10 minutes but after that it just does it again and I have to reboot my pc. I have no problems on other games like GTA 5 or even battlefield 1 btw so I dont really think it's a config problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T21:24:04.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good we were able to get it working a *little* bit better, but let's dig a little further to make sure we clear everything else up as well.
