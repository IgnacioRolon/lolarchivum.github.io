I mean get rid of the king of the hill concept/ trivial point system entirely and make it into a new game mode that people can take seriously.\r\n\r\nWhat if instead of 5, there were 6 locations around the ring, and they were grouped so that each side had 3 &quot;nexus&quot; like bases, and your team only loses when all 3 are destroyed, the first one is easier, kind of like the 3v3 style, 1 turret + 1 nexus, and the middle one would have 2 longer range, higher HP turrets.\r\n\r\nyou could also spruce up the jungle by throwing in 2 inhibitors for each team. imagine if you actually needed to go in the jungle to defend something? and at the center, instead of those stupid buffs, make it an objective that spawns at 15 minutes that acts as a base buff, or hell, whatever you want, i don&#039;t care, just drop baron mid even, just make it interesting. oh, the buff could be a 5 man buff that is currently in the middle of dominion... but that&#039;d be OP AF.. whatever, you get my point. hell throw in some jungle camps. and at the top and bot minion spawning areas you could have little rift heralds or something that activate super minions etc.... I have too many ideas ffs, but you get the concept... i hope\r\n\r\nit would still be 5 man, the gold income could be altered a bit, and laning phase (because you need to actually consistently defend something) would spurr into a  2v2 and 3v3 meta. this means a lot of the things that are viable on SR but not Dom currently would be able to transfer over... like I DUNNO SUPPORT. JUNGLING.\r\n\r\nRiot, pls hire me. I would love to actually design this into a permanent game mode people could take seriously.","replies":[]}
