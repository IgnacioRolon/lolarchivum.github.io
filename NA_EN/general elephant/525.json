It is like they don't even acknowledge the fact your team gets a ton of gold... I think the best way to win is by trying to get the outer turrets down as quick as possible... Maybe this strategy is a little \"well duh!\" But have you ever seen a comp designed for turret demo? Not since splitpushing was the only way to win way back when, and even then it wasn't recognized that the gold was an advantage... It is like people think they are simply barrier to break, and not juicy piles of gold to snatch up.\n\nConversely people don't value their own turrets NEARLY as highly as they should. In game they are your strongest non playerbased asset. Denying the enemy that gold is way more valuable than that stupid kill you chased way too deep. Even if you get it, if you lost a turret because you didn't clear the minions, the enemy team just got 2.5 times as much gold as you did from that kill.\n\nTl;dr- people under value taking turrets and they under value protecting them, which leads to being put behind in game and equates to more losses in the long run.","replies":[]}
