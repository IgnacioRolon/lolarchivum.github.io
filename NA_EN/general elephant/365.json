The vast majority of people have no clue what eah candidate&#039;s fiscal and monetary policies are or even foreign diplomacy for that matter... some people are educated on these matters, but the reason that mudslinging is so effective is because hatred is a stronger repelling force than positive views are at attracting voters. In the end most voters are going to make an ill-informed decision that we&#039;ll have to live with for the next 4 years (probably). \r\n\r\nMy point is, whether you feel more aligned with red or blue, you should undwrstand the basic values that each party is founded on and then use what you feel is the best governing strategy to make you an informed voter. \r\n\r\nPlease, in future elections, at least try to understand the basics, as most people resort to political ads and news for the bulk of their candidate information. It is a sad but true reality.","replies":[]}
