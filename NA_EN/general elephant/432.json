I don&#039;t either. But when they said they are going to do &quot;minor changes to allow more skill and counterplay&quot; mainly focusing on his W.... There is no way it ends well. Countless times riot has taken a champion I loved and played very frequently and made them into something that ruins the reason I play them... Corki, Graves, Shen all examples of champions I used to love until they turn them into either a monster (graves) who doesn&#039;t even have the same role as he once did, or Corki/Shen where they mutate their identity so much they are not what they once were.... \r\n\r\nGranted, it is mainly Xin&#039;s W, the least interactive part of his kit... but I can&#039;t help think they are gonna turn it into some gimmicky BS that will either make him a monster or completely change him into something that no one likes....\r\n\r\n/rant\r\n\r\nI want Xin to get a rework, but I have a terrible feeling Riot is going to mess it up and leave him in the dumpster for countless seasons....\r\n\r\n(also the idea of them completely reworking Swain terrifies me)","replies":[]}
