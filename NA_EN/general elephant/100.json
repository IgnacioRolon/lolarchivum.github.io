Give it some gimmicky effect that is useful for clearing or something... straight AD and a little CDR is good for few champs and realistically those who build it could probably use a tiamat variant more effectively anyway... I am not saying its an amazing idea... but AD and a little cdr seems so lame for the time and resources you invest into it....","replies":[]}
