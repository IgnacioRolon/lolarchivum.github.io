Misunderstood?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I have been looking into Urgot and what makes him so special.\n\nI came to a few conclusions that might be a bit surprising.\n\nIf you disagree I'll be glad to hear you out.\n\nConclusion 1: Manamune gimps his damage early game and makes it hard to get to mid to late game without getting shut down. In terms of damage, it only Adds 25AD (solely from the pickaxe) and the rest of the benefit is mana based. Even when it becomes muramana, you only get the passive AD increase on his Q, and the toggle only applies to his AAs. It is still a lot of damage, but I feel that having a rough early game outweighs the benefit of the item that has always been deemed a \"core item\" on him.\n\nConclusion 2: Maxing Q to increase the damage is not the best idea. Yes is adds a bit of damage, but with the flat AD ratio, and no CD reduction, his Q is good at level 1... afterwards you only get minimal increases. I suggest Maxing e first. It scales really well, increases the armor shred, reduces the CD, AND increases the already pretty good damage.\n\nConclusion 3: His AAs are short... really short... So you can't build all damage and expect to do well. I find getting a moderate amount of HP is critical to his success. In the same thought process, he should definitely get either tabi or mercs in order to get a bit of resistance. He needs it if he is going to survive long enough to put out his maximum damage through his full combo.\n\nConclusion 4: Spamming his Q to get tear into Muramana faster may be hurting his game as well. 40 mana is a lot to blow through early game when it is on such a short CD, I find I feel less obligated to Q if I don't build it and just focus my gold into getting early game AD through either a {{item:3134}} or {{item:1038}} if I am doing well. This makes each Q more effective because of how well it scales, and thereby letting you use it less to get the same amount of damage.\n\neditted to remove error involving black cleaver\n\nAs a side note: his e will apply black cleaver stacks on every tick (4 in total)\n\nEven though it is not popular, I personally find I have more success as Urgot when I am a little more conservative with my Qs, and I try to pack a bigger punch into each spell use. That being said, here is the build I generally follow:\n\n{{item:3260}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3172}} {{item:3026}} \n\nThe logic of this build is pretty simple:\n1. have a functional pool of mana and enough hp to get by in a 1v1 as well as some resistances.\n2. have armor shred be applied as quickly as possible so that the damage from Q and E both get the maximum per use\n3. have a sizable amount of AD to utilize his scaling\n4. zephyr. you probably think i'm crazy, but it helps his slow MS and close those AA gaps, it helps with AD, and lets him stack black cleaver even faster as well as gives him some more CDR to put the final build at 30%, which is great because then you can keep w and e up almost permanently while not sacrificing damage, sustain, or tankiness.\n\nThe goal is to overcome his short AA range and really abuse his kit to get the most out of each spell as well as be able to utilize his ult for the amazing ability it is. He isn't an ADC, he isn't a bruiser, So you have to treat him as if he is both... kind of.","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-03-21T07:47:53.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> As a side note: His Q does not apply black cleaver stacks, nor does it apply the toggle from muramana. To utilize either of these items, you NEED to AA often\n\nBlack Cleaver applies to all physical damage ever. You don't need to AA, you just need to deal physical damage. And Corrosive being a Dot will apply all 4 stacks.\n\nAlso - Muramana's toggle applies to single-target spells in addition to auto-attacks.\n\nI'm not sure how you can even get that wrong.

I'm having tons of fun playing this guy these days. One thing I noticed playing him is that, when I play from average to well, I'm the one with the least damage taken. That's because I hardly get into autoattack range (unless I'm in hard advantage and can do it, or I get jumped on), shutting people down from afar and mitigating most of their damage through shield + passive. With the furor enchantment on his boots and his shield up, you can basically kite people from 1200 range!!! Lategame I can \"duel\" ADCs with Urg's crappy dps and no lifesteal because... they can't trade back! I just E them, then slow them to the ground and shut them down from afar while they can't apply their primary form of defence (lifesteal). It's funny as hell (and probably toxic, whereas I might understand why he has been nerfed so hard). He's very rewarding to play because of his unique playstile, but I don't know if he's a good pick overall (I'm playing in normals): you deprive your team of a frontliner (as are most toplaners) and, if don't have a tank/offtank in the rest of the team, you can have trouble not being focused down (you can hold at bay one, sometimes two aggressors, but not more).","replies":[]}]}
