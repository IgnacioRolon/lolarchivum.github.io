She has easy AF cs&#039;ing abilities, she does good team fight damage, and her ult provides a lot of utility. \n\nMost importantly though, she abuses poor reaction times when it comes to lane rotations. My last game as her I just pushed bot any time I saw the enemy team not close to the lane. I took tier 1 and 2 before 15 minutes.... i took the inhibitor turret at 21... every game is like that.\n\nBasically all you have to do as sivir is never let any of the three lanes push to the turret if you can help it and just hard push every lane so you get map/objective control... she is pretty much a PvE ADC, it is kinda funny.... with her ult and spell shield getting shiv after Reaver makes waves melt in seconds. The enemy team can never keep up because they are too busy trying to fight your team that their inhibs drop even if they won the team fight...\n\nSivir is just freelo at low elo because she applies so much pressure, she is a crappy duelist and gets bullied in lane... just farm up and ezpz push to win. I&#039;ve had ranked games as her where I&#039;ll get credit for 6-8 turret kills... she doesn&#039;t give the enemy enough time to react so you force them to waste time chasing you, or fight your team who is probably defending a turret...","replies":[]}
