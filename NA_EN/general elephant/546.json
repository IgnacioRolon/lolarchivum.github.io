Any suggestions?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am kinda bored with what I am playing now a days. I am just looking for a game that gives a solid sense of progess and something I can put in at least 50-100 hours. PC only (console suggestions welcome too since I am still deciding which to get) and trying to keep to a $20-30 budget. I like RTS/TBS and JRPG/RPG games, but I am also open to new genres. \r\n\r\nSuggestions are welcome, i find gamers tend to give the most honest opinions, also game reviews tend to be pretty deceiving. Anyway all input welcome thabks in advance!","replies":[]}
