WTF?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the Depths is a game made by one guy.... He has produced more meaningful content and changes to this game since it&#039;s release than just about any other game developer I&#039;ve ever seen. It is still in Alpha, but it is so intricate and glorious and complicated that for a $20 steam game... I could easily sink 3 times more time into it than I did for all of Skyrim. Which is saying something.\r\n\r\nJust recently he completely ovehauled the resource acquisition, processing, and storage. He re-did  the entire engine system. He created  an advanced cannon system that allows you to customize ammo, ammo production, and even uses clips and autoloaders among other things.\r\n\r\nI honestly think that this guy must literally just eat breathe sleep From the Depths. He has basically relaunched every aspect of the game since it&#039;s initial release.\r\n\r\nThis being said, I look at LoL and just......... smh\r\n\r\nWhat has Riot *really* done content wise? skins? a few items? balance patches? a champion every so often? a flash game?\r\n\r\nOne guy can essentially relaunch his game. Why can&#039;t Riot show a bit more content creation?\r\n\r\nRito pls","replies":[]}
