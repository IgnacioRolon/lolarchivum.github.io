Reflects less damage back to attackers, but scales with armor. \r\n\r\n&ldquo; Another major outlier in terms of effectiveness, Thornmail is at its strongest when you can comfortably stack health. While we aren&rsquo;t rocking that particular boat today (armor + health is kind of always good), we&rsquo;re tossing in a hook to make the item also scale with armor-stacking, but in a different way. This also creates neat synergies for champions with on-demand armor buffs (like Leona or Rammus) which is pretty OK by us.\r\n\r\nImportant to note - if for any reason you experience a decrease in armor % (say, a stray black cleaver to the face), Thornmail will ignore that when calculating its damage.
