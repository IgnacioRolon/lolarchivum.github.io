This Post is the end result of my work. 137 posts, 40 states, 6 provinces, and 3 separate countries are included. I was hoping for more responses, but this amount of data was enough to get a good idea of how the server move affected how we play LoL. Keep in mind this was not a Simple Random Sample, but a voluntary response collection of data. There is no feasible way to collect an SRS online for LoL pings.\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/TVVMHyhi-i-want-to-make-a-beforeafter-ping-chart-that-is-state-by-state\r\n\r\nWhile I wanted to paste all of my images right into this post for ease of viewing, it is not possible due to forum limitations and the fact it auto formats pictures and sizes so you&#039;d need to click on each picture to see each chart. That being said I created an imgur album simply to allow for people to fully view all of the information and that is listed below.\r\n\r\n[Imgur link](http://imgur.com/gallery/gnr0H/new)\r\n\r\nThis includes All of the charts broken down into digestible changes for before and after the server move to Chicago with the entire Excel Sheet posted for a more complete visual of the data. \r\n\r\nAn Analysis:\r\n\r\nWhile the little attachment I used as a thumbnail does a good job summarizing the data, I feel like the data should be viewed in its entirety to fully understand who is benefitted and who is hurt in this move. While it is clearly a positive result, there are a few areas that were hurt in the move, namely Alaska and Hawaii.\r\n\r\nWith the amount of ping dropping a good 15 ms across the board, Riot did somewhat achieve their goal of not only lowering overall ping, but bringing the range of ping closer together. As you look at the charts note how the end results are much less extreme than they previously were, many states ended much closer to the 40-60 range which as a result decreased the standard deviation of average ping. I did not calculate this, however It is clear to see with the visuals and the raw data that this is true.\r\n\r\nMost people benefited from the move. I have also noticed that the people who were negatively affected such as the western states, are actually just brought in line with normal ping rates with the rest of the states. I hope this data helps people see what Riot&#039;s intentions were, and the amount of success they had with this move. Though it is not to be overlooked  that according to my data for the US, they were 6 ping above their target goal of a 50 ping average across the states. This being said an overall reduction of 21.5 ping is very substantial and we as a community are better off as a result.\r\n\r\n**I did this so that we could have some actual data about the move instead of people guessing or having Riot tell us the move was a success with no data to back it up. I hope this clears the air of any confusion, and feel free to link this to people who may say or believe the the move was not in the best interest of the LoL gaming community as a whole.**","replies":[{"poster":"PiRoScOuT","date":"2015-09-01T03:07:05.960+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't begin to imagine how much work this took, good job","replies":[{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2015-09-01T03:22:40.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PiRoScOuT,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rPceE1Wr,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-01T03:07:05.960+0000)\n>\n> I can't begin to imagine how much work this took, good job\n\nty. aside from the occasional OP bumps for 3 days, the actual translation, calculations and charts took about 6 hours. copy pasta formulas OP.\n\nI just updated the original post as the data came in, and translating it from one side  to the other took a while, but it was all worth while in my book, I also became an expert at using excel where before I had no clue...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kurthl33t","date":"2015-09-01T15:22:51.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the Rockies and I can confirm that my ping barely changed--I went from an average of about 50 to about 56.

Ping is measured in \"ms\"--that's 1/1000 of a second. This is the time it takes data to be sent and receive a response, so your actual lag is generally about half of this number since the time it takes for your input to be received (without the confirmation data back) is one way, rather than there and back.\n\nMost people need .15s and .25s to react to something, or 150-250ms, so let's average it to just 200ms. If your ping before was in the 90-110 range, that's roughly 1/20 of a second of lag, or 50ms. You may notice this if you REALLY pay attention, but over the course of a 40 minute game, it flattens out and becomes inconsequential, especially as you get a \"feel\" for it (get used to it).\n\nAdd an average person's reaction time of 200ms to a ping of 100ms/2, and it takes them about 250ms (1/4 of a second) to respond to an action. Reduce their ping to 50, and that time becomes 225ms (~1/5 of a second). It's EXTREMELY minor, so when someone blames their \"ping\" for their actual failure to play well, just laugh.\n\nIt's just another thing to blame so they can protect their fragile ego.\n\n_Special Note:_ There are other factors that can influence lag, such as computer performance, so the importance of ping is reduced even more.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximus Paine","date":"2016-08-26T23:29:56.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Häßlich,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rPceE1Wr,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-09-01T07:23:20.353+0000)\n>\n> This is the time it takes data to be sent and receive a response, so your actual lag is generally about half of this number since the time it takes for your input to be received (without the confirmation data back) is one way, rather than there and back.\n> \n\nIt's not really half of the number - one way. :-( It's two way because something happens at server level, you get it late one way, you react, and it gets back to the server delayed the other way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hermeneutist","date":"2015-09-01T16:35:17.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are situations when 1/100s makes a difference, for instance trying to land clutch {{champion:26}} ults. in fact, trying to {{summoner:21}} at the last second or {{summoner:11}} steal baron... fairly common moves with extremely huge differences in outcome. how about a clutch {{champion:25}} shield? or doing some sick {{champion:55}} blink resets? even trying to time {{champion:12}}'s combo becomes insanely hard with lag.\n\ni know because i play NA with 200ms ping, and i used to play my local oceania server with 20ms ping. there is a distinct difference, even after you get used to it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MadManApocalypse","date":"2015-09-03T07:02:45.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather them just get another server up and running, they're the biggest game around after all.","replies":[{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2015-09-03T18:11:50.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MadManApocalypse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rPceE1Wr,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2015-09-03T07:02:45.669+0000)\n>\n> I'd rather them just get another server up and running, they're the biggest game around after all.\n\nIt segments the population and reduces the overall competition.
