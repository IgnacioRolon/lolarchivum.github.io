A large part of this game is fundementals and macro play... even in solo queue. Is it really so hard to have at least one solid &quot;I can do pretty well with this champ&quot; in each role? I mean yeah csing can be a bit weird because of the differences in AD for last hits... but even then it should still be fairly doable....\r\n\r\nI am not saying people should be jack of all king of none, but ffs you should be compitent enough at every role so that you aren&#039;t a liability to your team at your respective elo... this includes OTPs. Just because you are a master at one champion doesn&#039;t mean you have no clue how to play the game otherwise... \r\n\r\nAm I crazy to think this?","replies":[]}
