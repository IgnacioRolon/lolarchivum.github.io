Anyone else like it? It is a RTS sandbox battle ship/pirate (secretly) game that has a REALLY high learning curve. Basically you suck at life until you get it and become a boss. I feel like more people need to play and enjoy these sandbox RTSs that are super in depth and very complicated, while being deceptively simple. Also the freedom of design is so cool when you realize you make way better designs than the prefabs. Because for the longest time you're terrified of their power until you figure out the secrets to winning.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-10-17T03:30:43.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have it, and I have found the best piece of advice I could possibly give regarding it (I learned from Robbaz):\n\nMake most of the ship out of 4-block-long beam blocks. They cover so much more area, and modifying the ship will take a hell of a lot less time. You can add finer details with the smaller blocks afterwards.","replies":[]}]}
