Though we&#039;ve never met in person, I am happy to have met them and talked to them.\n\nI am just kind of curious, what experiences others have had with people and what they have enjoyed about other players. League is a pretty rough game to play, so I want to know, why are we here? what drives you to keep playing?\n\nI may sound sappy, but friendship is one of the largest reasons I even considered playing league, who do you know that you would like to mention?","replies":[]}
