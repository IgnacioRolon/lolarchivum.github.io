Aside from a few games I feel like I am doing my best, but there is always something so hopelessly out of my control I can&#039;t even fathom how to do better to win the game. Sure I make mistakes, but I mean this is silver goddamnit. Everyone is supposed to make mistakes...\n\nanyway my most recent game was the first one I won in a long time... and it is because I played my heart out... I was shotcalling like a mad man and punishing people for over extending and just overall doing everything in my power to win. Despite this we almost lost... if the enemy team stopped flaming eachother for 1 second and focused we could have lost instantly, their riven was fed AF as well as their WW, and kog had his core items and a janna backing him up....\n\nOh well. I won&#039;t make gold this year so the least i can do is go down swinging.","replies":[]}
