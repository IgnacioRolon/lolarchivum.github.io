Work with it","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just a friendly reminder to those of you who try so very hard every ranked game and get frustrated with feeders, trolls, and ragers.\n\nI have found you can't fight against facts in game... meaning you need to ackowledge your team is down 4 turrets more and two drags. At that point using skill and mechanical ability to win goes out the window. It comes down to good decisions. The enemy WILL make decisive errors, and you need to capitalize on them and look for them. So many people refuse to accept they are behind because they don't want to ackowledge they are losing. This causes snowballing for the enemy. \n\nWork with the conditions of the game. The way league operates is that teams in the lead need to become more vulnerable in order to try and win. Use turrets, and even enemy travel distance to your advantage.  The easiest way to secure a loss is by over extending and not utilizing your in game assets. Minions and turrets are by far the most under rated bonuses to utilize in game.... force the enemy to deal with them, and don't give them up lightly. Definitely not for a kill.\n\nAnyway I just thought I'd share why I think people feed and throw games so often.\n\nTl;dr acknowledge when you are at a disadvantage and use DECISIONS to turn the game in around.","replies":[]}
