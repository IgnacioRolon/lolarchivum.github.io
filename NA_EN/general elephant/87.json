Beg for mercy if she lands her Q, just that partial skill combo will easily do over half your health... if you&#039;re lucky.\r\n\r\nI know  people on GD have been saying Anivia is broken... i thought she might just be &quot;strong&quot; but ffs, there is no way a tear/catalyst blasting rod Anivia should do 80% of your hp (or more!) in a single combo. Throw in a  good use of her wall or Q and you&#039;re super dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n_**!!!!!GUT THE FREELO ICEBIRD!!!!!**_","replies":[]}
