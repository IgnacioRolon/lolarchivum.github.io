I think the primary reason is that the ranking system doesn&#039;t accurately reflex the player if they play more than one mode in one role... which is everyone...\n\nIn a perfect world MMR is perfect because everyone plays at the same skill level, plays an infinite number of games, and never changes roles or modes.\n\nIn the real world they should just index win ratios across all champs for each player and weight their mmr based on their most played. A weighted MMR that is champion based with the only exception being ranked vs normals, where ranked affects norm mmr but not vice versa.\n\nThe end result is a weighted... semi-universal MMR that more accurately reflects a player&#039;s skill level. It isn&#039;t perfect, and there would be some clear issues with getting things smoothed out but... in the end, could it be much worse than this?","replies":[]}
