I want to include as much as possible for amazing metal, so I simply ask you submit your favorite songs so I can potentially add them to my ever growing ultimate metal playlist :D. I am sick of listening to intermittent junk and simply want to amass the most ultimate amazing playlist so I can know all of what i am listening to is a premium experience. I am not judgmental/picky and I use the term metal fairly loosely, so any submissions even kinda close will be considered :D. any assistance in this urgent matter is greatly appreciated\n\nedit: also the playlist is called \"No Fodder All Fire\" just cause that seems appropriate","replies":[]}
