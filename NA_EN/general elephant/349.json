I started losing to someone who was pretty bad... I ended up going 1/8, but my team carried so hard it didn&#039;t matter, the tp kha&#039;zix ended 9/2 and used tp to gank lanes from the far bushes...\r\n\r\nthe whole thing just has me baffled... i tried so hard in my previous attempts, and even when I was getting kills, and pushing lanes and helping secure objectives.... we always lost really hard regardless... and the one time i feed out my ass and do horribly, my team cleans up my terrible engages and destroys the enemy team...\r\n\r\nfor a ranked system... it is kinda funny that the better I played... the worse everyone else did, and when i feed, my team goes god mode and carries my sorry ass.\r\n\r\nanyone else have dumb experiences in ranked..?","replies":[]}
