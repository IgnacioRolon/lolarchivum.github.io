SV is litterally the only one in that list that gives MR....\n\nmy prediction is that people will not adjust and still rush 2+ armor items, being completely vulnerable to AP carries. even if they do get MR first, they will only buy one MR item and still be able to get chunked out by mages with the new items and the new reworked champs that will come out.","replies":[]}
