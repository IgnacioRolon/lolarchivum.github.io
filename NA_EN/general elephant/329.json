I haven&#039;t played anything since pearl... but sun and moon is super hype...\r\n\r\nDo I pony up the dough or should I just let the hype I have die and not bother? I&#039;ve watched a lot of lets plays, and if I wanted I could buy both a ds and a copy of sun or moon on a credit card....\r\n\r\nThis being said.... Is it worth? I don&#039;t want buyers remorse but I&#039;d love to play sun or moon.. does it live up to the hype? Is it worth? I don&#039;t plan to play competitively, just plan to enjoy it like every other pokemon game..\r\n\r\nHelp me decide pls","replies":[]}
