I played it about a year and a half ago and never finished. I am just now getting back to where I quit (week 45-50ish) I am playing **Vanilla** as a heads up, but I completely want to get the DLCs.\n\nFirst things first. Any great tips or fun things people have tried? I killed the Swine King with a double grave robber frontline, which was awesome. I did a super saiyan leper run to kill the mid tier siren. I killed her in 3 hits after I mega buffed him. He crit for 80 two times in a row. It has been a load of fun\n\nNext, I have a roster of about 15 level 5s with 5 more very close. Anybody want to be named? What non-DLC class? Any load out preferences?\n\nI am loving Dankest Dungeon right now, and I am watching NothernLion&#039;s letsplay of it as he is playing it too. He is a dummy but it is entertaining.\n\nAny other information or stories is greatly appreciated. Also any Dankest Dungeon memes would be awesome too.\n\nEdit: Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.","replies":[]}
