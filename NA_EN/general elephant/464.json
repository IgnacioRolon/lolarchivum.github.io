Playing things on the hardest mode immediately, torturing myself to achieve the greatest goals games have to offer....\r\n\r\nbut I&#039;ve realized none of it matters.\r\n\r\nThe result of this revelation has lead me to seek a more eccentric means of joy through gaming. I have found that joy is the ultimate goal of any gaming experience, and seek games which provide me with the maximum amount of it per minute/$ spent. Ultimately, gaming is a ratio of joy to money, and as such, I look for high value games that provide the most joy per minute played.\r\n\r\nIn terms of league, I find myself indulging in skins and the like far too often, I can&#039;t really enjoy the game either, as it is very stressful and unrewarding at times.... while there is the occasional moment of elation, I can&#039;t justify playing it any more...\r\n\r\nThe reason I now focus my gaming abilities on low impact, &quot;carebear&quot; games is that it ultimately provides joy at a low cost and reduces stress incurred. This combination is effectively gaming nirvana. When presented with free time to allow for games to be played, challenges are nigh important and the ultimate goal is simply to acquire joy in the most efficient manner possible.\r\n\r\nEven the most challenging games are not rewarding, and masochistic tendencies that these games impose on their players is simply, irrefutably, inferior to the main objective of gaming, which is joy, aka having fun.\r\n\r\nI hope this post enlightens more individuals to see the light that is the purpose of gaming and that we as a community can better ourselves as a result.","replies":[]}
