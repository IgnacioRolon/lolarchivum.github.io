I kind of suck top lane","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to improve as it is currently my weakest role. I mainly play renekton, but my main issue is that i get overly aggressive and either bully the lane into being cs starved or push the lane too hard and get ganked.\r\n\r\nI want to pick up some more top laners to round out my roster, but I find a lot of top laners are not very suitable to my play style and thus i do poorly.\r\n\r\nI have tried rumble vlad and maokai and they just don&#039;t quite go with how I am used to playing. I am thinking of trying swain, but i am open to other ideas.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to have an AD bruiser (renekton) an AP top laner (swain?) and a tank (i have no idea...)\r\n\r\nWho should I learn and why? My goal is to learn how to play consistently well for each of the three champions so I never have an issue in champion select","replies":[]}
