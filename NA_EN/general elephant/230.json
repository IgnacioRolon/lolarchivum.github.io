We all live our own lives and do our own things. I wanna get to know you all, and hopefully you&#039;ll get to know me a little bit as well.\n\n\nI want to stereotype my own life into a single day, in a way that gives you all a good taste of my IRL without knowing me in person. It&#039;d be great if other people did too, but this is GD, so it&#039;ll probably just get downvoted and ignored After all, it doesn&#039;t have waifus, anime, memes, drama, OP champion complaints, flaming, QQing, trolling, or supersonic levels of shitposting involved.\n\n     MORNING\nI wake up 5 minutes before I need to throw on my suit and tie and leave for work, today work for me starts at 10am, my rule never changes. I rush into the bathroom, still kind of disoriented, and brush my teeth and throw on my suit. I look in the mirror and think &quot;I should have shaved last night... oh well, maybe tomorrow&quot;. I run around the house with 60 seconds until I need to leave or I&#039;ll be late. I&#039;m never late. I don&#039;t know where I left my shoes, wallet, keys, or phone, and realized one of my socks has a mysterious wet spot on it. Miraculously, it all comes together and I run out the door right on time. I text my wife to have a good day and speed off to work.\n\n     WORK\nI race in the door 2 minutes early and punch in. My boss (the pharmacist) looks like I just brought a rescue boat with a feast fit for a king to them as if they were stranded on a deserted island. Some days I am the one stranded. With the extra afternoon person in (me), we finally start putting a dent in the work load. We&#039;re not out of the woods yet, over the course of three hours, we take in and process 100 prescriptions. To some pharmacies that is chump change, but when we only have 4 people working, it can get a bit crazy operating a drive through, calling insurances, fielding all the calls for the superstore the pharmacy is a part of, and a million other things we&#039;ll never have time to do. I&#039;m never doing less than 3 things at once. Time flies when you&#039;re doing the work of 2-4 people. 6pm rolls around, I am scheduled to leave. My boss gives me yet another look of desperation. 50 to transcribe, 35 to fill, 5 people in line, and 20 for the pharmacist to do the final check for, on top of the additional 140 data verifications (2nd check kinda like the pharmacist does) our pharmacy requires to be done by close. They were going to drown if I didn&#039;t stay. 8pm rolls around, my wife tries calling &quot;You&#039;re staying late again!?! Dinner was ready over an hour ago!&quot; I tell my boss I&#039;ve stayed as long I can, and they understand, they thank me a ton for staying, and I head home.\n\n     HOME\nI get home. There is a note on the counter &quot;Hey hun, I know you were working late, there are some left overs in the fridge, sorry for getting upset, I just miss you. I got a call from a friend, and they desperately needed my help, I&#039;ll see you in the morning, love you&quot;. Deflated and alone, I decide to go into extreme relax mode. I rip my suit off as fast as possible and find the most comfortable and warm clothes I can, crack open a beer, and watch a poorly written TV show. Then I remember I had an assignment for my online class due at 11:59pm.... ffs. I procrastinate even knowing it&#039;ll take about 2 hours. I even play a norm and post on GD. at 10pm I open the assignment and realize I can half ass it and only lose 10 points. Done deal, 30 minutes of my life  gone, back to being lazy and trying to make the most of my free time, or the least in this case. around 1-2am I decide sleep is probably a good idea and head to bed.\n\n\nThat is my actual life characterized by a single day.\n\nanyway, if you&#039;ve made it this far, I commend you, if you skipped down to this, just disregard and move on. downvote optional.\n\nedited some stupid stuff out.","replies":[]}
