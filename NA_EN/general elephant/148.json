About those Graves Buffs.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read in another post grave's base damage on buckshot is getting reduced by 5 per level from 2-5. but his damage from extra bullets gets raised 10% a piece, so a face full a buckshot now can do 120 damage at level one before any AD bonuses, it's maximum effect went up from 180% to 200%....\r\n\r\nPeople think they are nerfing him? oh no... he will be able to do way more burst if you get too close to him, and honestly? that in my book is worth more than 20 base damage at rank 5. if you hit more than 1 bullet, it is a buff. easy as that. it just reduces his lane poke ever so slightly.... after laning the changes are a buff in my opinion.","replies":[]}
