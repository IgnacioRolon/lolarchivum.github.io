You can even cap the reward to 2 shards per champ so you can&#039;t just BE farm on your main.\r\n\r\nHonestly this does a lot to solve peoples&#039; problems with the system in a cool way that doesn&#039;t impact BE earnings all that much in the long run. Sure you could earn more BE by farming these if you didnt&#039; care about mastery unlocks, but that is silly as the shard you get is far more valuable using it to unlock a mastery than it is to dust for BE.\r\n\r\nhonestly I would love if this was a thing... sadly I doubt anyone of importance will see this or consider it....","replies":[]}
