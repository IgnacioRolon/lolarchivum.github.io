Why does that thread even exist? Are people actually being oppressed by raka? She is pretty neutral and a niche pick at best, but that thread tells me A. People must be QQing about raka.... and B someone got sick of it and made a PSA thread.... the amount of *UUUGGGGHHH*  that causes is unbearable. I shall never go back. Thanks GD for being my favorite boards. You&#039;re all kinda like that really weird sibiling who doesn&#039;t leave his room very often to me.","replies":[]}
