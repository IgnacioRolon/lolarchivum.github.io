(the champ, not streaming service)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, we all know {{champion:29}} is in some pretty rough shape... it hasn&#039;t looked good for him since S3 prior to his massive e nerf. I used to think the poor little fella was dumpstered, but no, he just needs to be played differently. Back then I used to stack mad AD and delete people with a few massive AA crits.\n\nNo longer is that viable. his scaling is so poor and he is also pretty squishy. That being said I read something earlier today in regards to how to build twitch and then it clicked.... I was running the wrong runes, and building his items in the wrong order.\n\nthis being said, bear with me. masteries are your standard adc masteries, no surprise there. The runes however, you just go armor yellows, mr blues and then the rest is aspd. 29% aspd at level 1. this allows quick stacks and at 6 a much larger power spike with your ult. yes, you&#039;ll have like 61 ad at level 1, but you&#039;ll be able to scale into mid game REALLY nicely, just follow this build path and start deleting people.\n\n{{item:1055}} >{{item:3086}} >{{item:1001}} >{{item:3134}} >{{item:3006}} >{{item:3142}} >{{item:3046}} >{{item:3031}} /{{item:3035}} >which ever you didn&#039;t build> defensive item\n\nend build is:\n{{item:1304}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3102}} \n\nnote the lack of lifesteal. it is a minor problem, but I feel like if you&#039;re getting chunked out, chances are you&#039;re going to die anyway, so the name of the game is \"I WAS HIDING >:{D!!!!\" and just do your best to delete people from safety, they will be going after you like a madman, so just stay out of range until they push too hard and get out of position (because bait is strong at all elos) and then pop yomuu&#039;s and delete them.\n\nit allows you to stack fast and really utilize your ult, by level 6 you&#039;re AAing every second or faster, while it might not sound like much, it is MUCH better than other ADCs and with your ult you can really melt down people early before they start buying defensive items. As long as you play safe you&#039;ll do well, but again... play SUPER SAFE. don&#039;t go yolo into a fight because you will disintegrate and do nothing but pad the enemy&#039;s pocket.\n\nI would also like to note that this also make&#039;s twitch&#039;s playstyle feel MUCH better in game, and I do recommend it, I wish I knew the thread I was reading so I could give credit to that person... it made a HUGE difference in how he plays and feels.\n\nedit:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/byxbATC.png","replies":[]}
