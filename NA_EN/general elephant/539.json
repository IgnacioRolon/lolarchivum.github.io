I typically hold GD in higher regards when it comes to league related content... whether that is a mistake or not has yet to be seen, but for now i&#039;m trusting you guys.\r\n\r\nMy dilemma is with my main, Xin Zhao. Say what you will, yes he can be pretty garbo or uninteresting or lackluster and the like... that is besides the point here.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n1. What role do you think Xin Zhao fills best? (not top/mid/jung BS, i&#039;m talkin splitpusher, off-tank, primary engage, burst/sustain bruiser etc)\r\n     - what does he do as a champion best?\r\n2. Based on your answer to number 1, assuming an evenly distributed ad/ap ratio enemy team, what would his optimal build to fill that role be?\r\n     - against an extremely meta comp, what should he build?\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty simple. While many of you don&#039;t care about Xin, I would still like some feedback. I have some pretty strong opinions, but I am also a shitter, so against my better judgement I am hoping that GD can show me the true potential Xin has to offer.\r\n\r\nAny other related info or feedback is also appreciated. I feel the way the game is going Xin will soon be extremely obsolete, and I am just trying to find a way to make it work..... pls halp","replies":[]}
