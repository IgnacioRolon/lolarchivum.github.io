I want to highlight a few examples that I think are important. Feel free to add your own, but be sure to explain why they go together so well.\r\n\r\n1. Jinx + Morgana\r\n\r\nthis one is pretty simple. they both have snares, and bot play bot lane. if morg land's her snare, jinx can follow up with hers to make it a 100% chance to land, and chain cc with relative ease. At max ranks, these two moves can root a champion for up to FIVE SECONDS. anyone remotely squishy is way past dead from a jinx's AA spam before then.\r\n\r\n2.Nautilus + Nasus\r\n\r\nthis one is not as obvious, but a jungle nautilus and a nasus top are an extremely potent combination. What ends up happening is that when nautilus ganks, he can give the kill to nasus, and due to their ungodly amount of combined CC, it is almost a guaranteed kill. After feeding the Doge, mid to late game comes and he has stacks. naut is pretty tanky. so what ends up happening? they CC the living daylights out of anyone and everyone with hooks, slows, knock ups, more slows, and a huge WHAP from the ever dangerous nasus Q. They are kinda like the missing pieces to one another, nasus has CC, but needs just a bit more to be crazy dangerous, and nautilus delivers in spades and can live for ages, like nasus. what nautilus lacks is turret taking power, and nasus takes care of that with ease.\r\n\r\n3.  Leona + Amumu\r\n\r\nI don't think I need  to spell this one out... between the two, these champs can CC an entire team. throw a lissandra in there is it is honestly one of the most OP comps ever devised... I ALWAYS support as leona if I see an amumu, and conversely, I will play amumu whenever I see a leona. These two go together so well that successful ganks are like taking candy from a baby.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to hear more. I find having any of these duo's on a team lead to a much higher win rate.","replies":[]}
