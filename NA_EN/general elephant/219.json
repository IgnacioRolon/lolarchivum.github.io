I have a simple question.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Is what you&#039;re upset about... really that important?\r\n\r\nI mean sure, even in the worse case Riot is cockblocking your ability to unlock champions\r\n\r\nSure veteran players are being treated unfairly\r\n\r\nSure The game&#039;s balance has gone out the window...\r\n\r\nbut at the end of the day... How much has this REALLY changed how you play league? I tend to stick to about 30-40 champions, sure picking up one is interesting, but honestly, I know what I wanna play, but unlocking more is just an &quot;gotta catch em all!&quot; fantasy.... it isn&#039;t really important to me... at all.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d kinda consider myself a veteran player, I started playing back when Vayne was released (may 2011) and i have the conqueror emblem thingy... sure its not the longest, but i have seen some shit. Honestly I don&#039;t know what people are talking about with this one... I have about 30ish champions left, all 4800-6300 left to unlock after using all my gifted BE to buy up low cost champs. I really don&#039;t care about any veteran appreciation issues people have been talking about....\r\n\r\nAs for balance... it is preseason. it happens every year, this year just happened to be a bit bigger than usual.\r\n\r\nAs for no daily BE and only unlocks through the hextech system or disenchanting. Honestly i think they will change it, sure things are not ideal, but looking at the amount you need to unlock after removing runes entirely from the equation... I am fine with where it is at. When I first started, it felt like shit took a LONG ass time to unlock stuff, and back then exp was at its peak requirements, since then they have made it easy street to hit 30. Back then it took me three and a half months of 2-5 games a day to hit 30. That is roughly 300-400 games. In that time I unlocked a whopping 12 champions. Sure i bought some 6300 ones, but some of those are 3150 now...\r\n\r\n\r\nLong story short (TL;DR) get over it, you can feel insulted, belittled, betrayed, hurt, I don&#039;t care. This is a free fucking game, and honestly, these changes don&#039;t mean shit in the grand scheme of things. Go waste your time and money playing CoD or something. Or better yet, try DOTA and tell me you like it better than League. I would love to hear that.","replies":[]}
