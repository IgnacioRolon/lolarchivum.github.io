I think overall people will generally benefit from watching them play IF they try to learn from it and figure out what information they can use.\r\n\r\nI don't expect to become a god simply by watching, but I think it is really nice to be able to step back and watch some pros really lay down what the higher end game play looks like, and helps us make better decisions in our own games.","replies":[]}
