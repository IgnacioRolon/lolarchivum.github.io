My wife has the &quot;if I know someone with that name it is a no go&quot; syndrome. That being said I am just asking for name suggestions, anything from completely normal to very odd. Just hit me with some suggestions, the only stipulation I have is that the name can not end in the letter N due to conflicting pronunciations with my last name. Sorry for being difficult but thats why we are in this mess, thanks for any replies :).","replies":[]}
