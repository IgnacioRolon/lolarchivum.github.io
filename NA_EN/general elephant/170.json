Then I thought rageblade broke a few melee, namely yi and jax. Then I saw how keystone masteries broke a few AP champions. Then I saw how it even broke shen. I am a bad shen player.... not anymore.\n\nBasically with all of these changes, Riot broke the entire game except for maybe assassins, but even that is TBD.\n\nIf you know of anything that you think was broken with this patch, feel free to post it here. I&#039;m sure that was just the tip of the iceberg.","replies":[]}
