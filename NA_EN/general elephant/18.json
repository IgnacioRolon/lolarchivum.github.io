I can't help but RAGE.\r\n\r\nINITIATE CAPS LOCK:\r\n\r\nFOR THE LOVE OF GOD I DON'T KNOW WTF IS GOING ON BUT WITH EKKO, RYZE, AND A SLEW OF OTHER HORRIBLY IMBALANCED CHAMPIONS AND ITEMS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WORSE, RIOT IGNORING IT, OR GD NOT BLOWING A SHITFIT ABOUT IT. THEY GIVE US 3 MEASLY BANS AND THEN THROW THE BALANCE OF 20 OR SO CHAMPIONS OUT THE WINDOW, AND SAY GL HF!!! WELL FFS I DON'T THINK HAVING SUPER OP CHAMPIONS IN EVERY GAME IS THE LEAST BIT ENTERTAINING, IT SCREWS WITH EVERY OTHER HONEST PLAYER TRYING TO SIMPLY PLAY THE CHAMPIONS THEY LIKE. \r\n\r\nWHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT? NO ONE GETS TO PLAY WHO THEY WANT ANYMORE.... IT IS ALL JUST BS FOTM CHAMPIONS THAT RIOT IGNORES SO THEY CAN SELL SKINS, THEN NERF THEM INTO THE GROUND AND CYCLE UP OTHER CHAMPIONS SO THEY CAN SELL SKINS!!! IT IS CLEAR WHAT IS GOING ON AND I HATE IT. \r\n\r\nFIX YOUR GAME RIOT\r\n\r\n/rant","replies":[]}
