I don&#039;t ever plan to be a god at this game, I don&#039;t plan to be some grand strategist or mechanical monster.\r\n\r\nI plan to live out my League days having fun, and nothing is more fun than a grand ol&#039; clown fiesta.

Win or lose, it is always fun to throw everything you have at a good old fashioned scrap.\r\n\r\nI will say though, some times my Silver brethren surprise me.
