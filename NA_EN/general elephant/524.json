I mean, in a game. do you tend to do things you know more than likely won&#039;t work, just because you can/it is really fun?\n\nI personally love using &quot;The Package&quot; as corki to initiate fights. nothing feels better than blowing through the entire enemy team, knocking them all aside, just to run like hell while they scramble to chase me, and my team engages on them. forcing them to choose me or them. I die most times, and sometimes my team just says &quot;wtf corki!?!&quot; but I have fun doing it... every time. also, it is super important to note, that using the package does not actually put your W on cooldown, you get the package + a normal use, so you can escape pretty easily.\n\nanyway, anyone else do crazy shit just because it is ridiculously fun?","replies":[]}
