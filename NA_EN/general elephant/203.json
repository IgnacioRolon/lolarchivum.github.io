I will admit, it is not a very favorable move by Riot in regards to approaching a delicate issue, and honestly, from the response from the previous board changes.... not one I think they were taking lightly.\n\nFor a while, I lost interest in GD, I felt like most people were simply posting to troll and be overall terrible people. Then I started seeing HateDaddy posts, and \"the Adventures of Frostbutt and SIdeboob\" and many other threads that were creative and it made me come back. I've since been a fairly regular participant of GD, though my posts never attracted a lot of attention, I still gave it a shot. (some more effort than others, I have made many bad posts). I've since learned to respond and be a more active member... And now it is all Jeopardized. Or so I thought.\n\nI think there is something to be said for merging multiple boards. As many of you know, every sub-section of the forums has their own unique personality... We in GD are generally the outrageous ones, and G&amp;B are more of the fanboys. I know merging with a bunch of other people may sound like a \"culture killer\" but in all honesty, I feel like it may benefit the forums in some ways. As it stands, GD runs a pretty healthy amount of threads per hour, and that is perfectly fine, however, as many of you know, the forums had been starting to stagnate and lose popularity due to sporadic moderation and very one dimensional \"shitposting\". Maybe, just maybe, this forced assimilation will become our own societal melting pot, allowing us to really delve into better posts, deeper discussions, and an over all better environment due to the sheer volume and diversity. I know it sounds crazy... but I honestly would like to see a lot more active members in the online culture I chose to be a part of. I want more content, more depth. My only true concern comes down to 2 pivotal points.... If moderation becomes overbearing to the point that we lose our free speech, and whether the amount of content on these new \"mega boards\" will be too high volume during peak hours, which would propagate spammed low quality threads and drown out the threads that give our forums its personality and  honestly... it would kill the reason we are all here.\n\ntl;dr- I didn't like the idea... now I am coming around to it because it has potential to add value to the current state of the forums, but I am hesitant in regards to overbearing moderation and a potentially cripplingly high volume of low quality thread spamming.","replies":[]}
