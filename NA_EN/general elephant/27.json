That being said lets take a look:\n\n1. When Illaoi lands her e on you, your soul gets pulled and she starts hammering on it which is for 3/4 to 1/2ish reduced damage which scales, but is often maxed 2nd or last. (as in she does 1/4th the damage she would normally deal). You, seeing this run to the edge of the zone and force the spirit to disappear by running out of the zone, but then you are put in vessel form, and for 60 seconds tentacles spawn and try to smack you, if you kill 3, the form ends.\n\n2. When Illaoi lands her e on you, your soul gets pulled and she starts hammering on it which is for 3/4 to 1/2ish reduced damage which scales, but is often maxed 2nd or last. (as in she does 1/4th the damage she would normally deal). You, seeing this decide to engage on her and force her to choose, to either continue hitting the spirit for 75% reduced damage to you, or to hit you for 100% damage dealt to you. not only this, but the spirit&#039;s duration is substantially lowered if Illaoi takes damage. if the spirit disappears before she can kill it, you don&#039;t get turned into a vessel, and MOST of the time, you&#039;ll even win the trade....\n\nWith these two options, you&#039;d clearly take the second choice... but EVERYONE I&#039;ve ever fought as her immediately runs and leashes the spirit. not only this, but early game, Illaoi can&#039;t even kill the spirit solo in time unless you&#039;re already at low hp, so you GIVE her a vessel form proc on you that you otherwise would have avoided.... This being said, she is hard countered by strong engage and cc in lane, so champs like renekton and SHEN especially, couters her really hard with either some cc and burst, or good cc, a shield and damage to lower the duration. out of lane is a different story, but if you keep her down, she is super easy to kill mid to end game, but she is a monster if you&#039;re not smart about it and feed her in lane.\n\nalso watch out for her level 6 spike if you&#039;re going to gank her, 2 tentacles + spirit + jungler/top is FIVE TENTACLES that heal 5% missing and she can proc every 2 seconds during her ult&#039;s short duration, but trust me, she WILL double kill you if you&#039;re not careful.","replies":[]}
