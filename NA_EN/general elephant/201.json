Anyone stop to think about how huge this runes/masteries change is gonna be?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sure you have, but consider what the old system actually did....\r\n\r\nCurrently, we get a lot of base stat bonuses from rune customization. Its kind of an archaic system, but overall, it gets the job done.\r\n\r\nMasteries give menial bonuses to small % changes, and then some more potent keystones.\r\n\r\nNow consider what they are proposing. Mashing it all together, with the focal point being &quot;keystone runes&quot;\r\n\r\nI fear what is going to happen, is that Riot will funnel too much power into these keystones and take away overall values from base stats that a lot of champions rely on. When is the last time you played on a noob account with no runes or masteries? Feels terrible right? Well now consider those base stat or scaling runes being changed in a way to make  them weaker to compensate for a flashier overall system. Sure it sounds great on paper, but base stats being altered will drastically change balance requirements for champions. \r\n\r\nRemember Season 3 Sona? A walking passive stat booster. Not interactive, not fun to play against or as (debatable). But she was strong. The overbearing nature of her passive stat boosts was an invisible power. Much like runes/masteries have become.\r\n\r\nAll I am sayin with this post is... If they don&#039;t keep sufficient base stat customization, it is gonna be a real shit show come pre-season. More so than we&#039;ve ever seen.","replies":[]}
