I think even in alpha it is,still doing really well and I think they nailed the unpredictable nature of animals and the dangers of trying to make it on your own. I recently got mauled by a pack of wolves because they wanted to eat the bear I killed. I started a fire and waved a torch around (game designed deterent) and the wolves danced around me a bit then they tore me to pieces :( it is a pretty difficult survival game even when you learn how it works if you play on the hardest setting. Also the game has a ton of ways to trick you into thinking you know something, when in fact there are other possibilities. like the wolves attacking in a group even with my torch and fire going. Damn wolves.","replies":[]}
