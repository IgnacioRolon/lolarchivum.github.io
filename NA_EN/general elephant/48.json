He studied very hard and avoided the temptations that would have deterred him from his study. He knew if he wanted to be the best, he would have to put all of his effort into it. A few years go by and he is accepted into THE most prestigious culinary school to have ever existed. On his first day of classes his professor, Professor Karat, looked {{champion:80}}  in the eyes and said &quot;you will not pass my class. I have incredibly high standards&quot;. This lit a fire in {{champion:80}} , he knew he was going to put every thing he had into succeeding and becoming the best baker in the world, and to prove to Professor Karat that he was worthy of this title. \n\n\nOver the next few weeks, Pantheon became surrounded with all things food. learning new procedures and protocol to hone his ever increasing skills as a chef, and even more so, a baker. One of his classmates, {{champion:25}} , had been a natural at this ever since she was young. Talented and effortless, she was everything {{champion:80}}  had been trying to be all of these years. Over time, {{champion:80}}  had become fierce rivals with {{champion:25}} . Their passion and determination had pushed them further than either thought was possible.\n\nIt was just about time for their final examination to see if {{champion:80}} and {{champion:25}} were fit to become one of the legendary chefs in their elite culinary school. Only a few others had ever attained this feat. &quot;This year, we will give only one person this great honor&quot; said Professor Karat. {{champion:80}} looked over at {{champion:25}} with a burning determination, one that had left {{champion:25}}  speechless. She never knew how badly {{champion:80}}  had truly wanted this, but she too, had longed for this coveted award for years, and so she was not going to go down so easily. Their eyes met, and they both knew that this was the turning point. There was no going back. Suddenly, amidst the deathly silence, Professor Karat belted out &quot;Now I know you are all eager to face the final challenge and throw your hat in the ring to become one of the Elite, but this is not something that our institution gives away so readily. You have to earn it, and to do so, I can think of no better challenge than a head to head Bake Off!!!&quot;. {{champion:80}} exploded inside!  It was his life&#039;s work coming to fruition. He was ready for the challenge, and so were all of his culinary adversaries, including {{champion:25}} .\n\nThe stage was set. After seamlessly defeating each of their adversaries, {{champion:80}} and {{champion:25}} were in the final Bake Off for the title of &quot;Legendary Chef&quot; at Karat&#039;s Oustanding Culinary Kitchens. Professor Karat walked to the peak of the stage, in the grand hall filled with thousands eager to see the results of the final showdown. &quot;We have had many ups and downs in today&#039;s events!&quot; said Professor Karat, &quot;but all of that was simply finding the final two competitors in our last and most meaningful Bake Off of the day!&quot;. Professor Karat took a brief pause and then continued &quot;Our final challenge is between {{champion:80}}  and {{champion:25}} ! Both shall cook a single dessert of my choosing! Then I, along with my esteemed colleagues will determine who rightfully deserves our most coveted award!&quot;. The crowd roared with excitement and both {{champion:80}} and {{champion:25}} were electrified and invigorated  with the crowds support. &quot;The final dish will be..... Carrot Cake! You have 1 hour chefs, begin!&quot; \n\n{{champion:80}} knew what to do. He immediately grabbed all of his ingredients and began using a unique way of mixing from his spear practice so his batter was perfectly aerated leaving his baked goods light, fluffy, and delicious. {{champion:25}}  Had her own tricks up her sleeve. She had learned that by crowd controlling the oven for an infinite amount of time, she could manipulate the temperatures of the oven so that all of her food was perfectly cooked. The battle intensified as Professor Karat announced &quot;Chefs, you have 5 minutes remaining!&quot; Both {{champion:25}} and {{champion:80}} were nearing completion, oblivious to everything except their immense desire to win. &quot;FIVE, FOUR, THREE!&quot; {{champion:80}}  had done everything in his power to succeed, and he felt he had made the best dish he had ever made in his entire life. &quot;TWO, ONE!&quot; {{champion:25}} Was extremely confident that she would succeed, and  had just topped off her cake with her ultimate secret recipe icing. &quot;ZERO! Put down your utensils chefs! Judgement time is upon you!&quot;\n\nThe panel of judges had taken their dishes and disappeared to discuss the dishes they had been given. {{champion:80}} looked at {{champion:25}} and said &quot;i&#039;m sorry, but better luck next year, I put my heart and soul into this dish!&quot;. {{champion:25}} Laughed audibly, which made {{champion:80}} fuming, but he suppressed his anger and said &quot;you&#039;ll see, I have to win! It is all I know! It is my life&#039;s work!&quot; {{champion:25}} grew silence and glanced away.\n\nThe judges had been away for a long time, the air grew stagnant as if time froze. In an extreme uproar Professor Karat emerged and shouted at the top of his lungs, piercing the silence &quot;The judges have come to a conclusion!!!&quot; and the crowd erupted. After the din had calmed, Professor Karat proceeded. &quot;With much care and consideration, the winner of the title of &quot;Legendary Karat&#039;s Outstanding Culinary Kitchens Chef&quot; belongs to {{champion:25}} ! Her superb baking techniques and otherworldly icing were so unbelievable that no other being on the planet deserves the title more!&quot;\n\nWhat ensued after was something no one expected. Not even {{champion:80}} .\n\n{{champion:80}}  had snapped. The air grew frozen around him, the world grew dark and cold. He felt destroyed. His life&#039;s work in vain. He grew angry. Slowly building at first but it became too much. He looked for someone to place blame, but there was no one. His rage intensified until the world he knew around him was shifting and bending into a distorted world of insanity and manic anger. \n\nThe entire audience had ignored him as they celebrated {{champion:25}} &#039;s success. She had won and the culinary world was now in the palm of her hands. With all of the excitement, she had forgotten to console {{champion:80}} . She knew how much it meant to him and she knew he would be devastated, but oblivious to his rapidly declining state she was ushered away into the Hall of Victory.\n\nAs {{champion:25}} was about to enter the hall, she her an enormous explosion! {{champion:80}} had pressed R! The insane fool! &quot;Where does he think he is going!?&quot; she yelled. It was too late. He had left.\n\nSeveral miles away a poor unsuspecting farmer by the name of {{champion:75}} was sitting in a lane tending his carrot field when out of no where a strange green circle appeared. &quot;Huh, in all my years of farming i&#039;ve never seen this before!&quot; said {{champion:75}} . A few moments later the ground exploded and out from the rubble emerged.... Carrot Slayer Pantheon. Bathed in the bane of his failure, Pantheon had painted himself and his weaponry in the color of his defeat. Orange and Green. It was all he thought about, it was all he understood. &quot;What in god&#039;s creation are you doing!?!?!&quot; {{champion:75}} you&#039;re ruining my farm! {{champion:80}} stood there with a blank stare. There was no more orange or green in this area... He had to move on. He needed to slay more carrots in order to create more carrot cakes, to try and perfect what he had failed at. But in his manic insanity, he lost all other rationale, and just began mindlessly hunting carrots, for the rest of his existence.\n\n\nAnd so the story ends. it leaves {{champion:25}} in possession of two very nice and memorable skins that were designed in her honor\n(Victorious Morgana)\nand\n(Sinful Succulence Morgana)\n\nWhile Pantheon, largely forgotten for his accomplishments, was only remembered for his Insane outburst and ever growing insanity for carrot slaying, was given a skin, simply as a reminder that if you take life too seriously, you&#039;ll go clinically insane.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tViuqks","replies":[]}
