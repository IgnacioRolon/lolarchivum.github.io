IDK about you, but if you can play all those other champs at such a high skill, why is rengar your most played and least successful?\r\n\r\nRiot. why can&#039;t you see this? why can&#039;t you take action against it? it defeats the purpose of even playing and the issue will only get worse.\r\n\r\ntbh i might have even been kept out of gold simply because of all these boosters. I refuse to pay to earn my rank, but that doesn&#039;t mean I should have to in order to climb. \r\n\r\ncould you imagine how much higher your actual ranking would be if elo-boosting wasn&#039;t a thing? \r\n\r\nanyway /rant, I just thought i&#039;d throw my 2 cents in after seeing the same shit play over and over. booster carries team while destroying honest players.","replies":[]}
