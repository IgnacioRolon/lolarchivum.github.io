I have something to say","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a person who came to GD to vent and talk about IRL problems... I feel like that should be an allowed subject. Where else can you turn to when there is no one to talk to in real life? I wrote out a huge post to help someone who had been dealing with pretty heavy stuff and they never got to see it because  the thread was deleted. I like to help people, and I feel that on occasion we do get a few completely honest posts about peoples&#039; problems in life, and they need at least a response. I feel like I could have actually helped that person because I myself have dealt with similar issues and have learned to cope with it. Now it is gone and they will never know what I had to say, and even if it only helped a little, that is a heck of a lot more useful than any LoL meme....\r\n\r\nPlease... I know people like to complain about their IRL problems, and most are just venting to vent, but some people legitimately need help, and I&#039;d be more than willing to see tons of threads about how someone doesn&#039;t have a boyfriend or girlfriend (we know what I am saying) so that these people also have the right to talk about things seriously impacting their life.\r\n\r\nGD might be a bit of a monster sometimes, but when we see people legitimately struggling.... No one is that heartless.","replies":[]}
