There is a lot to do so after my last \"added\" I have stopped adding values. after all is said and done I recorded 137 responses and the results are in!\n\nPing changes = gud\n\nstay tuned for my final masterpiece.

Nice idea, by the way!\n\nalso, this ^^^ though now since it is on live it won't do a ton of good unless you're not able to play league?","replies":[]}
