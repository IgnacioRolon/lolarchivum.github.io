I work about 40 hours a week. Currently, one of our neighboring stores had a mass exodus of techs and now is offering OT for any shift any day to get more help. The problem is that this store had people leave for a reason (or a few)\r\n\r\nWith OT i&#039;d be making around $17 an hour... piddly yes, but is it worth it? I am in no place to turn down more money, but I also value my sanity. I currently only have rumors to go on as far as how bad it is there, but it is very likely if I go there... it will be... less than ideal.\r\n\r\nShould I throw caution to the wind and help out in what could be the pits of hell?","replies":[]}
