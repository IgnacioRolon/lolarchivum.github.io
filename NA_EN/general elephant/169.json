(its a little easier to digest instead of a wall of text as i usually do when making long ass posts..)\n\nno one asked for this, but it is happening anyway.\n\n1. don&#039;t complete your jungle enchant until late game.\n\n2. the buffs to botrk and gunisoo simultaneously has put Xin back into &quot;playable&quot; status, while also making the &quot;brucer build&quot; less effective comparatively (good, fk that build)\n\n3. run courage of the colossus, shits broken, with the AA knock up or ult knockback, its an easy shield. you need it.\n\n4. If Botrk is Xin&#039;s best friend, Gunisoo is his hot AF grill friend. those are typically the only sources of damage you&#039;ll need.\n\n5. challenging smite is 1000 times better on him than any other smite. Use it more for burst mitigation. the earlier the better. it lets you live longer. if you have the luxury of using it for damage or vision, all the more power to you.\n\n6. don&#039;t forget, you die really easy until you get your resistances and hp. if the enemy team has a burst heavy champ that is fed... just split push or something... avoid that somabitch like the plague, because he will ruin you even if you&#039;re 10/0 by 18 minutes.\n\n7. don&#039;t be a monkey. when ganking, sweep the lanes in a very wide arc so it puts you directly between the enemy laner and their tower, then zone them with your ult, hold your e, then e when you are sure they have no mobility skills (flashes etc) left. if you E too early as xin... you just wasted your time. never underestimate the power of just walking at an enemy.\n\n8. don&#039;t turret dive unless you are guaranteed to only take 1-2 turret shots until you have an armor item. see point 6.\n\n9. &quot;but Mr Elephant, why don&#039;t you just buy your resistances early so you CAN turret dive and not get 100-0&#039;d by a fed burst champion?&quot;- lil timmy\n\nwell lil timmy, its because you do shit for damage. You can&#039;t truly have your cake and eat it too on Xin. While Jax simply asks &quot;does it have stats?&quot; Xin has to ask the tougher question.... &quot;does it have enough stats?&quot;\n\nXin has very similar base stats to camille, but has very little base damage built into his kit. the VAST majority of his damage is AA based. If you build tanky on xin early, you won&#039;t die right away, but they won&#039;t even be remotely threatened because they have 100 years to walk away. You&#039;ve essentially taken the ONE thing xin has over other champions away from him. His high damage &quot;drain tank&quot; identity. When you build tanky items, you are essentially building things that do not compliment his kit. He needs &quot;item/kit synergy&quot; to work effectively. Unless your team needs a still pretty easy to kill meat bag with minimal forms of cc/disengage, you&#039;re better off following my strategy.\n\n10. (sorry, that was a long ass point) Xin is a super strong early game champ, with a mega shit mid game, and a scary late game. That being said, you have to establish your lead and presence very quickly. I&#039;ve learned recently that just constantly trying to counter jungle and ward their jungle is by far the best way to do this. farm hard, but also look for any lane that is even remotely pushed towards your towers. if you can get behind the enemy before they see you, it is pretty much a guaranteed kill.\n\n11. your mid game is shit, no matter what you do (in comparison to most champions) you can win 1v1&#039;s really easily at any point... but 5v5&#039;s you&#039;ll just die instantly, or if you&#039;re a pansy who buys resistances too early, you&#039;ll still eat a lot of damage and not be able to deal enough. this being said mid game you should be heavily objective oriented, rotate from top to mid to bot to mid to top to try and distribute map pressure, trying to secure enemy camps, drags, scuttles, place wards, and gank if the opportunity arises. This is common knowledge as a jungler, but it is extra key as Xin, because the point of spreading pressure so widely is to avoid enemy champions trying to force fights that are larger than 2v2. \n\n12. my standard build, sometimes you need to deviate due to the enemy team/circumstances, but w/e\n {{item:3006}} /{{item:3009}}/{{item:3047}}  /{{item:3111}} +{{item:1413}}+{{item:3153}} +{{item:3124}} {{item:3065}}+ {{item:3143}} /{{item:3742}} \n\n/ = alternative option, + = next item\n\n13. don&#039;t forget to always AA, every moment, of every fight, whenever possible. Enemies 100%will underestimate how much fkin lifesteal/regen you have between botrk, your w passive, and guinsoo proc&#039;ing your w passive every other AA \n\n14. Xin is pretty kill or be killed, and his E is the ultimate gamble. using your E well/poorly will sometimes, (a lot of times actually) be the deciding factor whether you will win or lose a game. Use it aggressively as often as possible, but only when you are confident that the engage will work out. When xin picks a bad engage, it usually means your whole team will get wiped. or the enemy gets wiped because they blew all their huge  CDs at the same time and your team just wins 4v5 because the enemy has no available CDs.... its surprising how many panic ults/sums your E can fish out.\n\ni&#039;d type more, but i am kinda bored now. i&#039;m not high elo, and a lot of this people will probably argue with me on pretty much everything i&#039;ve said... but over 200 xin games since they removed sated devourer (back when xin was legitimately freelo) he has been on the struggle bus a little too long. I made this in the hopes people might try him again and realize with the bork/guinsoo buffs, he isn&#039;t back to former glory, but he is definitely still a strong jungler.\n\nTL;DR buy bork/gunisoo, don&#039;t finish your jungle item til late game, hold your e until you&#039;re sure you can  stay on em, and he is pretty good right now.\n\nedit: o yeah, max e first and run a decent amount of aspd in your runes\n\nedit edit: autoformat fk'd my numbers.. w/e, don't care. also XIn will out duel an equally fed camille, so there is that. its pretty funny to watch her do all these flips and tricks just to get out AA'd to death....","replies":[]}
