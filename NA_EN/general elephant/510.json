I suppose we could have a quasi-merged server where it simply uses the closest server on average for games... but that still means golds+ will have extra long wait times due to less relatively local players and/or players are not as closely matched for games. Both of these are already complained about issues, and having an additional server would either deal with ping, and make these two issues exponential, or would not deal with ping, and minimize the effects of having segmented servers.\n\nBasically, if we want to reduce ping, it will increase our wait time and/or reduce the \"closeness\" of our mmr to relative players. It is a situation where you can not have your cake and eat it too.\n\nYes creating an east coast server would reduce the distance traveled for people on the east coast... but it would cause more issues as a result.\n\nWe can't assume the player base is large enough yet to warrant a new east coast server simply because we don't have enough people who are good enough playing consistently, and whom it would make an actual impact on their games. I am in Michigan, i have 70 ping on average, to have that reduced to 10-40, would not be all that beneficial.\n\nTo those with ping issues, a closer server may not necessarily make your ping much better.\n\n\nI expect many many down votes for this, so get to it GD.\n\nor tell me why I'm thinking incorrectly.","replies":[]}
