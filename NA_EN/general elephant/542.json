Obviously it is something that requires a fair bit of investment, but the value it would add to the game would be incredibly beneficial. My idea is essentially for Riot to install some form of short term game recording mechanism to be sent to a 3rd party company with a large amount of storage to temporarily file them and make them accessible to the player base.... Obviously money needs to flow one way or another, but I think honestly the value would be net-neutral because of what the company would be able to then do... The best system in my opinion would be for people to either view them anonymously, or create an account to save a couple. with a monthly fee you would be able to upgrade said account to allow for video editing and the ability to download the clips or what have you to your computer. This would EXPLODE the marketability of League of Legends because it allows for many people who previously weren't to make their own League material to share with friends and essentially create more buzz and hopefully help bring in more new players, thus extending LoL's longevity as a company.\r\n\r\nI know this is a big undertaking, but honestly, it is something that I feel is completely viable. I know riot has been very adamant about making statistics and the like very available to third party websites like lolking, so why not implement a pseudo-replay system so you can simply export the recorded games to a company who can make use of the data? You could even launch it with ranked only to start and work your way up to every game...\r\n\r\nI fear for the direction Riot's capital expenditures have been trending towards... not that I know that much about their finances, but I feel like they could do more than they currently are, and are missing out on a lot of opportunities to expand the game (and their revenue via a larger player base)","replies":[]}
