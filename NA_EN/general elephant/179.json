I fear one day the anxiety of almost clicking on it on a daily basis will be too much, and I could suffer from a serious medical condition. For this reason, I would like to request that Riot please include at least a 1 to 25 inch space between Memes &amp; Games and General Discussion. This will alleviate any anxiety I am currently having and will decrease the high risk that I (and others like myself) could have something terrible happen to them as a result of nearly clicking on Memes &amp; Games on a daily basis. It is only a matter of time, Riot, I implore you.\n\nEdit: This thread is now about FEK\n\nEdit2:\nhttp://imgur.com/aBQRzvZ\n\n\nI finally feel safe\nTundra Fizz saves the day. ¤**Savior of GD**¤\n\nalso props to Tundra Fizz for being so quick about making this possible\n","replies":[]}
