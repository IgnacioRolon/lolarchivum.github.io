I have gotten a lot of quadrakills in normal, but I have had every single penta opportunity I&#039;ve never been given stolen away from me by my teammates, either intentionally or accidentally. I am just wondering how common this is, as it happened to me last night when the morg shot the 100 hp enemy with her snare and killed them when all I had to do is right click them.... clearly it is my fault for not clicking fast enough. getting a quadra in under 2 seconds as twitch yet my penta is taken.... the one prior to that I was graves and my team&#039;s cho&#039;gath flash ulteda 200 hp enemy that I was probably 25 units out of range of.... all the other quadras I&#039;ve had have either just been unofficial pentas, last man escapes, or team mate takes a kill early in the fight....\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not had good luck with this, I know it will happen one day.... but for now  it seems like I am destined to just continually be unable to secure that last delicious kill for my first penta ever.... I have been playing a long time too.... it is kinda silly it hasn&#039;t happened yet... I guess i&#039;ll just be a 40 yr old penta-virgin","replies":[]}
