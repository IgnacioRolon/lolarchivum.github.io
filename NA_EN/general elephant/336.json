I get that in one I did a lot more kill wise... but mid/late games tend to snowball... i dunno. I love the fact we get grades, but I am conflicted because I don't really know what riot constitues as good/better compared to the other people playing that champ in that role.... (which is what they compare you to in order to give you a grade)\r\n\r\nShould lack of deaths factor in more than they currently are?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[]}
