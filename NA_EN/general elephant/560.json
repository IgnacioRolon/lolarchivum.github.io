{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2015-09-12T02:30:57.443+0000","title":"Forum Moderation: A Possible Solution?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I will not claim to know all or see all or do all, I&#039;d like to think after reading countless threads on this subject that I&#039;ve come up with a some what rational answer that can at least appease both sides (the moderators and forum goers).\r\n\r\nI will start by saying that I feel like the root issue is communication, and while yes, we as GD have said we &quot;need more moderation clarity&quot; that in and of itself  is an ambiguous statement. I propose we formulate an actual system that would work for us and present it to the moderators so they can clearly understand what we want as a community, and so they may provide us a better service. Alternately, I feel like this would allow the moderators to speak up about concerns with said system as they have their own issues and rules to deal with in regards to the company policy.\r\n\r\nThis being said, I would like to take a shot at making a fair moderating system for both parties:\r\n\r\nI call it the 5 point system.\r\n\r\nGeneral Procedures:\r\n1. All accounts now have a number on their profile ranging from 0 to 5\r\n\r\n2. Every account starts at 0 and if reprimanded, that number **can** be increased by moderators by 1 point at a time. **maximum**.\r\n\r\n3. At 5 points, the Account is permanently suspended. **Note**: this is the only way that permanent forum bans can now happen\r\nA. The only exception to the permanent ban rule is by receiving two 2 week bans within 30 days of each other (this includes the last day of a ban into the first day of ban 2) . If this happens the account may, under the determination of moderators, result in a permanent ban\r\n\r\n4. When an account&#039;s content is found in violation of the rules, A moderator has 3 levels of reprimand depending on severity\r\n     a. removal of content with a message stating why, warning is issued\r\n     b. removal of content with a message stating why, 1 point issued\r\n     c. removal of content with a message stating why, 1 point issued, and up to a 14 day forum suspension\r\n\r\n5. Points on accounts are not permanent, however they do take 4 months per point to be removed from the account. \r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\n-Restricting the level of points that can be issued ensures that people have a safeguard from being permanently banned without sufficient evidence\r\n\r\n-This still allows moderators to do their jobs, and also gives them sufficient evidence in permanent ban cases\r\n\r\n-This does gate the amount of power moderators have, but I feel like having the ability to issue up to a 2 week ban and 1 point is severe enough for any one instance of content removal.\r\n\r\n- The only people who are in jeopardy of receiving a permanent ban are those in two situations, either A. you have received a two week ban within the last 30 days (after you are no longer in immediate danger) or B. Your account is currently at 4 points.\r\n\r\n-The idea of  people arguing whether a point being issued was fair or not will be much more clear since they are specific to the immediate post being removed, and do not consider the poster&#039;s previous history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like feedback on the idea from the community (or even moderation, though I have my doubts) How would you all feel if this was implemented? I for one think it would provide sufficient moderation of the forums without worry of being overburdened.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is that it DOES require guidelines to be applied to moderators and this might not be something Riot would consider seeing as it would essentially impose a self restriction on the level of discretion moderators on the forum have. But in my opinion, it is the only way to truly compromise when situations get as strenuous as they have been. Tangible changes and clearly identifiable guidelines.\r\n\r\nPlease, feed back, or even your own Moderation Guidelines suggestions would be great.","replies":[]}
