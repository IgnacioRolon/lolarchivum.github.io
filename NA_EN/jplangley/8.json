However, unlike normal ranked calculations, yours is amplified. The more games you win, the bigger the multiplier gets. Same with losing. The more you lose, the harder you fall.\r\nHowever, it doesn&#039;t end there. Even when you&#039;ve been given your rank, for the next 20 games, you will still have amplified post-game MMR calculations. This way, the algorithm&trade; can still gauge you even after placements are over. Additionally, the number is so big to prevent normal smurfs from going around and crushing the souls of people who are genuinely terrible at the game.\r\nThat being said however, there is one downside to this idea: Boosting. Say you&#039;re a God-awful player who has been hardstuck in Bronze 3 for the previous two years. So you make a new account. And then when you hit level 30, you hire a booster to hightail you straight to Gold 1. With this model, it&#039;s 5,000% easier for something like that to be done.\r\nSuggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-07-02T22:04:31.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":".... no player thier first actaul season..

The MMR rises depending on how many games you win, so if I go 9/1, I'll get gold 1-2, but if I go 4/6, I'll get silver 3-4. So technically, there is no set MMR in placements. It rises dependent on wins/losses.","replies":[]}]}
