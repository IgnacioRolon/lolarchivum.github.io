He's a glass cannon that has nothing but damage abilities, except for Event Horizon. In all honesty, if he was a new champion, the ability would feel out of place. And the name doesn't really fit either.\r\nAn event horizon, as defined by Google, is _\"A theoretical boundary around a black hole beyond which no light or other radiation can escape.\"_ While you can argue Event Horizon does live up to its name by it having a circular stun gate, I feel like it can be better than that. So here's my proposition.\r\n\r\n---\r\n__E: Event Horizon__\r\nCost: 65/80/95/110/125 mana\r\nCooldown: 22/20/18/16/14 seconds\r\nRange: 550\r\nEffect diameter: 600/625/650/675/700\r\nCasting time: 0.5 seconds\r\n\r\nVeigar conjures a black hole that activates after 1 second, lasting for 3/3.25/3.5/3.75/4 seconds afterward. After activating, anything (Including projectiles) other than Veigar himself that touches its event horizon will be dragged to the epicenter of the black hole at the same velocity before touching it.\r\nLive projectiles can still deal damage while being dragged to the black hole's epicenter, but will dissipate after doing so.\r\nEnemy and allied champions' movement speed while being dragged will be increased to 600 if theirs is lower than such. Upon reaching the epicenter, they are able to pass the event horizon and leave the black hole.\r\nEnemy champions are slowed by 30%/40%/50%/60%/70% for 3 seconds upon reaching the epicenter.","replies":[{"poster":"Chad Chadlainn","date":"2019-06-20T06:36:21.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aside from removing him completely, which would be preferred, I think he needs a full rework that doesn't involve 400 dashes and a bullshit baby cage.

But your idea sounds bad if only because it seems like Riot would need to be able to code properly to implement it, which I'm not too confident they can do :^)\n\nHis kit is fine tbf, he needs a bit of changes to make him feel less clunky, but overall he's okay, unlike other control mages, he only has 1 cc ability, sure it's powerful, but the rest of his kit is kinda shit compared to that, because of how a big part of his power budget was put there.\n\n He has 1 ability that doesn't do really do anything by itself (it's extremely easy to dodge if you aren't locked in an animation). Yes, I agree that playing something like Yasuo, Zac or Sylas into him can be a pain for the Yasuo/Sylas/Zac player, but Veigar is absolutely useless into 85% of the other matchups, if you are an ADC, you should never get into his range without being out of position, if you are a tank, you should get some MR so you can just ignore him, if you are a bruiser, get Legend: Tenacity and Mercs and just walk through his cage, if you are an assassin, just bait out W Q or the cage and kill him.\n\n  What I'd like is making the cage a slow + grounding effect for 0.75 AP ratio on Q and mana refund. If we were to remove it entirely, his W needs a rework on top of that, it's a joke of an ability without the cage, also probably increase his range if so, because he'd much, much more vulnerable early than he already is.","replies":[{"poster":"Chad Chadlainn","date":"2019-06-20T20:13:29.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll let you off with that first statement because it's only natural someone who mains him would think he's okay. I will, however, go ahead and say that I disagree so hard that if merely having a certain opinion was enough to make me legitimately resort to ad hominem, it would be that one. \n\nI'm not sure why you're putting too much emphasis onto the fact he only has one CC ability when it's perhaps one of the strongest and least engaging things in the game currently. Why would he even need more? I think the 2.5 second stun rage cage that takes up a sizable area and lingers for 3 seconds is more than enough, especially considering he doesn't even need 2.5 seconds to kill someone.  Think of all the other mages whose stuns only last about a second and a half and are often only able to hit one or two other people at most. Xerath landing a max-range E which can only hit a single target is 2 seconds. TFs Gold Card is 2 seconds. Syndra's E is 1.5. ETC. And even if it doesn't stun, you're still essentially rooted for 3 seconds if he builds it around you.\n\nRecall this is on a champion who not only infinitely scales, but does so without even needing to properly farm. At least Nasus, despite him also being unfun to play against, has to be near minions to stack. \n\nWhile W is indeed easy to dodge without a stun, that isn't unique to Veigar. It's very easy to dodge a number of skillshots in this game, such as Jinx and Jhin W. Wouldn't disagree with it being changed if he loses his E, though. It still hits like a truck and even in the best-case scenario in regards to tenacity, you only have like less than a half second to the W if you're stunned by his E. It's a bit harder to miss than it sounds. \n\nYou should also not speak of matchups if you are not talking about people he has to lane against, as I think that's misleading. It's the rarest case when Veigar isn't going up against a mage or an ADC (because for some reason Riot thinks mages going bot and building full ap and pretending to be supports is okay), or an assassin. Tanks and Bruisers often don't go mid or bot, so they're somewhat irrelevant here. Certain mages can outrange and harass veigar, sure, but a lot don't. Having to auto attack your minions means you'll be in range of his stun, so that also means ADCs are easily trapped in the rage cage as well. I have to disagree he has a lot of bad matchups. \n\nHis R exists. \n\nHis design is terrible and shows how outdated he is. It manages to somehow feel clunky yet be so incredibly unfun and broken at the same time that I have to say I don't think it's physically possible for me to enjoy a game when he's in it. But I also hate yordles so that may or may not contribute. Either way, I think the statements about his kit being fine and that it also being shit aside from his E are two I'd heavily disagree with, myself.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-20T06:55:20.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JPLangley,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=166lGlTm,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-06-19T20:31:21.356+0000)\n>\n> Upon reaching the epicenter, they are able to pass the event horizon and leave the black hole.\n\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa\n\nwhoa\n\nwhoa.\n\n_Leave_ the black hole?
