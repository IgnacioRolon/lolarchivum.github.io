Among younger speakers, the word has a meaning ranging from derision (e.g., equivalent to rubbish or stupid) to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule (e.g., equivalent to weak, unmanly, or lame). In this use, the word rarely means \"homosexual\", as it is often used, for example, to refer to an inanimate object or abstract concept of which one disapproves. The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.[6][7]\"\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay\r\nIts not meant to demean or diminish anyone, its a current use of the word in young culture, trying to forcefully remove it is not a solution and should never be one because people want to \"force\" take offense to it. And not allowing people to comment on the thread anymore when theres a useful discussion going on shows that we dont want to learn whats right but we just want to force those in power's beliefs on those who dont have control of the situation.","replies":[]}
