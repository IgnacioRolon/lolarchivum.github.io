I have already had tech support with both router and modem/ISP","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*I also posted this thread in Client Discussion, forgetting that this specific board existed. Feel free to remove it.\r\n\r\nLet me give a short rundown on why I feel there has been issues lately client side in regards to intermittent lag and random DC drops.\r\n\r\nOver the past few months my name has been on the bill for the internet services, and during these past few months I have gone through 3 routers and multiple chats/visits from TWC to see if there is any interference or issues with the modem. I have a moderate 50mbps connection and consistently get around 40-47mbps. Even the basic unplug/re-plug of the router and modem still give me a shit gameplay experience on League of Legends only.\r\n\r\nEven with all of this information I consistently am having super laggy games. I have a usual in game ping of around 47ms but recently have had enormous lag spikes. The most constant spike I will get will take me to around 140 for about 2 seconds, which can happen every 30 seconds or every 5 minutes. Sometimes, multiple times a day, I will get 300, or even up to 3000+ ping. I have also gotten a 500 ping+DC. During this DC I always tab out and bring up my browser and see if I am truly disconnected from the internet or not. More times than not I am still able to browse the web while I am stuck in limbo on Summoners Rift and I have to quit the game and re-log in.\r\nEven my most recent game we had 2 players who constantly DC'd throughout the game, both complaining of lag issues. I have also witnessed many games recently where players are alt+clicking their ping and will have 300 or so.\r\n\r\nDear Riot, please tell me that there could legit be an issue server/client side so I can stop ripping my hair out and complaining about a shit internet service when I am being told by tech support on both router and modem side that there are no issues detected and that the 2 are communicating properly. I even went as far as to upgrade to the 50mb connection (laugh it up) just so I can have a better experience in LoL and nothing seems to be fixing this lag.\r\n\r\nLet me reiterate: it has only been in the last 4-5 months that I have had these tremendous spikes. Prior to this period I had smooth gameplay on a lower-than 50mbps connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T04:32:26.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes your network can have issues talking with specific servers for one reason or another, even when you're own internet is 100%.
