Sometimes my ping registers as spiking up, sometimes it doesn't.  But at this point, my game is nearly unplayable.  I just got rolled as Syndra against Ekko because I was teleporting around my screen - and during that entire process, my ping was at 67.  I was having some issues earlier as well, playing Gangplank, but nowhere near as bad as my Syndra experience was.\n\nI am almost positive this started after 6.16, but I can't figure out what on my PC could be contributing to this issue.  I run Windows 10, and have had many issues with Windows 10 in the past.  Since October, I haven't even been able to get the apps/app store to work on this.  Not sure if that is contributing any, but it hasn't so far.\n\nAs I am very techno-illiterate, I would appreciate any help/directions that can be given.  \n\n\nEdit:\n\nI tend to run this game at a cap of 75-90 fps, and it isn't dipping when I enter fights.  It's just...jerking around, is the best way I can put it.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI use AVG (the most recent, free build). \n\nEdit 3: \n\nComcasticâ„¢ Experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T17:12:00.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like your network is having problems staying connected, which is pretty critical because the game requires a constant connection.

Up until a month ago I played with 40 ping when my connection was fine, but ever since about the 20th of July or so, my ping has been hovering around 80, which alone would be fine, but about every minute or so I'll get a ping spike, accompanied by the gameplay stopping for a few seconds, then speeding back up to catch up. It's enough to make me not want to play any pvp matches because of how often it happens. And when I tried some of the featured game modes, I discovered that the ping spikes grew more frequent as the game went on, until the game was barely playable for extended periods of time. \n\nI still can't figure out what is causing this issue, and what might have changed to cause it to spring up, as I'm not tech-savvy at all.","replies":[]}]}
