IMO this is pretty good considering that the average KDA/CS of my team was 4.25/8.25/9 and 119.75 CS.\r\n\r\nI ended up getting a end game rating of B+...\r\n\r\nOn top of that to make matters worse i had the most total damage done to champion 31.423 AND total damage dealt 146.112 of my team!\r\n\r\nI even got 1 of the 3 tower we manage to get down...\r\n\r\n I mean i know i lost but ffs! i did all that and i only got an B+?\r\n\r\nComparing it now to a previous game i played not long ago.\r\n\r\nI was top lane we ended up winning in a 24:43 min lenght. Ended up 4/2/4 159 CS total of 9.299 gold. Total dmg to champ 8.114/ total dmg done 77.953 and 1 inhib down by me.\r\n\r\nI get an S+...\r\n\r\nWhere is the logic in that?!
