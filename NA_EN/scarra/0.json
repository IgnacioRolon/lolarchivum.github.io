The first three games I played I ended up with about 30 kills a game and had close to 90 kills after 3 games. I loved that she was a snowbally assassin that felt really rewarding to kill other players with and stuck with her as my most played champ that week. \r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time using her to level up to 30, before I eventually switched into playing Katarina, another reset champion. \r\n\r\nI remember returning to Akali after not playing her for a long time during my first tournament at IPL3. I spent maybe less than a week practicing her, and we had to use a substitute mid laner, so I had to play top lane Akali which was very far from my comfort role. I played against Hotshotgg's Galio top lane and killed him solo while he tried to TP away and won the series and the tournament. \r\n\r\nLooking back, it's been a while since i've played her. She's been relatively low priority as one of my picks, but I know one day she'll be back as one of the champions I enjoy playing mainly because her kit is really fun for me to use.\r\n\r\nSo how about you? How did you find your first main?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Neon","date":"2015-03-11T23:00:19.982+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine was Nami!

That was my role every game and nothing made me happier than picking up a champion with a kit I love top to bottom and that no one else was playing.\n\nPlaying her on free week was like having my eyes opened to all of the cool things that a support can do. She had slows, she had heals, she had damage, she could kite, she could really just do it all. Coming off of the pre-meta Annie support with her point and click stun, I can still remember the first time I landed a bubble to stop a gank which we turned into a kill. I just sort of sat back and thought to myself, \"I made that happen,\" and it was the first time I really contributed to a game based on something that I needed skill to do.\n\nI've played about 900 games since I picked her up, and probably 85% of those are just on Nami.

The game was so interesting and I liked so many of the characters and the overall dynamic of the game so I ended up using my up and coming tax return to purchase a half decent laptop so I could play too. A bit before that, my friends were looking at the next new champion coming out, explaining to me how they put out new characters to play every two weeks (BACK IN MY DAY). That's when I saw her. My beautiful steam-punk princess. The second my laptop arrived I downloaded League, went to GameStop, bought a ten dollar RP card, and bought Caitlyn right when I got home. \n\nLooking back, I didn't realize what a monster I was. I would play Caitlyn mid. Only. I would take ghost/tp for summoners and run/tp all over the map trying to kill anything and everything. I started trap level one and would line their side of the river with three traps so it made it harder for them to CS without stepping in one and taking a head-shot to the face.\n\nI was the worst kind of person.\n\nI don't really play ADC anymore, and it's actually my least favorite roll now, but Caitlyn still holds a place in my heart for being the entire reason I wanted to start playing League in the first place.\n\nEDIT: I KNEW I STILL HAD IT. \nI took a screenshot of the endgame screen where I got my first penta ever.

Before even playing League, I knew that I would like to play support over any other role (and I still do), but I needed a champion that was fairly cheap to level up with. My friends told me to get Taric because he was decent (at the time) and was a fairly low cost. I thought the idea of an on-target stun was super good, so I stuck with him for a while. Ultimately, I came to know that he was outclassed by a few other supports (Thresh, Leona, Janna, and Sona were pretty big at the time). So, I ultimately bought Leona and didn't play Taric much since, though there was always a place in my heart for the Gem Knight.\n\nWhen Pre-season 4 rolled around, Taric turned out to be practically broken, so I returned to playing him for that whole period of time. Sadly, his ratios were nerfed because of it, and I have seldom played him since Season 4 started. Nevertheless, he remains to be one of my favorite champions of all time to play.
