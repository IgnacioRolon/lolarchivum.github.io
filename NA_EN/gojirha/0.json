If you would like to skip to the main point It'll be after the {{item:1056}}  below.\r\n\r\nFor most of my gaming life I have frequented shooting games at a decently high level, and I have always been a competitive player, recently I have been lost with what to play, and thanks to a tinder match I decided to give league of legends a try (my first ever moba)\r\n\r\nAt the start I tried to play as many characters as possible, I wanted a base knowledge of everyone on the roster so I wouldn't be suprised, I begun to figure out what I enjoyed and what I didn't. I picked a few mains {{champion:24}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:59}} so that I had flexibility and wouldn't be caught out in my roles (top / jungle) and I begun researching runes / items so that I could understand counterplay and the reasoning behind all my choices. \r\n\r\nNow this alone is a lot of knowledge to pick up on in a month, understanding the format of a moba, trying the massive variety of characters, and items, runes etc.\r\n\r\nI then hit level 30 and after a 27 / 1 normal game on Jax I was feeling very confident, I thought \"hey I'm ready for ranked\" so I dived straight in, the first game I got entirely countered by a riven and went 0/18 but I didn't give up going 4/10 on my placements. However those 10 games were an horrendous experience not because I got destroyed, but because of the way I was treated.\r\n\r\n{{item:1056}} (This is where I get to the point) \r\nAs a new player throughout my placements, I was profusely flamed, told I was horrible at the game and torn apart by a variety of players who were doing better or worse than me, consistently on my own team rather than the apposing.\r\n\r\nThen when I thought it couldn't get any worse I was permanently banned for responding to the negativity with negativity. I know that my behaviour and the things I said were terrible, I won't try to talk my way out of that, as much as the ban frustrates me I can respect the reasoning behind it. \r\n\r\nBut the point I am getting at here is that this community is horribly unforgiving to new people, there is so much detail to this game and so many layers to understand and improve at from csing, to building the right items, poking in your lane, preparing for ganks, warding for mushrooms, taking the right battles, working in a team, and yet everyone is expected to have it all mastered and perform perfectly from the start?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-14T21:12:56.483+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I totally earned my ban but my behavior should be forgiven for no reason\" wat","replies":[]},{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-05-14T19:11:40.739+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"chat logs?\n\nbecause something about that sounds fishy\n\nnormally it takes a fair amount of time and reports before a permaban is issued\n\nthe only thing I can think of to result in a direct permaban (skipping the other punishment tiers) is if you really went negative\n\ni.e. - death threats, zero tolerances words, etc\n\nthings that would really put you under the spotlight for the ban hammer\n\ngranted this is barring in mind your account didn't have any previous punishments ","replies":[{"poster":"Gojirha","date":"2019-05-14T19:52:17.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"My ban is adequately justified with the things I said, but the premise of this isn't to dispute that really.\nIt's to highlight how new people are treated, and how it is hard to improve at this game when you are shunned by everyone for trying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2019-05-14T21:20:50.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you get permabanned as a new player?

However, the vast majority of careers have moved to a multi-faceted approach to learning - you have to learn the knowledge, then you learn the skills, then you learn the job/site specific requirements.\n\nLeague is no different. You need to learn the knowledge and skills first before you learn the game specific requirements (such as team comps, team plays, etc). It is much harder to learn the team skills if you don't have your own skills down first. And it's much harder to learn your own skills if you're getting beaten by people of higher skill than you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"G Master Hung","date":"2019-05-14T21:35:04.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats subjective to an individual.

When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nIt is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some shit as well. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game.\n\nIn short, you can reply back to the toxics and counter flame them back, just don't use super severe things like hate speech and don't do it often.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bademeister","date":"2019-05-15T14:06:42.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are doing it again - you are flaming this board.

That way you have a general understanding of each character, each position, and each role. The game isn't as much about how well you play your character as it is how well you know the character the enemy is using. This is a colorful game of chess: those who know the most moves and strategies and match ups will win the most. \n\nTime to study. \n\n{{sticker:sona-playing}}","replies":[]}]}
