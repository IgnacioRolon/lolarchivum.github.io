You will not be able to use this skin until you purchase this champion. ARE YOU SURE you want to proceed?\" and then puchases the skin if I click \"yes\" instead of \"cancel\"?\n\nWould be useful for people who exclusively buy champions with IP only, as they could buy skins that are on sale even if they don't have enough IP for the champion yet, and then save up and purchase the champion later.\n\n(When I still played the game before the preseason ruined everything for me, I would actually bank around 10+k IP at all times and never spend it, exclusively for this purpose - so if a neat skin went on sale or a new skin was released on sale, I could buy the champion and then buy the skin. But not everyone has the luxury of doing that, because they need runes for ranked and such.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Paero","date":"2015-12-11T23:29:34.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In saying that, sometimes when a skin is on sale for a champion I don't have, I feel the urge to buy it when I don't have enough IP saved for the champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-12-11T19:10:58.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The store also seems to not show me skins unless I mess with the settings.
