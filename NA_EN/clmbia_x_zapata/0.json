If I'm playing a pick-up game of hockey, I'm sure as hell going to be asked to leave and not return with an attitude like yours. It has nothing to do with a 'fragile environment'. \n\n>  I have just recently discovered that I have been permabanned for a single incident that happened earlier today. One game.\n\nNo, you were perma-banned because you've had 6 previous penalties, and didn't listen or believe the seriousness of their warnings. The last time you were penalized, which wasn't too long ago, you were told the next time would be a perma-ban. Well, it's the next time.\n\n> I will 100% admit that my actions were inappropriate.\n\nI don't really know what the issue is here. You admitted you were in the wrong. You were told the next penalty would come to this.\n\n>  don't think it's warranted. At all. A one game outburst [...]\n\nIt wasn't a one game outburst. This is common behavior for you.\n\n> But the fact that this community has placed an emphasis on punishing \"mean guy hurt my feelings\" over \"cry baby is ruining the game for 9 other people\" in a competitive gaming scene, is laughable to me.\n\nThere is no emphasis. People that ruin games are penalized. Ruining games can be done by trolling, intentional feeding, or harassment. Tell me how it creates a gaming experience that you enjoy and want to return to when players say things similar to what you said?\n\n> it's just sad that we've gotten so used to this way of thinking.\n\nAre you advocating that the community en-mass should change into a pile of trolls? It's the community that sets the standards. I think you're going to have a hard sell convincing the player-base that they must put up with harassment while they are playing a video game.\n\nThe title of your post was related to the behavior systems being broken. How would you suggest they be changed?\n\n> As expected, this forum is filled with nothing but Riot Games yes-men who can't think logically.\n\nIt's actually the opposite.

If you were already on the 14-day ban tier, then your next punishment would be a perma (I'm pretty sure they say as much on the reform card?), and this log certainly could trigger a punishment.

This is because Riot has to be sure the person in question is actually trying to troll and ruin the game via gameplay offenses and not just having a bad game or two. Not only that but more often than not the banned gameplay trolls often already know why they got busted and as such are much less likely to complain on the forums about their ban.\n\nIn case you don't believe me [here are](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken?show=rundown) two examples of gameplay trolls being banned. Yes it's just two examples, but it proves that they do get punished.\n\n> I hadn&#x27;t used the chat function prior to him going off in-chat saying that he was going to intentionally feed.

The fact that Riot can just willy-nilly permaban an account for something like this is unacceptable to me as a consumer. This community is filled with prepubescent wall-flowers where words heavily outweigh actions.\n\nHere's the thing though: \n\n1) You are judged based on your actions alone because at the end of the day it is your actions that caused you to get punished. Others are judged on their actions alone as well, so it's fair for all. This is also why Reform Cards only show the defendants chat, to encourage them to focus on their behavior instead of on others.\n2) Riot doesn't just willy-nilly permaban for any little offense. They can, but they don't. Under normal circumstances you have to receive at least 35 chat restriction games+a 2 week ban and still show no significant changes in behavior in order to get permabanned for chat-related offenses, with extreme chat-related offenses escalating to 2-week or permaban status. Yes at 2-week ban status any little offense can result in a permaban but at that point you're already on thin ice and should really be careful about what you say or do to avoid that from happening. If you don't and continue to act up then you can expect to be permabanned for proving to Riot that you have no real desire to interact with others in a mature and respectful manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-05-25T20:19:25.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CLMBIA x ZAPATA,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=RUEAsZIM,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2017-05-25T20:01:28.861+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve already admitted my actions were in the wrong.
