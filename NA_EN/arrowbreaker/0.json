Problem at login screen...an unexpected error was occured...I did everything right, checked the repair tool x5 times, even re-installing the client twice ( waited for 6 hours for both installs) and still nothing, everything was fine until the patch come out, I was checking a Facebook Group of LOL which people say things about new champs, their plays, their division, and this problem...Of course not everyone had the same problem like me and many others but still...how? and why? I even tryed to made a ticket through the support call but nothing( tired to wait 30 minutes to send a ticket lol, and still sending...really?). I don't want to be mad, but someone can tell me what going on? When it can be fixed? I wasn't reported by anyone for hacking or something like that, I remember well...but really? If someone knows something please tell me. Thanks:))\r\n\r\nP.S: Sorry if my english can be pretty hard, I'm from South East Europe and english is not my good call.

It sounds to me like you might have some kind of network block or issue that's failing to reach our services in and out of League.  To start off, I recommend grabbing our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to auto-configure your firewall settings in case that's the culprit, but you'll want to double check any antivirus you have too.\n\nOnce that's been configured, run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to both tune up your connection to us as well as remove any other blocks.
