He is the most banned champ in the game and has been for a long time now. Riot just attempted to &quot;nerf&quot; him on the pbe, but had to retract all changes due to it being a buff actually. So let me get this straight, the most broken champ in the game... {{champion:157}} YASUO{{champion:157}} can&#039;t be balanced and when it is attempted it becomes a buff? I believe this champ in all reality should just be suspended until they can figure something out. Cause face it.. when he is picked he wins because he gets 2x the highest dmg output in the game as his passive, when he gets banned as much as he is the {{champion:157}}Yasuo{{champion:157}} mains don&#039;t get to play him as badly as they want, and if by some miracle he does get picked it automatically tilts the enemy team, thus ruining their overall experience before the game even starts. I don&#039;t know what to say but the fact that there are so many ban worthy champs and he is pretty much banned 100% of the time should show that something is very wrong with the champ. Extremely wrong with the champ. You ask LoL players who the most broken champ in the game is and they say {{champion:157}}Yasuo{{champion:157}}. Even the people who play him will admit it and that&#039;s why they play him. I don&#039;t want {{champion:157}}Yasuo{{champion:157}} deleted. But for real something really needs to be done now.","replies":[{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2017-08-28T20:20:29.689+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yasuo's ban rate is high because his kit has serious balance flaws.

This post is completely false.\n\nHe has an average winrate of 50% and about 6-7% playrate. Yasuo is only strong in low elo and otherwise, he is just hot trash in high elo.\n\nhttps://www.op.gg/champion/statistics\n\nNot even breaking the top 10 most banned champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Azrael Evernight","date":"2017-08-28T21:33:39.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your logic is flawed because that is specifically plat and higher in Korea. lol Nice try though man.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-08-29T13:19:35.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Look up NA then. He is in no way close to 80% or higher like you suggested. Yasuo is legit the most trashy hit or miss champion. Low elos will struggle against him but he has no good match-ups and has to scale or cheese early. Both of which are hard against players that are not dumb.\n\nAlso most of your logic is very basis and untrue.","replies":[{"poster":"Azrael Evernight","date":"2017-08-29T18:38:36.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your original argument is that he isn't even good high elo, yet more then 60% of the game is low elo.

Assumptions. You assume that he is some god champion that breaks the game. Yes he stomps out low elo but once you've fought a couple of yasuos, you should be able to understand how to play against him. \n\nI bet if you check his winrate outside of high elo it would still be the same or even worse. \n\nYou mention a change on the pbe but what is it? Want to give a link because I don't remember seeing a change for Yasuo on the pbe lately.\n\n> Cause face it.. when he is picked he wins because he gets 2x the highest dmg output in the game as his passive\n\nHe has reduced crit damage which needs to be bandaid fixed with IE. ADCs technically out-damage him.\n\n> he does get picked it automatically tilts the enemy team\n\n{{champion:122}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:23}} \n\nJust pick one of those above champions or a very long list of other champions and win lane by default. Yasuo has terrible match-ups in his best lane top and even in mid, most capable mages and assassins can handle him.\n\n> You ask LoL players who the most broken champ in the game is and they say Yasuo. Even the people who play him will admit it and that's why they play him.\n\nUntrue. Talk to 10 players from each elo and you will get a massive variety of answers. Link me a poll where this is truth. Do something to prove that Yasuo is considered the most broken champion in the game.\n\nAlso I play Yasuo because he is smooth and fun to play. He is also an edgy anime swordsman and that's a fun power fantasy. The character is just fun and that's why you have so many people who play him. It isn't because he is broken. Ask Yasuo mains and they will reassure you that they aren't playing him because he is busted.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-08-28T20:29:18.689+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think they need to rework his w.
