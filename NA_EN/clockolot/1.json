I even tried some other email accounts I have and it still says that those email accounts are already in use. Could linking two emails as backups make it so they count as one when signing up with an email? And is there any way I can check to see what accounts are signed up with the emails that are already in use?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T23:04:47.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have a way for you to check which emails are in use, except for trying one to see if it's used already. If the ones you're trying are used already, it's a little odd that they might be used by someone else but you may need to create an email specifically for that account. If you end up needing to do so, I'd suggest writing that down and saving it somewhere in case you ever need to recover that account.","replies":[]}]}
