Do these people have no common sense? You&#039;ve lost. Surrender the game and stop wasting everybody&#039;s time. AFK&#039;ing in these situations shouldn&#039;t be a reportable offense, and I&#039;m not talking about when you&#039;ve &quot;lost your lane&quot;, I&#039;m talking about when you&#039;re 30-5, they&#039;ve destroyed your inhibs and are now toying with you and letting the minions end themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"JayBaited MeLane","date":"2015-09-12T10:22:18.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"even in extreme games like that, just have fun with them :)","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainCandyazz","date":"2015-09-12T19:51:05.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Fun\" is not a word that can be used when you're restricted to your base while the rest of your team feeds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-09-12T21:45:57.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. I can't stand that shit. I'm more likely to lash out at my teammates for forcing me to play in a lost game. If I could just put the stupidity behind me and move on, I'd be alright, but no. Have to sit through it for an extra 30 minutes, it really ticks me off.\n\nI don't get the \"never surrender!\" mentality.

If someone's being toxic and they want the game to end, but they are not really bothering my other team members I'll gladly postpone the game and smile as they rage.\n\nThe game and that toxic guy already made me salty, might as well extract some fun from it where I can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Predatore","date":"2015-09-12T09:13:08.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am negative quite a bit and do tend to surrender but there is always a chance.
