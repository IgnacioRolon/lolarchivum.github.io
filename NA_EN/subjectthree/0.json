In more moderate cases, the area around my champion would turn dark, as if I was in the fog of war, but I would still be able to see any and all entities within my vicinity, however should I hover my mouse over or walk too close to the vi, my entire screen would be obscured with parallel streaks of  yellow purple and black converging on my mouse.  The only things I would be able to observe through this effect would be the health bars of nearby minions and champions.  It should be noted that every time vi appeared on my screen a version of this glitch happened, that to my knowledge no one else experienced it, and that I was not able to replicate it in a custom match with one of my friends who was using the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-02T18:44:51.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey keyloada - \n\nI'm not able to get a repro on this. :c \n\nIf you have any additional info/screenshots, please feel free to add it to the post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shyv","date":"2016-03-02T03:37:24.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"breh its the boards not your english paper","replies":[]}]}
