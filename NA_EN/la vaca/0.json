At first it would tell me that an older version of league of legends was not uninstalled. I looked up a forum for that problem and it told me to try the Hextech Repair Tool. When I try reinstalling through that tool it gives me an **Error 1610 attempting to install package into my roaming folders.** I have no idea what to do at this point has anyone ever experienced this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-14T22:35:22.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I this this problem might be caused by a security setting that's not allowing your HRT or patcher to scan your game files.
