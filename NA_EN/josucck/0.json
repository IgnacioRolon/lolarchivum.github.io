Keep in mind, those capsules can give different amounts depending on what level you got to and such. At higher levels you can get more than pre-30, as well as milestone levels giving more than normal levels.\n\nWith all that mumbo jumbo out the way, let's all just be a little patient to see just how well the new system works over a little time. It's hard to say exactly how much we're getting with just a single day's worth of data. You're definitely welcome to give all the feedback you might have so far, but it might not reach the ears of the important people here in H&S. I'd really recommend you post this in Client Discussion where the devs can see it easier though!","replies":[{"poster":"Naqel","date":"2017-11-10T06:17:05.253+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's some great feedback:\nIf someone is stuck with a tiny amount of BE away from the champion they want directly after a level up(and disenchanting all shards), the new system means they need to get another entire level to unlock that champion.\n\nIn the old one, that simply meant one more game.\n\nWere I not already in possession of everything I want, ever landing in a situation like that would probably make me reconsider how I invest my time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-12T23:34:51.663+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is REALLY good feedback!!! We've always had a little Gift RP Art program in place to help people out in this example but when they need a little RP instead of IP/BE. In my personal opinion, this program should probably apply to BE as well to help people save time and get a little boost to buying the next thing they want!\n\nFor real though, this is the kind of feedback we need with new systems. This directly pinpoints something you're not happy about, why you aren't happy with it, and how it could be fixed in a reasonable way! Please do me a favor and post this over in Client Discussion so the devs have a better chance of seeing it.

Change is hard, especially when you have been so used to doing things one way.  Adjusting to change does not happen over night it takes time (6-12 weeks in fact). \n\nHonestly i don't have a issue with the whole BE thing, yes you should get a tiny (tiny tiny tiny) amount after a game just to help with BE accruement (and feels of obtainment) and the costs of getting a champion you are set on. Here is what i am finding.\n\nLeveling up is super easy **REALLY **easy and you get free stuff.I have only leveled to 34 as of today so that's 3 capsules in these i have received 1 Ali, 1 Aniv, 1 MF, 1 Nid, 1 Poppy, 1 Shy, 1 Singed and 2 Taric's, hand full of BE. Considering leveling is infinite!\n\n I honestly think this is fair considering all the other ways there are to obtain champions eg: RP, BE, GIFT, Capsules from leveling. \n\nlets not forget the weekly unlocks for draft/blind queue for people to try champions (much rather this then players having easy access and just jumping into ranked with a champ that's new to them.....checks and balances people, and then there is the \"My shop\" which i think can make a regular return to help with some players concerns.\n\n**TBH Riot do a lot of great work! **Cut them some slack they have practically changed the game for the better rolling forward. YES there will be some tweaks with BE and mechanics this can be expected!!! Just enjoy the new feel to the \"In Game\" in the preseason and any bug will get ironed out for next season.\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\n**\nGuys please remember the below:**\n\n(1) - Quests and Events are regular now - Tokens can be broken down to be too! You have choices you know.\n(2) - Games seem to be going much faster. More games in X amount of time  = faster leveling = more BE then before game play changes were made.\n\n**P.S Riot, a couple of suggestions**\n\n(1) - Maybe consider implicating more of (My shop) or some form of rework of it. to get champions and not skins as i think you already give may options for this RP/Shard/Gift/Honor capsule (People shouldn't just get stuff for free all of the time. there has to some investment made by the player.\n\n(2) - This will sound stupid but i will say it any way. Once a week or month release a chest purchasable with BE. In this chest you will have a chance of obtaining 1 champion out of a roster of say 5 or 6 champions( rotating/random) available in the box, champions will be listed on normal pop up box with a buyer beware notice (never will it include champions releases in past 6 months/ 1in 5 rar rar rar). make this so you never get a champion a Summoner already has!\n\n(3) Champion lottery with BE could be fun. doubt it could be done though :( \n\n\nAnyways, Thanks for the great work Riot! Heading down the right path!","replies":[]}]}
