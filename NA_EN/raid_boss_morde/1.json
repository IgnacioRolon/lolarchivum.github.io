Trundle ult does indeed calculate its heal based off the target's health without taking mitigation into account. I'd imagine that was done deliberately during his development or rework to ensure that what seems like the correct play (ult the person with lots of health and mitigation to steal) is appropriately rewarding.\n\nMorde ult by contrast does base its healing off post mitigation damage actually dealt. Given Morde's tendency to buy MPEN and the most desirable ghosts often being squishy targets that makes sense too with how the ult should be used. \n\nLooks like the behavior in that video linked is working as intended. There's a bit of variation in the healing ticks as the ult runs, that'll be the floating combat text amalgamating other sources of healing (HP5, nearby minion deaths etc) into the same display number though (done to reduce visual overload). Would be good to find a concise way of helping the reader expect pre-mitigation healing from Trundle's ult tooltip, wouldn't want to do so without a clean, simple way of doing so though (initial comprehension of ability functionality being more important than that level of nuance).","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-07-08T02:36:32.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh, i'd prefer to have the pre mitigation heal on morde aswell. so he can choose from ulting the tank for extra survivabillity, or trying to get that adc-ghost.\nTHis would maybe help to make his teamfighting presence a bit less binary, as currently his impact on teamfights heavily depends on getting that adc-ghost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2016-07-08T03:26:49.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the reply! As you can see, there was some mass confusion in that post because of this. That actually makes a lot sense now that I think about it... but this could be another reason why Trundle is so strong. I never knew that his ult would heal off pre-mitigation, and always thought buying Magic Resist would reduce that damage. This is very interesting.\n\nIt would be really nice if you could add to Trundle's ult tooltip that it heals for pre-mitigation damage (similar to what WotA had).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-07-11T17:21:50.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://dd.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/4plbu0/how_does_trundle_heal_1100_health_instantly_in/d4n28cz\n\nCan you confirm this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-08T07:51:09.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I'm a bit surprised, I thought all the skills that had this effect of damage + heal* where healing with pre-mitigation values, but it's actually different on a case-by-case basis?
