When he gets his rework/VU, will the Pentakill splash be updated to something completely new, or will it be the same?

Targon to become a protector of all life and beauty.\nYorick will probably be turned into Dwayne The Rock Johnson with a shovel from Ikea and his ghouls will be living pepperoni plants.\nSeriously though, i hope they keep Yorick similiar in a way like Poppy.
