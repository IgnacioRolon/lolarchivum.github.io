Unfortunately, he gets passed up in a lot in skins :( it&#039;s been almost 4 years since he got one, and today, it&#039;s changed. After 4 years of waiting, you would think they could at least give him a 975 RP skin. Look at Skarner? He got a LEGENDARY skin after waiting 3 years, and then another 975 skin a few months later. I really don&#039;t want to complain with this, and I normally don&#039;t about new skins. I know Riot works hard on these, and I really appreciate the work! I just really hope you (Riot) consider a higher class skin for Mordekaiser at some point. Zilean had waited the longest without a skin, and he was... &quot;rewarded&quot; with a really good skin, a 975 RP skin. New recall, new particles, new model and textures! Let Mordekaiser get some sort of treatment on this skin. Even this 750 RP Talon skin has some slightly different particles on his W and R, and he&#039;s waited a long time without a skin.\r\n\r\nALSO\r\n\r\n@Riot: If he&#039;s going to be in this card theme skin line, he should be the Ace or Spades! \r\n\r\nQ  - mACE of SPADES!\r\n\r\nAnother note: this skin line is probably going to have a combined splash art, right? Kind of sucks for Morde again, because then he&#039;ll have two different combined splash arts: Pentakill and Cards. He wants to be the center of attention for once, he told me!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-30T18:05:20.022+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey InfiniteDelusion!\n\nI totally get where you're coming from, as it's been quite a while since his last skin.\n\nMordekaiser falls into a similar boat as Evelynn -  they've got old models and rigs that need to be updated. Rather than making players wait even longer for a Mordekaiser skin, we decided on a thematic that could accept the current limitations his current rig has (We did something similar with the 750 RP Evelynn skin.)\n\nWe did consider Mordekaiser as the Ace of Spades, but we ultimately decided upon King of Clubs because we felt that 'clubs' had a much stronger shape language for the weapon than 'spades' did.\n\nHope this clears somethings up!","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-04-30T18:14:33.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will his particles get changed for the same reason Warden Nautilus's particles were changed?

I'm just frustrated and lightly salted about Mordekaiser being left so outdated, so sorry if I sounded harsh. Mordekaiser really needs to be on the list for the potential VUs soon, I think he deserves it quite a bit. \n\nAbout the skin, these are very little changes, but make sense. Change the Q particles to match the weapon he has. It should shoot out little \"club\" maces. For his E, the weapon that comes out of the ground should be his new weapon! Then his ult could simply be his new helmet floating above them. Those are my only concerns for the skin at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-30T21:48:52.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not harsh at all, you're just being honest. \n\nSince it's a 750 RP skin, we only change necessary particles, and we felt that in this case his (E) was the big issue here, rather than the other spells.

I'm not saying combined ones are bad, but it's been 4 years since Mordekaiser has had is OWN splash art. One reason I've been looking forward to a new skin for him is for the new splash art. I want a new wallpaper... but I would like him to the focus, not a bunch of other champs that I don't care about. It's sorta like Xerath in his new skin. He's in the back, and is hardly in the splash art, but he's at least had recent skins that showcase him; Scorched Earth Xerath. \n\nIt really doesn't matter, it is just a splash art, but It would be nice for him to have his own individual one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cosmosaurus","date":"2015-04-30T03:52:37.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a feeling he's gonna get particles, the base ones just won't look good with this skin.","replies":[]}]}
