That has nothing to do with personal stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2019-01-11T21:11:29.940+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">That's the discrepancy we need to solve.\n\nPublishing stats creates a new discrepancy - one between the players' opinions of acceptable stats and Riot's action or inaction in response.\n\nIt might lead to situations like this where OP thinks Vayne incorrectly spiked to 54% in a day. But it prevents situations where players might freak out over stats that are out of context, like Kayle's win rate or something. \n\nHiding the stats also gives Riot a lot more room to just ignore things that players would identify as problems. This is a totally made-up example, but just humor me. Let's say that Ahri's third-party stats show her at 51% average win rate and 52% win rate in gold. Riot's stats break that down even further and reveal that gold Ahri mains with 150+ games have a 61% win rate. \n\nRiot might look at that and decide that Ahri overall is in a good place, and any change to bring down that 61% would have far more negative consequences than positive. So they let it sit, and those Ahri players see their win rates level off as they're carried out of gold. Riot's decision is utilitarian, but can you imagine the hellfire that would rain down from the community for a decision like that?\n\nI think it would be an even bigger problem if everyone knew the full extent of the mastery curves. Blaustoise released Jax's mastery curve, and my reaction to that was.....not good. It basically confirmed that he's no-skill freelo, and it pissed me off to know that I can be 50 games into a a champion and have the same odds of winning as a Jax being played for the very first time.
