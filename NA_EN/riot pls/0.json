I REALLY like what you guys did even with that brief description about them in the Book. Valor and Quinn together are two of the most capable champions that demacia has and the intrigue of being across the borders of enemies? exciting.\n\nAn update on Skarner would be nice. I wanna see him progress and learn and gain allies. Janna is another interesting one. I really liked her color story about her and the boy she protected. I think there's a lot of room to tell more stories of her heroism and perhaps of her struggles. I'd like to see a story from HER point of view.\n\nAlso! Jax and Fiora met! I MUST know what happened as a result of their duel. jax is looking for capable fighters to help him. Did Fiora live up to his standards? Did he live up to hers????? I gotta know.\n\nI'd also like to hear more stories about what the Aspects are up to. Last we heard, Diana was trying to exterminate the Void's influence and I'd like to see what her and all of the other Aspects are up to. Are their paths unified in purpose? What beautiful thing is Taric protecting!!!??\n\nNami is another big one. Her last story was so funny, meeting the villagers. Loved her interactions.\n\nOrianna's journey into understanding humanity and her own form is interesting. I wonder what would happen if she met up with Camille, or even Viktor? What would those conversations be like.\n\nWhere is Ivern? What is he doing?\n\nThis is JUST me being greedy, but Syndra! Girl what!!! The will of Ionia itself had her sleeping! Soraka was passing out visions about her! A man died to ensure she would not awaken but she DID! Will she make allies? enemies? What will sate her rage! and let's talk about her warped magic that basically causes magical cancer! I just need more from muh girl.\n\nVarus. What are my favorite two gays and demon up to? And the other Darkin for that matter.

What did her mentor remind her of her mother? Does she have connections due to her families wealthy reputation?
