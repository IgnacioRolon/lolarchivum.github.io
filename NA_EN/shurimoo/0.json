Why should you care about your max hp heal cost if you don't have to spend any health whatsoever to heal someone 2-3 times off landing a single q? Normally surrender@20 has context links to posts on twitter or here that at least explain why the changes are being made but, at least so far, this one has none and I'm at a complete loss what its intent even is aside from, the way I see it, pointlessly ruining soraka's skill expression and counterplay.\r\n\r\nThinking about it some more:\r\nRejuvination passive is 5s at all ranks(IIRC; please let me know if that isnt the case), so she maxes W every game instead of choosing between Q or W depending on matchup/how people are playing (removal of skill expression)\r\nIf enemy engages on her early she is weaker, due to losing sig. amounts of self-healing on q and maxing W now but that just means she sits back; her only goal is to get through laning, which she can easily do if they engage on her ADC because she is maxing W now along with her W healing being increased by 5/rank. She spends no hp if she lands a Q, so the only person losing hp in an engage is her ADC (except they arent because soraka is casting W on them). Even better: Soraka's adc just goes Cleanse. Now ignite is useless, and laning phase is likely a done deal.\r\n\r\nLaning phase is over, soraka now has warmogs+/ KV; ardent, etc (obviously that's more items than just laning phase end but that isn't the point. She will build tanky enough to be unassassinateable but definitely wants healing boost to increase her W, so enough HP to activate warmogs, a little resist, and ardent/athenes). Your counterplay no longer revolves around disrupting or focusing soraka, your only avenue is to pray you can instakill her heal target through her higher W value, endless heals for poke (warmogs) and KV passive. If you engage on someone, she likely gets a free Q unless you flash it. Now she spends no HP and doesn't lose HP for healing people during the fight, meaning enemy team HP is effectively infinite until she dies or is forced out. If you manage to kill the DPS through her W and KV then congrats, you've probably won the fight but her ADC also has PD, can go DD, and has cleanse (as we established earlier), making this fairly unlikely in my eyes (though damage is very high in the game, and obviously people messing up isn't impossible) but the point is, I don't think these changes do anything good for the game or Soraka.","replies":[{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2020-02-09T08:24:51.956+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with top lane Soraka isn't Soraka. It's the lane in general. Instead of recognizing that, we're getting another bandaid and they're undoing one of the few good changes they made in the past few years, which was making Soraka an interactive champion.\n\nThis change is going to cause Soraka to be a healbot again, which is what she was changed from because she had next to no interaction in lane years ago. She would just stand behind her ADC and heal. I guess with the release of Yuumi, they don't really mind having champions like that anymore, but I have to say as a Soraka main it's pretty sad to see the path they've set. Sure, you're somewhat more vulnerable, but you still stand from a safe distance and only an assassin can touch you. A really good Soraka is going to use her E wisely for that occasion.\n\nThe previous changes made her more of a lane bully, which is fine in bot lane. She's dealt with pretty easily by mage supports like Zyra because they can spam poke at a safe enough distance that her Q is hard to hit due to the slow missile time. Against engage supports like Nautilus she's just dead or wasting flash if she tries to consistently harass. She can't really get out of hand unless the enemy plays badly (i.e. buying Executioner's Calling first back when they're getting whopped by her Q).\n\nMost melee top laners don't have any tools early game to deal with Soraka's Qs, so they get easily bullied out of lane. When they do, she has anti-engage with her E. When the laning phase is over it doesn't matter because Soraka was designed to transition into a more heal-focused champion later in the game to give people a chance to build anti-healing and to make her work towards that goal.\n\nThe Q nerfs and W buffs are going to change that. I get why they're buffing W with a Q nerf, because if they just put out the Q nerf, Soraka would have no chance bot lane in this meta. \n\nPersonally, I preferred their first proposed minion damage nerf. It was still a bandaid, but not one that caused problems on the other side of the map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-09T08:01:11.852+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"This change moves some of Soraka's survivability into the assumption that she's in a duo lane by reducing the strength of her Q while mitigating some of the cost of her W.

ADC's beat you early game, mid game, and late game. Early game PTA melts your healthbar and deals far more damage than you can hope to compete with. mid game, the CS lead allows them to get items before you, meaning nothing changes.

They need to know where the enemy carry is at all times and make split second decisions in a team fight to avoid heavy CC and get out alive.\n\nGetting killed in an instant or being denied kills often makes people lash out at the offending champion, calling them low skill or whatever. They have the same buttons you do, the fact that you thinking that pushing 3 buttons instead of 2 makes you so much higher skilled is overly simplistic. Skill is also expressed through game knowledge, managing waves, relaying information about the enemy team locations, etc. \n\nI would appreciate it if you would stop conflating mechanical skill with overall game knowledge, because using only one metric does not give you the full picture and feeds into an elitist attitude where X champion and it's mains are better than Y champion and its mains because \"we actually have skill\".","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2020-02-11T02:28:55.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not my intention to suggest that playing Soraka does not involve skill, but I think it's fair to say that her W has very little skill expression, as do *many* enchanter abilities. \n\nAgain, it's about how this *one skill* works. It's a point and click with a simple, linear cooldown, and I think that's ultimately just not good for Soraka in the long run. And the current issues with her in the game are good evidence for that, imo. \n\nI also find Soraka's fantasy (the savior of teammates, as you succinctly put it) *super compelling,* but that's why I'm advocating for inventive change in her kit. I think she could fulfill that fantasy much better than she currently does.\n\nUltimately, succeeding on a champion, as you say, is a confluence of many many factors. I have seen a TON of soraka players that are super super skilled, and I find that playing Soraka is actually pretty difficult for me. But, that's partially because her design has had to bend over backwards for one, in my opinion, very unimaginative skill. And I wish it were different.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sluiceway","date":"2020-02-09T18:53:37.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wonder if the issue is with Soraka or her Itemization, and that of the opposing team.

But mostly I think it would be a farm-centric lane where both trade harass and heal any damage taken soon after, as neither one has much kill potential on the other. I do think that Soraka would be the one farming under her tower, though.  I have not taken into account potential jungle interaction in my answer, since you specified 1v1.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2020-02-09T17:36:48.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd prefer they give more bruiser buffs tbh.
