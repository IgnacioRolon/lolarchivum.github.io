Given how she is currently built, what else do you expect her to do?  God knows her utility is trash tier until you are rolling 200+ AP.  Even at max ranks and full CDR, neither her heal/shield or her movement speed is really anything to write home about.\n\nLet's say Riot changes her, so that she is no longer \"the damage utility support\", What is your suggestion for buffs in other areas to compensate for a downgrade in damage output?  If they change her Q to a skillshot, are you ok with it starting off doing like 90 damage and ending with it doing something like 300-500 before AP scaling?  Would the skill shot hit minions?  If so how much bonus power do you need to give it so that landing it actually makes it feel worth while?\n\nIt honestly seems like the people who claim that she is too strong have either never played her (or only done so a handful of times since she existed) and/or flip out at the idea of giving her HUGE buffs to compensate for a reduction in \"ease of play\".   Let's be honest here if Sona didn't auto target she would need to be a BEAST when she hit her offensive ability.  Or if you don't want her doing damage, she is likely to become this monster who can't be pushed out of lane, along with her ally, unless she is playing like a blind cat chasing a laser pointer.  The other possibility is you get a champion who, if kept alive by her team, basically makes a 5 man push impossible to counter and has it just steam roll down lanes wiping out everything in it's path.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-03-03T23:37:41.971+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Abatrox,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tfb2WEQj,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-03-03T21:50:24.984+0000)\n>\n> E only speeds you up XD #riotgames\n\nThat might as well be the case RIGHT NOW.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowplosion","date":"2016-03-04T18:43:08.697+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see allies dodging only Sona's heal but not anything else.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emmy Cha0s","date":"2016-03-17T11:19:41.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah brah, they follow up with 3 nerfs _in the same patch._\n\nSona has never had a single patch in this game's history that was only a buff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-03-03T21:52:54.933+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":6,"body":"Whoa, what's with the comments about her being gutted?

Her poke isn't strong enough to scare most champions unless you can land it repeatedly without counter damage.  Her heal/shield are very weak when you look at what they do individually (100% AP ratio sounds great until you have to tag all 5 champions on your team for it), her movement speed spell doesn't really last long enough (you can hit that thing like 4-7 times going from one base to the other and you still probably only saved yourself like 2-4 seconds); she lacks any internal form of engage disengage I.E. gap closer.  And her ult can't hit champions that are on top of her ({{champion:5}} , {{champion:107}} , etc...).\n\nBut most of all she is SUPER AP hungry.  While other utility champions like Soraka, or Janna can be played with limited AP and still have their abilities function as needed, high base heals with low cooldowns and strong disengage mechanics respectively, Sona doesn't really do all that much if you build her aura/defensive heavy and AP light.\n\n\nShe isn't \"weak\" per say, but a lot of her power comes from when your team is a full group and from your opponents playing poorly.  One of these means that you often don't see a power spike until 15-20 mins into the game.  The other is outside of your control.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Bonecrush3r","date":"2016-03-04T04:53:25.677+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"you're joking right? ive seen sona's go 12/2 because of how strong her ap scaling is with a liche bane","replies":[{"poster":"QjTHqo3RTq","date":"2016-03-04T05:01:47.120+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know, if the game was decided by how good ap scalings were, AP Blitzcrank would be crushing, AP Aatrox would be an instaban, and Proffesor Milk would be in the LCS, in the greatest region, NA","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-03-04T07:32:48.905+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's not her scaling it's her orgasmic burst damage.
