I just played a game against a poppy that reminded me why needs on, lets just say im gonna have nightmares tonight.\r\n\r\nBut i was just wondering if she is actively being worked on and what attributes she will keep?","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-03-02T09:16:06.444+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's not actively being worked on. We're possibly considering her as a candidate for late this year, but no guarantees. Here's pretty much what I'd want to see:\n\nhttp://knockwurst.deviantart.com/art/Poppy-League-of-Legends-KNKL-405699226\n\nThat's some fan art done by one of our former, and sorely missed, artists Kienan. \n\nIt would roughly equate to solidify Poppy in the Yordle space and give her (as I think is what's appropriate for all Yordles) slightly more animalistic features. I'd say she could skirt slightly more animal in an official version, but I generally like where this is at.\n\nI think it's ok that we could say male Yordles get scruffy, almost puppy/rodent sort of vibes to them, while females have much less hair (maybe a peachfuzz amount) and are a bit more divergent from the males. \n\nAlso, this gives her actual anatomy! That's a plus. We did the same thing with Heimer and will have to do such for the rest of the Yordles.","replies":[{"poster":"adventcalendar","date":"2014-03-02T17:20:26.897+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"About female Yordles; is blue like THE skin colour for them or is it a coincidence with Poppy, Tristana and kind of Lulu?","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-03-03T02:05:07.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a hunch, I'm guessing it's a coincidence. I think you can probably have any sort of color on them honestly. I guess dark, cool colors tend to work well on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-03-03T22:03:44.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I had a weird fan theory that saturated blue/cyan/teal skin was an exaggerated secondary sex trait suggesting the presence of a nutrient needed for healthy Yordle maternity.\n\nIt adds some interesting implications that make Yordles feel more like their own species with their own culture while letting them have interesting parallels to human society--while simultaneously world-building what Yordle society looks like. \n\nTristana ends up being Yordle MF, Poppy has the counterpart fantasy for Yordles to Leona's fantasy (Yordle Diana wherE), while Lulu ends up being (ironically) sort of a Baba Yaga type of character to any theoretical Yordle summoners of the League. Rumble ends up looking a little effeminate relative to Teemo (emphasizing the love triangle they have w/Tristana) and Heimerdinger (Yellow OP--also makes \"raise your hwat?\" make more sense in-universe).\n\nIt also adds some ways to add extra flavor and atmosphere to any stories set in Bandle City, since right now Yordles are basically fluffy gnomes who require social interactions to remain sane (Their main defining societal/cultural/psychological trait, which is admittedly interesting and creative), sometimes have giant problems (Ty based Heimer bio), have an oddly large military (that outside of *Teemo* was incapable of stopping *Veigar* from stealing the cornerstone of their society--and \"stupidly good tech relative to everyone else\" is a gnome trope) and worship a giant rocket (something I could easily see gnomes doing.) Giving them more distinct cultural traits, even if the aforementioned theory is hogwash, might be appropriate. \n\nJust a thought (which turned into a long rant on Yordles not having a strong enough identity--hooray ADHD). Feel free to joss the theory, although I do really think Yordles could be so much more as a culture/species and would love to hear thoughts on how Bandle City and Yordles are going to develop in the future.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Limakoko808","date":"2014-03-02T13:01:21.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah im diggin the animalistic features. Having female yordles looking more feral than their male counterpasrts, who are more fluffy like, could be a cool way to go IMO. Because it seems like male yordles are more into technology and magic while the 2 female yordles we have seem more into brute force,what with a bigass hammer and a rocket taller than the yordles themselves lol","replies":[{"poster":"Limakoko808","date":"2014-03-02T13:07:52.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oops i forgot about Lulu lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-03-02T09:20:41.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That looks good to me!
