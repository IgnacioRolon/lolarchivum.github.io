I mean the hat is awesome of course but besides that her visuals seem to portray her as the exact opposite of the kind of women her attitude and overall feel suggests.\n\nI mean sure its visually appealing for those who enjoy sexy women, but it just seems like fanservice at best. Not saying this kind of look is bad, but it just doesnt mesh as well as it could with Caitlyns persona. With elise id say the sexual look does work well because she is supposed to be seductive in order to lure men into her traps, but i doubt Cait uses her miniskirt in her investigations. Just my thoughts on the matter","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-02-17T07:29:20.020+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":8,"body":"Saved me the trouble of making it.

I still miss Karma's fans, I will not lose Cait's hat.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-02-17T07:36:43.001+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":13,"body":"There's a lot of stuff going on here that I like, I'll expand more on about it when I get back.\n\nEDIT: Ok, FINALLY WON A GAME. Anywhoozle, yes, I generally like this concept. I think it does some interesting things that preserve what I feel is core to Cait. There's some aristocratic notes, there's some sophistication, and there's class. \n\nI do feel it might be a bit too Victorian to be uniquely Piltover, whatever that means. That's part of the challenge actually. We've made Jayce and Vi, two people who are supposed to be interacting with Cait and she simply doesn't fit in. They're not really steampunk in thier language, they're sorta.. \"manatech\". So, while I feel Cait can have Victorian notes, we should find a way to bring her into that manatech (or hextech) area and get her materials, her shapes and other properties in line with Piltover.\n\nPart of that is sort of figuring out what the hell Piltover actually looks like. We have a start with Jayce and Vi, so that's good. We may have to flesh a few more details out before we jump right into Cait. \n\nHer hat is another thing. Some love it, some hate it. It is indeed iconic. When you think of Cait, or you associate let's say.. cosplaying Cait, you think purple frilly short dress, knee high boots and big Willy Wonka hat. Now, charm is great, but we need to extract what that charm is and see where we can re-channel it. Maybe a bowler hat? Maybe just a smaller version of her current hat? I do love the hat for its charms, but it's sort of silly. \n\nThat said, if we ever, and that's a big if considering our priorities right now, hit Cait with a VU, my gut guess is that we'd do a traditional skin for her. That way i think we can solve some of her thematic issues without destroying the charming thing we've grown to love. \n\nBut yeah. With our priorities now, a Cait VU is probably a long way off, and as per usual, about anything I talk about:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/8JAJGRg\n","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Brigadier","date":"2014-02-17T09:00:21.999+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":">They're not really steampunk in thier language, they're sorta.. \"manatech\"\n\nI saw in Jayce - and a bit less so in Vi - a sort of modern approach to classical art deco illustrations of future technology.
