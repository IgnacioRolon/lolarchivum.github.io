Eat a Q at level 1 and start spamming W>aa on him. You can get a kill by level 3 if he tries to CS. \n\nAfter that, good luck to you. He'll push you under turret and dive at 6. I usually drop a pink ward behind my turret so I can shunpo out when he dives as I try to CS.\n\nYour only real strategy here is to get as much CS as possible before 6 and shove him under turret so he gets as little as possible. If you're ahead and you're going to stay in lane, go for Negatron > Cutlass > Abyssal > Gunblade. A corruption potion is also worth the gold since he'll force you to chug pots or leave lane. 18/0/12 masteries here, and don't skip runic shield.\n\nYour other option is to rush Abyssal > Swift boots and try to be a roaming support until Kass overextends and you can gank him with your jungler. Mostly what you're trying to do is push the fuck out of top or bot to get other laners to rotate mid with you. If you have no intention of staying in lane to feed the Kass, you can go 12/18/0 to maximize your gank burst.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsStout","date":"2015-11-20T14:29:17.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin is a Katarina counter.\n\n:p","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2015-11-20T13:06:46.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i read very intelligent answer in this topic","replies":[]},{"poster":"t0ad5","date":"2015-11-19T15:30:56.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are supposed to be playing Yasuo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-11-18T22:29:59.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you lube yourself up and pray","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-19T00:15:58.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kat still suffers the same way every AP champion did back in S2 and S3.
