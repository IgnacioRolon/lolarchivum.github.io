The game, which is ranked game, was not going well and he used Devour on me and probably on allies after which he threw me/allies into the enemies. \n\nIts nice in normal games between friends but when we play competetive game and things are not going well this get worst and helps enemies win the game\n\nEver since this champ came out i knew this was going to happen - an ability that can be used on allies for negative purpose. Something about Kench&#039;s Devourer should be done otherwise people would still continue to use Devourer for negative purpose\n\nFor instance I should be able to have much greater control when Ally Kench use Devourer on me. Like lets say I can exit Devour after 0.5 seconds in my desired direction where he wont be able to do it for 2 seconds\n\n\nhere's the problem\n>After 1 second, Devour can be recast into Regurgitate Regurgitate while Tahm Kench's belly is full. \n>Allied champions can exit at will **AFTER THE SAME DELAY.**","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-08-12T20:40:05.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know you can right click away from Tahm to exit his belly yourself?","replies":[{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2018-08-12T20:43:24.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FurorDivinus27,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=knEttavM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-08-12T20:40:05.624+0000)\n>\n> You know you can right click away from Tahm to exit his belly yourself?\n\nI know but I was already spit out toward enemy direction before i was able to do anything","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-08-12T21:15:17.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spam right click and 90% of the time you will take priority.","replies":[{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2018-08-12T21:16:38.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Super Cow Swag,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=knEttavM,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-12T21:15:17.502+0000)\n>\n> Spam right click and 90% of the time you will take priority.\n\nBecause Kench cant do the same?
