And thats really strange thing that i cannot understand well. If they go armor they counter Blade and now for me its a wonder item like should i even get it. \r\n\r\nWorst thing about it is that Cutlass also got way more expansive for what it gives. Vamp Sc. 900 gold + long sword 350 = 1250 gold. Where does other 400 gold go into? the baby slow and baby damage? Thats way overpriced man! it should stay 1400 gold for entire cutlass as you dont get any more stats. When you build zeal or bf sword you get way better stats than building Cutlass \r\n\r\nNot to mention that cowsep now goes wierd ap yi on hit build. That be nice if Alpha get no damage from AP and for some reason it works. He even said that he doesnt wanna build blade anymore cause its more expansive and got nerfed","replies":[{"poster":"Korillo","date":"2015-11-19T21:24:45.281+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"They ruined it","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-19T21:34:26.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you did there...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MilfHuntUnitXJ9","date":"2015-11-19T21:23:45.615+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"% health damage was always designed for taking down tanks.

You are trying way to hard to proof nothing at all, if anything you are the one who needs a tissue here. If you want to get BotRK go ahead, no one is stopping you but ADCs can just build something else that will get them better sustain and/or damage anyways so tell me once again how is BotRK in a good spot right now?","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-20T01:39:32.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Okay, fine, let's talk other champs.\n\n* Jungles got sated, which put bork into overdrive, thus motivating an eventual nerf.

Sorry to break your bubble but there is little reason to ever pick BotRK over the many better options that are available in the game right now. But that's fine the item is still useful for sated junglers right!?

And if it worked before on Yi, it's probably a good thing it doesn't now.\n\nThe reason for the nerf to the bork passive is to balance out everything ELSE added over the past couple of months that basically puts bork on steroids.\n\n* The sated passive\n* Runaan's being good on every other adc now\n* Kog with attack speed that blots out the sun\n* On-hit hybrid champs getting a little more love\n\nBork was fine until these changes, but was due for a nerf the MOMENT Riot changed devourer's. But if Riot nerfed it then, it would have hit too many non-jungle champs reliant on bork at a time when none of them had additional steroids that balanced it out. Choosing to nerf it in the adc/sustain patch was excellent timing. After that patch, EVERY bork toter had the synergies to compensate for a bork nerf, instead of just a few champs. Most people shunning bork now don't seem to get this. It's actually as excellent a dps item as it was a few months ago.\n\nMaybe not for EVERY scenario. But if the mixture of nerfed stats with boosted synergies has now turned bork into a niche tank-busting item, well then... GOOD! That's what it was SUPPOSE TO BE FOR ALL ALONG! The whole point of these changes is to add some serious tradeoffs between different champ/item choices, rather than have a bunch of ubiquitously effective picks and builds that are spammed to the point of monotony. Bork was one of those items. Ever seen a zed rush a bork against every squishy mage in the game? I have... on every Zed I've ever seen. What's wrong with this picture?\n\nRiot is trying to address a long-standing problem that, in trying to add one item/champ/mechanic for one specific purpose, they tend to make things that are either a) not really useful for that or any other purpose or b) useful for that as well as all OTHER purposes. This was never a good thing. Riot's finally finding a route to reaching some of their longstanding game-mechanic goals. Balancing these items in isolation to recorrect their course has never really worked. Riot's new approach of COMBINING changes over MULTIPLE items/champs/mechanics to tackle specific problems of specific items is actually working rather neatly (still hate that SR games now end at half builds though.)","replies":[]}]}
