And if you do change it \nall game massage will appear:\n>Summoner (Champion) has changes X spell with Smite\n\nif you used one of your Summoner Spell you may no longer able to change any spell to smite\nAnd again this is applied only for the jungler. If you are top laner you are not able to change your Summoners at all\n\nThere is 90% chance that you will lose the game if you forgot to get smite. This gives the opponents major advantage of the game. And the worst of all you cannot remake if this happens which also leads to negative experience for your team","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2016-11-28T01:26:33.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But how will it determined who is the jungler? What if people trade roles in champ select? \n\nThis idea is terrible and it is 100% the player's responsibility to make sure they have the right spells under all circumstances. If you're queuing up as jungler, the first thing you should do in champ select is change your summoner to smite. Then this wouldn't be an issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-27T22:35:34.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Solution: jungler needs to learn to play the game.\nNo need for bandaid fixes for bad players.","replies":[]}]}
