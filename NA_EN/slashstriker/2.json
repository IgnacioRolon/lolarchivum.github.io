I think we should see how the new tanks items would feel like when released and then if necessary nerf armor penetration and anti-health items if its required","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-10T23:08:49.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will be broken, riot will fix it.
