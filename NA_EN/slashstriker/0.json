It's kind of annoying when you know it's been a few minutes since the inhib died but can't go look over at it and get that visual indicator of roughly how long it'll respawn. That's been out of the game for like 4 or 5 patches, I would say the circle only appears like 5% of the time now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-10-11T00:12:24.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Despite it being a bug.
