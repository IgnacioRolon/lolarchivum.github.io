But other trees offer too much utility and less any damage boosting stats\n\n---\n\n**Sorcery**\nAerie (damage), Comet (damage) - Hard choice here. So basically I have to choose between damage or damage? What&#039;s the difference here? Put one of those on another rune tier so I can have both. Like I said &ndash; I want damage\nIf Aerie benefits shields why isn&#039;t it Inspiration Rune? Seems more focused toward Supports\n\n**Orb (Shield), Manaflow (Mana refund), Ultimate (CDR)** - what if I am Katarina? Where&#039;s my damage option? What should i choose? I want to deal damage, not be defensive with orbs and stuff\n\n**Celerity (move speed)** - It seems that only Hecarim will benefit from it\n**Scorch** needs some scalings\n\n---\n\n**Domination **\nSeems too much focused on Healing and barely gives any damage\n**Hunters: Ravenous, Ingenious, Relentless** &ndash; Non of these gives me damage and I would have hard time choosing any of those as damage dealer\n**Eyeball Rune** seems weak\n\n---\n\n**Resolve**\n**Grasp of undying** &ndash; This ability should heal more and damage less because it&#039;s what tanks want. They want to survive and be durable. So what&#039;s the reason you give Tanks more damage and less healing?\n\n**Conditioning** &ndash; after 10 minutes you gain armor and MR. I literally have no defense before 10 minute mark. What&#039;s the problem having 6 armor and magic resistance at the start of the game and after 10 minutes to get additional 10% armor and magic resistance? I am tank right?\n\n**Iron skin / Mirror Shell** &ndash; 3 armor / MR seems barely beneficial. With Lane Swaps those choices become useless\nSo basically we lose 9 armor to gain 3 armor or magic resistance? Was 9 armor/MR the biggest issue in the league? Do you want tanks to have defenses early game or not? Rito make up your mind\n\n---\n\n**Inspiration **\nI personally don&#039;t like how support role works in the league so I don&#039;t care much about it. But the only issue here is that you get no more passive gold regeneration. Supports would be pretty upset because you removed **Bandit** mastery and I think you should keep it as new rune. I would definitely prefer **Bandit** mastery over **Dept Rune**","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-26T21:31:20.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ONLY thing I agree with you on is scorch.

All 3 of those give no damage\n\nIn Domination \nHunters: Ravenous, Ingenious, Relentless - no damage\nDomination is a bit too much vampirism\n\nUnderstand? There are group of runes that give no damage. Each group tier should offer at least 1 damage option","replies":[{"poster":"Hong Kong Revolt","date":"2017-09-27T15:21:10.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ability to reach a target and a shorter ult CD are more important than flat damage nearly every time though.
