It is almost laughable to think they were any more durable than the previous iterations.  If anything they are less durable especially with the meta around some ranged champions like Jhin and Cait who will hard peck at them regardless of minions or general turret fire distraction.\n\nI personally thought the **~~ARMOR~~** was supposed to be a second skin that gave gold per 1000 health notch before you could take down its actual health.  You know because when you read **_\"(Plates don't have health of their own.)\"_**, you tend to think they are meant to keep the main health of the turret untouched until destroyed.\n\nApparently, Riot games thinks a hand held shield/bullet proof vest/plate is actually representative of your body so if it gets destroyed so does your life.  Armor either mitigates/minimizes damage or completely absorbs damage, but in this case it does neither and appears to be the actual health pool of the turret.\n\nYes, I know it is not supposed to change the dynamics of the game and yet still reward aggressive play (which is a dynamic)...but there is no noticeable difference between this turret, previous turrets, and the behavior of players who bully.  Apart from getting gold now.\n\nThe armor is pointless, you could have just made a patch that awards gold per 1000 health damage on turrets before the 14 minute mark and completely drop this \"Armor\" garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2018-11-27T18:49:32.651+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"The outer turrets have 2000 more health and more armor/MR than before.

If you&#x27;re constantly pushed under turret, you&#x27;re likely being denied CS; so, your enemy is already gaining a gold lead so long as they know how to freeze the lane at the correct spots.\n\nThere are two sides to everything, before pushing up to the tower but being unable to take it was just risky due to jungle exposure, now people have a proper motivation to push which makes it easier for the jungle to abuse them.\n\nBut people will do it exactly because its rewarding, which promotes action rather than a stale party where both sides just farm and are too scared to ever fight and the greatest goal is to freeze a wave before your own tower. \n\n> 2. If you&#x27;re trying to play safe under turret, it&#x27;s likely the result of having died once or twice to the enemy, providing them with a gold and xp advantage through kills, farming, and likely one or more turret plates during the time you spent dead.\n\nBefore last i checked if you went and died at a even slightly bad time the tower went down from full health right away from the followup push, now it takes screwing up royally to have that happen before the plating falls. \n\n\n> 3.

Yes, the turret plating destroyed is shared, but a jungle that takes advantage of as many turret plates as possible will place themselves AND their lanes ahead of their respective opponents, placing enemy laners AND the enemy jungle behind.\n\nYour view of this is shallow.\n\nLike if a jungler sits in a lane to help them push then they will fall behind in EXP unless they can actually manage to take any towerplating, whats more they will have to share farm between 2-3 people where it wasnt intended creating a gold shortage.\n\nBut early on its easy for the defending side to sit under tower and take any fights they want, people can only survive 3 towershots at most which makes it hella risky to forcefully push a defended tower, one bad move and the aggressors will die and the defenders will come out ahead. \n\nIts still the case that the most favorable thing is to is farm normally then help laners push if you succeed in ganking some place to try and get the first tower, just as before.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-11-28T21:49:59.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The turrets are in beta, they only have the PBE information. However, I found that snowballing is not as worse as it uses to be. Tbh, it has helped a lot. \n\nAs for the bounty system, any more gold added to the max bounty will make comebacks way too strong. Plus, Cs is now counted with the bounty. Making bounties extremely strong.\n\nYour first comment is allegations, you also forgetting proof. Most of the high elo players have yet to complain and the same goes for lower elo. Secondly, just because you have a Gold lead, does not mean you automatically win. The older outer turrets gave global gold when they died (500 G) which is 2500 gold for the whole team, now it gives about (250 Gold) which is about 1250 gold, correct me if I am wrong. The plating gives split gold to the allies that break a plating, not full gold. \n\nIf my math is correct, if you brake all five plates on all turrets you will at least be given 2900 gold for the whole team, correct me if I am wrong. The chances of you getting all three turrets striped before 14 minutes are, very, unlikely. Then you have to add the enemy turret plating gold. Which will make the 2900 gold lead imposable to reach.\n\nSo tell me, again, how do the new turrets make one team snowball better than the other?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Press Q Win","date":"2018-11-27T17:28:09.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Tower give too much gold right now, wich indeed cause snowball but another problem is that after plating fall off, the tower have no more resistance and are made of wet paper..
