They take the chance of every end of the year where rank doesn't matter and make it a giant testing ground as Meddler says\n>The changes in the preseason are all pretty heavily intertwined. Some things can't be broken down into smaller chunks. Doing just a couple of new items at a time won't work without the appropriate adjustments to the rest of the item system for example, since the new ones will be either too good or too weak if they're not in sync with the overall system. Additionally many components are heavily dependent on others. Marksmen kit updates for example are dependent on overhauling AD itemization and vice versa for example - the new items were developed with the updated kits in mind, and those kits were developed within a context of improved AD itemization. Things like Masteries could have been separated out, but that then means going through a period of significant disruption, balancing the game after those changes and then doing the same thing again shortly after. There's a limited window we've got where we're not impacting ranked or pro play, so getting stuff in right at the start of that and then taking as much time as available to improve's really valuable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"OldDirtay","date":"2015-11-11T21:00:03.607+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":9,"body":"i just dont get why they changed literally every aspect of the game, least my opinion for a worse version\n\nstill going on 5-6 years and there is still no solution to afks or intentional feeders/trolls\n\nbut this season alone they could changed pretty much every champ, rework a bunch of them, go over stats for everything from jungle to minion to turrets, revamp a bunch of items, remove item, and add items\n\nwhile not touching afks etc which is peoples main problem....it just boggles my mind....\n\nalmost as much as riot axes and meddler in the post about the 4v5 and minions having more power for the team w/o afk.....what got me was when he said this was a comeback buff....how does giving their minions more damage give you a comeback buff exactly?\n\nriot just legit boggles my mind...on top of the fact they always use isn't instead of is...example\nit isn't our intention to just nerf all mages...but then they proceed to buff mr, tone down armor, buff ad, hike up the costs on ap items, bring down ap items power, nerf mana regen\n\nit may have not been their intention, but they nerfed it in every aspect you possibly can\n\nriot just makes me sad, oh well, time to find a new game till they come to their senses but lets be real.\ni dont see that ever...ever....in the history of their updates....ever happening\n\noh well, fun while it lasted","replies":[]},{"poster":"MAN OF INTELLECT","date":"2015-11-12T04:51:41.204+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am excited to see the new champ select for the preseason.
