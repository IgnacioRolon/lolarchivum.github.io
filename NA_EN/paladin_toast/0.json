I'm slowly getting his mechanics down and how to play team fights and what not, but in my elo people don't really just last hit minions. They constantly push. I've read some post saying only go in for last hits when they do so they have to choose between cs and harass, but if I did that, I'd be under tower because they are killing my minions faster than I can last hit theirs. Most mages just use abilities to shove lane and still manange to harass me. Granted, I can still win lane because I know how to trade and harass back, but my farm isn't usually that good. I can only get to around 100 cs by 20 mins compared to about 130-40 when I'm going ADC. \r\n\r\nIs it worth taking a harass and going through all my pots just to keep up in CS if I have to spend that gold on more pots?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-03-30T05:20:42.478+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Must be trolling, Zed has one of the easiest last hit in the entire game because of his Passive as well as his E-sweep that may or may not be used with W and Q (most effect if you use 3 at the same time, instant waveclear). Pretty much outside of his ulti, the rest of his kit are incredibly good for last hitting.","replies":[{"poster":"GrandTheiftAuto5","date":"2019-07-22T23:15:20.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That combo isnt neccesarily instant wave clear.

Im currently Mastery 6 zed, 2 mastery 7 tokens racing to get the last as fast as possible. I usually find myself with a score of 5+kills/2-3 deaths/3+assists, and only ~100 cs. So im racing myself to get 200 cs before the game ends, which is a struggle because all of my teamates want to just end the game. I don't know how to improve on this... I get a lot of cs early game and ive been hitting 100 cs at around 20 minutes. I just don't understand how people get 100 cs by 10 minutes, especially on zed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iiRebs","date":"2018-04-01T05:56:30.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Set up minions so they can crash into your tower. In other words, make sure casters are at full health and melees are at a little more than half or full horizontally.\n\nYour minion wave doesn't have to be pushed. It is perfectly fine even for their wave to hit your tower. However, you generally want to freeze the wave for the early game until you can roam or if you you get a kill. In either case use abilities to clear minion waves, making sure to crash it to their towers. \n\nAlso, your Q can be used in two ways. Trade with it when you get harassed for walking up to CS, always throw after killing the minion so it hits only the other laner. You can also use it to finish off the creep. Sometimes you may be able to align it with the other player for some additional damage. It depends a lot on the match up.  Use the first option if the enemy is staying closer to the casters and the second option when they are closer to melees as a basic Idea.\n\nWEQ combo is also amazing for trading against an enemy harassing you. \n\nAlso prioritize dodging and trading when they are on CD.\n\nRefillable pots are also extremely useful for laning against poke heavy champions.\n\nWave management in general is also very big in mid lane. You will lose lots of CS, exp, and possibly tower by roaming at the wrong time. Make sure you are crashing a wave in to their tower before you roam, don't just follow their roam either. Sometimes it better to stay and CS. If the other lane doesn't consider your pings, there is not much else to do. I would recommend you watch LL Stylish's laning phase and how he roams and plays certain match ups. \n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg sadly.\n\nAs for teamfighting, there is a lot to consider. For starters, know the combo you want to use and how you plan to execute it before you go in. For example, say I want to outplay from low hp in the jungle. Before I do anything, I come up with my plan. For this instance, you have the ability to w over a wall, ult the squishy, take your w, e, triple q, ult back, aa, ignite, the squishy. Now, you start to do your plan and adapt for any contingencies. Perhaps one of their teammates comes to them. Instead of taking your ult back, you may have to give up on the kill and run away, perhaps blowing flash in the process. Things happen. Be prepared to adapt. \n\nSecondly, keep their team comp in mind. There are some major abilities you have to keep in mind, any stun, snare, etc. By waiting for these abilities you can start to worry about just eliminating the enemy team. Also keep in mind your ult is very useful for helping you dodge stuns. \n\nAdditionally, prioritize killable targets. I.e. you have a 6/0 Darius and and 4/1 ezreal on the enemy team. I would never ult the Darius because I can't kill him, the Ezreal is a compl at telly different story though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zethro","date":"2018-03-30T05:23:07.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a silver 3 (not very credible), my answer would be sometimes you cannot get all of the cs. Obviously, just google \"Faker Zed\" for gameplays on how he lanes. But if you want it from me, matchups dictate who gets the cs.\n\nI don't know if you have heard it, but there is a term commonly used called \"lane priority.\" lane priority is basically who can clear their lane and roam elsewhere first. For example, a xerath can clear mid and roam easier than an alistar can, so if there is a fight bottom then xerath would be able to get roaming first, without losing any cs.\n\nlaning priority only exists because one champion has more access to the minions than his opponent. This is usually because if the opponent walks up, he would get punished heavily with a bad trade. As you can see, one champion having a chokehold on a lane is a common trait when examining matchups. \n\nin the end, sometimes you are the zed and the enemy is the cassiopiea who q's you whenever you attack a minion. You still have options, though. The first would be to consider a different champion next time. if not, you can roam and forfeit a wave. Or you can stay in the lane and focus on qing the enemy, which would also forfeit potential cs (you are hoping for an all in oppurtunity come lvl 6).\n\nthese options apply top all losing match ups. In zeds case, they usually q minions and let the cs advantage go to the opposing mid laner, then try for an all in level 6 or roam at level 6. I would suggest trying to time a back lvl 5 so that you can give your all once u hit that lat minion to level up. \n\nHowever, I havent watched faker play zed in a wwhile, so I wouldnt know.\n\nGood luck {{champion:142}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"OatheSworn","date":"2018-03-30T05:12:50.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I usually do against a poke champion like Ahri or Syndra is dodge around until the minion is low (not low enough to kill yet) and act like I'm going in for it, dodge back or side at the last second and dodge their ability then turn around and take the cs. It usually works but it's all about timing and reaction.\n\nIf they have a click on CC like Ryze, then it's better to farm with your Q and then chunk his health down every time you get your shadow. Remember that after you use your shadow you are vulnerable so back off after that and farm using shurikens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thefourtysn","date":"2018-03-30T04:30:33.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very small request for a large answer. It depends on the match up, and for Zed if you're getting zoned out from the cs, you'll want to basically just use your abilities to take the cs. You'll most likely don't just wanna walk up and take the cs, make sure you had your abilities to trade if you're gonna go up to cs. The goal for the mage is to play safe, and get the stopwatch early on, so try to harass them down for that because they've already used a ability so take advantage of it.
