This means the criteria which we use to select testers for each system is a bit different.\n\nWe cannot manually review PBE applications, but I definitely recommend you continue to actively play League and be a positive force in the community while you wait to hear back on your application. Check out our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) for more details about the system.
