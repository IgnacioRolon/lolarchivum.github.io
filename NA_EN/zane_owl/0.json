After they were done I closed my client since of course it lost connection and attempted to relog. Next thing I know I receive a log in error stating my account has been transferred to Latin America although I clearly did not request for a server transfer. This is extremely upsetting because I have invested a lot into my main account and am about to reach my decay of banked games in Masters and this restricts me from playing on my original account. Now it only allows me to log into Latin America under the name as Cloud Horizon which email does not align with the email set for my main account. I hope this post gets their immediate attention as I'm sure my ticket may not get through intime. My hope is that they can fix this ASAP and if not, at least rectify my standing as Masters if I get decayed as a result of something that was not my fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-21T03:51:55.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already submitted a support ticket, I recommend waiting for an account specialist to get back to you.
