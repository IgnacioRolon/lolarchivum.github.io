My main email associated with my league of legends account has been hacked and I am unable to recover it from microsoft because there is no support number I can call. I just want to be able to at least change the password to my account. I would really appreciate a reply because I have been playing on this account since season 2. I have spent a lot of money in rp on my account and I dont like having it be compromised by hackers. I have screenshots in my ticket and more details. Thank you.\r\n\r\nTicket number #23395386","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T23:29:29.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at this and it looks like you received a reply from an account specialist not too long ago.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
