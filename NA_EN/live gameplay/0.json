With the World Championships coming up, our focus for the *next few patches* will be aimed at competitive play - both in increasing the diversity of picks and hitting those outliers who beat down all meaningful choice in champ select.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder: **these are not promises for what will be in Patch 4.12, rather, they're a forecast of what we are currently working on and the problems we see**.\r\n\r\nONWARD!\r\n\r\n**Ahri:** Ahri's a cool fox gal that we'd like to see more of, but she's currently sitting just below the top-tier mid picks. We're investigating ways to make Ahri feel better to play without just tipping her into the perma-pick category (hello S3 worlds).\r\n\r\n**Alistar:** OH BOY. We really want to bring Alistar back up as a support, but our big challenge is to make sure he doesn't also become an insane jungling cow god, because that gets obnoxious. Access to what's essentially a mini-Malphite ult at level 2, combined with powerful tower dives and displacement makes for a worrisome combination that keeps us up at night. Worrying.\r\n\r\n**Kassadin:** This guy. Man.\r\n\r\n**Lucian:** Like we mentioned in the 4.11 patch notes, Lucian is still strong and his super well-rounded nature makes him less of a strategic pick and more of a must-pick. We're really exploring ways to give Lucian meaningful weaknesses while also highlighting some of his core strengths. At this point we probably can't bring along *all* of his advantages, but we're looking to maintain Lucian's mobility / burst while also highlighting his spellslinger archetype. You'll see more as we go!\r\n\r\n**Them aggro junglers:** Depending on who you talk to, there are roughly 3-5 competitive junglers in the 'very strong' category who are outshining entire categories of dudes (see tanky jungler buffs). That said, we're balancing our approach here to make sure we don't just hit one so the others become default picks, but this gang has such high early aggression that they're still inhibitive in the game. **Chances are high we won't have anything for these in 4.12** as we're still watching how the 4.11 jungle item changes have affected the scene, but we have a strong inkling that these dudes will still be around.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUp today we've got **Riot Hongyou** from the Live Gameplay team to answer some of your questions / comments on the forecast.","replies":[{"poster":"0178576592","date":"2014-07-04T02:11:47.375+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":6,"body":"Why are we so apprehensive to nerf leesin even the slightest bit?

Perhaps even also decreased by 1 second per minion hit?  This incentivizes aggressive play, decreases the power and frustration of fighting against Riftwalk in no minion areas, gives a window for players to respond in teamfights, gives an opportunity for {{champion:38}} to make a high risk play, and (maybe?) still keeps his identity. \n\nWe've done something similar with {{champion:79}} when his E was on a low cooldown, and I'm wondering if a similar approach could work here.\n\nEdit: Just for context, I'm not on the design team.

Even if hitting champions lowers it's cooldown, it's still basically a Flash that is on a FAR lower cooldown than your Flash summoner spell...on top of the Flash spell he might just get for the hell of it anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamfail","date":"2014-07-04T18:08:46.907+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree that giving CD reduction dependent on hitting minions could cause the {{champion:38}} vs. immobile champions matchup to be fairly lopsided.  If we take the minion option away, and keep a CD reduction based on hitting champions (perhaps decreased by 3 seconds per champion hit with a base of 10 seconds), would the function of Riftwalk during the laning phase stay essentially the same?\n\nIf it does, is the effect on gameplay for teamfights and midgame roaming an overall net plus for the health of the game?\n\nFor these changes to be successful, I think this is all dependent on whether making the core identity of {{champion:38}} conditional (i.e. effectiveness based on hitting other champions with the ability) still keeps his identity intact, which I feel is the first question to answer before we can even consider making Riftwalk's CD conditional.  \n\nPerhaps defining the word \"identity\" is the first step, which seems somewhat challenging since it may not be something you can really objectively define.  If defining the word \"identity\" is impossible, I'm all for discussing whether conditional CD reduction is the right way to go for making Kassadin's gameplay healthier :)","replies":[{"poster":"thunderingice","date":"2014-07-04T18:29:23.530+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I personally think that Kassidin will always be a bit of a problem so long as his identity is low cd flash with B levels of burst (admittedly lower than before the rework).  Most of the jumps in this game have a high cd for a reason.  See ez, Liss, corki, not lee sin who is also a problem, cait (on the line), graves, leona, thresh, sej etc.  Many of the champs with long cd jumps have been issues and will be again but are a lot easier to bring in line.  Ppl with low cd/easily accessible repeated jumps become a lot hard to find the line of \"balanced\" on.  See lb, lee sin, kha, akali, yi, renektons double dash, rengo, shaco (tho he has other design issues as well), yas etc.\n\nKassadin will probably always be a balancing nightmare so long as his identity is really low cd flash without meaningful limiters.  I think instead you should go ahead and redefine his flash to give it more identity.  For instance, you could give it more damage or length or some other type of compensation (bonus points if it feels good and is interesting) while never allowing his flash cd below 10-12 seconds even at max level.  As an example, Liss is probably the person with the most healthy flash in the game imo as it allows interesting options to people on both sides of the interaction.\n\nThis will change his identity without question.  But I think it will be a healthy change and one that most people should appreciate if you add an interesting enough/rewarding enough mechanic to replace the ridiculously low cd.  \n\nMy two cents.  Hope it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamfail","date":"2014-07-04T21:23:41.980+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"Just want to put this here cause I ninja edited it into one of my other posts.  I'm not on the design team, and I'm just curious about how to make Kassadin better from a player's perspective.\n\nI think there is acknowledgement across many people that low CD flash is a problem, which then causes him to be a \"balancing nightmare\".  Low CD flash may also be a bad idea for various reasons.  However, if Kassadin's identity is so deep rooted into player's minds that having this low CD flash is one of the things that we absolutely cannot change due to how much it would damage players' enjoyment of the champion, what can we do to alleviate the risks and downfalls of having a champion with a low CD flash?\n\nCurrently, I think it would be interesting to see what problems arise when Kassadin is given the earlier change I mentioned (10 second base with 3 seconds decreased per champion hit).  My hope is that the laning phase would stay the same, and we get the benefit of nerfing Riftwalk in situations where there are no minions.  \n\nThat nerf could be a successful (successful here meaning we can reduce Kassadin's power, while keeping his identity intact) nerf IF the changes that happen to midgame laning and teamfights are also successful (successful here meaning that there are more interesting gameplay situations that result and also that there are no degenerate gameplay loops that pop up with Kassadin as a result).  This seems like something that would be worth testing on PBE than trying to theorycraft it all out.\n\nYou mentioned redefining his flash and giving it more identity, which seems like something worth exploring, but I'm not sure I accurately understand what you're trying to communicate here.  What type of compensation were you thinking that would give flash more identity?","replies":[{"poster":"steng4h","date":"2014-07-05T15:24:25.924+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"The recent changes that have been applied to of his kit are pretty bad overall.

Anyone have any idea why I can't reply to that post?  Both on Chrome and Firefox.\n\nIn regards to the post, I think this is a good example of how setting solid goals before making changes allows you to be confident that your proposed changes are doing what you'd like them to.  The mobile assassin anti-mage is the set of constraints that you've set for this kit, and it *seems* like these changes still fall within those constraints.  \n\nThe mage version of Riposte seems like it would be a fun ability, but I wonder whether it carries any negative gameplay elements that spell shield type abilities bring but we just haven't identified yet.  Is punishing a player (dealing damage to him) for doing what we've taught him to do (attack / cast spells) a bad thing?  I feel that it's possible that Riposte and a spell version of Riposte could be considered bad design, but I don't have the subject matter expertise to confidently say one way or the other.\n\nIn regards to the mark type gameplay, I'm a fan of the mark type interactions that force you to weave in autoattacks to optimize (Riven Q, Lux passive, Lee Sin passive) because of how it punishes impatience.  Seems fun.\n\nOf course, there are always tons of things that don't work out in practice, despite it looking good on paper.  I feel that this would be a good iteration to test on PBE to see how much it really affects all aspects of the game, instead of trying to theorycraft all the possibilities.\n\nThe constraints I set in my proposed change were trying to solve a specific goal and were much less risky.  I think your changes were much more successful but risky for fixing his gameplay in one fell swoop.  I wonder which approach should be taken in which types of scenarios.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-07-04T02:25:29.512+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":6,"body":"But what if his identity is the cause of his problems?

Some things in this game, although they are definitely mechanics or thematics, are just inherently powerful because of the lack of access other champions have to increase their power in those areas. Mobility and range are the most important ones, and we have champions that exemplify both of these as a character trait (Kassadin and Caitlyn) and are exceedingly powerful because of it. Even so, Caitlyn doesn't have unlimited range like Kassadin's near unlimited mobility and tends to be easier to balance because of that.\n\n*The problem with range and mobility is that you cannot itemize your existing champion to increase these, but there are champions that are inherently more powerful in these areas while still having access to the same items that every other champion has.* This makes them inherently more powerful because there is literally no counterplay to range or mobility. In the way this game works if you are being attacked beyond the range of your own abilities or auto attacks you cannot fight back, and you cannot fight someone who cannot be caught unless they want to. Kassadin could tickle for damage, but with the mobility that he has he will always be a threat because you cannot stop him from tickling you. Caitlyn's massive attack range has seen her be a viable pick since her release, because she can literally just out range almost anyone except a level 18 Tristana.\n\nThe single problem is that other champions cannot itemize in these areas. You cannot buy blink boots or range extenders, and so the champions that are stronger in those areas while still having access to everything the other champions have access to will simply be conceptually broken. I would like to hear what other people have to say about my post (and especially Riot), so please reply with your thoughts on the matter!","replies":[{"poster":"Hongyou","date":"2014-07-04T04:06:32.047+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"There have been iterations of Kassadin where he did no damage and was not a threat. Because of how powerful mobility is, history of Kassadin has shown that he is either overwhelming or underwhelming. But this difference in power was not due to changes in his mobility but related to changes in the other aspects of his kit. Therefore we believe there can be a point between A (OP) and B(underwhelming) that is tunable by changing these levers instead.","replies":[{"poster":"DrawnActor","date":"2014-07-04T04:09:03.231+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"The reason that a Kassadin with no damage wouldn't be a threat is because if you can't actually lower someone's health bar then you obviously wont be able to impact the game. However, the issue is that if you want to balance excessive mobility, that's the route you have to take. \n\nMobility is so inherently powerful that giving any power to the rest of his kit (burst, cc, utility) will be overkill in combination. An untouchable burst caster that can never be stopped from bursting the enemy is conceptually broken, but so would an untouchable cc bot or whatever else you could add to his kit. The other problem with excessive mobility or range is that it's incredibly fun to use, but incredibly frustrating to play against. Have you ever had the experience where you're right about to kill someone but they escape with a flash, Nidalee pounce, or Kassadin riftwalk (even repeatedly, in the case of the last two)? It's almost painful. \n\nKeeping Kassadin's excessive mobility in his kit means the rest of his abilities have to be incredibly lack luster to make up for it. It creates a character that is very one dimensional and lopsided, with abilities that wont feel good to use (in the case of a fully balanced character). Curtailing the excessive mobility in his kit means you can make his other abilities much more powerful and meaningful, in other words, create a healthier champion, kit, and gameplay style.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HarrysManor","date":"2014-07-04T17:54:57.972+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if {{champion:38}} cannot cast rift walk if he has taken damage with in the last couple of seconds.

If you hit 40 minutes with Lee Sin, you'll be painfully weaker than Wukong, for example. So you're facing a dillemma where nerfing these champions based on competitive means screwing people across all other levels of play since they *aren't* strictly OP, and if you choose to shift their power curves, you'll homogenize an entire class of champions.

We are currently looking to change Lee Sin in a way where he would still fulfill the role of the early powerful jungler while having a noticeable weakness in the late game.

AD could be pretty easy to touch (people said that Lee doesn't AA, so AS won't help him. if that was true, then base AD should also not matter except for a slightly slower jungle clear speed). Hitting MS would do a lot.\n\nI also think that the buff that Riot wanted to give to his passive would have been a good way to make Lee more balanced.

The Q CD is not really high and the dmg and possible mobility are also super strong. So even as a skill shot, it is super, super powerful. His W is a 40-200 HP shield, what isn't that much in the first place, but it can hit 2 targets, what makes it 400 and it is only one part of the skill.

In fact, why do you guys seem to throw a fit every time a Cleric does well in any lane other than bot-support, but when a tank intended for top or a mage intended for mid comes down to bot-support, it's \"role diversity\"?  As someone who enjoys playing Clerics, this attitude kind of offends me.  Sure, *I* like playing them bot-support, but what is wrong with them in other positions?  Especially when you seem to encourage all the other roles to mix it up with their positioning.\n\nBy the by, here's a freebie for your Cleric Pigeonholing Initiative: Lulu's E (Help! Pix!) can't target allied minions.  Bam, no more silly Glitterlance trickshot for top and mid Lulu, and bot-support Lulu never has to worry about hitting a minion with her shield instead of an actual ally.","replies":[{"poster":"Fox Gnome","date":"2014-07-04T23:08:44.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^^This.

I am Diamond 1. I have the most Cassio games in North America. I have literally thousands of games with her. I rarely lose lane with her and she doesn't need buffs. She needs QoL changes like I said - changes that make her less punishing and risky to play without increasing her overall power.\n\nFor example, lowering the general CD of Twin Fang isn't really a buff (I mean it technically is but it isn't increasing her power) since if you're playing Cassio well you won't mess up TF's CD. 5 seconds of no damage though is HUGE and a big reason why she isn't played in competitive play. She's insanely punished if she messes up her Twin Fang spam and in today's League where every other champion has multiple mobility spells I think 5 seconds is a little ridiculous. This is especially apparent to me when champions like Syndra, Ziggs, and Orianna exist who bring a lot of damage AND utility while outranging Cassio. \n\n\nWill lowering the CD of her Twin Fang break her and make her OP?

It's only a 700 range spell that does 190+.55 AP at max rank and it costs 90 mana. Cass's Q poke is less expensive and more damaging as it is.\n\nThose three champions are the only \"immobile\" mid laners that are picked in competitive play. Orianna and Syndra aren't ridiculous either in my opinion. Both are strong picks and excel at what they are designed to do. They aren't overbearing and have clear strengths and weaknesses. I would argue that Ziggs is too strong because he has safety, damage, waveclear, utility, and more in his kit, but Riot is on top of him. \n\nI didn't try to make Cass sound weak. I even said she doesn't need buffs. She needs QoL changes similar to what Syndra had that makes her the lightest bit less risky to pick so it is worthwhile for professional players to pick her up and she can fulfill her niche of being a source of constant magical DPS. Right now, why should a pro pick her when they can pick Ryze or Karthus? All she has over them is a stronger lane and she can't even abuse that in competitive play where mid laners are forced to farm out of fear of jungler interference. \n\nEDIT: Higher up on this page, somebody suggested a charge based Twin Fang (max 3 charges) that refreshes a charge upon hitting a poisoned target and upping the base CD of Twin Fang. This sounds pretty cool. Just saying. :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
