I was playing jinx, level 1 my support doesn&#039;t come to lane til level 3, when she does come to lane she dies immediately so now we&#039;re fucked, mid lane isn&#039;t doing too well, so at this point enemy Fizz is decently ahead and Hecarim isn&#039;t doing too shabby, and top lane is going even, we have fiora they have malphite, noticing the team comp and noticing Fizz a little ahead, I try to safely farm at tower, team flames me for playing too safe, so I decide to group up with the team against my gut(return some flame in the process), in team fights as you can see as long as my flash is down I&#039;ll die, even if it is up I&#039;ll die, so we lose I go 2-9-3, the next day I get banned for intentional feeding, lmao. So moral of the story, if you get autofilled just dodge or you get banned for intentional feeding. Have fun on the rift :).\n\nPS I didn't get banned I got a suspension.\n\n\nReform Card below\nhttps://i.imgur.com/yn8reqH.jpg?1","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-08-25T00:49:37.062+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Post a pic of the reform card please.

She also hit level 2 before you. Perhaps you are remembering a different game.\n\nYou had two big spots of extended inactivity. One for 30 seconds, which wasn't as bad since you lane was pushing and Lux went to roam. The other one was for a solid 2 minutes though. You moved a bit near your tier 2 but minions were up by the former tier 1 turret and no enemies in lane. Until Hec came in to farm the double/triple stacked wave.\n\nFew cases of got too close and bursted and pushing without vision.\n\nMy guess would be it isn't so much a intentional feeding ban but a griefing ban (which gets the int feed label). The low cs with decent amount of afk is what may have triggered it.\n\nDisclosure: I could be wrong about why the ban was placed, and it could be a false positive.

Only reason your team got him on a return kill was because his ult missed anf stepped in Chomper. You were still level 7 or 8 about 15 minutes in. Hec and Fizz were already at diving level/potential by then. \n\nYes, you can be suspended for griefing 1 game. It isn't as common because bad games happen. This could just be a bad game case; I can only make observations on what I see and give input. \n\nLux and Graves were both in the jungle when you were waiting for the big wave to crash. You could have gone up to your fallen tier 1 to get it. It was waiting for this wave that you were afk for 2 minutes (moving from entrance to jg at T2 tower, to tower, to bush, then back towards tower). Typing just means you weren't physically afk. Not contributing to the game for an extended period is afk behavior though. Depending on what you said, it could have contirbuted to the punishment. Since it is a gameplay infraction, chat logs wouldn't be included.\n\nAgain though, I am not an official representitive of Riot, so my data and ideas can be missing things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phoenixdust","date":"2018-08-26T00:29:22.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be stupid, but how can you watch other people's replays?
