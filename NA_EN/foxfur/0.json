I believe though that it wastes the time of the team that has all 5 people. They waited anywhere from** 2-5** minutes to get a game (From my experience as a plat 5 player) and assuming no one dodged, which I always sit through 2-5 dodges before any game starts, wastes a further **10** minutes to get through champ select only to get another** 2** minutes wasted loading in and **3 **minutes until the remake happens.\r\n\r\n   **  20** minutes at least wasted for the winning team to get nothing out of it. If the enemy team remakes, you should not have to feel like you are being punished as the winning team. I believe it should count for at least promo wins, maybe even just a 5 LP gain for a remake would make remakes feel a lot better. As it is currently, remakes just punishes the people who had a team that had everyone connect in.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-05-08T21:41:28.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You call it the \"winning team\", but remake is so short into the game and the enemy has a disadvantage by default because someone is missing, that you can't call that winning at all.\n\nYou didn't win anything, so no rewards for it.

That is why I call them the \"winning team.\" In the past when things like this happen, it was free wins for the side who had 5 which is why I am making the argument that now we are punishing those players who would have had an easy win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-05-08T22:09:08.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It doesn't take as long as you'd think to get in, and **what winning team?** It's less than 5 minutes of gameplay. At the very most, you have an early kill from an invade. That's it.
