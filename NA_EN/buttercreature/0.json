However recently while taunting he would stick out an empty hand while his knife would be stuck to the knife on his back. I posted this to submit to the riot website for bug report.","url":"https://youtu.be/aDXjizhfnSA","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDXjizhfnSA/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While in game playing as Tahm Kench{{champion:223}}  with his chef skin, if you taunt Tahm should normally stick his knife out.
