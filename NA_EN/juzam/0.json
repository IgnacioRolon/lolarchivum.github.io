I just bought a 5 hextech bundle and opened 5 Champ shards totaling 3800 BE and 2 skins worth 465!!! OE. Legendary skin shards upgrades are 1520 ORANGE ESSENCE! And that shard only disenchants for 364... I can't even disenchant a legendary shard to upgrade a 750 RP skin shard. Epic shards only give 270 OE. That legendary shard upgrade is OVER 4 times more OE than what it disenchants for. \r\n\r\nIf I was averaging 500 OE for every 5 chest bundle, I would have to pay 2925 RP to upgrade Zombie Brand.\r\nLegendary skins only cost 1820.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T03:25:04.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind you can get all of this content for free by playing the game normally as well. Chests can be obtained by just playing the game and getting mastery chests, which can give you plenty of skin shards for free to disenchant.","replies":[{"poster":"Juzam","date":"2018-01-25T13:32:57.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do play the game normally, I got all the mastery chests during the first week of the season and I still can not upgrade that legendary skin shard.
