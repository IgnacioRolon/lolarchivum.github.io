I notice my first game is usually fine but as I continue to play, I start to develope a slight click delay, its a really tiny delay but its enough to throw off abilities, last hits and can be annoying in team fights especially as adc, which I play a lot haha. Ive noticed my abilities and wards are even unpredictable at times as to when they are going to cast. Along with this I notice that the announcer is delayed as well, with the an enemy has been killed etc call outs. Not sure if anyone else still experiences this as the last post ive seen was last year. Id like to think its not my pc as its a decently high end pc.\r\n\r\nMy specs\r\n\r\nIntel I5- 2500K @ 3.30GHz\r\n16gigs of ddr3 Ram\r\nGeforce gtx 960 4gigs dedicated\r\nIm running on a wireless card but im getting 150mbs\r\nand the signal strength is almost full bars(minus 1 bar)\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T16:41:15.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Input delays like this can be due to packet loss and not necessarily a hardware issue.  Running on wireless could be a culprit though,  and using a wired connection to troubleshoot would be a solid first step.  I would recommend running a[ Log Reader ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader)which can help find what's going wrong, as well as provide some steps towards a resolution.
