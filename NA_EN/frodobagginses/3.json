We ended up coming up with decent ideas for both of them that preserve their essence and make them a better champion that is also easier to balance.\r\n\r\nGalio:\r\nFor galio who really doesn&#039;t need a large reworked we looked to make small changes on his W. This was to keep the healing idea the same but change how the rest of it worked. Riot could remove the base armor and mr from his w and change it so that the armor scaled off his AP and made the mr scale of his mr. This would reward him for building mr against mages more while making him viable against AD champs which he currently is utterly useless against. Along with this riot could add an actual shield scaling with health to his W but decrease the healing on it. The last part is pushing it but could make people see him as the AP bruiser he is along with other changes improving his viability in all mid lane match-ups.\r\n\r\nNunu:\r\nPassive: Change to a 3 hit passive against champions with target specific cooldown. When stacked it improves his q and e on that target. It would allow his q to be cast on champion targets for a decreased damage though scaling with AP. If his e is cast on the target instead of a slow it is a stun.\r\n\r\nQ: The same except that it can be cast on champions who have 3 stacks of passive that deals a percentage of the base plus some of his AP.\r\n\r\nW: Changed to single target MS buff. Resets after after ability is cast on somebody with 3 passive stacks. His old W just didn&#039;t fit him with and only had synergy with his old passive while this one will help him gank and get out of the enemy jungle after counter jungling, which we believed to be one of his largest defining featuers beyond his ult.\r\n\r\nE: Same as live though stun interaction with passive.\r\n\r\nR: Same as live\r\n\r\nI think these changes would help with Nunu being a good counter jungler along with keeping his defining features of ult and Q. Though sadly we couldn&#039;t find any good changes for his E. I believe that these changes would make him more appealing to new players, more viable, and remain close enough to original champion for his current mains. Along with this these changes require minimal amounts of large changes and new animations while still getting the job done.","replies":[{"poster":"Mymyamiaou","date":"2016-07-08T16:11:57.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The changes to {{champion:3}} 's W are something I can see Riot actually doing-- the {{champion:20}}  changes are debatable.
