His poke is way to strong to go with his burst and mobility. Along with this the armor on an early iceborn gives too much ability to dominate lane. Please rito choose what ezreal is. Is he burst, poke, or mobility. Also please make iceborn melee only as AOE ranged slow for basic attacking is a bit absurd.","replies":[]}
