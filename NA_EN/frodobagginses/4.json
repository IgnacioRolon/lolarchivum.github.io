Though I believe that people have complained to much about 4s and with the reinstatement of ranked 5s rito should limit premades to 3 across all elos, similar to what is current in high elo. This change would make the dynQ system closer to perfection.\r\n\r\nAlso can rito please increase uptime for ranked 5s and 3s on weekends and change the times so that between timezones it remains a decent time frame as the current one could be improved for the east coast.","replies":[]}
