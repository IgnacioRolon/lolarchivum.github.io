So I have two ideas to help these people use it to benefit the community and also themselves depending on the way this system goes. First off, Make it so the you can gift people a hextech chest for x amount of IP in the endgame screen. To limit friends spam gifting limit it to once per player per season this can be done. Second is another idea that I have seen before, that you can buy a chest that is limited to only champion shards for 2k-3k IP supposing that you are making it so you can only get Champion mastery 6 and 7 from unlocking a champion you already own through this system. Just some thoughts to improve an already great addition to the game.","replies":[]}
