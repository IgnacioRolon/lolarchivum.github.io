I want to buy an external 1080p monitor but i am not sure if it is worth buying a 144hz or a 60hz one. Do you think that intel hd 520 will manage to play league over 60 fps(even in medium or low settings)? \r\n\r\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T04:16:01.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that the HD 520 graphics will run League at 144Hz, but for almost any other game, it will be hard to maintain that framerate on integrated graphics. I think a 60Hz display would make far more sense on a laptop without a dedicated graphics card.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
