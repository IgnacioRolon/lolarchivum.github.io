Very young male Naruto watchers?) and I am Bard Bard which means I do not talk in ghetto language to reflect my visuals. I kindly said that his skills might leave much to be desired and he just said:\n\n_**\"Yes, I suck with this champ. I can not play him, I don't like him and I will never play him again. Sorry! I will do my best but after that I will never touch im again.\"**_\n\nI cried in joy. Every word was right and true. This person was the first that I met since my 9 years that was really aware of it without \"no u suckz\" or \"play challengerzzz men\". \n\nEDIT: He was not devastated btw. Nobody flamed him.
