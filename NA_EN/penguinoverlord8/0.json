The goal between picking sona/nami and other supports botlane and picking Ap support bot is different. One looks to sustain, and to \"grow\" your adc, with a mage sup, you are just hoping to maim the enemy enough that they either feed or fall behind. If I'm Annie, my goal probably isn't to peel for my adc, I won't have to, because I'm suppose to get stuns off that set off kills for the adc, or poke the enemy adc into submission. But in most situations I will have or at least be close to having my stun so I could possibly give my adc a few seconds to do whatever he/she needs to do.\n\nNow you are gonna say, what if they don't land the cc?\n\nTo that I'm going to say it's a matter of skill for the person playing it, you can say any number of the cc those champs have are hard to land (except Annie, her stun is stupidly easy to land) I can be a horrendous player who sucks at skillshots, if so, what is the different between nami and someone like Vel'koz? Not much, except maybe an ult that I can't fire off at the right time for nami and if it gets late enough, a heal might not matter as much as a missed stun. Regardless, the most important part of the equation is that you do what you are suppose to. \n\nObviously, since mages are not built for support, to play them correctly for bot is hard, and requires a lot of skill. I can respect someone who could wreck their enemy and still have restraint to build like a support. But they are not terrible picks. Sometimes it's fun to take not traditional adcs and supports bot, and a lot of it also depends on the synergy between support and adc. \n\nThat aside, my adoration for soraka makes me sad that you don't enjoy her. She's quite squishy and all, but she's rather useful, and the silence is nothing to sneeze at if you use it at the right times.\n\nAnd Zilean... Idk why but in my mind he's always been a support, probably always will be too. Probably because I don't play him and therefore haven't managed to care about him.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-07T04:22:04.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey we all have our own play styles. i would be considered a support main. and my 4 main supports are {{champion:37}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:111}} but i still like to play {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:3}} as off meta type of supports. but i always pick according to team comps. my team and enemies. i have also used some mage supports as well. {{champion:115}} can be a hand full for enemy team cuz of your poke and range, you have an aoe slow and a knock back kinda and his aoe ult does lot of damage. but my goal as a support is to be the type of protector enhancer for the adc while providing utility my team might lack. i have played {{champion:12}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:83}}  as well all at as supports. but when im playing adc i like the sustain/cc/peel type of supports cuz i need that for me to be a successful adc. i also dont play mid so maybe i lack some fundamentals on the so called \"mage supports\" from just pure lack of playing those champs.","replies":[{"poster":"StarTorched","date":"2016-09-07T04:38:16.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. Since me and my friends go some pretty whacky bot lanes, I don't really see problems with mage supports (some of which are honestly tamer then the crap we've done)\n\nMy top supports are Sona, Nami, Soraka and Lulu, I also play the occasional Karma and Leona, and one or two times have tried a few mage supports. Honestly, I play mage supports for fun mostly and usually go back to sustain supports for safety not because I don't find them viable but because of the fact that I generally am not as good with them/ not as familiar. \n\nBut I find that if you do play mage support, you must save all cc until either your adc chooses to engage or you need it for peel. Besides that, it's also a matter of suiting what your adc wants. One of my friends sometimes prefer me going full damage and even ask me not to build sightstone (I disregard that one) while the other simply doesn't care as long as I am willing to go in with him and help him secure a kill or two. \n\nSo I guess the point is that what support works and what doesn't purely depend on what your adc expects from you, after all you are sort of your adc's fairy godmother xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2016-09-05T21:25:06.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do I like mage supports? hell yeah\n{{champion:117}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:117}} are all awesome","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2016-09-06T00:41:35.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does it matter what the enemy team thinks of your champion or build choice?

I personally don't care what my support is, so long as they actually do something during the game.  Having a Janna that stands 10 feet behind me and randomly drops a shield on me is way worse, in my opinion, than having a mage support that is actually trying to harass the enemy without much peel.  I don't mind playing passively, but if all my support is doing is leeching experience without contributing to the lane, I'd rather they just play Soraka so they can at least heal me up from all the poke I'm trying to dodge.\n\nTo be fair, if you are building something like {{item:3092}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} or {{item:2301}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3157}} , then you technically aren't a typical support in my opinion, you are an underfed midlaner.

Obviously there is a time and place to buy these items (zyra with athene's is kinda worthless without a locket for example), but so many supports forget that you are suppose to help your team.  Dealing damage is just a bonus late game.  Your ADC should be doing 90% of the damage late and you should be protecting them.  I'll still call you a support if you have 1 or 2 AP items that synergize with your kit.  But when you have 4 AP items, magic pen boots, and a sight stones and saying you're a support, that's like saying the top laner with {{item:3078}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3143}} is full tank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Privileged Jew","date":"2016-09-05T21:51:13.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra main here myself (200K + mastery points).
