His numbers are great and with this buff on the PBE to Daisy and the QOL change I think he will be just where he needs to be, but the Preseason doesn&#039;t look as promising. The removal of the buffs little buddys is a small nerf because Ivern cannot Rootcaller to them but hey a few seconds added onto the clear isn&#039;t much, but the smite cool down increase really hurts. On the other hand Ivern has a bit more spare time then most junglers which is used for his powerful ganks but with plants maybe Ivern has more to do. (Also the bush mastery is like literally made for him )\r\n\r\nI&#039;m curious if he will be hurt a lot or not.

Kruggs give almost a level and a half for clearing at level 1. He could start at raptors, passive, red, passive, kruggs, passive smite and hit level 2 and maybe 3 before the enemy jungle clears their 1st camp (Except maybe solo camps pending leash.) With that he can go do a gank to unprepared people in addition to his bush help.","replies":[{"poster":"LXII","date":"2016-11-03T23:34:40.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is like a 40 second windup on being able to clear with his passive (without smiting), if the enemy jungler hasn't cleared a camp in 40 seconds there's something seriously wrong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Papa Slothy","date":"2016-11-03T23:31:34.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"on the bright side though, smite will now make your first camp only cost mana","replies":[]}]}
