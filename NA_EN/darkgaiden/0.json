All i can see is the win rate of my top 5 played champions, but where is all the other information i need???? why remove it in the first place??... or is it that i am blind and im not seeing some hiden button somewhere???","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-25T17:42:30.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that the legacy client has been retired, the devs can start beefing up the updated version with new stuff.

Meaning no updated data is being sent out to sites like OP.GG, or LOLKing, LOLSTARS. If they don't get updated soon, i am considering looking into something else. I spend way to much money and mainly time playing this not to have my progress being continually tracked. {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]}]}
