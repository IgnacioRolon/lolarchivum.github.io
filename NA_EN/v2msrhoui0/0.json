I have a standardized 700 ping and its just so, so slow. Its fine on mobile or any other device, but not on my PC. If anyone who's good with the technical side of PC want's to hit me up on league, please do, or Battle.net, or anything really. I just don't want to spam the boards.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T15:31:40.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT sounds like your connection has weakened with the move, and it can already be kind of tough playing over wi-fi as well.  Would you be able to try a wired connection with a longer ethernet cable?  You can also use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help find ways to strengthen your connection.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"V2msRHouI0","date":"2016-09-03T20:44:32.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to bother again, but I went through the connection issues guide three more times, and now it seemingly works. Splendid guide, I must say.

I'd try a wired connection if I had a cable, it will most likely fix it, but could it have something to do with my antivirus licence running out prior to moving my router?","replies":[]}]}]}
