But when I checked my profile later on that evening I was still at honor lvl 0? I've been very nice to people since the honor thing came out, and it's been quite some time now that I'm still honor lvl 0? Is this a bug? Or is it really a INSANE amount of time to get from honor lvl 0 - 1?. I really think it was a bug since it gave me that message. But I can never be too sure. People honor me almost every game for being nice! I'm not sure why I'm still 0 :(","replies":[{"poster":"I Like Teemo","date":"2017-10-04T17:18:44.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i will agree it is stupid that u can get honour 5 in a few weeks by bm'ing, flaming and trolling (so long as u don't get banned first).... but u cant get to honour 1 in months by only ever saying \"nice job\" and \"gg\" in chat. Even tho you get 1-2 a game it still doesn't mean much","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-25T02:32:31.479+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It doesn't take an 'insane' amount of time to go from Level 0 to 1.  if you still aren't climbing, the only thing holding you back would be by your own behavior.  If the system notices negative behavior on your account, you will either lose honor points, or not gain any new points to advancement.  So if you really want to climb, the best thing to do is just focus on your own play, support your teammates, and don't say anything that can be taken as negative in chat. If so, you should be able to climb no problem!\n\nHopefully that clarifies things a bit!  Let me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-25T02:44:04.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He said he received a message for getting lvl 1, but he isn't lvl 1.
