A class is meant to be part of a champion&#039;s identity, and since Zyra, Leona or others tend to be confused for being supports (because they are or were mostly played in the role of the supporter) I think it may be better to rename the class Sona, Lulu, etc. sit in.

I thought the idea was to have a new class name for the squishier, more mage-like kind of supports, Sona, Soraka, Janna, Nami, Bard etc.  (Not sure which class Lulu would belong to though... she seems kinda ambivalent, like Lux, Kayle, Morgana, Zilean...)","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-05-11T22:36:13.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would think that the \"tank\" class is more on the side of offensive CC, like AOE stuns or displacements disrupting the offensive team, scattering them apart by ramming into them, etc. and being a threat to enemy carries with heavy CC, moderate burst damage to squishies and extreme tankiness that forces you to focus them or lose because they can't be ignored. Champs like {{champion:14}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:113}}{{champion:111}} {{champion:32}}{{champion:154}}{{champion:54}}   are the typical offensive tanks. I would even have them renamed to \"initiator\" or \"vanguard\" or something like that. They all have one thing in common: they ram into the enemy team, disrupt their positioning, and can wreck most carries 1v1 because their tankiness, CC and damage against no-defense squishies is too high. Meanwhile, they aren't that good at dealing with fighters because fighters are just as tanky, have way higher damage, and CC in a 1v1 duel is not as impactful as CC in a teamfight where you can die from ADC crits in the duration of a single stun.\n\nMeanwhile I'd say \"supports\" are more in terms of defensive utility - speedups, shields, heals, reliable single target stuns, etc. and are mostly used to stop assassins and fighters from diving onto squishy carries and wrecking them, and thus setting up kills for the carries. They usually aren't that good at engaging a 5v5 though, because they can't disrupt the entire enemy team at once.\n\nIMO, it would even do to distinguish offensive tanks and defensive tanks. {{champion:57}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:72}} play alot differently than {{champion:111}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:113}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-05-11T17:11:05.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't really matter, if they rename it now people are just gonna keep calling it by the old name.
