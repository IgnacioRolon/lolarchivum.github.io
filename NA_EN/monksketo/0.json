She's Human, and definitely a warrior (if a little bit on the \"rogue\" side as far as lore goes). If that sounds like a long time ago, keep in mind that there have only been 7 champion releases since Camille (not exactly a lot of room for new \"warriors\") because they've also released 11 reworks in that timeframe (which reminds me: {{champion:19}} )\n\nPlus immediately prior to {{champion:164}} we saw the release of {{champion:240}} and {{champion:420}}, and saying that either of them aren't \"warriors\" is just a flat out lie (plus Kled would stab you for that. He'd stab you anyway, but he'd stab you *harder*).\n\nOh, and don't discount {{champion:141}} (Rhaast). Definitely a warrior, Human at least at the start of the game, and honestly not that much of an Edgelord if you choose Rhaast (Kayn is super edgy, Rhaast is more like a mix of Aku and Deadpool).\n\nIn other words... no.
