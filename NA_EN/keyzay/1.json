He didn't want warwick to ks. He followed the warwick around in the jungle stealing camps and trolling the game. He also flamed the garen in the beginning of the game because he brought ignite. After the game was over, we were unable to report him because the end screen never came up. Then he messaged me after the game saying that we should've learned our lesson and backed him up even though he was trolling. He said that he got 0 reports and that he's glad he trolled. That should be a punishable offense but my team and the enemy team never got a chance to report. Brand account name was ZebraCakes64","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-15T22:46:53.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That always sucks when you need to report someone but the post-game never loads so you can't report them -_-'.\n\nIf you were able to get any screenshots of what that player was saying, you could always shoot us a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with those screenshots and we might be able to help out.","replies":[{"poster":"KeyZay","date":"2017-06-15T22:49:45.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so there's nothing we can do unless i have a screenshot which i unfortunately don't have","replies":[]}]}]}
