Yet for some reason that seems to not be happening.\n\nEdit: Also new Rylai's is a thing so theres that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-08-24T23:21:48.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When someone can deal 1.5k true damage without truly building anything then its a problem.
