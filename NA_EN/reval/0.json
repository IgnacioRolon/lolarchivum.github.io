I used the ctrl+5 and hoped it would change back but nothing happened. I even changed the toggle keybind and tried but still nothing. Writing /toggle did nothing also. anybody knows what's up and how can I show my mastery emote?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-20T17:24:52.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently, special emottes take over mastery emotes during the special event.  Your best bet would be to change to another icon to retain your mastery emote, or hang on until the Versus event is over.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
