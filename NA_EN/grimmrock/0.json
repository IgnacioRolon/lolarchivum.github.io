Even if devour is currently on CD, you probably STILL wouldn't want to sacrifice a full stack just for a short stun, it would be better to wait out the CD so you can use the thing you actually built stacks for.\n\nIf you're seeing multiple devours in the same fight then you're seeing really long fights.  Although increasing its CD by ~2 seconds (before CDR) across the board might be worth looking at -- it doesn't destroy his identity and *probably* isn't a massive overnerf like most people's suggestions (including Q stun consuming stacks, sheesh).\n\nAnother possibility is combining a CD increase with half CD on minions and/or buffs to the effect of spitting out minions -- most people hardly ever devour minions right now because it's so unimpressive compared to devouring champions, making the tradeoff more even would give him a bigger menu of choices with more distinct flavors (while at the same time being a nerf to repeatedly devouring champs, the most obnoxious thing about him from an enemy perspective).\n\n...in pro play, though, even a single ally devour is fight turning, so I don't know if a CD increase would be significant.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2015-10-28T11:15:14.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still, stacks last pretty long, and both abilities that exploit them apply hard CC without consuming them. And with rather short CD and potent slow on his Q it isn't uncommon to see Tahm Q>AA>AA>Devour a target, and, by the tame he spits them out, Q is up again so he can immediately stun them afterwards. This is flat out a death sentence in any skirmish, and makes him win any lane trades by default.\nAnd playing him since release, I can say that it isn't hard to pull of at all - I rarely get out of a fight without at least one enemy Devour. Any weaknessess he might have can be remedied through items (try kiting him through {{item:1305}} {{item:3742}}, and killing him is not an option due to sheer amount of durability he has ).\n\nAlso, remove MS buff on ally Devour when running away. It is enough that he can save an ally from any stupid mistake they might make and that then you have to burn through two of his HP bars to get to them - why do you also need to have a hard time catching up. to him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-28T08:42:13.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Devour already has a 6s CD.

(cause the other forms are OP.) Go ahead and increase the CD, but I think they should promote his minion W poke with a Mana/CD refund. This would encourage a little more poke from his kit. and not be completely reliant of swallowing champs.\n\nAlso, get rid of that MS buff on ally cast. (at least when moving away from enemies) It's not very nice that you (not only nullify one kill on one of your allies, but basically don't put yourself in harms way to do that.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2015-10-28T02:18:10.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it could be a bit like how Yasuo can't spam his dash on people cause then no one would ever escape him.
