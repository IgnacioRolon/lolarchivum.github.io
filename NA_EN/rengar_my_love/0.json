Before then, the forums were just a place to kill time- after this thread, I had a mission and it gave me determination. On top of that, I found myself some new friends of which I still speak to today. \r\n\r\nHow could one single thread do all this?\r\n\r\nSimple. It was an idea, and that idea was fantastic (if I don't say so myself). Something people wanted, something people could get excited over and most importantly, something people could band together over.\r\n\r\nSomething that has already raised over 1,000 upvotes.\r\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3887441\r\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4142236\r\n[until the mods went on a rampage of 'putting threads in their place' :F]\r\n\r\nBy showing consistent effort to Riot, community ideas become the reality. I really want to thank anyone who supports this concept, past, present or future- you all put a smile on my face.\r\n\r\nThis game needs more bulge, and not the female kind.\r\n\r\n(Picture created by Silverbirch and commissioned by Dusksaur)","replies":[]}
