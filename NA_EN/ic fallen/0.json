Was punishment free for around 5 months 1 checkpoint before honor 2. I no longer incite like I used too, and I have Definitely improved my in chat behavior. However It hasn't been enough and I'm at the point where I'm close to a two week ban, and honor takes so long to recover I can't keep slipping into punishments. Also It's obviously not healthy for me. So any advice to start the reformation process?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2020-01-08T00:47:01.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">So any advice to start the reformation process?\n\nCertainly.\n\n* Use **/mute all** liberally. If your teammates start behaving in a manner that you feel will make you snap, mute them. Better to lose communication than lose your account.\n* Keep a notepad near your computer or a text file open, and write in that if you want to vent. Alternatively, get a friend on Discord.\n* Take breaks. Too many games in a row can get frustrating.\n* Focus on improving your own gameplay. You'll get less annoyed at others if you're focused on yourself, and that's good -- you can only force one player to play better, so may as well focus on the one you CAN influence!","replies":[{"poster":"iC Fallen","date":"2020-01-08T00:58:38.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna start using mute all more.

It's easier to just look for others to blame and insult instead of doing the harder to do self-reflection. Now onto the advice.\n\nIf you feel like you need to vent then you can do what The Djinn suggested and have a notepad open and ready to type in. Alternatively you could just yell and rage at the screen, punch a pillow/bed/punching bag or squeeze a stress ball. Any of these will allow you to vent without compromising your teams chances of success or putting your account in danger of punishment.\n\nI would also recommend taking breaks whenever you're frustrated. I know this can be difficult to do as it's very tempting to keep playing until you win, and I'm definitely guilty myself of not taking breaks when I need to. However it can definitely help to take your mind off of things for a while and focus on something else instead.\n\nAt the end of the day there's nothing wrong with getting upset now and then, as it's part of being human. However, recognizing when you're crossing the line  is an important skill to have, as is knowing when to stop and move on. You don't have to be an emotionless soulless robot or an absolute saint like some people would lead you to believe, you just gotta practice some self-control and self-regulation/discipline (for a lack of a better word/phrase) and use the tools available to you to help you out if need be, such as the mute button for dealing with problem players.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, and best of luck in your future endeavors.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Trist Utah","date":"2020-01-16T12:55:46.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing that really helps imo is accepting that you're striving for a 51% win rate over long term. You're going to crush some games. You're going to lose some games. League is a game where every game has a winner and a loser. If you become physically frustrated over losing, you really should consider finding some cooping mechanisms before playing. You're going to encounter a lot of people who are a lot better at this game than you are, and lots of people who are worse. you'll encounter people who are great at teamwork, and people just want to do their own thing. It can be really frustrating when someone else appears to be getting in the way of your goals. But just remember, it's just internet points. The main take away from league is to have fun. If you're not having fun, really ask yourself why you're playing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightLakega","date":"2020-01-08T01:45:52.069+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"1st understand there's nothing wrong with you.

Turn off your chat. 99% of the time nothing remotely helpful comes through it, even in ranked. Pings are all you need. \n\n3rd.

The main problem Riot faces with regards to griefers and trolls is intent, which isn't a simple thing to prove compared to poor chat behavior, especially when most people seem to mistake simple bad games or mistakes as trolling/griefing/inting. They do get punished (14-day ban first punishment), and there have been threads on the forums of them getting banned, though it's tricky to track them down since some people like to delete their threads once they're called out on their behavior. We all wish Riot had better detection systems for poor gameplay behavior, but at least for now below are some examples of them getting busted: \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/E4LnThmW-most-ridiculous-chat-restriction-i-have-ever-seen-in-my-life?comment=0011\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/KHAL90oW-stuck-at-honor-zero?comment=0003\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/3jEVVlsY-permanently-banned-with-ingame-log?comment=003e\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/jFwTE8Oj-playing-off-meta-in-ranked-int-feeding-ban?comment=0039\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken?show=rundown\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/GrmPK5yP-intentional-feeding-but-i-didnt-feed?comment=0006\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/MKBQUoKd-banned-for-intentionally-feeding\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/KTq4tjIF-i-dont-get-it-how-riot-bans-a-player-because-another-kid-draven-decides-to-take-all-the-kills\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/xW5z7auF-proof-that-riot-employees-ban-without-providing-clear-evidencecertainty-of-an-infraction\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/RAfb0McT-got-banned-for-intentional-feeding-for-a-game-with-02-death\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5bqNJurI-banned-for-a-bad-game\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/f9P7YRXv-bad-game-i-guess\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/2Xkw0yE4-first-ban-and-14-days\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Wb6xkgzF-what-for-14-day-ban\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/r8HTAlbX-worst-ban-ever\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/xp1c9xuj-14-day-ban","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"drymonkey","date":"2020-01-13T20:02:50.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i never been a toxic player but i do get mad from time to time like we all do.\ni have 2 golkden rules that help alot for keeping my cool and not going of at them ..\n\n1 to stay calm Always keep thinking evrythign that happens in this game is MY bad even if its clearlmy not you cant change what they do only what you do thinking like this helps alot at keeping you focused in the game and not the ragechat \n\n2 if you get pissed witch will happen rage at the screen and just smile at the players trolls and ragers respond verry well to rage and anger and that gets the ball roling fast.  what i do is pritty simple and workes verry well if they start to flame you or are bad in general (if that makes you mad) \ninstead of yelling at them on chat yell at the screen and then type something verry nice ….\n\nmay feel strange but i prommise you flamers cant stand guys actualy being nice to them they just shut down and eather stop typing all togeather or ignore you or just actualy be nice to you verry fast","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-01-08T03:21:49.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I've never been punished, I see many here fall into punishment cos they don't know how the system works. \n\nFirst thing you need to know, the system punishes based on consistency x severity. Meaning you can be punished for 1 game of severe toxicity or many many games of mild toxicity.\n\nThere's also no need to ask for reports. 1 Report does the same thing as 9 reports, and all a report does is to flag the system to check for toxicity. If no toxicity was found, then the system will \"throw away\" the report. If there was toxicity, then the system will grade the severity of the toxicity, and the toxicity score will be accumulated into your account. This also means that it is not necessary to \"defend\" against people whom threaten to report you. Nothing will happen if you didn't do anything wrong. \n\nFinally, not everyone is trolling/inting/griefing in your games. People have difference strengths. Some might have a strong laning phase, but terrible macro in late game. Some might be all mechanics no brain (looking at those Yasuo players). Some might be tilted off the face of the earth from their last game and super tunneled on that little minion (and failing to last hit it). There will be bad players in your game, but just because they are bad, doesn't mean they are purposefully sabotaging your games. It's OK, there world isn't going to end when you lose a few games. \n\nRemember, You'll get to your proper rank with many games played, and you'll get to your deserved rank (not to be confused with your desired rank) by the end of the season. If you are \"hard stuck\", then you'll have to git gud, and there are plenty of good guides out there to help you improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Vulgar Nerd","date":"2020-01-08T12:19:56.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kei143,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wKOJsEAL,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2020-01-08T03:21:49.741+0000)\n\n> There's also no need to ask for reports. \n\n... and in fact asking for reports is considered harassment and I believe is clearly outlined in the EULA/ToS.","replies":[{"poster":"Famous Gay Actor","date":"2020-01-08T18:04:56.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"some morons in EUW found out that you can get banned for asking for reports and spamming \"report X for Y\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}
