Was it right of them to do that? No, but that's never an excuse to use hate speech such as racism or homophobia. So just know before I even read the rest, any punishment was well deserved for this sentence alone based on Riot's zero-tolerance policy.\n\n> ThisGam3IsTrash: i choose not to listen to these nazis\nThisGam3IsTrash: cause this bitch KALISTA TOOK MY BLUE BUFF\nThisGam3IsTrash: lose for all i care\nThisGam3IsTrash: this game is trash anyway\nThisGam3IsTrash: cause fuck you thats why\n>ThisGam3IsTrash: a bunch of trump supporting nazis\n>ThisGam3IsTrash: i figured youd be okay kalista\nThisGam3IsTrash: \\fucking turd\nThisGam3IsTrash: god this kalista is fucking trash\nThisGam3IsTrash: just look at that trash score\n\n Wow. So there's a lot to address here. \n\n You don't have the right to speak down to your teammates. Just because Kalista stole your buff doesn't mean you get to act this way. Frankly this attitude is disgusting and is pretty much the epitome of toxicity in League.  Even if you didn't use that hate speech in the beginning of the game, the rest of your chat log was more than enough to warrant a punishment. If you aren't belittling others based on their score, you're giving up and just generally being a jerk all throughout the game. \n\n You're going to face hardship from both the allied and enemy team, if you can't handle yourself then remove your ability to chat altogether or take a break entirely. If one buff being stolen removed your ability to focus on the game this much, I would recommend re-evaluating your priorities. \n\n>So all in all i got a 25 game chat restriction all because riot supports Donald trump. \n\n **You're lucky** that it wasn't an immediate 14 day ban based on that zero tolerance phrase you used in the pre-game lobby. That was enough to warrant the second-highest level of punishment and instead you got off lucky, so I'd say you should be grateful. \n\n>and nazis. which i dont. and they dont like that apparently. because as far as i can tell thats the only thing in there that would get me a penalty.\n\n\n I'm not even going to tackle the political side of the flame. If you like or dislike Trump, that's cool, but generally Riot's rules are just against being jerks. \n\n>honestly its a fucking online game so why the fuck should should i have to watch what i fucking say to some plebs that cant fucking play this god damn game! \n\n Why should other people have to be subject to constant flame, racism, homophobia, or general negativity in every person they come across? Do you want to flame and needlessly berate your teammates? Play with a premade. That attitude wouldn't fly in most social scenarios and definitely won't fly here.\n\n>oh and yet some racist assholes can just say every racial slur in the god damned book. believe me i posted that shit and it got removed before the next day.\n\n Definitely not. If someone uses a slur and you properly report them, they'll get punished without a doubt. If you mean you posted that evidence of racism/homophobia here on the Boards, [yes, it would be removed because it goes against our rules. ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE)\n\n> but no im toxic because some fuckers got their fucking feelings hurt in a fucking online game\n\n I've got to be brutally honest here, it seems like you're the one who had their feelings hurt. Please make an effort to change your ways because in your current state, nobody wants you on their team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThisGam3IsTrash","date":"2018-12-30T00:27:16.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this game is fucking trash","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThisGam3IsTrash","date":"2018-12-29T22:33:17.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-12-29T23:48:55.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who are you talking to?","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2018-12-30T00:10:10.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xidphel,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=6AdJxkEM,comment-id=000f0000,timestamp=2018-12-29T23:48:55.734+0000)\n>\n> Who are you talking to?\n\nThey're doing \"Chronological order\" instead of normal Discussion view.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2018-12-30T00:09:39.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you deserved this.\n\nIf you even want *any* discussion on this, please use the \"Discussion view\" instead of chronological.
