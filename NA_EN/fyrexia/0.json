When other people view your profile, it should be showing your most recently played champion, unless you have an icon like the Elementalist Lux icons which will force your profile image to match the icon.","replies":[{"poster":"Lulu the Support","date":"2017-08-03T22:52:52.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now my dynamic background is with my highest mastery champion, even though I haven't played that champion even once in my last 20 games. Other times it just shows what I played the most in the last 20 games. Why did it change. I like that it displays the highest mastery champion right now, but I'm concerned that it'll start displaying my most played recent champion again. Can I choose that if it does?","replies":[]}]}]}
