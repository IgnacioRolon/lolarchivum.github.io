When I tried to log in today, I was met with a screen that said that I needed to download a newer version. Okay, that's fine. So, I downloaded the newer version, and then when I logged in, everything worked for a second, then said that I couldn't connect to the LoL server. Then, it said I needed to update, and download a newer version. Repeat this ad-infinitum. I believe it's because I left my client logged in, my computer went to sleep, and I had to restart it like with the legacy client. Now, I can't log in to League. This is frustrating. The legacy client is not working, and saying I need to test my internet connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Allenah","date":"2016-11-23T04:04:41.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not an issue with just the new client. I still have the old one since I had declined when it initially popped up, and I can't get on either. People who successfully dled the new client are having issues as well. Riot is aware of the situation and working to fix it according to their status page.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T00:29:06.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were some Login issues on the NA servers yesterday.
