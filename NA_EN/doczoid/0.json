I'll be going to Pax East with my Leagues buddies and we had seen that there was going to be a Cospitality Lounge. I haven't really found any information on what that is other than thinking it's a cosplayer's hangout when not walking the floor. Is it somewhere to meet and greet some of the Riot employees and also see the cosplayers? \r\n\r\nSucks there's no booth this year but hopefully an event Riot puts on comes up this year on the East Coast.\r\n\r\nThanks for any information.\r\n\r\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-24T17:53:52.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya DocZoid! \n\nThe Cospitality Lounge is a change to take a breather from the convention, hang out with each other, and you're also more than welcome to touch up your cosplay with our wide array of crafting supplies. :] \n\nI'll be cosplaying as classic Lux, so maybe we'll run into each other!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DocZoid","date":"2015-03-05T12:01:51.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the clarification.
