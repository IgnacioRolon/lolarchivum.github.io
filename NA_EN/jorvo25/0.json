This time I was still chatting with teammates while the counter was stuck at zero.   It does not look like a network issue because I would not have been able to get a receive packets if I was disconnected.   At this rate the account is going to be banned for repeated dodges.  Every third lobby is beyond annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jorvo25","date":"2016-08-27T05:15:54.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still happening.   \n1) The status of the servers is good.   \n2) My connection is wired.\n3) Firewall is disabled.\n4) I switched dhs servers.\n5) I have no packet loss.  I did not lose a single ping packet to multiple sites.  Rock solid time so I have no local traffic interfering.\n6) There is no sign of packet buffering problems.\n7) Ports are all set properly.\n8) I am not running VPN.\n9) I renewed lease and flushed the dns server.\n\nI don't believe it is a problem with my connection locally.   The client just stops working randomly.   I just was kicked from champ select because the lock champs button could not be pressed.  The timer was running but the lock button never lit up.  It does display like a lack of connection in that the chat room locks out and occasionally everyone leaves, but if it is network it is up stream of my ISP connection.   I have no problems in game, so I am rather stumped unless the champ select and the game packets are taking a different route.  It has happened 8 times already, and cost me several series as it is forcing dodges at the worst possible time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-25T18:22:28.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the client hangs in champ select, it's typically an indication that the client is experiencing a brief disconnect from the matchmaking service, and cannot reestablish a stable link. The most common cause of this is any number of local network configurations that don't specifically play well with League. I recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if you still have issues after working through those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jorvo25","date":"2016-08-25T01:00:56.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My age is 44 and I am a computer programmer by trade.
