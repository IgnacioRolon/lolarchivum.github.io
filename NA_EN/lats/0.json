Feel free to glance at my rune pages/masteries for an example setup (it's the pages titled siksiksik).\n\nAnother great option is Maokai.  He has a point and click snare, and once they are snare you aren't going to miss Q or E for follow up CC.  He won't do the damage that someone like reksai will but with the advent of cinderhulk he can clear, gank, and tank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PÃ¦an","date":"2015-04-10T23:54:23.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:254}} {{champion:113}}  both are strong.\nvi basically instagibs the adc no matter what if her ult is up.\nsee u an I is extremely noob friendly, build full tank and you have stupid CC and a good bit of damage because of % hp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chadmeet Singh","date":"2015-04-10T01:33:21.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:5}} {{champion:54}}  and my all time fav {{champion:19}} \njust play champs with hard cc or lockdown abilities, if u go in for a gank post-6 u get a kill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nin10do0014","date":"2015-04-09T21:24:03.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jarvan, though he does have one and a half skillshots, is probably one of the best Junglers to learn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-04-09T18:23:14.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:106}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:57}} are some good tanks that (generally) fit your criteria (Maokai has a few skillshots, but they aren't too difficult to land, especially since Twisted Advance is targeted).
