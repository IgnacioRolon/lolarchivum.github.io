You cannot attack the other teams turrets or nexus\r\n2. All towers of your lane must be down to attack the nexus\r\n3. The Minions Nexus is locked to the first team to attack it for 10 seconds or till no team member of that team is within 1500\r\n4. Turrets and minions of the enemies lanes will not attack you\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n1. Disrupt the enemy lane by assisting the minions of that lane in the deaths of their enemy champions\r\n2. Support the Minions Rebellion by supplying the opposite lane with materials from beasts with 4 epic monster spawn points that will help the minions with defense or attack or allow for special minion spawns.\r\n3. 1 Legendary monster spawn that, when sold to the vendor at you base, activates UMA (the Ultimate Minion Annihilator) and wipes your lane of all minions and disables their spawn for 30 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-05-28T15:47:38.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.
