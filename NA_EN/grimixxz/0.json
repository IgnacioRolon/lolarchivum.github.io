There are a lot of toxic players on league and well I, being the one harassed got banded. Well I say go fuck yourself, in utmost kindest way possible. In the past I reported people when needed too, after awhile I gave up since no one ever got banded they just continued playing on. I got reported one time and got on a  14 day suspension. Okay well this doesn't make a lick on sense. \n\nI think I am done with your game, you message comes across as a professional, and serious game. How so? when there are people trolling players like me and I get seen as the bad guy.  I thought this game was something I would come back to and play for a long time. Spend some money after the new patch. Well I was wrong, I made new friends and had fun only to find myself  getting band, because I was getting screwed over in game.  Also seriously the first suspension last for 14 days then perma ban,  wtf is that! Your basically stealing money from people over something that happened in one game. Id rather play DOTA if that's the case.\n\n Everything comes down to who actually is the one checking out the log and video to see what all happened, have a good day Grimixxz. Ps. I know your going to have some sort of response saying sorry for the inconveniences, or something witty well this time you got it wrong. I was the one being harassed. Therefore this game is no longer a game, its now  simply a cash grab. I cant play a game where every thing I join is just another toxic gameplay. Even being able to play again just makes me think that its not even worth my time.

I did look over the chat from that game to see just what exactly happened, and calling your own teammates things like retarded and trash just aren't cool regardless of who started it to begin with. Another point that might have played into the ban might have been when you started to brag about inting or that you didn't care about a ban because \"this wasn't your main account\". \n\nI don't want to throw out your entire personal chat logs, but if you're still confused as to why this ban was placed you can shoot a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) over to our player behavior team for the full context.","replies":[{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2017-10-04T12:51:00.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=mbhBQN7Z,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-03T00:59:44.566+0000)\n>\n> Another point that might have played into the ban might have been when you started to brag about inting or that you didn&#x27;t care about a ban because &quot;this wasn&#x27;t your main account&quot;. \n\nReal question: when this happens, does Riot attempt to find and punish the user's main account as well?  It honestly seems like they should.  If someone is toxic and has multiple accounts, it's not like playing under a different summoner name makes them a different person","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T20:27:32.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a fair question to be concerned with, but ultimately we can't discuss other players accounts or punishments. \n\nReal talk: I know that's not what any of you want to hear, but we simply need to retain some level of privacy with peoples personal accounts.

Usually when I join a game I don't say stuff the would be to \"risky\" but that particular game just seems I was very angry about the situation. I would like to apologies to the other player about what was said. I didn't like the circumstances and I was being asked to gank mid when I was obviously behind. Belittling and steal my farm on purpose was a contributing factor. Someone had stole my buff for jungle in the beginning of the game and yes I was distraught,  but another player was instigating me.\n\nIn all I would like to apologies to you and the players of that game and I will make sure it will not happen again. I will accept the 14 day ban, the fact of it being my secondary account shouldn't have matter. I am trying to make it my main, and I should learn to control my anger. Like I previously stated I will not let it happen again, and I will accept the 14 day ban because it will give me time to think. Thanks for responding, yours truly Grimixxz. I do not know if you can personally contact the other players of that game, though if you could I wish you could send this letter to them or that fact that I wish to apologies to them for what had happened.\n\nThanks for not putting out my personal chat, I had time to think about what I had said over night. Wish to apologies to you personally, for my first letter, I should have been more understanding of the situation. I will continue to play league in a professional and fun way. May be hard to believe but, I really wont let any of this happen again. Have a good day Broporo","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T04:50:52.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We all have moments where we aren't at our best, and nobody is faulting you for that. We all know what it feels like to have that rage building and it's not that we're trying to punish you for that, we're merely trying to keep a safe environment where people don't walk away feeling upset/depressed. Feeling upset about being slighted is normal for everyone. It's how you handle that rage that makes all the difference. \n\nI do commend you for taking time to reflect and even *moreso* for stepping forward and apologizing even when it's not needed. I'm here to serve you guys, and I look out for everyone and try to bring out the best in everyone when I can.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"knightslayer95","date":"2017-10-04T12:43:43.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then can u put a mute button for ourselves instead of the teammates, that way even if i trash talk the whole game being tilted at least none of it will be sent.
