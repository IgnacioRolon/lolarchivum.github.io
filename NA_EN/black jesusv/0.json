I find myself in a pickle where I get the coolest skins and I never even knew that I had them. (had dunkmaster Darius) DIDN&#039;t know I had it until i took the 20 minutes of time to go through every single champion to see what skins I owned.\r\n\r\nSo my Idea is to just create a way to see all the skins you own in the summoners profile, it would save time, and imburse people to buy more skins and or play different things. I found so many skins that I didn&#039;t even know that I had, like Hextech annie. Thank you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-09-05T20:24:16.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're trying to implement that feature in the new client afaik","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-01T00:33:18.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you get hextech annie without knowing you have it.\n\nThis thread smells funny..","replies":[{"poster":"Black JesusV","date":"2016-09-05T20:22:20.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was aiming for Soulstealer vayne, and i happened to pick it up along the way i believe.
