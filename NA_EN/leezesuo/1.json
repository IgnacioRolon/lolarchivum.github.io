And there are longer skillshots which do more damage AND go through minions. To hit the chain effectively, the LeBlanc has to use a w+q+e combo which costs half of her mana. The slow is not too high, 25% are like nothing and just help to proc the snare which is pretty important. Maybe it is because I know LeBlanc extremely well, but I have no problems with laning against her.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2016-04-04T18:27:29.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=stepan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EfB5GRt9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-04T18:18:47.350+0000)\n>\n> Remember her Q used to be a silence.

It reduces the counter against her to simply playing the Guessing Game where you're most likely gonna pick the wrong one.","replies":[{"poster":"PentaJuke","date":"2016-04-30T00:02:02.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats the point of the passive if you can tell which is the real one? are you kidding me?","replies":[{"poster":"AdderTude","date":"2016-05-01T19:57:27.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lolcaloid,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EfB5GRt9,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-30T00:02:02.528+0000)\n>\n> Whats the point of the passive if you can tell which is the real one? are you kidding me?\n\nWhy is it called \"Mirror Image\" if they look exactly the same? They should call it a true clone if you can't tell the difference. When you look in a mirror, you can spot a key difference between the reflection and the original. The same should be said for picking out the clone instead of losing on a coin toss.","replies":[{"poster":"PentaJuke","date":"2016-05-02T00:34:35.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhm its blue buff its an obvious differnce, unless what your sayin if i were to look in a mirror im gonna have pink hair i guess.","replies":[{"poster":"AdderTude","date":"2016-05-09T19:07:42.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lolcaloid,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EfB5GRt9,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-02T00:34:35.720+0000)\n>\n> Uhm its blue buff its an obvious differnce, unless what your sayin if i were to look in a mirror im gonna have pink hair i guess.\n\nYou're really missing the point. If your hair is swept to the left, your mirror image will have hair swept to the right. Likewise, if LeBlanc's legging is on her right leg and the stocking is on her left, her mirror should be the reverse (legging on left, stocking on right). As it stands in-game, her double looks exactly the same as the original model, hence why they should call it a \"clone\" rather than a \"mirror image\".\n\nThe only champion who should have a true identical clone is Shaco. They're meant to look exactly the same in the first place due to the clone punishing the player that made the wrong choice (exploding in a ring of daggers).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PentaJuke","date":"2016-04-04T19:20:04.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:7}} is fine right now,besides her chain is a skill shot unlike {{champion:43}} and {{champion:25}}.

There was a time when Zed needed skill. When he had like 48% winrate. That was nice, and he was good when the player had experience. But now he is too easy just because of his raw damage, the passive which makes csing a lot easier and the resource management.\nI mean, champs which low winrates and a curve that ends above 50% at 100 games are nice. And LeBlanc is one of them. You are rewarded for having experiences with her.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sariat1","date":"2016-04-04T20:12:51.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I will admit, the hitbox on the chain is deceptively large.
