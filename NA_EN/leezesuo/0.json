Your hidden MMR is all that matters in the long run and dodges have no effect on it. If your MMR is in a higher division then you will get your promos again in record time.","replies":[{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2016-04-18T22:13:02.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but instead of dodging and getting a loss is it not easier to try and carry yourself that one game that you might win, than playing an extra game that will just bring you back to where you were...i mean both are viable i guess so i see your point...","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-04-18T22:17:06.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SrbLud,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=arExFZ2m,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-18T22:13:02.371+0000)\n>\n> Yeah but instead of dodging and getting a loss is it not easier to try and carry yourself that one game that you might win, than playing an extra game that will just bring you back to where you were...i mean both are viable i guess so i see your point...\n\nOptimal climbing strategy involves weighing your odds of victory against how many games you lose out on from the dodge timer. lp/promo losses are a complete non-factor because your MMR is the only thing that matters.\n\nI don't dodge games but that is the optimal strategy given how the system works.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-18T21:57:02.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even as it counting as a loss you still get to dodge at least once in normal promos and 2 in division promos.","replies":[]}]}
