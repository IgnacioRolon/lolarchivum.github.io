More than often, the game seems to not know what to do when it finds a match. Few times I've had it infinitely stuck looping \"waiting for other players to accept\" and other times the \"waiting for other players to accept\" - box sticks over to champion select, restraining me from choosing or banning champions. I've also had lobbies stopped due to \"server fixing\". This has led me slapped with a straight 30 minute queue dodge timers. I thought there was a step of 6 minutes?\r\n\r\nI've tested my connection, works fine. Hextech Repair tool claims my firewall is also fine. What's the issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Katia Managan","date":"2017-09-28T09:15:05.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I see the negatively impacting games issue up there.
