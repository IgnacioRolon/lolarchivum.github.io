This champ is supposed to be similar to AP SIon, but with some added elements to improve playing both as and against him. I am willing to change many things in the name of balance and fun.**\n\n**Another disclaimer: This is not the finished product! I just wanted some feedback**\n\n**Role:** AP Mage, AP Fighter\n\n**Inspiration:** This is an attempted remake at “AP Sion”. It was apparent to both the fan base as well as Riot that the previous Sion was a disjointed champion. He had the choice of two playstyles that either focused on him being a burst mage or a lumbering behemoth of a tank. While both play styles were fun, Riot recognized that Sion had a huge divide with his abilities versus outlook. Whenever you played AP or tank, the other half of his abilities were almost worthless. Thus, Riot reworked Sion as a full tank, which made sense cause he’s an undead barbarian with a giant axe. However, a significant portion of the player base at the time enjoyed AP Sion. So it’s my goal to create a champion with similarities to AP Sion while implementing other features that allow him to be fun playing as and against. Enjoy! \n\n**Champion Background (Cliff Notes):** As an apprentice necromancer, Valek stumbled upon a scythe/staff when grave robbing a master necromancer. Turns out while the body is dead, the master still lives on in the weapon in some spirit form. The spirit made a blood pact with Valek, promising him power beyond measure. In return, the master would blood bind to Valek and exist next to him in his staff. Valek agreed and drained a portion of his blood into the staff, where the spirit thrives off the blood in order to continue its ambitions.\n\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/art/The-Dark-Mage-329610430\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/art/Flem-ber-Mage-380225243\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/art/Dark-Mage-296604291\n\n*Passive-Spirit of the Harvest:* On kill or assist, Valek is granted additional permanent health based from a percentage of damage that he dealt to the target in the last 5 seconds before the kill. This permanent bonus is increased during his ult.\nPossibility #1: Bonus health has various thresholds which upon surpassing, reduces amount of permanent health gained afterward\n\n*Q -Ethereal Blast:* Shoots a linear skillshot that deals a large amount of magic damage and stuns the first target hit. Cannot hit minions. Range/width/velocity is similar to Elise’s E.\n\tPossibility #1: Stun is a base value of 1.5\n\tPossibility #2: Stun duration increases upon level-up, 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2\n\tPossibility #3: Stun duration and/or damage is reduced when passing through minions\n\n*W-Death Caress:* Grants a shield around Valek for 10 seconds. If the shield is not destroyed, it will explode and deal magic damage equal to its remaining value (if you don't get hit, it deals substantial damage). Valek can choose to explode the shield 4 seconds after activation.\n\tPossibility #1: Has a passive where shield is increased based on how many units Death Caress has slain. AP ratio most likely reduced\n\tPossibility #2: Deals damage based off starting shield value\n\n*E-Spirit Anchor:* Passive-Grants Valek 30/60/90/120/150% base mana regeneration. In addition, Valek gains a stack of “spirit” whenever he slays an enemy unit. The cap for spirit stacks increases upon level-up\n\tPossibility #1: Upon reaching max “spirit” stacks, each unit slain by Valek gives 5 mana\n\n*R-Unleashed!:* The spirit breaks free from his confines and takes form on this material plane as a specter (I’ll call him Legion). He uses the staff as a scythe and is now a melee champion. In compensation, he is gains alternate abilities as well as increased durability (see passive). Legion’s starting health percentage is equal to Valek’s health percentage upon activation. You now control Legion instead of Valek. While Legion is unleashed, Valek loses consciousness and cannot move/attack/use abilities and is helpless as Legion uses his life essence. Legion can reactivate this ability to bind him back into the staff and teleport to the side of Valek, restoring him to consciousness. When returned, Valek’s new health equilibrates to the lower percentage of either character. This is a toggle ability that has a high cooldown and only takes one mana expenditure\n\t\nPossibility #1: Since Legion is still tethered to the majority of Valek’s blood, he has a max range of travel since he cannot exist on this material plane without being close to his host. This range is increased upon level-up. Only you and your allies can see this range and tether.\n\tPossibility #2: As #1 except the enemy can see the direction of the tether (but only what they could normally see). They still do not see the max range you can travel, but this gives them some insight on where you may have hidden Valek’s body before being unleashed.\n\tPossibility #3: Ability has only a moderate cooldown but each second being unleashed increases the cooldown for the next time by 3 seconds. \n\tPossibility #4: Valek takes increased damage during his vulnerable state.\n\n*Q (Legion)-The Reaping:* Legion’s next auto-attack causes him to dash to his target from a small distance.\n\tPossibility #1: This attack deals bonus magic damage\n\tPossibility #2: Your auto-attack deals damage in a crescent sweep\t\nPossibility #3: Legion fears enemies that are damaged by this move\n\n*W (Legion)- Blight Armor:* Encases a target with cursed armor that reduces 10/15/20/25/30% damage dealt and taken. A good time to use this ability is when Valek is caught and you need to protect him. You gain all the benefits and none of the weaknesses!\n\n*E (Legion)-Spirits of the Damned:* Toggle (On): Each auto-attack consumes 1/2/3/4/5 “spirit” stacks to deal additional bonus magic damage on hit per stack consumed. If Legion has no remaining “spirit” stacks, he sacrifices his own life force through a percentage of his current health to deal the additional damage.\n\t\n**Special Interactions:** {{champion:83}} (grave robbing) {{champion:8}} (blood pact) {{champion:412}} (collector of souls) {{champion:30}} (undead and necromancy) {{champion:266}} (living weapon) {{champion:67}} (smells black magic) {{champion:236}} (hates undead)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-06T06:31:56.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I didn't make the connection that you could cast Legion's W on his \"vessel\" Valek!

Please excuse the crudeness of my comments below.  :)\n\nOverall, pretty cool concept and there are a couple of shining stars within this kit.  That said, there are also a handful of weird, albeit more minor, decisions that I want to go over.\n\nPassive- the stipulations about dealing damage just before the kill are thematically interesting but feel limiting and un-fun in practice.  One of the healthiest parts about Sion's kit, in my opinion, was the stacking health passive for killing minions.  It was simple and effective.  Perhaps since Valek is a mage, who also turns into a melee champion, he could get a stacking spell vamp or magic penetration passive?  I'm not in love with those ideas, but I do think the restrictions here are too limiting.\n\nQ- Nice and simple, nothing wrong with that.  I like the \"gets weaker when passing through minions\" idea.\n\nW- The damage on this ability seems really low and I'm not sure why you went so conservative with it.  You don't mention any AP scaling so I'm assuming it just does whatever the shield does?  I suppose the shield gets stronger with AP but the damage still seems super weak.  Bumping it up should be an easy fix.\n\nE- The spirit stacking concept seems really interesting in design and theory, but I don't understand your application of it.  A passive that grants major mana regen, plus a stacking mechanic that also awards flat mana, but only when fully stacked?  This would only make sense on a champion who has an ability that converts mana into damage or something, who is constantly going oom.  As it stands, either you're giving him mana he doesn't need or you're making him very mana-hungry as a weakness and then immediately solving for it by taking up one of his ability slots.  Again, love the concept, but only when it's applied to his ult.  I recommend keeping the passive spirit stack component specifically for his Ultimate and then giving his E some other type of active component that helps him generate stacks but also have some other primary function.\n\nR- Awesome, fantastically interesting ability.  I love this idea immensely.  It reminds me of the Starcraft hero from Heroes of the Storm, though I'm forgetting his name at the moment.  Valek becomes this sitting duck (I like the idea of him taking true damage or at least bonus damage) and being tethered to this unstoppable killing machine.  I think showing the enemy the tether is a good form of counterplay (even if the tether range is quite far!  And I agree that it should scale with rank).  I like either option 2 or 3 for Q.  W is pointless in its current form... it should work more like the talent \"live dangerously\" or whatever it's called.  Deal 2% more damage but take 1% more damage.  There has to be a benefit for using it.  As I said above, I like the idea of consuming the stacks he's been farming during his ult.\n\nI hope this was helpful, and sorry it was so long winded.  There is a lot of good stuff in here and I can't praise that Ultimate enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2015-01-06T06:16:34.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=31xNwpWA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-06T05:13:09.080+0000)\n>\n> Lutzburg\n\nThank you for reviewing! And I love long responses! Sorry if my response if long winded XD Here’s some of my reasoning for the abilities:\n\n**Passive:** Something thematic about the previous Sion was his health stacking element, which was more prevalent when he played AD/Tank but was still present in his AP form (by investing only one point in it at level 3). I beat myself over the head for a stat stacking passive that didn’t involve the use of minions as 3 champions already have a mechanic similar to that. I figured that going after champions instead of minons was a healthier gameplay style and not making the lane such a farm fest a la Nasus/Veigar. The best part is that it’s not feast or famine, it doesn’t need to be a kill as with Draven, nor can you really be “kill-stealed” as it works off assist (though I’d probably lower the percentage a little bit compared to kills). AP Sion was played as a quick pusher, then roamed with Boots of Mobility to get quick and easy kills. In the same way, Valek should be going after kills, and he should be rewarded for doing so. I also felt lore wise it connected with “Legion” (still a crappy name) as he sustains off of “life essence”. I figured that strong spirits would be prized over weaker ones, so he’d collect and absorb the strong (passive) while weaker spirits such as with minions would be easily expended (E).\n\n**Q (Valek):** The previous targeted stun that scaled something like 80% off AP was extremely toxic, so I made it a skillshot. Nevertheless, landing this stun was CRUCIAL for Sion’s burst. So in compensation, I gave it more range and made it easier to land during the laning phase. Glad you liked it.\n\n**W (Valek):** My apologies, I should’ve mentioned damage. I don’t know if you ever played the previous AP Sion before, but his W and Q did, as Phreak would say, did TONS OF DAMAGE. This bad boy scaled close to 80% as well and had huge base values. A huge complaint from people laning against AP Sion was that there was little counterplay. He put his shield up, and you backed away since you could rarely clear the shield, and even if you were close to popping it (thereby expending your precious cooldowns) he would explode it dealing ALL the damage. This as well was toxic. No counterplay. This ability would still have tremendous burst but only if you can land the stun first since it only deals remaining damage form the shield(this is still in question). Since AP Sion was able to thrive even in high ranked gameplay (Diamond player Soultran mained him top and mid) with only 2 USEFUL abilities, I needed to tone down the toxicity and sheer damage of this guy so he could have a fully useful/interactive kit. So to answer your statement: Yes, the damage on this ability is very high as long as you hit a stun first.\n\n**E (Valek):** As stated above, Sion was able to be played with virtually only 2 buttons. I still wanted the player base to have the same 2 button “Stun and Burst” experience but still have the rest of his kit be useful to him. This is why I thought his E in Valek form needed to be a passive, but could still contribute to other problems that the previous AP Sion. Another big problem for AP Sion was his HUGE dependence on Doran’s Rings. Since his Q and W take tremendous amounts of mana, he needed cheap mana items that still gave him power for enough burst. Riot recognized that item diversity is an important part in League. The staple build for AP SIon was just 3 or 4 Doran’s Rings and Boots of mobility. This was absolutely ridiculous. This is why I have the mana regeneration and the Doran-like possibility when fully stacked. I rewarded players for having a full stack as traditional AP Sion players enjoy his normal form. Going Unleashed! is extremely dangerous and should only be used to secure a kill. He'll spend most of his time as Valek.\n\n**R:** Thank you very much. I’m not at all confident that this champion will ever get recognition, so please use it for a champion if you want.\n\n**Q (Legion):** Just a simple move for “League of Gap Closers”. He has no sticking power anyway but needed some way to at least get to people without being kited. This form offers so much raw power that I didn’t want him to have any sticking potential so I thought this move would be alright. Should I include the cleave and/or fear? The jump distance is the same as with Hecrarim’s E.\n\n**W (Legion): **AHA! I believe W is not pointless in this form as it protects your very vulnerable Valek. I thought it would be important for Legion to have some form of protection over Valek, even if it’s just a little. Again, AP Sion was strong off of only 2 abilities, so I have to make other abilities somewhat weak, but still meaningful. Casting W on Valek gives you all the benefits but none of the weaknesses. Can also be used on burst rotation mages to reduce their burst. They’re still super squishy to take down even with the armor. I do like your idea of 2% for 1%, but he’s already got lots of damage packed into his E with the same danger of using it too much and using his own essence.\n\n**E (Legion):** Thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}
