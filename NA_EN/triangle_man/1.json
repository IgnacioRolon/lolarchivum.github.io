Similar champion related particles/abilities cause this problem as well such as Zed's shadows.  It will also make it more difficult to target/last hit a minion.\n\nIn the near future we hope to have a list of all known issues and this one will definitely be included.\n\nSorry I couldn't be more helpful, but this type of bug would take a substantial system overhaul and provide comparatively (to other more serious bugs) less value.","replies":[{"poster":"slamor","date":"2014-09-24T22:24:23.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is this the counterplay to thresh we have been looking for all along?","replies":[{"poster":"MikeEatsAss","date":"2014-09-24T23:38:58.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has actually been going on, on and off for a while. In season 3 I believe (Or early season 4) you could use wards to the same effect as using Orianna's ball as well as yourself. It was quite annoying until rito finally fixed the ward part","replies":[]}]}]}]}
