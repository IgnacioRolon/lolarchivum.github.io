The summoner name on the account is FMF. I have contacted riot support and got a response from Riot turkey but considering there is a language barrier i would like to deal with North American support. If there is any way to lock the account and get it back to NA i would really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-13T22:48:41.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go ahead and reach out to us in another [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), but this time do **not** sign in.
