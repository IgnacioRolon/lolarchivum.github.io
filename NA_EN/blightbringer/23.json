The only thing that I actually really enjoy about the current Aatrox is his Voice Lines, Visuals, Personality. But when it comes to Gameplay, I feel like i'm playing Riven when ever I use Q, Viktor when I use W, or Graves when I use E.\n\nI get that the previous Aatrox design had its flaws but they exchanged (almost got rid of it at this point) half of his sustain possibility from old Aatrox for extra damage on the new Aatrox.\n\nLiterally every time I go to r/AatroxMains Subreddit, everyone asks for a Revert EVERY SINGLE DAY. I'm pretty certain that at this point almost everyone didn't like this rework because it doesn't feel original and that it missed it's goal.\n\nI miss old Aatrox https://i.imgur.com/pxyBgZr.png[]","replies":[{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2019-03-13T21:32:09.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, he went from the best sustain/auto-based champion (imo, only matched by Olaf) to a spell-based AD mage. \n\nThe visuals are completely different, he went from a slim, imp-like demon to large and with a wide sword.

However, his gameplay is too different.\n\nI bought Justicar Aatrox because I love lifesteal splitpushers so much. He was reworked ~6 months later and I played him &lt;10 times since. He's not even remotely close to what he was. I think his W was a big identifying factor for his gameplay, and his new Q made his playstyle too clunky. Imagine if Master Yi was reworked to make his Q a skillshot and his ult a dash. It's so different it's not even right, and I'd feel sorry for all Master Yi mains.\n\nI honestly wish I had a refund left, Justicar Aatrox was such a waste so quick. I can't do anything Aatrox used to do. Akali Rework is a good example of adding skill without completely changing gameplay to the point where her kit is unrecognizable from her old self. Some times, I just want to do Aatrox things but there's no champion that'll do it. My rageblade-ravenous boi remains in the void of deletion, and no other champion fulfills what he was.\n\nOn top of that, they added demolish so many, many champions can do what he did without even needing to 1v3.

I can understand wanting to move away from auto-attack based champs, but this just isn’t right. Bloodwell could’ve had the passive attack speed bonus changed to something else, fixed. His Q was fine, and actually would’ve made more sense with his current kit than his new E; imagine the World-Ender flying up to the air and crashing down into the enemy armies, causing a huge impact crater. Now imagine the “World-Ender” doing a slight dash into the enemy army. Which seems more appealing? If they wanted to slowly remove auto champs, they would have to remove his old W, yes. But this W is unsatisfactory and more often than not useless, at least in my experiences playing as and against Bbtrox. Maybe they could’ve made it similar to what it was but only working with abilities, but that seems unappealing. His E was commonly complained against, though mainly for its “weird” hitbox, and could be seen by some as less than useful compared to the rest of his kit. At least it made sense for a somewhat taller than an average human, ancient war machine with enough intelligence (and magic) to win nearly unwinnable battles hundreds of times over to be able to emit magic blades from himself every so often, compared to a hulking behemoth the size of a small-medium town and supposedly being one of the Ascended randomly smashing himself into the ground at his enemies, yet at the same time performing precise combat repositioning. His R needed to be replaced for certain, it wasn’t very interactive and only served to boost his passive. I like the new revive mechanic for him, but I dislike that his new R is literally just his old R and Passive, just remove the R damage, make the passive give you AD or whatever, and you can only use Bloodwell when you activate your R.\n\n I get that he’s supposed to have a form of PTSD from the Icathian rebellion, and that the entrapment process for him was unstable, and that he had spent thousands of years separated with the outside world. How the hell is he in any way stable enough to think rationally (Concepts such as vengeance against the Targonians, and the ability to recall pretty much all of his memories, plus enough planning and foresight to groom a new host in Tryndamere if that wasn’t retconned yet) let alone understand how his new form works the second a human touches him? It’s irritating that the Darkin all know how to project themselves from their new bodies the moment humans get near them, I don’t think Vai and Galmar or whatever their names are actually even came into contact with Varus. Hell, Aatrox was the Ascended of fair combat/Justice or whatever they call it, since according to lore the very concept he was bound to was erased from existence, and went to Icathia with Nasus. Nasus is the Ascended of Knowledge Preservation. Both noble concepts. Why is the guy dedicated to Justice and Fairness one of the first to fall to desire, but the guy who kept records of everything wasn’t even remotely interested in selfish needs? Because he had a little brother he was just forced to lock away? Why not use the dark powers everyone else was learning, _tell everyone else about the traitor that killed their emperor_ and team up with what immediately after the cataclysm were still his allies, and destroy the guy responsible for killing apparently the only person holding you guys in line and rescuing your brother?\n\nAppearance was less impressive, voice could’ve been better, like the personality for his lore though. Don’t like it for Aatrox, however.","replies":[]}]}
