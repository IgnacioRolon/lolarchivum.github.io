I assume that this was the ability that introduces the higher skill requirement to his new kit.\n\n* Sometimes this ability Critically Strikes and sometimes it doesn&#039;t, might be a bug perhaps, or maybe not, nothing is certain still.\n\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-champion-aatrox/en_US/3a2cd8032f93d3aadf42219a6c19ccfcc5e7792f/assets/img/global/accents/accent-pullquote.png\n\n##W: INFERNAL CHAINS\n\n* This ability doesn&#039;t really feel all that useful aside from the bonus CC that he already has. \n\n* The damage is really minor.\n\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-champion-aatrox/en_US/3a2cd8032f93d3aadf42219a6c19ccfcc5e7792f/assets/img/global/accents/accent-pullquote.png\n\n##E: UMBRAL DASH\n\n* The passive sustain is somewhat good at later stages of the game, but it&#039;s completely incomparable to what current Aatrox&#039;s sustain is like (current Aatrox has better sustain).\n\n* The active dash doesn&#039;t make any sense by looking how short the dash is, seems like a massive downgrade of what Dark Flight was. It just feels like it&#039;s used to serve to be used mainly as a synergy tool with his Q.\n\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-champion-aatrox/en_US/3a2cd8032f93d3aadf42219a6c19ccfcc5e7792f/assets/img/global/accents/accent-pullquote.png\n\n##R: WORLD ENDER\n\n* Nice Movement Speed boost.\n\n* The bonus damage is really un-noticeble (just gain a small amount of AD, very tiny).\n\n* Him having a revive every time he has R up is nice but outside of this and the Movement Speed boost it feels pointless.\n\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-champion-aatrox/en_US/3a2cd8032f93d3aadf42219a6c19ccfcc5e7792f/assets/img/global/accents/accent-pullquote.png\n\n##Conclusion\n\n_Positives_\n\n* Has a lot of CC to provide for his team.\n* Has potentially more reliable sustain, since now he isn&#039;t required to basic attack 3 times to heal anymore.\n* Has some-what more AoE damage.\n* Has some good catching potential with his W.\n* He might be a good jungler, with his AoE damage, Knock Ups and Sustain.\n* When Aatrox revives he can actually move now.\n\n_Negatives_\n\n* Quite weak on really close combat.\n* No longer has the ability to duel someone.\n* Q has potential of being good, but currently it offers opponents a window to engage while you cast the ability. \n* W having a similar issue as his E, having no offensive power aside from the CC or having the ability to catch someone.\n* E Active ability potentially too weak of an ability on it&#039;s own.\n* Using R feels underwhelming, in terms of offensive power.","replies":[{"poster":"Jarring","date":"2018-06-12T23:08:50.827+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":2,"body":"i just KNEW people were going to have trouble with his q once i found out the E was the dash that helps him land it. \nif they just made it so he can move during the skillshot like camille's it would feel better and easier to use/land and wouldn't even need the dash.. \nThey could just give the passive to his E making it a toggle between heal and dmg just like it was except that it works with skillshots as well. \nThen they could just revert the passive and ult to the way it used to be. \nIf it stays like this he's gonna have a lot of trouble landing that q against melee top laners.

What did these people based their assumptions on? On 1+ game and high lag, to accurately judge his mobility and player skill? Aatrox has 3 different AoE indicators for his Q, with the third one being a circular AoE that can very much hit people close to him, if they're stupid enough to duel inside his \"weaker\" double Q ranges.

Just gives you a chance to dodge/skill express. \n\nOnly thing imma agree with is that the E range is seriously laughable lol.

While Dark flight's range was longer, it had a long cast time and could be interrupted. The E is shorter but 2 cast means you can split the movement up and change directions fast, it also means u can jump 2 wall instead of one. Its also faster and that means less chance of getting interrupted. On its own the new E has trade offs compared to Dark Flight. But compare new E + new Q and i think the combo is superior to Dark Flight, as just a simple singular cast of E+Q has comparable range, and knock up, yet is faster, and that means less interruptable.\n\nOne thing that I do think would have been cool was if they extended the E range during the ult\n\nR\n\nHis ult is mainly about the revive more than anything else. The revive is a REALLY strong ability and take a HUGE chunk out of his power budget, so it would make since that the AD boost feels a bit weak...Because its mainly about the revive","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2018-06-13T13:10:46.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. The fact that it gives permanent 240 move speed out of combat means you can Quinn your way into fights, or chase *really* well. It has 12 second duration too.\n\nThe biggest reason revives are either worthless or meh is because you're stationary and out of the action. But this revive. is fast, *and you can move*. You no longer have the stupid situation where when you Rez all your targets are 600 units away from you and you need to reclose the distance.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2018-06-13T14:28:39.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not just the fact that your targets are 600 units away, but it was basically a zhonya that activated when you died; people like Caitlyn would just drop a trap on where you were going to revive and you could do nothing as you got snared by it and took an empowered attack. How champions like mages could toss out their CC spell exactly when you would get up and you couldn't dodge it.\n\nIn other words, it went from \"only really useful when both of us die in laning and I have this\" to something that can be much more helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2018-06-13T14:57:29.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. I feel like people are really, really underselling the strength of the ult, simply because we've *never had* anything like it before. The closest comparisons are \"Sion passive, but he's *invulnerable* for a short while\", and \"Kled dismount, but it takes a lot longer and is mobile\". It's honestly one of the strongest ults I've seen in this game, excluding global teleportation ults and giant AoE ults.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zeromatsu","date":"2018-06-13T11:34:10.329+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not played him myself yet, but his numbers seem fine?\n\nPassive up to 16% max health dmg is huge.\n\nQ has 80% scaling which makes it really good to use, especially since you get even more dmg for every additional cast and if you hit the marked area. \nHe probably needs to build more ad now.\n\nW dmg is meh, cc is not bad.\n\nE is not just the dash:\nIt gives you 20% physical dmg healing, so EVEN FROM SKILLS.

You can control the Revive unlike before.\n\nTbh all the negative points some of you posted are part of his \"counterplay\"...

I've been playing him only jungle though since I really dont enjoy top lane.  HIs clears are good, ganks are decent and can be good if you do them right.  I dont know what his gameplay fantasy is supposed to be, but personally when I play him I feel like I'm just in the middle of the teamfight swinging my sword like a maniac and having fun.  I think he is going to be played very tanky with items like cleaver, trinity, or titanic into tank.  Also if you pop your ult kinda early and have a spirit visage and revitalize you are going to heal a fuck ton of hp when you revive.  I also think his e feels great.  It has great synergy with q and lets him get over thin walls and still have another charge.  I still have to try him full tank though, might be good with all the cc he can put out.  Also you prob wanna try to get 40% cdr on him.  Idk I like him, but people think he isnt that great.

If Aatrox walks over this pool of blood he will consume it healing himself. If an enemy champ walks over a blood pool they will destroy it. Blood pools last 6 sec.
