But once he takes full control and enough time passes, he will begin to change and begin to look somewhat familiar alongside the other Darkin...\n\nhttps://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq1Fd0WK.png%3Fnoredirect&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=150, {{champion:266}}\n\nThing is we still don't know what {{champion:110}}  looked like before and after becoming a Darkin, because his current appearance in most skins is now based of 2 people from the merge.

All the events you're experiecing in the lore all happen at, relatively, the same time. For example, the new Aspects being chosen, Aurelion returning to Runeterra and Azir resurrection. All that happens in succession and near each other.\nLIke you said, Varus was freed recently. You won't see him take full control for a long time, because of how League's timeline works. Time is \"still\".\n\n***\n> [{quoted}](name=Darkin Hybrid,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Fhq2gvKv,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-16T13:18:20.687+0000)\n>\n> he will begin to change and begin to look somewhat familiar alongside the other Darkin...\n\nNot necessarily. It baffles me why people assume Aatrox and Rhaast are the norm. Let's not forget 5 other darkin exist. Rhaast and Aatrox are only 2/5 of them. Why assume they are the norm and not the exception?\nBesides, Varus is different. While Aatrox and Rhaast took possession of **one** mortal body, Varus **crafted** his body using **two**. We don't know the limitations of their magic (blood magic). All we know is their form isn't exactly how they looked like before, at least for Aatrox's case.\n***\n> [{quoted}](name=Darkin Hybrid,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Fhq2gvKv,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-16T13:18:20.687+0000)\n>\n> So I am just wondering will we ever see Varus at full power, as a full Darkin like his brethren \n\nIf anything, Varus is **more** powerful than both those guys, lore wise in the current events of the timeline.\nRhaast hasn't taken full control over Kayn's body.\nAatrox is looking for a new host because his current body is weak and \"dying\".\nVarus literally crafted his body recently and that's the pivotal point. Because he used two bodies and not one, his power should be way above any of the other four (unless a similar process was used or the host is a particularly powerful entity).\n\nFinally, neither of them will ever come close to their brethren full power. Why? Because darkin are cursed Ascended people. The other dozens of Darkin were destroyed and the 5 that remain will never be at full power again.\n###### Unless they find a way to break the spell. Maybe on another universe ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-11-16T23:56:26.993+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correction, Aatrox's form is comprised of many flesh bags not just one like you've claimed. \n\nAlso Rhaast's in-game design is entirely in the context of a \"what if\" the Darkin reached full potential. But beyond it's visual we have zero context behind how Rhaast could manage to achieve that exact look. Possible Kayn's fully absorbed flesh still wouldn't produce that exact same Darkin form we see in-game. If Aatrox needs multiple people to reach some semblance of true form, wouldn't Rhaast (and Varus) have to do the same?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-11-16T13:46:22.561+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it'd be fun if it were a legendary skin where he was the full darkin.","replies":[{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-11-16T13:51:31.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah sounds interesting.
