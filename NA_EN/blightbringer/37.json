No matter which civilization will win, the technology will always win. Even if Piltover don't win the war, their techs will be used by others regions. \n\nThe only case where it's wouldn't happend would be if Bandle city took control of the world because they are creatures living in the forest. Obviously, they don't like technology because it's destroying nature. \n\nDemacia is afraid of magic but, i don't think J4 would prevent Piltover from using techs. After all, Piltover isn't really an enemy of Demacia, and J4 is more open-minded and i think he would allow it. Ofc now he is a little bit against mages but i'm sure Shyvana will do something and cure his anger. \n+ technology isn't really magic, even if they use hextech, does Demacians see hextech as magic? I'm sure Piltovians could say \"it's not magic, it's hextech\" and Demacian people would not see it because they are so misinformed on magic. They know what magic is but they don't know what hextech is. \n\nBut Noxus would use them to develop their society. \n\nFrejlord would be interested in some techs because they are living in a hard region (cold, savage and everything). \n\nAzir or Xerath are power hungry and if Shurima took the world, they would use Piltover techs. \n\nIxtal with Qiyana, even if she don't like Piltovians, i'm sure she could find a way to use their techs for something. After all, when you discover comfort, you don't want to destroy it right? When she will learn about robots servants who can serve her at full energy, or when she will heard about social medias, i think she may change her mind on Piltovians and use their techs but turning them into slaves. \n\n\nThe shadow isles, i don't know because i don't really know the purpose of Mordekaiser. Does he want to control the world or kill the world? I think he would still use Piltover tech. \n\nBilgewater is full of pirates and i'm sure they are 100% interested in techs, especially when it's can give them power and money. \n\n\nIonia is peaceful like you said and Piltover won't have any problem to develop and expand their techs.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyronaaxa","date":"2020-01-02T00:12:34.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe technology will rule since magic literally exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-01-03T14:13:03.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes.

Because Bandle City is \"a place of unfettered magic, where the foolhardy can be led astray by myriad wonders, and end up lost in a dream...\nIn Bandle City, it is said that every sensation is heightened for non-yordles. Colors are brighter. Food and drink intoxicates the senses for years and, once tasted, will never be forgotten. The sunlight is eternally golden, the waters crystal clear, and every harvest brings a fruitful bounty. Perhaps some of these claims are true, or maybe none—for no two taletellers ever seem to agree on what they actually saw.\n\nOnly one thing is known for certain, and that is the timeless quality of Bandle City and its inhabitants.\"\n\nIf it Ruled over Runeterra, the whole **REALITY** would change and people would go INSANE... And that is for everyone, even undeads and void creatures would be confused of the weirdness of Bandle. Is that Flower talking to you? yep, that is normal now, you can literally taste the rainbow now... and you will NEVER forget the flavour. Is that person REALLY a human or just a yordle in disguise? No one knows. What time is it? there is no time. Its this just a dream?

Demacia is Sparta/ Greece. Noxus is Rome. Shurima is Egypt, Targon is somewhat like Israel or whatnot, Frejlord are just local tribes in the Antarctica lol. The others seem to be more localized so to speak, like Zaun is Honk Kong etc.But yeah imo, Noxus is clearly expanding, Demacia is firmly holding it's ground, Ionia isn't really used to war but now that they had no choice and they had a taste, if you imagine Irelia as a leader they could play that game just fine I guess but they're about counter attack at that point, it's like Russia vs US, if the fight comes to them they can match them but if they have to take the initiative they sorta land locked and aren't going anywhere or not land locked but still same shiz rly.
