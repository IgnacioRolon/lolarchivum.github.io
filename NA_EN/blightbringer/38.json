There needs to be more high AD items like Bloodthirster without a whole lot else there so that it's more comparable to AP items.\n\nLifeline needs to be more common among the items, simply because it is very good against burst without being overly powerful.\nDefinitely damage/defense hybrids especially for AP items.
