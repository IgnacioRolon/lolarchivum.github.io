Some champions even get uncessary hate.\n\n>Examples:\n\n* {{champion:427}} Ivern - The most positive living being in all of League of Legends, who loves nature and all of it's animals. A person who is half man, half treant. But most people don't play him because he is seen as another champion who just \"presses to shield\" their ally and that's it. While his other abilities are completely ignored just because he has a shield based ability.\n\n* {{champion:136}} Aurelion Sol - A space dragon who was born at the very time the very existence itself was formed. Who has the ability to destroy and forge stars at his will. This guy is actually hilarious, his voice lines are awesome (BOOP). But he is also another case of a champion who can be often looked passed because he isn't able to do those flashy plays that (Zed, Katarina, Yasuo are known for), which these champions are often what draw players naturally.\n\n* {{champion:32}} Amumu - While Amumu slightly suffers from old design visuals, one thing has always remained unique about him, he is the saddest guy in all of League of Legends (Opposite of Ivern). He's sad because he can't find any friends as a cursed mummy, and no other champion is remotely close to being the same as Amumu in terms of mood. One of his abilities even allows him to cry in game, which no other champion is able to do making him stand out the most out of all champions.\n\n* {{champion:432}} Bard - An odd celestial being of some kind, who isn't able to speak in human form. But still makes interesting noises of his own to make up for that, and I sometimes wonder what they mean. Bard isn't often-ly played because of what role he is categorised in, a support. A role that is known to not have a lot of players who enjoy playing it.\n\n>***\n\nI could go on with the list of other champions but you get the idea. I find it quite sad how cool champions such as these don't receive the same amount of love as other favourite-d champions do.\n\nHonorable mentions: {{champion:203}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:6}} \n\n>***\n\n##Do you agree with any of this?

Karthus and Xerath were two of my favorites before their lore was trashed. Karthus was just dripping with potential, and tons of hints were tossed around during his background beforehand - and then Riot turned him into your generic death-focused evil cleric/lich. Xerath? Well, they kind of re-wrote him for Azir's sake which really annoyed me.\n\nThey fell short on Renekton, who's story was great until he ascended. Then it was all downhill, as the writers missed that it was the evil in the hearts of common men which inevitably lead to his disappointment and disillusionment with mankind, which eventually caused him to descend into madness.\n\nNasus? He was done right. Swain was done right. They CAN get it right from time to time. Riven? That's really on the fence. I'm going to remain hopeful, but if her lore ends up trashed I'm done with investing myself in what RIOT's cranking out. I can only take the lore of 3 of my favorites being trashed.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-06-08T09:19:10.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly Renektons reason for going mad in the old lore felt extremely forced and nonsensical to me.\n\n\nIt would have been ok if he had just become evil,but he downright descended into madness,that caused him to go after his brother just because he encountered a lot of evil guys.\n\nHim going mad from being locked up in a dark room with an angry Xerath for a millenia makes much more sense and his sacrifice made his fall all the more tragic.","replies":[{"poster":"Axzarious","date":"2018-06-09T00:58:30.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Forced? Nonsensical? That some great being gifted with the ability to see the true nature of humans - the nature of whom might even be invisible to themselves? To at first be disappointed in their ambitions, which then leads to a sadness. Then such emotions turn to anger at the injustice of it, finally culminating in an attempt to see if he could perhaps 'save' these individuals, cutting the evil from them? It doesn't work. Something snaps as the slow erosion of his mind continues. Some part of Renekton remains buried beneath the madness, yearning for an end to his suffering. That last shred of Renekton knows the only one who can end it is his brother, and so he confronts Nasus. It fails, and his mind crumbles further. He's forgotten why he does what he does, too broken by the constant pain to understand he's seeking everything he'd lost. It's a miracle he still remembers his brother, and so he relentlessly seeks him out like a desperate animal - Because some minuscule shred of his mind desperately attempts to grasp the last thread of hope it remembers.\n\nThere's something inherently tragic about a God that is not undone by any great evil, but slowly worn down by the common folk. A monument to their hopes, dreams, and aspirations slowly worn down by the countless burdens such a beacon bears until it snaps, then becoming a mockery of the ideal and exposing the obvious, ugly truth. A mirror showing the humans what they really were all along.\n\nThey really missed an opportunity for something grand : Renekton becoming a literal manifestation of the brutality born of Shurima's greed, avarice, and ambition - to really drive home that even if Azir HAD freed the slaves before it all, the atrocities done in his name could never be covered or buried. (Or hell, he could have just gradually gone insane before Azir was ever relevant. I'm not a fan of older characters being dumpstered because some people at RIOT want to re-write other champions for the sake of their newest release, instead of doing something with the potential and themes the original champions were rife with.)","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-06-09T11:30:04.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way you describe it sounds all great and poetic,but the end result is still that Renekton went mad because he met a bunch of evil guys and eventually descended into insanity because of it.\n\nWe humans ourselves know just how wicked,cruel and evil some of us can be(especially in the past),but most of us don't turn insane because of it.\n\nI guess it would have worked if Renekton was a more magical being whose mind is more directly affected by this,like a spirit or something like that,but in that case they would have needed to write all the ascended around him and not the other way around.","replies":[{"poster":"Axzarious","date":"2018-06-10T11:31:23.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, if you want to put it simply, that's the way it is. If you want to distill the current situation we have, it basically boils down to \"Renekton drags Xerath into a closet, they sit there for a while till Xerath is all like \"Your brother is a dick.\" and Rekenton's all like \"That asshole! I'm gonna kick his ass.\"\n\nRenekton already was a being like that originally with his ability to see the hearts of men. Imagine if you could read people like a book? That WOULD impact any person, and slowly wear them down over time.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that RIOT is notorious for demolishing the themes that made the characters who they were, when they could have easily carried them over. Aside from the visual overhauls with champion reworks, I think RIOT could have created things much more positively recieved if they'd kept the themes originally present for champions - Yes, he could still be a frost troll, but after bearing the curse of his tribe he leaves, finds lissandra and conspires with her, then returns to his people a king. \n\nA good deal of the Shuriman reworks are incredibly contrived when viewed as a whole, and it's a miracle Nasus was largely unscathed. Almost all of it reads as if it were written for and around Azir, and it probably was. While I can understand that Xerath might have had niche appeal on the lore front, they chucked everything he was into the trash bin, and made him a caricature similar to your typical one-note cartoon villain.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-06-06T01:48:19.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, some champions' lores actually just make the fact that their kit is garbage that much more disappointing.\n\nI love Fiddlesticks but he's basically a troll pick right now outside of being a counterpick to a few Supports.\n\nHell, the only reason I play champions like Kindred and Vi when they're out of the meta is because of their lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Budget Yami","date":"2018-06-05T23:43:23.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, uhm ppl play lol for the game not the lore.\nBUT i see your point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-05T22:06:02.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because this is a game, and people care about gameplay primarily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-06-08T10:39:35.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A majority will almost always play champioms because of their kit, they can ne interested in their lore too but that's a minority.\nI myself usually read bios and if i get interested enough I go and check their kit out, and skins too obviously. xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyquiem","date":"2018-06-06T04:13:55.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’m surprised {{champion:268}} not on the list, he has armies following him, he can just crush noxus or icathia.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-06-08T09:21:24.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Icathia is only a ruin now and he is currently busy with Xerath anyway.\n\nAlso we don't even know if his army can even leave the desert in the lore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-07T17:59:30.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Amumu\n\n>  he is the saddest guy in all of League of Legends \n\nI'll have to disagree.\n\n{{champion:72}} is atleast, if not more sad than Amumu is.\n\nThink about it.\n\nAmumu can't have any friends, right?\n\nWell Skarner had friends, but his friends were also his family and they were brutally slain right in front of him.\n\nAnd he had to leave behind the only ones that survived to set out for the crystals stolen from his dead brethren so he's not even sure there's any family to return to when he gets home.\n\nNow let me ask you this:\n\nWould you rather never have any friends for the rest of your life?\n\nOr get friends, and then have them brutally murdered before your very eyes as the first thing you see when you've just woken up?","replies":[{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-06-07T18:33:56.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, that's rough.

People might still warm to it if it was a big part of the actual game, but the fact is, very little background exists in the game; an ancient space dragon who forges stars is a cool concept, but when you select this character in-game, you find his size relative to champions like Garen makes him look more like a mutant sausage dog than a godlike star dragon - and one that can be easily killed by a rodent boy-scout with a blowpipe, or by a slap in the face from someone in a pool party outfit.

You don't fully have to play League to read up on these champions to appreciate their backstories or themes. Hell, I do that with a bit of Warcraft yet I've barely play WoW (at the very least I only play the starter edition). \n\nAnd even then, some people may like a champions lore but never play them or vise versa. I love the concepts of Sol but never play him due to how his kit works. I like playing Xin every now and again but don't give a shit about his lore (mainly because I don't think he has good lore).\n\nLong story short: People care about a champions kit more than there lore because at the end of the day it boils down to how that champ plays in-game. Is there kit good? Does it bring something unique? It is meta? etc. The lore side of things is more niche for those in the community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alex Luu","date":"2018-06-06T04:05:55.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"because we don't use their story in gameplay,\nyou: \"My champion is a space dragon!\" \nenemy team: \"damn dude, ok we give up , you're too good!\"","replies":[]}]}
