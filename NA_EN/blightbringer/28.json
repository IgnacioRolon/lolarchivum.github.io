People who play a lot of rank will get their ranked MMR higher than their nomral MMR. For instance, if someone makes  a smurf with the sole goal of having that account be in the gold elo range, they will get to level 30 then play mostly ranked, stagnating their normals MMR. \n\n2. People don't take normals as seriously and might have a lower winrate in it.\n\n3. Those people might be duo queueing with someone who is at, or lower than the rank that you are at.
