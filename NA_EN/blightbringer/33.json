In addition the reason why I placed in the Domination tree is because there were already sustain runes in the Domination tree, such as: Taste of Blood, Revenous Hunter. I know that this rune would usually go in the Precision tree but it already has Fleet Footwork.\n\nDark Harvest is more of a \"become a scaling champ\" rune, similar to what Gathering Storm does. And both take quite a while to become effective. Your first time Riven can give the enemy toplaner full stacks and permission to roam in the first five minutes.\n\nRavenous Hunter stacks on unique kills, so it doesn't become more than half-strength till the player has roamed or at least joined some teamfights; this maxes out as soon as a top or jungle gank makes a two or three mistakes. (I don't remember ever using Taste of Blood, unless maybe I was copying a rune page from a guide in a hurry; so no comment on that.)\n\n\nI think a better way for it to work and fit the Domination theme would be for it to forbid healing normally, and gain stacks equal to number of attacks made or a figure based on damage dealt with bonus stacks for takedowns. The stacks are consumed over time at some rate to increase the HP recovery rate by a factor related to how much health is missing and champion level.  This would let a champ go in hard with Warwick-like recovery if they're brought low during the brawl, but wouldn't be an immediate lifesteal.  You'd get sustain while playing a Domination burst strategy and enough recovery for a time afterward that you won't limp away from a near-death experience so low that the minions or an enemy joining late could easily finish you off, and with it also factoring champion level, it could become like a pseudo-Warmogs in late game, ensuring that if you survive a team fight you can recover enough to work on an objective or to hold your ground till your teammates can get organized again.","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-04-23T18:29:04.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking more along the lines of changing it to be a more powerful, assassin-oriented Triumph.\nSomething like, if you kill a target within 4 seconds, gain 40% damage reduction for 2.5 seconds while you restore 50-200 (+25% AD/20% AP, adaptive) over the duration. Getting another kill within this time refreshes the duration and does not grant any extra healing.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-04-23T18:19:29.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So let me get this straight:\nOne \"enemy\" slain and I instantly get 7.5% lifesteal, AND 7.5% spellvamp?
