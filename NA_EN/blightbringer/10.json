But we will somehow manage and adapt..... Hoping to farm some up-votes from my fellow junglers.\n\n\n\nImo, direction is not right. I am ok with the intention but I am not okay with the direction. Sure they want to stop junglers from hitting level 3 and ganking a lane when laners are level 2. For that you need to lower early exp from jungle camps and lower the spawn time, so that they could hit 6 at the same time as solo laners. I read some where some bdshfggfgchjbhjh wanted junglers to have just lower exp so they couldn't hit 6 when bot lanes was 5, prolly an adc main. Jungle is ONE lane it needs to have significance and higher exp than from a shared exp lane. \n\nThe current direction just forces more interaction from laners to help their junglers. In solo Q you cant expect that, a lot of the time they don't even help when they pushed their lanes because they was a proper back timer or some other excuse. And what about weak early junglers they get more jdfgdhgfbb because they cant contest scuttle. sated devourer jungle era was the right direction, sure the item was OP but the numbers could have been adjusted, could have been tuned/nerfed. Early game gankers were useful early and shit late and that is the point of picking an early game jungler. and a farming jungler was shit early and useful late, and that is how junglers should be.\n\nAnd what about the invisibility issue? Khazix, Akali, Kaisa, Vayne, Shaco etc. Renger, Eve and Twitch at-least have limitations. You want to try to 1v1 an Akali, she wins if you don't use your ult, and if you use your ult  she shrouds for 8 fghjgfdj seconds after that she zhonyas. And then Akali main would say but what about talon, talon has his Ult he has to abhdsgfhvbjbjs spend CD for that invisibility we could have atleast some time to get to him.
