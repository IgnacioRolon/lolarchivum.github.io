So you should build Armor since you can't build Health against her, right? Nope! Guinsoo's also gives Total Armor-Pen! (Yes I know, it is based upon level, but it nonetheless exists) On top of the Last Whisper item ( {{item:3036}} or {{item:3033}} , take your pick) she is sure to have built. (I know, the Armor-Pen between the two items does not stack, and thanks to other changes, she may not build Guinsoo's anymore)\n\nSo, the two things that you are supposed to build to counter the things she offers, Physical Damage and True Damage, which are supposed to be counter-built via Armor and Health respectively, she renders BOTH of them moot! Her True Damage allows her to bypass high armor, and the Max HP% OF that True Damage allows her to bypass high health!\n\nEDIT: Sorry, remembered that part of this was in a comment from a Riven post.\n\nTHIS is why she is often seen as a problem to Fighter and Tank players such as Critmaster here and myself.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Cack","date":"2019-07-23T22:14:00.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xnOfUrRJ,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000020000,timestamp=2019-07-23T21:53:08.888+0000)\n>\n> did vaynes kit change in those years except for number tunings? no, so of course she was garbage stat check design back then, and is still garbage stat check design today.\n\nyeah they nerfed it badly so it sucks now.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-07-23T22:16:48.771+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Krispy Cack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xnOfUrRJ,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000200000000,timestamp=2019-07-23T22:14:00.495+0000)\n>\n> yeah they nerfed it badly so it sucks now.\n\n51% winrate, 14.6% pickrate.\n\nliterally unplayable, kek.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jng Account","date":"2019-07-23T20:27:41.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"If she is aaing you, she won't dmg others, that's it, that's her trade off.
