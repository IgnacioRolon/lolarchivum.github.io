If Riot really is equalizing the power of the different drake/dragon types, then it follows that the CD refund from Cloud Dragon Soul is probably about as impactful as Spear of Shojin's passive, plus it's a permanent effect for the whole team for the rest of the game and also procs off of ability casts. Of course, this depends on whether Cloud is the \"dominant\" drake that game (randomly selected), and on whether a team has killed four drakes. That's a ton less consistent than putting the effect onto an item. It sounds like a brand new balance problem to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-11-16T15:49:53.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know the irony?
