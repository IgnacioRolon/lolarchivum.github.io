They can come in from the side and gain access to the target they want easily, but they don't lock that person (or multiple targets down) to let the team gain access to them.\n\nAlistar, Braum, and Sion have disengage; they have the ability to force targets away from their team / apply heavily punishing ground-based CC effects which lets your team open up considerable distance on any would-be attackers, letting them disengage.\n\nWhat assassins have is limited CC tools. Usually a short duration slow, and maybe a contextual root, which allows them to stick the target they want in place for enough time to hurt them.\n\nAatrox, Warwick, and Soraka have sustain. They bring the ability to heal themselves (in Soraka's case, an ally) through heavy amounts of damage taken; requiring some combination of multi-person focus, well used hard CC, and grevious wounds before they'll succumb.\n\nWhat (some) assassins have is short-term survival tools. Pyke's design is almost perfect, what with how he's rewarded (by staying alive) for weaving in and out of fights. Rengar can partially heal back damage taken over a short window, but other than that doesn't 'sustain' much of anything. Ekko can reset the clock, if he's not hard CC'd.\n\nThe only valid point you have is assassins having the highest burst.

The way Riot added _certain_ resistance to certain champion classes when season 8 started was not an adequate response.

It was nonsensincal imo compared to an equal amount of each armor/mr to ranged and maybe a bit more for melee.\n\nI'm sure the intention was to decrease time to kill. And I thought it was very funny at first during preseason. But I was like, \" they're gonna dial it back... Right? There's no conceivable way they can leave the game in this clown fiesta state for an entire competitive season.\" But I also thought they wanted to go this way so I am not surprised this small indie game design company did not dial it back at least a little bit. (they opted for bandaid-ing resolve, which wasn't quite the source of the issue)\n\nThe resolve tree is not as good as old defense runes. But it also shouldn't it be. Because everyone would be forced to spec defense at least off spec. Which largely kills the system imo. And that is the design flaw with the current rune system.

I did mention him but I also said that he deserved the passive that he has because of him not being able to get any bonus health, additionally regardless if he is an Assassin he is still primarily a Support.","replies":[{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2018-08-15T03:43:00.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes he is an assassin played in a duo lane and he is still immovable, that's what I said, you can't poke him and you can't kill him (you can try but you are wasting your time and your resources) because he is too fckin tanky. tanky supports like braum, leona or nautilus are a joke in comparison and are easy to push around and out of lane. do you see the problem? how is that not a paradox? an assassin that is much more resistant and durable than actual tanky supports? zzz","replies":[{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-08-15T13:14:44.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is why you ward the bushes to prevent him from healing. In doing so he would have to walk a decent distance away from lane to get out of sight to heal back up resulting in him loosing xp.","replies":[{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2018-08-15T13:24:27.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's ineffective unless you can simultaneously freeze the lane in a good spot and ward both lane bushes, the bush river, the tribush river and the enemy turret... which isn't reasonable.","replies":[{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-08-15T14:54:55.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do agree that it's not a good enough reason, (I know I said this already) but I think he needs that passive that he has because he can't build any health it put's him in risk (as specially now when the game is so bursty and one shot's are everywhere). \n\nAdditionally statistic-wise he's considered to be the most balanced champion with a 49.92% Winrate (50% is considered the ideal balance) and 13.79% Pickrate.\n\nI guess the issue with Pyke is learning to play against him better, learning his weak and strong points (similar to Thresh or Blitzcrank). Thresh only really has CC, and no real defensive tools to offer his team besides his W (Lantern), so it's always good to engage on his team-mate first and then target him second. Blitzcrank is somewhat similar to Thresh except for the one thing that he has no utility to offer to his team.\n\nPyke usually uses his W to start engages (not always but sometimes), if he does use that to your advantage to engage on him because he's more squishier (and he won't be able to escape to heal up any damage that you deal) but try to avoid his CC to not allow him to trigger his Aftershock that will grant him an enormous amount of Resistances, if he does anyway just wait it out as it doesn't last very long and then use all the damage from your abilities on him. Dodging his E is easy, if you don't get pushed towards the side of a wall, you just need to always walk backwards in a left or right direction (depending in which direction he jumped towards you). His Q is somewhat dodge-able due to the animation time, allowing you to have some time to react. His R can be easily countered by things like a (Summoner Spell: Heal) or any other form of healing source if timed right (Redemption).\n\nI hope this is somewhat more reasonable.","replies":[{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2018-08-15T15:10:26.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine with his win rate and overall playstyle, I just wish he was less non-interactive in lane and I question his identity when clearly some of his strengths overlap with the strengths of an opposite class of champions. Saying he can't build health is iffy because most assassins don't build health anyway and he is still a lot more tanky than a Zed with a Black Cleaver for example.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, any lane with a Pyke is a snoozefest and I know nothing is going to happen and we will simply have to wait for the mid game before starting to play the game,  which is probably the opposite of the kind of gameplay an assassin should encourage. No risk, no reward is the gameplay of a tank, not an assassin.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
