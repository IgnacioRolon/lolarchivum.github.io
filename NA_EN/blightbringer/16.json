As she rolled her shoulders and sighed with exhaustion, her armor gleamed in the mix of neon light pouring through her parlor window.\n\n“To see the Moon again...” said she, walking to it and placing one palm against the glass.\n\nThe city blinked and buzzed on.  It was midnight, but the light pollution had drowned out the stars for decades.  Diana shut her eyes and imagined the great pale disc she had witnessed one evening drive into the countryside.  A tear rolled down her cheek.\n\nThe searing glow of the future had not burned religion from the world.  Indeed, more than a cloistered few had turned away from the world and into scripture.  Diana once had.  She had visited an old temple on a mountain far from this place to pray to the sun.\n\nBut now the solar idols and scrolls on her shelves only brought her misery.  She had discovered that the Moon, whose light the elders of the temple had forbidden as false, once too was worshipped at another temple on the very same mountain.  She rushed to her elders with the news, but they rejected her, and she had fled with what she had found.\n\nIt was a mighty suit of powered armor.  Unlike those of the rumored PROJECT, it fit around her body rather than replace it.  She could take it off.  Moreover, it let her hack into augmentics and organics alike, paralyzing them with wireless viruses or arcs of electricity.  It was designed to turn the world upside down.\n\nIndeed, the potential of its power for betrayal was the stated reason that G/NETIC turned her down when she jumped at its call for champions.  But Diana knew better.  She had kept its Lunar crests, and when she saw that Leona’s augmetics bore those of her old Solar temple, Diana knew she would never be allowed to join.\n\nShe still wanted to help.  G/NETIC’s call had awoken within her the heroism having inspired her search for the mountain temple.  It was time to act—to change the course of this drifting world before it was too late.  Diana had read widely and eagerly of chances to make a difference.\n\nOne stood out.  It came from a conspiracy theory website with a reputation for delivering on even its gloomiest predictions.  PROGRAM was alive.  It was malevolent.  It wanted to take over the planet and remake it into an unrecognizable landscape of software and hardware.  Its motivation was unknown but purpose unmistakable.\n\nDiana had decided that she needed to act.  Someone needed to investigate PROGRAM outside the usual channels of bribed inspectors and influential executives.  Someone needed to get through its defenses and learn its means, ends, and why it had them.  And if PROGRAM turned out to be even half the threat that the site described, someone needed to stop it.\n\nDiana slumped onto her couch and put her feet on the coffee table.  Tonight had been a careful expedition into the inner reaches of PROGRAM’s influence: a server farm on the periphery of the city.  Hacking in and reading the files, she discovered documents in a language that she none of her searches could explain.  Associated files mentioned individuals and places she could never find.  There were references to plans and ideas she had never heard of.  It was as though PROGRAM had come from another world.\n\nIt was time to warn this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2018-04-22T20:24:42.055+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}  Whoa.

First, I wanted to add religion and religious discrimination to the PROJECT-verse, since were among the few practices and vices yet unmentioned there.  \n\nIndeed, cyberpunk being about how ugly humanity can misuse beautiful technology—a cynical bookworm’s parting shot at an arrogant geek—I wish that such aspects of the champions’ lives and society were further explored in their skin biographies or color stories.  Vi’s story touched the nitty-gritty details of daily life, character, and society that defines the genre but never dove into it.\n\nRegardless, I also tried to make PROGRAM embody or equal the Void to unify the universe with the canon lore, suggesting that each skin-verse is another version of Runeterra.  This change raises the stakes for G/NETIC, Battlecast, and the Resistance, who must work together to save the planet from an AI that would seek to consume it.\n\n****\n\nPS.
