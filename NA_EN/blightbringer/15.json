The technology takes over your soul.\"\n― Lisa 'Saiyaka' Thorn, Visual designer\n\n\"Artists decided to keep PROJECT skins people-sized, though the champions have fused and augmented their bodies using some big, crazy technology. 'In order to become PROJECT you have to surrender your humanity,' says Lisa 'Saiyaka' Thorn, a visual designer. 'The technology takes over your soul.'\n\nPROJECT champs aren't just soulless husks, though. Little clues point to their human origin: Yasuo's leather glove, Leona's exposed jaw, Master Yi's wuju-sculpted washboard abs. These aren’t robots—they’re just seriously tricked out people.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, PROJECT is about transforming the “mere human” forms of champions using technology, and the shape language the artists used reflects that. 'When champs use their heightened PROJECT powers, it’s through shapes and geometry that fit their unique characteristics,' says Thorn.\"\n\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/creative-spotlight/how-project-champs-transcended-humanity","replies":[]},{"poster":"Echo61","date":"2018-05-30T13:15:41.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. I dont know why everyone thinks ANY champ could get a PROJECT: Skin.

Each of the themes are technological, and each of them fit fairly well with their champions.\n\nZed is a cyborg ninja, not unlike Raiden from Metal Gear or... **shudders** G-G-Genji.\n\nHe's sleek and fast and crippling, much like the designs of his blades and particles.\n\nBattlecast Urgot is... something. Not unlike the Metal Gear Rex or ZEKE.\n\nHe's heavy, packs a punch, and is essentially a one-man/tank/monster-army. His particles are fiery like Hell itself, with the sounds of pumps and machinery.\n\nProgram Camille is a Hunter AI. In hindsight, she fits better into PROJECT than Program, but whatever. Same applies to her as Zed.\n\nMecha Zero Sion is a giant war machine of metal and... whatever that blue energy shit is.\n\nHe's bulky, titanic, and could probably level Manhattan in about a few days (based on his in-game size). If we're going by his lore-form, which the Login Screen encapsulated so well, he could probably level Manhattan in half a day. The high-tech whirring and corrupted-sounding VO perfectly match up with this idea of a Renegade Mecha. The Prototype, if you will.\n\nEach of these skin lines has a central idea to them.\n\nPROJECT, having humans-- strictly humans-- as the base for their skins.\n\nBattlecast, having monstrosities, or all-out supernatural beings, regardless of anatomy.\n\nProgram... I don't really know. They seem to be geared more towards the magical-champions (mainly those with SOME level of humanoid shape), including Hextech-powered ones it seems. Expect a Program Orianna coming SoonTM.\n\nMecha is larger humanoid beings, mostly a few feet taller than the average human. The current champions also seem to be very... bloodthirsty and violent.\n\nASol could fit in Battlecast or Eternum, which doesn't have a specific central idea to it. I mean, the only thing it has going for it is the fact that all the current champions have tails, hence why there's no Eternum Zed (that'd look hype af tho) or Eternum Ryze (also hype af).\n\nPersonally, I think Eternum would be a better fit, as both ASol and the Eternum creatures are alien in origin and nature. Tho, frankly, I don't know how I feel about ASol getting a second skin as a red/reddish one, as we already have Ashen Lord (which also has fiery effects).\n\nSo there's really, a large majority of techno-skins that champions can fall into. Excluding a few like Hextech, Super Galaxy, \n\n{{champion:34}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:19}} -Battlecast\n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:420}} (honestly a better fit than Battlecast smh) {{champion:427}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:38}} (he can go with either PROJ or Prog) {{champion:7}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:110}} (once again, a good PROJECT pick as well),{{champion:8}}, {{champion:83}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:143}}: Program\n\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:5}}: PROJECT \n\n{{champion:111}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:154}}: Mecha\n\n{{champion:201}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:15}}: Resistance\n\nSo on and so forth. There are a lot of champions who could fit into other techno-skins aside from these four. Lancer Warrior Pantheon, Hextech ASol, Super Galaxy Quinn, etc.\n\nRiot isn't limited in the slightest. Maybe they're limited to the STORIES they can tell, for example, we're missing out on a PROJECT Zed vs PROJECT Shen story now because Shen is Pulsefire, and so he's not a part of PROJECT's story. But speaking in terms of skins strictly, I'd argue that Riot has a large range of skins that can fit for any champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-05-31T12:55:36.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't expect such a long thought out reply, nice one.

Altho Pulsefire isn't part of a specific universe, they can be in ANY universe. So if they visit PROJECT, it could technically count as an overlap.\n\nWhether it's due to inflation in a certain theme (like technological, hence why Kog has Battlecast but Hextech is a Mythic Skin), or the aforementioned narrative view, Riot never has created two skins from the same universe/theme for a champion.\n\nAnd I highly doubt Yi would be getting all that lmao.
