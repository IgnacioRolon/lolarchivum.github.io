I am able to log in, search for a game (after my 10 min que penalty due to an issue I havent been able to fix,) and once the game starts and the client itself opens, it remains as a black screen. I then get the error message you see in the imgur link. \r\n\r\nI have tried a multitude of solutions, including removing rad files in such way that was suggested in [this article](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2501061). I have flushed my dns manually, and also had it flushed through the Hextech Repair Tool, along with the other services it offers. I have restarted my computer, restarted my modem and router, and even reinstalled the whole league client (before repatching.) I have disabled my firewall, restarted, then tried to connect. All of these \"solutions\" have provided no success, aside from one singular time I was able to connect to a custom game was after pressing retry on the error prompt three times, and I have not been able to replicate this successful load screen since then.\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, I have tried every solution I have found after days of troubleshooting. I never used the legacy client, only the updated one, and hence I am led to believe it is not a client error. I believe it isn't a firewall/system error, as I have used the hextech repair tool several times and it made no difference and my firewall had never been a problem prior anyhow. Nothing has changed with my router/modem or isp or wiring prior to or after having this issue. I am completely and utterly confused with the randomness of this issue, and how little similar issues are covered on the boards and how riot doesn't seem to be acknowledging the 30ish other people I know whom are also experiencing similar issues, if not the exact same issue as me.\r\n\r\nPlease leave any positive criticism and/or solutions that I have not already stated. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"ZZCorruptedZZ","date":"2017-05-18T03:44:09.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same problem, have you been able to fix it?
