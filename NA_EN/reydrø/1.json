You'll need to wait patiently until then, it takes a while for Riot to go through all the champions when cycling only 4 of them at a time... I'd say it's easier just to buy her with IP if you don't like waiting just like me ^_^. Why wait when you can slam dunk people with your towering tentacles and slowly crush their souls, break their spirits to ever come back again by solo pentakilling the enemy team at Baron Pit? GLHF, please don't bm them afterwards when you steal Baron!","replies":[{"poster":"Reydrø","date":"2017-06-21T01:26:29.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You see my frend said he was gonna gift me when she gets on sale but she hasnt been on sale ever since she was released,Thnk u for ur time.\n","replies":[]}]}]}
