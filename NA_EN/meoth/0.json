Or just downright removing it from the game. But I don't think this would have the kinda results I like to imagine it would. \n\nToo many champions already have some pseudo form of mobility in their toolkit. Thus removing flash would leave those who don't to suffer more than they already do. \n\nBut do I like the idea of champions like shaco(my main) having 2 flashes(Deceive/Flash)? No. I think it's dumb, but that's how it is currently. I wouldn't want to see changes that only create more power-creep for some while other champions suffer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Backup4now","date":"2018-12-15T21:57:35.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be good for the game, but there'd be a lot of rebalancing because characters like Annie are completely balanced around flash-bear drop. So deeply in love are they with flash-engages that they actually make it core to the characters; they get that garbage design out of here, and the game becomes much more consistent since there isn't a 5-minute cooldown power spike.\n\nIn addition, flash is commonly used as a get-out-of-jail-free card. Gankers such as Camille are balanced around automatically taking away people's flashes with no risk, so once flash is removed Camille's dash can actually get a real nerf. Etc etc lots of changes but overall will be healthy, but riot balance sucks wee wee so it'll never happen etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2018-12-15T19:28:33.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tower diving would be almost impossible to mess up.

If you cant flash from an assassin ur dead because of the overwhelming damage in the game. And if you can't flash initiate, you cant start a teamfight, But on the contrary, if the enemy cant flash ur initiate, then it forces a teamfight to happen if the enemy gets caught, so that's why I'm wishy washy on that point. Regardless, champions with mobility and dashes would still be top tier because now they would have an advantage over the enemy, but on the other hand, immobile champions could take barrier and heal and other defensive summoners with relatively low cd in order to win fights. It would be interesting and I would honestly like to see this be tested on pbe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-12-15T15:33:19.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My poor Zoe wouldn't be able to blink 5 times in a row.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mael bro","date":"2018-12-15T10:50:51.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing a {{champion:29}}  would be borderline impossible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-12-15T01:17:09.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest I would prefer if it was removed (it's mainly used offensively anyway to get that last bit of damage off, when finishing someone off, or to flash and ignite someone) and compensate immobile champions by making making their base movement speed equal of most mobile champions, because not only do mobile champions have higher base movement speed by default, they have a dash ability (low cooldown in most cases), and on top of all that a flash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Done25","date":"2018-12-15T00:57:49.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be more dangerous.
