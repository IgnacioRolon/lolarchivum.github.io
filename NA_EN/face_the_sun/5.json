I figure that the origin of this game is some sort of twisted survival-of-the-fittest environment, as the one who \"wins\" this game is often placed with high regard and respect from his inferiors for possibly hours. From what I can understand, the goal of the game is to somehow collect as many of the black cards as possible by somehow using white cards. While my preliminary experimentation has not been able to determine what exactly is on these cards, my only guess is that it is a civilized battle of the wits that requires heavy thinking to decipher the meaning behind each and every card and how to use each card to its most effective point. These is this supposed \"Card Czar\", but I have not been able to find the nation from which he rules or even who the Card Czar is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-05-08T05:47:52.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://media.tumblr.com/d1627ca259bb0c3054b66fe4c1aabf4c/tumblr_inline_ms0k44oQ3s1qz4rgp.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Face The Sun","date":"2016-05-08T06:05:36.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"u sick bastard...
