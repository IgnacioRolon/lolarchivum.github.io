I just said he has too much stuff going on for him. And the fact that he's melee/squishy/can only have 1 type of build doesn't matter, by that logic every melee/squishy melee/ squishy champ should have multiple effects in one ability just because they are limited by it.\nIf Yasuo actually needed to do something to get both passives, like if he fills flow bar he gets double crit, that would be fair and not overloaded. If his windwall required cast time or had limited amount of projectiles it can block, it wouldn't be overloaded.\nHis range might be his disadvantage on ARAM, but on SR it's not that big issue.\n\nAll your 'downsides' you named for yasuo are just general disadvantages that various champs are dealing with, not just Yas. But that doesn't excuse him from having multiple effects in the same spells. If other squishy melees can live without it, then yas can aswell.
