Wukong, for example, has never had his core gameplay change, but is only now becoming unhealthy because features like Duskblade and Electrocute exist. Similarly, Draven was considered tolerable for many seasons, but has gone back to feeling oppressive because there are a host of tools out there that make him too easy to play for his current rewards. While Riot has definitely released kits that are flat-out unhealthy on their own (Zoe stands out as a particularly egregious example), right now we're at a point where even kits that were fine on their own have become frustrating and unpleasant to deal with. I feel the way to address this will have to involve addressing runes and removing front-loaded burst from general systems, so that we at least find ourselves in a meta where people get one-shot less frequently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vztah","date":"2018-08-04T17:39:28.127+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"i mean the zoe \"nerfs\" really didn't do shit but w/e fair enough","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-08-05T20:25:26.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean the nerfs they did early on were huge, such as reducing her Q splash damage, removing the partial CD refund on E, and making her unable to pick up {{item:3146}} from minions.\n\nAt this point she's a lot closer to being balanced.

What i was saying was sure assassins do a ton of dmg right now but if theyre supposed to be the highest burst dmg characters in an early game where everyone else is doing insane amounts of dmg well it kind of explains why they do so much dmg. If you want to nerf the assassin class you have to first nerf the dmg of all the other classes. Zoe 1 shotting people kaisa bursting players faster than an assassin can burst her, mf chopping off half of someones health bar with 1 Q and a dirk in laning phase, draven 2 to 3 shotting people mid game. Like why arent these issues being addressed but everyone jumps on assassins doing too much dmg.

They provide the same role that assassins do they're just under the name ganker on here. Some of those include \"Examples: Bloodseeker minimap icon.png Bloodseeker, Ember Spirit minimap icon.png Ember Spirit, Legion Commander minimap icon.png Legion Commander, Night Stalker minimap icon.png Night Stalker, Nyx Assassin minimap icon.png Nyx Assassin, Pudge minimap icon.png Pudge, Storm Spirit minimap icon.png Storm Spirit.\" Taken straight from the website. Now you can sit here and make jokes on it i did say i dont play dota nor do i know much about it but i gave you a character that plays the role of an assassin and instead you wanna crack jokes like \"Critical Strike! Brandon lost 50iq!\" You're the one saying you know dota 2 so well yet when i said bloodseeker the hero Strygwyr, the Bloodseeker didn't come to mind? Says a lot about how much you know about either game. \n\nNow when you said back to your main point, i told you the very same thing but the only thing different is you wanted to focus down the assassin class  whereas i said the game as a whole has too much dmg. You said the assassin class shouldnt even be here cuz it brings too much problems. So you're changing half of what you said. You made a claim about assassins not being in the original game then never even made a comment on it when i mentioned the assassins that were in game during the beta. This is the problem with the game too many people come on here trying to strut their knowledge, Riot listens to their playerbase feedback and  majority of the people on here dont know what the hell theyre saying.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sono Un Kebab","date":"2018-08-04T12:00:30.180+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"Because Riot has members of the balancing team that believe they can balance the game without playing it.\n*COFFCOFF* GHOSTCRAWLER *COFFCOFF*\nAnd others that just friggin put everything they can on a champion when they create/rework it.\n*COFFCOFF* CERTAINT *COFFCOFF*","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-08-04T14:43:33.949+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/w0fAJlx0-friendly-reminder-that-ghostcrawler?comment=0006","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2018-08-04T17:05:15.777+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Few points, i understand your frusteration however:\nWhile AD Trynd and Yi are very similar champs, AP Trynd and old AP Yi arent.

It's childish and counter-productive.\n\n> Speech oppression is real\n\nThis is nowhere near comparable to government censorship. Riot are just trying to keep negativity out of their game. Games are supposed to be positive experiences after all, they're supposed to be fun. And chances are that the game is going to be more enjoyable if there's only positive, neutral and constructive negative things in chat, than if all of that was overshadowed by people telling each other that they're reported and need to shove a phallus down their throat.\nSure, they may fuck up with some changes/additions and accidentally create negativity with that, but them fucking up unintentionally doesn't mean everyone else should be allowed to fuck up intentionally.","replies":[{"poster":"Ellena18","date":"2018-08-05T05:06:42.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mean that everybody should move to india and get a guru\n\nand your report system is used for abuse not for the actual thing\nand seriously dunno in what world u live in, guess is the flower powder from the hippy?","replies":[{"poster":"Ayzev","date":"2018-08-05T14:45:48.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ellena18,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=budxbGhq,comment-id=0009000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-05T05:06:42.382+0000)\n>\n> Mean that everybody should move to india and get a guru\n> \n> and seriously dunno in what world u live in, guess is the flower powder from the hippy?\n\nI have no idea what you're talking about\n\n> and your report system is used for abuse not for the actual thing\n\nIt doesn't actually do anything when abused though. If you haven't talked shit in chat, the system won't punish you. Even if you do talk shit, you'd still have to commit multiple offenses for something to happen. The only exceptions to this are trigger words like the famous \"kys\", and you certainly don't need to use those if you don't intend to talk shit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jaygo41","date":"2018-08-04T19:01:59.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because the game isn't about having fun playing against other peoples' champs.
