Targon.\r\n\r\nBoth of them are characterised by circular patterns &amp; the planet-ish motifs (also seen in other Targonian champions such as Taric), and the new champ&#039;s spell seems to also have sparkly stars and other such lights. imo this is a clear indicator that the new champion is from Targon, but of course, I could be wrong :D","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-10-21T19:17:36.541+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Pantheon’s color story referenced a ~~profit~~ prophet.
