However, if I exit the game then I cannot reopen the client until I restart my computer. I appreciate that the client opens faster than the old one did, but this flaw is very inconvenient as it requires me to restart my computer if I want to reset my client. \n\nSecond, I've also run into a small issue regarding the button functions on the client. This just occurred today which is odd. \nThe first instance was during champ select. I was unable to see any champions and the circular dial kept spinning around on a black page with a 0 timer at the top. I was forced to dodge, and lose LP. The funny thing is that my screen went back to normal after I was kicked from champ select. \nThe second instance is when I finished a match, and my client was not showing any buttons for the lobby, loot, or store. Those spaces were blank.\n\nI am running on Mac Version 10.12.2\n\nAny fixes or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. And at the very least, I just want to bring these small issues up. \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T19:41:40.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your issue may be network related in both failing to establish comms to the login and patching servers, but also when transitioning to the game.
