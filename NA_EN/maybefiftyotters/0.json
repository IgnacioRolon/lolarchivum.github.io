The best way to get in touch with Riot directly is to file a Support Ticket. Second off, resorting to insults when you don't get the response you were looking for is a very poor way of going about looking for or receiving help.","replies":[{"poster":"Llib Setag","date":"2017-02-05T04:31:29.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Lol thanks for the life lesson.

I read your post about 2 years ago and after that i do regret and vowed to change my ways on being toxic however i would like you to review my case. While i did say in chat that theres a new way to say the n word i did not say it to anyone directly in the chat. Also my team was very relaxed and ok with me saying that in chat. Its just after the game someone in my team the master yi used it against me for a bad game. In the actual game i did swear and curse but it was for my frustration against the yis play style while even though im writing this, I know what i did was wrong and promise I will change and be a better person after my ban! This gave me a better view in the mirror of how a bad person i am. Thanks for reading this! Also i plan to join your riot team after college soon!
