I've played dozens of MOBAs, card games, and I stream 4 days a week.  My internet is absolutely 110% fine.  None of those aforementioned internet using programs have ever, ever, ever, ever had an issue with lag.\r\n\r\nGuess what game always does?  League of Legends.  I've used your hextech repair thing.  I've looked at your connection guide.  And I can't possibly see how my internet is remotely the problem when I do far more taxing things than League with zero and I do mean absolutely zero problems.\r\n\r\nlogsoflag.com confirmed that every single game since I installed 1/7/2017 has had 16.6 packet loss a minute or more with 70 median ping.  What about matches I played the last time I had this spaghetti installed?\r\n\r\n11/7/2016 - 3.1 packet loss a minute, no percievable lag, 32 median ping\r\n\r\nEarliest game in my logs folder?\r\n\r\n8/15/2016 - 1.8 packet loss a minute, no lag, 32 median ping\r\n\r\nAll the logs can be found here: http://www.fileconvoy.com/dfl.php?id=g047a35e0941fce0f9999207772b727f2d14cf021e\r\n\r\nDota 2, Elder Scrolls Legends, Krosmaga (which is a bad game), and I bloody stream 4 days a week Riot.  All of those things run flawlessly.  It's you.  Fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T05:05:33.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I verified with our records that there aren't any server issues going on with NA that would affect your latency or Packets before they reach our servers. *Packet Loss* and big changes in latency are typically caused by issues along your network route or problems on your home network. Since you've already worked through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), I'd like to take a look at your network routing so we can figure out where the issue is coming from. You can use [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) (a free networking app) to run the traceroute log we'll need. After loading up the app, simply plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, export the trace results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nPlease let me know if you ran into any issues with those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Cleril","date":"2017-01-11T03:19:23.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.1.1 -    0 |  982 |  982 |    0 |    0 |   24 |    0 |\n\n|                   No response from host -  100 |  197 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n\n|                           67.59.234.205 -    0 |  983 |  983 |    7 |   11 |   53 |   10 |\n\n|                           67.59.254.246 -    0 |  982 |  982 |    8 |   13 |   50 |   12 |\n\n|              451be066.cst.lightpath.net -    0 |  983 |  983 |    8 |   12 |   55 |   10 |\n\n|                              64.15.1.88 -    0 |  982 |  982 |    9 |   13 |   53 |   10 |\n\n|                    nyiix.riotdirect.net -    0 |  982 |  982 |    9 |   13 |   51 |   11 |\n\n|                          104.160.132.35 -    0 |  982 |  982 |    9 |   13 |   56 |   11 |\n\n|          ae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  982 |  982 |   24 |   28 |   80 |   26 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  982 |  982 |   25 |   28 |   82 |   26 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T21:38:01.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you run this traceroute during a time you were experiencing issues in-game?

Since I reinstalled I've had ping spikes randomly from 40-150ms (as seen in the logs).  Nothing changed in the network or drivers or anything like that.  Windows 10 caused me grief with LAN after their recent update yesterday (after the test was done) so I had to reset ip configs and turned the router on/off.  As stated in the OP no other online program/activity has ever given me an issue (while League consistently gives me problems).\n\nI can play a game now to see if for some reason it magically fixed itself but that wouldn't make sense.\n\nThanks for the support so far, I know I was rough in the OP but it's frustrating when League is consistently the only online program/activity I ever have an issue with.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-12T22:11:47.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you see issues again in-game, it'd be neat if you could find a point to *Alt+Tab* out of the match momentarily to start another trace while you play.
