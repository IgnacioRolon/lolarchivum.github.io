Lemme start off by saying i am not banned. Have never used 3rd party programs and this is not a salty rant. I am sure i will still get downvoted anyway tho.\r\n\r\nWith that said. Riots new banwave for scripting and 3rd party programs just went out and from all the posts i have seen i am seeing one thing in common with most of them.\r\n\r\nMKLOL\r\n\r\nFor those who dont know. MKLOL is a program which is considered to be a cheating device by Riot and their terms of service. Using the program results in a ban. Plain and simple.\r\n\r\nBefore Riot declared MKLOL to be a cheat device warnings were sent out to all those using it. Summoners who had the program installed were given a wtitten warning about the program, told it was cheating and that they would have a small time frame to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nSadly it looks like most people did not get the hint. The term &quot;get rid of it&quot; does not mean tuck it in the back of your harddrive and never use it again, it literally means Get. Rid. Of. It.\r\n\r\nUninstall it.\r\nDelete it.\r\nWipe it off your harddrive\r\n\r\nAlmost every post i have read about the ban wave has contained the following sentence (or something simmiler)\r\n\r\n&quot;I do have MKLOL installed but stopped using it after the warning.&quot;\r\n\r\nI dont believe this is good enough for Riot. Its like taking a test with a cheat sheet right there on your desk face down and promising the teacher you wont look at it as they step outside to get a drink or something.\r\n\r\nWhen you were given the written warning you were told using MKLOL was a danger to your account. That right there would have had me uninstalling and deleting that shit asap. Not just leaving it where it was and never using it.\r\n\r\nIn the end it all comes down to trust. MKLOL is not trusted and you were warned that you were not trusted to be in possesion of it. So when the ban wave hit and MKLOL was detected on your system still then you got slapped with the ban.\r\n\r\nThe point of this post was to help shed some light for those who were banned. However onething to remember is that i am not a Riot employee and nothing i posted is offical. Everything i said could also be entirley wrong. Thats for Riot to decide.\r\n\r\nBittom line. Dont trust any 3rd party programs at all and this wont happen.","replies":[{"poster":"iShak1337","date":"2016-05-18T08:29:52.803+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly....

I got the warning as well over 6 months ago. A week after the warning my HD crashed and I had to buy a new one. Never installed it on the new one and I still got the ban. So explain that one? Also please explain why riot is searching everyone's computer? I do not see that in the terms of service that they can search my computer? Cause not every one installs programs the same way, example most people probably do the typical install, I myself keep all my programs on a backup drive, which means it is not in the default location and riot would have to search all 3 hard drives to find any type of software. So why is riot invading our PC? What else are they taking from it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-05-18T07:34:29.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never used it and got banned anyway.\n\nThe only third party program I ever used was LSI (league summoner information) which a Rioter directly stated was okay.
