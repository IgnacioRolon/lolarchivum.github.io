I don&#039;t think i ever snowballed so hard that game as i did with Dark Harvest, you might think its a late game rune and it is but honestly, its early game power is really strong to! Getting 4 souls from both sides of canon minions gave me a good chunk of stacks and damage, coupled with starting {{item:1082}}+{{item:2031}} ((Becuase {{item:1056}} is one of the worst items in the game now)) and a farm heavy lane and I was dealing insane damage by the time mid game came along and I honestly hadn&#039;t got that ahead in kills or CS.\r\n\r\nWith the Sorc tree set to become garbage, i will now use it as a secondary tree only, for midlaners looking for an alternative i implore you try Dark Harvest, farm passively till mid game, get those canon souls from both teams and you&#039;ll see that incredible difference it makes. Unless Riot fixes the Sorc tree i won&#039;t be going back to it. ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2018-05-12T23:44:01.277+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You think dark harvest is good on Annie?

I am a dark harvest mid laner myself(although now I'm beginning to use electrocute occasionally because Dark Harvest started to feel boring. I get to build tankier and the play pattern is kind of easier for me, plus I do less damage with my abilities from building more durability. Also the sorcery tree isn't bad at all. I do hate the idea of nimbus cloak and moving Ultimate Hat over to the domination tree(such an annoying thing, since taking it on Kat would reduce my healing due to no longer have ravenous hunter), manaflow band, scorch, Absolute Focus, Waterwalking, and Comet are all really good runes though, so I don't see why people are claiming the sorcery tree sucks. It and Domination are my two favorite rune trees. Although I do like Inspiration quite a bit as well since I'm an assassin and my job is to get ahead early.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-13T00:34:49.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark harvest turns everything into a lichbane/trinityforce user.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-05-13T00:39:33.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LFW2pR7P,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-05-13T00:34:49.421+0000)\n>\n> Dark harvest turns everything into a lichbane/trinityforce user.\n> \n> {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}\n\nI mean, Kat has plenty of ways to proc it. She can proc it at least 3 times in a fight xD\n\nI also have ways to determine WHEN I get my dark harvest procs to set up ways to actually proc it before the enemy knows it's coming too.
