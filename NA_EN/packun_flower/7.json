In DAC even if you're low on items the enemies can deal with lots of shitty components, if the game is showering rings of health and robe of the magi they aren't combining into something gamebreaking.

League in a whole is free from the start. and everything you buy with real money can either also be bought by blue essence or is purely cosmetic and give you no advantage whatsoever, they are there to just cool addons to your characters which could be earned for free, or is a way players can support league while also getting something for their favorite champ or game mode. *BOOM*","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThisName1sDumb","date":"2019-06-28T07:29:54.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guys, lets be honest.
