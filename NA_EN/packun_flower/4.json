She can't just delete people and 5v1 like she used to, but she can fight people if she outplays them and capitalizes on mistakes. She has a lot of utility, so she can be played defensively or as a supp too. She has a pretty high skillcap now, so you can't just play one game and win with her, but even when you do have a few games you still have to work for your kills.\n\nSo, I think she's in a good spot. Her Q could be a liiiitle bit bigger, and her passive not so obnoxious to work with, but otherwise I think she's in a good spot.\n\n... Riot actually released a balanced champion (Illaoi was pretty balanced too, so was Kin).

I learned fast that he requires good (borderline great) decision making even in lane. I will say I even suck at playing him but I think I am not the worst though.

Her ult reads as a knock-up. Especially when double-tapped.
