A passive that is so unnecessary  and so redundant in this meta that its very existence shouldn&#039;t exist. Ever since his release the double crit passive has been a problem but it has never been addressed, now its causing so many problems in this meta that Riot may not havea  choice but to address, Number tweeks aren&#039;t going to fix this problem, the removal of his double crit rate passive will.\r\n\r\nI mean&#039;s he&#039;s already got the shield passive, why does he need a second pasisve? His kit offers amazing mobility as well, you can&#039;t mix mobility and power and expect players to call that balanced.\r\n\r\nJust get rid of it, there is absolutely no need for him to have it now, and he&#039;ll still be a viable champion even without it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2015-11-26T04:22:38.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually I would say his entire kit is unbelievably toxic. \n\nWindwall alone is better than most ultimates.... seriously, if you could replace Taric/Sona or even Janna ult with Windwall... would you?

And because he has to engage so close against ranged enemies, but has stats too low to face tank, he has a passive shield to make harder to burst and dashes that help him close the gap. Because his raw DPS isn't actually all that high when compared to the other melee carries, he's given utility to compensate in the form of his ult procs and W.\n\nYou know what will happen if his crit passive is removed? Yasuo's damage output takes a major hit. That results in having to build more attack damage or crit chance. That, in turn, means a squishier Yasuo, and therefore one that's too fragile in the late game to be relevant. Because melee range.\n\nWhat happens then? Either a large-scale rework or buffs to his base values and/or stats. One means changing the champion from the bottom up while the other leads to a hypermobile bruiser who can bully damn near anything out of lane. Nobody wants that.\n\nHere's the thing, every melee carry has similarities in their kits. Yasuo, Fiora, Yi, and Tryndamere all have a gap closer, some sort of damage mitigation/sustain, and damage steroids. This is because they have to close the distance between themselves and ranged champions, survive that part, fight them, and be reasonably expected to make it out on top. You need a lot of things to do that.\n\nIs the very concept of a melee adc flawed? Perhaps, but the execution has admittedly become more elegant than the days when they made Tryndamere unkillable so he could do his job. Regardless, that's the state of things.","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2015-11-26T04:22:16.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's almost like it would be some kind of nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T04:56:45.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, it would be, and what part of his performance suggests he's strong enough to need one? I'm not asking you to read me his kit, mind you. I know what it looks like. What I want to know is what data you have that suggests he needs to have his power taken down a notch.\n\nStatik Shiv just had its damage lowered below what it was in season 5, the new capstone was nerfed to only affect attacks against champions. He's received two indirect nerfs already, and from what I've heard, his win rate in plat is something sub-50%, maybe as low as 44%. Also, low-elo win rate isn't indicative of much. All sorts of things are strong down here with the scrubs like myself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yxion the Yordle","date":"2015-11-26T04:21:08.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My solution to the {{champion:157}}  issue would be to reduce the sustain and attack speed from Warlord's Bloodlust for melee champions. (Like 50% less.)\nEither that or possibly reduce the passive crit chance in a way that makes him require at least SOME crit chance runes to hit 100% with 2 items.\nIf it was 1.6x instead of 2x with {{item:3087}} and {{item:3031}} that would put him at 80% crit, then if he had crit chance marks he would be almost at 100%.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T04:51:37.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"While it's easier for Yasuo and Tryndamere to proc Warlord's, they have to get in melee range to do so. If you're going to weaken the passive just because they exist, you're shafting every other melee champion who might have considered taking it. Also, if you cut it half, what then? It affects mid game, evening things out somewhat, but then ranged carries benefit from it far more than melee champions do, and they do so from a safe distance. There's a reason that items and masteries and such have benefitted ranged champions *less* than melees (see Guinsoo's), and it's precisely because range is safe and powerful.\n\nNow, scaling back his crit chance.... As someone who used to run all crit marks, let me tell you, the opportunity cost of getting that crit is not very high. You could very reasonably  hit that, seeing as 80% was where he was before preseason. My complaint with that, aside from the fact that I don't see how he needs nerfs at all, is that the AD available to champions this season has fallen. Yes, Yasuo gets 100% crit with two items, but his total ad has dropped, and as such, he's dealing less damage overall. That's a bit part of why all the Marksmen have less endgame AD now; because they have more crit.\n\nYasuo is by no means too powerful and straight up nerfing that hard him without some kind of compensation would serve no purpose.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cherysse","date":"2015-11-26T03:46:10.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't mix defensive power, mobility, 95% extra gold worth on crit stats, high damage spike, anti tank power (ult's armor pen), ability to poke and a high capacity to land a wombo combo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-11-26T04:31:48.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they do ever remove double crit chance they need to:\n\nBring back e generating the passive\n\nChange his ulti back to total penetration instead of just bonus\n\nLet his e stack to 4 times\n\nAnd slightly raise how much AS is converted into CDR for his q","replies":[]}]}
