Most of what you put on there are juggernauts and fighters champions that are known to be tankish and still deal damage. Just because a champion has a bunch of hp and resistances doesn't make it a true tank. Look at a champion like {{champion:111}} who has so much damn CC and natural tankiness that is a true tank meanwhile look at someone like {{champion:120}} who only has like 2 means of CC in his kit and needs items to make himself tankier he is a fighter. The only champion really that probably needs to be looked at for his damage is {{champion:223}} and even he has only 2 forms of CC so he is not exactly a true tank.
