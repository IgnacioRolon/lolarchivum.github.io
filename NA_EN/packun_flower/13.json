We used to see Riot talk about Clarity, Balance and Not Losing in Champ Select. We were told they were aware of power spikes and doing their best to even them out (In particular, I remember them flipping the #s on Renekton's Ultimate, making it weaker early and stronger late). I thought things like Fiora, Mordekaiser and Darius were going to be something Riot would be more active in combating in the future. But they remain extremely strong.\n\nI hate the new masteries. They seem to lack clarity in some regards and aren't balanced. While the old system was neatly labeled (Off, Def, Util) the new system has often left me wondering where the hell im supposed to place things on the champ im playing. Also, the old system was full of slight buffs and minor passive boosts. This new system sees massive bonuses and very strong active abilities. The new system is going to be harder than hell to balance.\n\nBut, I'm also not impressed with Riot's ability to balance and fix things of late. Fiora, Mord (and in soloqueue, Darius) are still hell to play against. They've been so for a couple of months.

The ad reduction actually didn't hurt because he can itemize now much easier, a lot easier than any other class, people are complaining about adcs getting items, meanwhile the actual truth is these items were made for yasuo, as if they just made them for him, also the general ad reduction which doesn't exist because it affects every ad oriented champ.

Every point of AD is effectively worth 2.25 AD for Yasuo since he crits every hit once he has IE. -15 from IE is -34 damage per auto and Q just from that change alone. Shiv is actually weaker until lvl 12, making a Yasuo that get's early kills less snowbally.
