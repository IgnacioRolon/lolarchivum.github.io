Mine have been reset and simply don't work any more.  I've tried resetting my keys to default, but it doesn't fix anything.  Does anyone know how to fix this???\r\n\r\nI also cant manually set my keybindings, for example when I click on 'spell 1' and the bind box pops up, but when I press Q nothing happens.  something is very wrong with my League","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T22:33:48.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a recent issue that caused settings and bindings to reset for some players.  Previous custom modifications may have caused other issues like being unable to resync your settings.  Doing a complete reset to default should fix this up:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
