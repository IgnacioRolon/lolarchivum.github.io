I had to wait 5 minutes for the last one, but this one is actually pissing me off now. My league crashed during bans and would stay open, but would be stuck at 0 seconds. I now have to wait 15 minutes because of your game freezing on me. I even got the, \"an unkown error has occured\" message. I should not be punished for this and should not be given a wait queue for this, anyone else agree?","replies":[{"poster":"DanteDMC24","date":"2017-01-15T17:11:52.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito, i have gone afk in 1 game because you idiots removed draft pick and there were gonna be trolls in game so i went afk to do remake and you decided to make my next 3 games not a priority by giving me 5 minutes queue.
