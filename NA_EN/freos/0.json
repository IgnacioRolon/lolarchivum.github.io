I can select my champion and move freely throughout the client however, The loading screen wont come up. After champ select ends the client pops up and says reconnect as if I dc from game. I click reconnect and literally nothing happens. I have done a bug report and have not gotten a response. I don't know if this is just my pc or connection and if it is I would love some advice on how to fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Bugcheck","date":"2018-06-22T23:44:36.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Freos,\n\nWe've released a temporary build that may fix the issue for you, give it a try: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/GX3Zhxwe-game-client-anti-cheat-known-issues-and-fixes\n\nI also added you in-game to help you triage any problems you are experiencing.
