It was only my friend, teemo, and me that disconnected. It also looked like it lasted the same duration but that teemo's dc lasted longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Billabongbombom","date":"2016-09-18T05:15:19.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When mine crashed, I can't log in as well.","replies":[{"poster":"ThuyLoanquyenang","date":"2016-09-18T06:13:53.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too- actually 3 games continually as hell- and I am banned for leaving- leave buster that so ridiculous and stupid- ban for no reason- why they created player behaviour but they didn't collect potential and serious contribute to analyze why this problems are still happening","replies":[]},{"poster":"K端rama","date":"2016-09-18T05:40:02.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL NA and OCE are currently experiencing technical difficulties.
