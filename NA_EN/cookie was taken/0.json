With the in-client tech issues we (sadly) could not showcase this, but with the website we can.\n\nI'm a bit biased, but I strongly support the Narrative team erring on the side of synergizing with established lore rather than demolishing it.\n\nLet me preface what follows by saying that Narrative's been showing a more serious commitment to community engagement in recent days than it ever has, at least within the scope of my recollection. Thank you. I also thought the new Sion lore was quite good—and, not unimportantly, meshed very well with established lore.\n\nMy primary (substantive) concern about Narrative's current direction is that your thesis seems to be: \"This old lore sucks. Let's start with a clean slate.\" This is an energizing, refreshing attitude, but it's also highly problematic in that \"these ruins are inhabited.\" The lore community has been working with and building upon established lore for years. I would urge Narrative not to treat the destruction of old lore as a cost-free move. LoL's lore gains a lot of strength from community involvement.\n\nAs for procedural concerns, while I'm heartened to see you reaching out to discuss lore with the community, so far Narrative has only taken a first step. The crucial next step is giving us some idea as to what's getting redone next, so that we can focus our discussion. (Otherwise, we're left simply making a bunch of shot-in-the-dark threads like, \"by the way, if you ever redo Kayle, here's what I think should happen.\")\n\nAs I've written before, I'd like to see Narrative rely less on shock reveals that come out of nowhere. Shock reveals are exciting, but by their nature also preclude meaningful community engagement. Especially when the new content clashes with established lore, I do not think shock reveals are appropriate.\n\nFor example, maybe you want to redo Bandle City and erase the Mothership. That is not a good topic for a shock reveal. That is something that warrants prior discussion with the community, early enough that the discussion can have an impact.\n\nIn contrast, adding a story or artwork that simply fleshes out more details of Jarvan II saving Xin Zhao from the arena would be fine as a shock reveal, as would be (e.g.) a cinematic showing Ashe and Sejuani brawling in the Freljord.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2014-10-14T20:25:34.514+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":10,"body":"> My primary (substantive) concern about Narrative's current direction is that your thesis seems to be: \"This old lore sucks.

The highlighted portion is what worries me.\n\nIt's feels as if there are significant numbers of champions already declared \"finished\" by Narrative and you're just cynically asking for our input on the rest as a peace offering.\n\nFor example, there are a group of new bios already coming out for the Shadow Isles, and I'm pretty sure there's one more area mostly finished coming down the pipeline.  That's about 20 champions whose stories have already been declared \"done\" without community input.\n\nAgain, no idea if any of that is true, but there's nothing from Narrative that's saying otherwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-10-14T20:53:16.383+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to respond. And I know it's not just a matter of time—I know that this is a thorny subject, and I appreciate you taking on some additional stress to interact here. This post is one of the more substantial posts I've seen from a Rioter yet on this topic.\n\n> We don't view it as 'destruction,' but as a tweak to fit with new foundational rules for the world. In making those tweaks we're looking at what players have liked and disliked for what reasons and why, and all those factors enter into our discussions. Fan theories? Check. Past reworks? Check. Recent events? Double check.\n\nI think it's great that those sorts of factors are part of your discussion. That said, there's value to letting the community speak for ourselves, rather than just being represented in absentia, which is why I encourage further public discussion, especially when it comes to major changes.\n\nI do think \"destruction\" is an appropriate term. There is such a thing as creative destruction. For example, the lore community basically waved aside some of the derpier League-related lore and developed some fanon that made Summoners into \"radio support\" rather than creepy puppetmasters, and the Institute into a beleaguered EU-style body struggling to maintain legitimacy rather than an all-powerful magocracy. However, there's a fundamental difference between new lore that adds onto established lore and new lore that also destroys some established lore. It's a different calculus with different factors coming into play.\n\n>  Feedback is fine, but a lot of the time we get requests for what is essentially a spreadsheet on who is working on what and why.\n\nI don't know about others, but that's certainly not what I'm asking for. I'm thinking more like, \"the next big rework will be Ionia.\" That allows us to focus our attention on Ionia, and allows for a discussion prefaced with, e.g., \"We're thinking of redoing the Noxian invasion of Ionia to bring in Demacia as an ally for Ionia. We also want to highlight Zaun's involvement.\" This prompts interested parties to speak up and get involved.\n\n> I'm happy to cultivate discussions on groups of champs that are coming up soon on the docket (the big thread from Friday being a good example),\n\nThat was indeed a good thread, because it defined (at least generally) one set of Champions up for rewrites and gathered community input.\n\n> Again, have to be careful here. Do we reveal everything and never surprise you at all, or constantly surprise you and have less interaction?\n\nI would propose, as a rule of thumb, that shock reveals are less appropriate to the degree that the incoming lore is destructive. Let's say the story is about Lux and Ezreal going off on an adventure together. This works fine as a surprise, because it meshes with prior lore. But if the story retcons Ezreal to be from Ionia instead of Piltover, that would be something that warrants discussion first, even at the cost of some \"excitement\".\n\n> The entire world is being redefined, and Bandle City is indeed among the reworks. Some of the changes you might not like, others you probably will. I personally (and be aware that I haven't had any input on Bandle city) hate the mothership. Someone else might love it.\n\nSure. And this is why something like that should be discussed. Rather than merely factoring in what the Narrative team suspects the community's feelings to be, let the community speak for itself. Our opinions might surprise you. We might come up with alternatives you hadn't considered. Our focus might vary from what you'd expect it to be.\n\n> But we're not going to throw out or keep anything based on a small handful of opinions - we keep what makes for the most interesting and vibrant stories, while considering what every side has to say.

More explicitly, you erased from the game's story what gave the title to the game itself. It's like developing a new game of Pokemon without Pokemons or publishing the third book of the Lord of the Rings without any ring reference therein. It's something major, not a tweak.\nBut well, you said you wanted to separate the game from the lore, indeed, so it may make sense to you; the problem being that the game retains elements of said lore and the new Sion is now not an Arnie impersonator anymore because of this and all his VO it's all about immersion. So it's a bit confusing, either you develop the story for the game or you do it separately. If one includes the other, you can't possibly argue the retcon is \"a tweak\". It's a retcon.

Retcons and reworks as undebatable surprises? Bad, bad idea. A writer is free to continue his/her story the way she/he wants when publishing a sequel, but I think you'll agree that publishing a sequel which states in the preface that past events are no more or different, leaving many plot holes while doing so, well, is nearly impossible.

In the past few years have any of your surprise reveals, in the realm of lore, actually worked? I can think of one. Sion. That's it. Freljord didn't go over well. The Retcon has not gone over well. Shurima has not gone over well. Character and item revamps have done better but have also been problematic. I'd advise erring on the side of caution. Shocking and delighting positively has not been your forte and is something that companies who have very positive relationships with their fan bases have to do carefully. Even the recent surprise character lore revamps have irked people. This tactic is *not* your strong suit. You guys do fine when you're introducing skins or a new game mode. Maybe just refrain from it until you build up some good mojo and then reintroduce it and work at it.\n\nThis is a really good point!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dotintheparadox","date":"2014-10-21T17:53:20.961+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Someone else might love it. But we're not going to throw out **or** keep anything based on a small handful of opinions\n\nSo, if the majority of the lore community that actually participates in the boards disagreed with the decision to remove the institute, it's still counted as a \"Handful of opinions\"? If we're counting the entire community of LoL, then yeah, we're a minority, but we're also the only people who've actually read the lore, everyone else I know who plays doesn't care at all about the lore. \n\nThey really don't, I'm not going to bring up \"Muh E-sports\" but still, they weren't interested because the original premise was weird, they weren't interested because it just didn't have much else, and the stuff that was already set-up, just disappeared. I showed people I know the JoJ (Rammus X Cactus OTP) on the wiki (It's the only place I could find it anymore), but since it was a wiki, they didn't want to read it. The lore indifference is born from the inability to find it, not that the old story wasn't cool, or funny, or interesting, it's just that almost no one can get to it.\n\nEven people I know who like lore don't care about League's lore, the new stuff doesn't interest them at all. They go to Dawngate because of the way they're doing it, they have an actual say in the story, not rampant fanon appeasement but they're given two possible choices from the current storyline, and then you vote, with matches being played for the votes, it makes you more invested in the story than, \"Here, the lore is this now because we thought it was a cool idea.\" also the web comic doesn't hurt.\n\nI'm also seriously wondering why the lore team is now you guys, if you apparently hated the original stuff? I'm not trying to be mean, I seriously want to know this. \n\nBut seriously in the end, we're realistically the only opinion you're going to get on any of this, and don't count surveys, it's not good for the demographics for an online game, especially one where you have rampant smurfing, and bot accounts.

Isolated from Zaunian society, save his item-gathering \"friend\" Warwick, in order to keep from developing empathy for others, Singed was unknowingly at the forefront of a revolution in chemical weapons.

Currently I have little to not faith in narrative's direction whatsoever, and talking about this just warns me that I am going to be let down again.\n\nSo Carnival, let me ask you this:\n\nHow often will it be serialized? Are we talking weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, once per real-world event? Give us something more to go on because although [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/BmlIQTTn-lores-becoming-short?comment=000100000000) post demonstrates the emotions I would have if I had any trust for the narrative team, I am far more cynical than that thanks to their actions.\n\nFrequency of the serializiation is INCREDIBLY important, and I am very interested to hear what Riot's tentative plan is for the frequency question. And on a side note, if this is what the community waited nearly 3 years to replace JoJ, you better be ready to deliver above and beyond anyone's expectations, because there is now more than just \"broken promises\" attributing to the scrutiny that will be placed on this.\n\nBut, I want the best for Riot's narrative team and I WANT them to succeed. I cannot emphasize that enough, so delve into some of my questions. Everyone agrees the narrative team needs more communication, especially on upcoming content, so let's have some dialogue so that the team can actually get the community's opinion on what they're spending tons of hours developing.
