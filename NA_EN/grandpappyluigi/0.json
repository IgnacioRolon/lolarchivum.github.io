I don't know what to do and who to talk to about it. Someone please help me out... My game freezes every game at around the 18-20 minute mark. Computer is not running hot or hard at all, steady 25C. I have a gtx 950 ftw hooked up and it runs every other game i throw at it just fine, maxed out. I honestly don't know anything else I could possibly do to fix this, I've tried re downloading the game, patch repair, deleting the game, everything. Its gotten to the point that it is cost me games because I cant fix the problem fast enough to return to the game... Riot I've sent in several tickets... I don't know what else you want from me...","replies":[{"poster":"kevinobrien","date":"2018-01-28T02:07:13.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same issue without getting it resolved. I have gone from 2 different computers, 2 different routers, completed all the requested steps from riot and this continues to do the same thing. I have to sign out because I cannot open task manager when this happens. Any solution would be appreciated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T21:29:10.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't see any tickets or recent posts about this issue, but it sounds like some of the game files might be corrupted or missing. If you haven't yet, try running the repair option through the client settings. Make sure you're running the client as admin when you do that.","replies":[{"poster":"GrandPappyLuigi","date":"2017-10-22T08:34:20.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How exactly do I \"create a ticket\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-22T20:02:55.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can shoot us a ticket by clicking right here -> [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
