When I go to the support page and select my problem it tells me to sign in, well, I enter my information and hit sign in and it says I've been signed out. I am not even signed in in the first place like wtf. How can I submit a ticket if I'm not signed in, and when I sign in I get signed out? But I'm not signed in! What's going on!\r\n\r\nEvery time I post to a board it's immediately taken down.\r\n\r\nMy final request was to have my leaver buster ban lifted. There was a time when I would rage quit and deserve a ban, but it's punishing me for disconnecting mid game, and my last game as graves my whole computer literally froze. Each leave I signed back in just few minutes later ( 6 - 7 my client takes forever to load the login screen. I have to open and close the launcher say, 5 times ). I don't deserve THIS particular ban, I've done nothing wrong. It was out of my control, and now I'm being punished for having my computer freeze? for having 1000 ping issues when I normally sit at 90 - 100. I understand in the past I've had issues with this but not anymore. And a 20 minute wait, really, I can see a 20 min wait if I've been doing this intentionally but you can clearly tell I've reconnected to the game. Why am I being punished for faults with either the server or my computer freezing?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-08T22:22:56.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zanithe! \n\nI'm not sure what's going on with the ticket system - I can certainly poke the team and see what's going on there.\n\nAs for your LeaverBuster ban, unfortunately, we do not remove bans/restrictions.","replies":[]}]}
