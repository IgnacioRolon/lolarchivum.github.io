Do it wrong and you're gonna die. Do it too early and you'll still be pulled. Do it too late and you'll still get knocked up.\n\nDisplacements outright **cancel** her jump if you time it properly. Any good Thresh player will tell you how you can bait the jump, walk up to her and interrupt it midway.\n\nFinally, here's a quote from **Riot jinxylord** on the topic:\n> We could certainly nerf Trist jump to be interrupted by CC but that would likely make the spell feel pretty awful to use, **the vast majority of dashes in our game cannot be canceled in that way** and I'm not sure Trist's W should be uniquely bad in that regard considering it has a .5 second cast time. We could lower the cast time (or remove it completely), but that would likely make her mobility overall STRONGER.\n\n> This is due to cast-time buffering. To compensate for things like network lag, spells in League that have cast times are favored to go off (even if you are stunned during said cast time). This does create some frustrating experiences where you land your hook on Trist and she just bounces out of it, but on the flip side, if the spell were instant, that hook would have never landed in the first place.\nTrist's W is strong to be sure, but it having a cast time makes it a good degree weaker. Better she's stunned after jumping away from you than never stunned at all.\n\n> To get into what I mean by \"network lag compensation,\" imagine you're playing against Riven (who has an instant stun with no cast time, enabling it to preempt your cast times) and Annie (who's Q stuns after a travel time). If you push Q at the same time Annie does, both of your spells will go off, as her stun takes a bit to reach you. If you push Q at the same time as Riven stun, it's very possible that (based on latency) Riven's stun will go off slightly before your spell. If this happens, not only will you be stunned, but you will be left wondering why your spell didn't go off. You pushed the button when you weren't stunned, and yet the spell failed to cast. Makes the game feel clunky and unresponsive, and at times will cause players to do things they don't want to (like continue running into a fight after the stun wears off because they thought they had cast their dash/ult/fight turner which would have made them stop for a cast time and change their trajectory).\n\n> These types of interactions are one of the reasons silences (especially instant ones like Raka E) feel so bad in our game. They have poor feedback that something has happened, and so players attempt to cast their spells, don't get a result, run places they don't want since there was no cast time to stop them, and then come out of it feeling like the game is laggy and unresponsive.\n\nNow, move on and let this thing go.\nEnough is enough with the Tristana hate.","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2017-11-06T08:51:12.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Saying no one has ever complained about it is a dead lie, you only need to look at oh, this very post to see that.\n\nPeople have been wanting (rightfully so) to remove the CC buffer on Trist and Ez since they realize they have had them.
