They smoothed everything out recently, didn't they?\n\nLook for yourself (see attached file).\n\nIt's even worse for the Desperada skin since they changed the snake species, her tail doesn't even resemble what's on the splashart to the least bit. \n\nThere have been threads about this since the very beginning and they didn't respond to a single one of them. Also her hat has been downgraded aswell. The skin has lost its entire appeal since this visual gutting.","replies":[{"poster":"skyfall619","date":"2015-12-15T22:45:45.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that kinda annoys me know that i noticed this. ugh why did u bring this to me attention now ima be annoyed whenever i play cass","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-12-16T00:42:16.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your only hope of escaping this predicament is to use one of her skins.","replies":[{"poster":"skyfall619","date":"2015-12-16T01:19:05.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but they all suck","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Headless Ninja","date":"2016-04-02T20:09:20.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes pleas new cass skin , how about some  kind of acsended magical skin like xerath or something, or maybe a mecha or blood moon (think of the q)","replies":[]},{"poster":"gogodevil","date":"2016-02-12T00:06:40.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Want a new Cassio Skin.
