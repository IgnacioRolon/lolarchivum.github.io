Now I have a tremendous storyline about one of my favorite characters in League. Her lore tells the tale of such a strong character that it only makes me want to play her even more, but she&rsquo;s such an important piece in the Bilgewater storyline that, quite frankly, I&rsquo;m dissapointed in the discrepancies that this beautiful new lore creates on MF&rsquo;s current kit and gameplay. Things that I believe should have been addressed for the release of Burning Tides.\n\nBoth in the Bilgewater event and in the new Lore in her champion Page, Miss Fortune is depicted as this calculative, revenge driven girl that uses everything she has at her disposal to achieve her goals. Her whole persona is created as a consequence of a bloody &ldquo;trade&rdquo; between her mother (a weaponsmith) and Gangplank, **making Shock and Awe very, very important.** After this, she calculates every single move she&rsquo;s going to make (wich is quite related to her kit). She deciets, kills, manipulates, and also uses her looks, charm and femininity to obtain what she&rsquo;s after. After much planning, she becomes the mastermind behind Gangplank&rsquo;s downfall in Bilgewater. This is amazing. But only one of these aspects is reflected in her kit, Calculation; you could also say that her damage ramping up is akin to gathering resources I guess . But why, why in the event she&rsquo;s such a big part of, only got a minor VU and band aids over a kit that doesn&rsquo;t reflect where Riot is taking her character in the lore? And these band-aids didn&rsquo;t even address her core problems, the reasons she&rsquo;s not picked competitively or higher up the ladder. \n\nI&rsquo;m going to be as objective as possible with her current state, and if possible, we can discuss Miss Fortune and a Rioter can answer our questions.I&rsquo;ll place the rework at the bottom of the current skill analysis for clarity and easier reading.\n\n**Strut:** I think that since I started playing her, people have been asking, practically begging for, is  that after a certain level, it wouldn&rsquo;t be cancelled by minion damage; however, we got the non direct damage mechanic. We didn&rsquo;t get the scaling per lvl that was mentioned or the minion damage ignore at lvl 11. I think that Strut shouldn&rsquo;t even be her passive anymore, it should be her W. By placing Strut in W and creating another passive surrounding her guns, she&rsquo;d make more sense lore wise, and be an easier champion to read and balance.\n\n**Double Up:** Even after the angle changes, it&rsquo;s extremely unreliable. I don&rsquo;t know what prioritizes first, is it champions? or targets with impure shots stacks? it feels random in most cases, sometimes it even hits directly on the side of the first target, even if they&rsquo;re not in the cone. And then there&rsquo;s the 150% situational damage in the second hit, while in lane being very powerful if mastered, it has no use outside lane or in late game. It provides an AA reset, but as you get attack speed, the skill cast time feels like it makes you lose DPS, specially after 1.6 AS. **Why can&rsquo;t the skill just be allowed to critical hit and have it prioritize champions in the bounce?**\n\n**Impure shots:** I understand the removal of GW, you want to get rid of the mechanic and it was a bunch of hidden power, but activating Strut is counter productive unless you can&rsquo;t shave it off, and it won&rsquo;t even come close to the power you took away by taking out GW in the first place. **Why was the AS% boost that got pushed to the PBE scrapped and not even tweaked to balance it?**\n\n**Make it Rain: **It&rsquo;s her zoning tool, but other than that, it adds close to nothing to the rest of her current kit. It scales on AP, and while the damage was focused on a 2 second period, the primary reason to cast it (the slow field) to try and zone enemies suffered the consequences. I thought the skill was going to be changed completely. **Why were improvements placed on something she didn&rsquo;t use the skill for?**\n\n**Bullet Time: **The skill concept by itself is fine, it just scales oddly, and by increasing the amount of stacks of impure shots instead of the AD ratio passively, MF doesn&rsquo;t get the full benefit from this mechanic. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to reach 8 stacks before a duel is over unless it&rsquo;s a tank. **Why was this mechanic implemented in the first place if MF needs a perfect scenario to succeed?**\n\n**TLDR;**\n- Strut still lacks usability and I think it should be reworked into something else(read below)\n- Double Up is still unreliable and has no real purpose outside of lane phase\n- Impure Shots&rsquo;s AS steroid is lackluster after the removal of GW and it activating strut is counterproductive if it doesn&rsquo;t remain up for the duration of the active.\n- Make it Rain still doesn&rsquo;t feel satisfactory to cast, period.\n- Bullet Time still scales oddly, more impure shots stacks instead of a higher ad ratio per stack places MF into situations she can&rsquo;t make a reality\n\n**My ideas are**\nRework:\n**New Passive: Shock and Awe, Guns of Fortune**\nMF&rsquo;s basic attacks deal an aditional 6/8/10% of her AD as bonus magic damage, stacking 5 times to a maximum of 30/40/50%. Upon reaching 5 stacks, MF gains  30/55/80% attack speed. Indicator for MF as of how many stacks it&rsquo;s a heart similar to her current AoE indicator.\nQ: Double Up remains the same. Cast time improves with AS\n**W: Strut**\nPassive: After 5 seconds of not losing health to non-periodic damage, Miss Fortune gains 20/24/28/30/32 bonus movement speed, which increases by 8 each second up to a maximum of 50/60/70/80/90 bonus movement speed.\nActive: Miss Fortune consumes her Shock and Awe stacks to briefly charm enemy champions around her for X seconds and doubles her bonus movement speed, this speed decays rapidly after 2 seconds (think Katarina W for range) (long cooldown though)\n\nE: Make it Rain, remains the same, except  instead of a circle, it&rsquo;s a rectangular AoE. Damage is physical, or no damage at all\nR: Bullet Time\nMF channels for 2,5 seconds, spraying 8 waves of bullets in a cone in front of her. Each wave deals 50/75/125 (+X% AP+X% bonus AD) physical damage. If MF has 5 stacks of Shock and Awe on activation she will consume the stacks to apply an extra 30/40/50% of her AD as magic damage per wave.\n\nThis rework focuses on the guns left  to MF by her mother and her capability for insane upfront damage (wich is the core of the &ldquo;shock and awe&rdquo; military strategy). She gathers resources (in this case, shock and awe stacks) to turn the tides in her favor. Extended duels and AoE damage will still be her speciality. She gets a mini charm to spice up the fantasy of a very resourceful, gorgeous bounty hunter, and Make it rain becomes a pure zoning tool to control the battlefield\nBullet time is the grand finale.\n\nNumbers can be tweaked. I&#039;d like everyone to join in the conversation so we can get something good going here!****\n\nEDIT: rephrased a few stuff","replies":[{"poster":"Zuske BloodLine","date":"2015-07-30T06:19:53.454+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"RIOT PLEASE , WE WANT MF TO BE ACTUALLY GOOD.

So here is a much simpler version:\n\n\n> Well like it or not, she doesn't need any changes. And as mentioned, she still has a good winrate, which is contrary to everyone's belief that she sucks.

She's not a AD caster, she's an auto attack AD.\n\nThanks for telling me what her abilities did, I totally didn't know! (AND you were half wrong, heres why!)\n\nPassive: A MS boost you lose as soon as you get hit by ANYTHING. (really good for helping her get her damage off!)\n\nHer  Q: basically an aa reset in lane, it doesn't do anything later due to AA's hitting faster with the potential to crit. So true, it does help her do more damage in lane, but nowhere else.\n\nW: well you already said it, it's a steroid, it gives her more damage on her aa's\n\nE: This is her only ability that either needs to be made more reliable, or completely changed. It stops her autos that you seem so keen on talking about, for a very weak aoe slow field, that scales off of ap, how useful. (I'll be honest here, this ability is good in certain situations, but even in those situations it feels so terrible to use because of how much damage you lose.)\n\nR: Wow, you get to stack to do as much damage as you did before her first rework. Fucking great. Really the stacking change was terrible. I have only played her a few times after this change, and I haven't played her in ranked since S3 because of it. (it makes 0 fucking sense to me why this change went through, it really pisses me off) What's even better is they decided to make the magic damage on the ult (due to w) scale off of AD, and the physical damage scale off of AP. Seriously? Who's the fucking genius that came up with this half-assed change? It was just added because they wanted to cut her damage unless she stacks. (after she was already in a weakened state due to pro-players getting her nerfed)\n\nYeah she has decent damage, and that's all a champion really needs, but when your abilities stop you from doing the thing you want to do most, (you said it yourself, auto attack) then you lose cohesion. Which was all well and good until they decided to make her auto attack to make her abilities stronger. It's no longer a choice in your play pattern. You get to do the same thing over and over again.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-07-30T14:59:17.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Miss Fortune's abilities fall off late game.

But I'm going to prove you wrong.\nMF is extremely item reliant, even more so considering she brings no utility like Sivir or Kalista. At most, you could say that the utility she brings is mixed damage, and to make her mixed damage a possible threat, she needs a huge amount of AD (because of the low AD ratio) and Attack speed (because of the amount of stacks she needs). Where would she get this if it's not with items? a Nice attack speed buff is Jinx's switcheroo or Tristana's Rapid Fire. MF's is okay-ish at most.\n\nDraven can nuke you because of the AD ratio and criticals of his Q. He'd be closest to MF in item dependancy, but his Q can critical while MF's Impure shots are magic damage.\n\nOut of all the examples you gave, Vayne would be the least item dependant, because of her true damage scaling in W, and even so, she needs items and time to carry. Both Kalista and Sivir bring insane utility to the team, but that doesn't mean they don't need items to work properly (Kalista with Ruunan, Sivir with AD). \n\nSivir uses in her total basic attack damage for the first hit of W, has no cap in targets for the bounces, just a cap of 40% damage reduction at most. The first hit also applies on-hit effects and can critical, It's also an AA reset and she gets off the AAs quickly because of her R interaction (extra attack speed while W is active)\n\n**How do you fail to see the problems Miss Fortune has compared to the ADCs you just mentioned? **They're like the easiest examples to pinpoint. Here, I'll do it for you:\n\n{{champion:67}} \n-AD Ratio on Q that can critical and lifesteal.

When you can keep up your shields in fights, Strut can be active indefinitely.\n-Make it Rain is a zoning tool you can use to set up ganks or ultis if used correctly.\n-Bullet time has one of the highest possible damage outputs in the game, because of the Impure shot stack mechanic.\n\nOf course, in paper, it all sounds fine and dandy. **But taking into account that:**\n-Q doesn't crit and the cast time severes your AA chain as you get Attack speed.\n-Impure Shots have a very low AD ratio per stack, and you need 8 stacks for it to reach it's full potential. The damage isn't factored in Critical Strike or Lifesteal.\n-Make it rain has a cast time, it's also magic damage that scales of AP. It doesn't even apply impure shots stacks to glue her kit together.\n\nit makes all her strenghts fade in comparison with other ADCs.\nDraven and Vayne both Have similar AD Steroids on their Qs (85% ad and 50% ad) both apply On hit effects and the modified AA can critical as normal while not taking the bonus damage in, while lifesteal takes the whole damage into consideration.  Now Miss Fortune's AD steroid is Impure shots, to access the full damage she needs 8 stacks on the target, it's 48% AD magical damage so it's not taken into consideration for lifesteal, critical, nor benefits from amor penetration.\nDraven also scales fully on AD on all his damaging skills. Vayne has %Max HP pure damage every 3 attacks.\n\nAnd Bullet time, while having one of the possible highest damage outputs in game, it's only with the best set up possible (wich is 8 stacks already on the target at lvl 16). The maximum damage output without stacks is 1000+20% of your AP (as physical damage)+216% of your AD, as magic damage, while it's 384% AD with max stacks before casting. The scenario for Bullet time to be at used it's strongest is almost impossible, It's like asking anyone to sit for a full channel of a Katarina ult\n\nIn this post, I haven't said that MF is trash, I'm simply saying she's lackluster in several areas due to her kit and mechanics. Just because you don't see the flaws in Miss Fortune doesn't mean she doesn't have them. Keep up the circlejerk that MF is completely fine, just not here.\n\nWhat we're trying to do here is assess Miss Fortune's weaknesses and kit, you're the one who directly compared her to other adcs in your previous post.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-07-30T07:23:37.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her high mixed damage gives her a nice midgame where it's hard to itemize against her.

It's not the mixed damage part of it. The odd thing is that the physical damage scales with AP while her magic damage component of Bullet time scales with AD and is situational (because you need pre-applied stacks for it to hit like a truck).

I bring heal and barrier on mf because her total ms alone with the passive is good. \nHer q jump hitbox got nerfed but it now applies on hit effects. Other than being an aa reset(aa-q-aa does a lot of dmg for trading). Plus you can lifesteal from that(that's good considering extras dmg from kill on first q hit for the bounce). Triforce is also good on her now since it gives her more ms which is ridiculous(its so funny how fast she is combined with her passive and red upgrade on boots), her max lvl q is 3cd so procing triforce is easy.\nHer w restarting her passive is great that's why I brought barrier. If you have a shield, your passive doesn't go off until your main bar gets hurt. When ganked you are able to turn the tides by using heal barrier(you get more ms with the heal) to kite them.\n The bonus magic dmg on her w passive is good too and nobody realises that. It scales of ad!!! She does mixed damaged per aa that gets stronger per stack which also applies with her ult to make it scale(some people just don't know how to read..\"mf ult doesn't scale and does no dmg\").\nI'm fine with her e. More upfront damage is great. Don't complain that it's ap scaling, other champs like cait have ap scaling on their cc(its because they're not mages, giving them more burst is op. These specific abilities are for utility not damage... Unless if you're ap mf). Also the cast range is pretty far and the aoe size can hit 4 ppl.\n\nSome tips: start with your ult during teamfights or going for kills in botlane. It allows you to atleast clear the minions that will hurt your passive and also apply atleast 5 stacks which means more damage in your aas. Your ult also has a passive that increases your stack limit(she could reach 10 which is like 100+ magic damage per aa). Or finish them with it after 3 or 4 aa. Her ult range is huge  so you could reach enemies out of aa range that running away.\nGet bloodthirstier first. The shield keeps her passive alive and the extra sustain from her q is ubsurd.\nDon't be fooled get phantom dancer not static shiv(recommended item, its inferior and you don't need fast waveclear since you have w). Its better on her because of the stats and moving thru minions passive... Also moreee speeed.\n\nPS.

The changes I posted here are just another way out, trying to bring the identity the lore gives her forward.\nI moved the impure shots effect to the passive because her current kit relies completely on stacking impure shots to ramp up damage in both her AAs and ulti. And I don't think Riot wants to change this completely. \n\nLet me explain the new passive a bit further, I may have missed a few points (I'll edit the first post, thank you for pointing it out) it does the following:\n   1. Like Ashe's passive, the stacks are counted on yourself, not the enemy. Wich means that you could possibly gain stacks with minions/monsters and then proceed to trade/duel.\n   2. It still ramps like the current impure shots mechanic,  a bit higher actually, with less conditions. 5 Stacks for +50% AD instead 8 stacks for +48% at lvl 16.\n   3. The AS boost by reaching 5 stacks would give her an \"I'm ready to own your sorry butt\" feeling during trades. It's not like Jinx's Q that ramps as she attacks, it happens **only** after reaching 5 stacks. My first idea was making it ramp just like the AD ratio though, final result is the same anyways.\n   4. Riot loves moments of power and decision making, wich is why both W and R consume the stacks. Trade offs and decisions she needs to make. Clarity for her opponents because she'd have an indicator of how many stacks she has accumulated.\n\nIt's also the same for Strut, I think Riot wants Strut to remain on her kit (because of the current changes), wich is why I kept it, but turned it into a skill. As her passive it barely has chances of tinkering with it. Also.....don't you feel impure shots is her true passive anyways?\n\nBy makig Strut into a skill, there are new possibilities of what could it do. In my version,  It's not a dash nor a jump so if she can't move after casting Strut she's still done for. But it opens the possibility for actually chasing, you'd consume your stacks to close the distance between you and your target with the speed boost that decays, but cannot be taken down to 0 with 1 damage from a minion. The charm is just the icing on the cake, because of her lore and because I hate when Rengar or akali jump and obliterate me without any possible solution from my side other than flash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2015-07-30T12:29:52.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Khell DarkWolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kPrAuiWh,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-07-30T10:59:41.711+0000)\n>\n> 5: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/5VeOp6Xq-old-mf-need-a-buff-now-new-mf-needs-a-buff-when-will-rito-buff-mf?comment=00010003000000010001\n\nTaken from this link.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Khell DarkWolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5VeOp6Xq,comment-id=00010003000000010001,timestamp=2015-07-29T05:11:22.835+0000)\n>\n> I think what should be done is her playstyle and kit should reflect more to what she is doing while addressing the issues in the past.\n> \n> An example:\n> \n> {{champion:21}}  **Miss Fortune**\n> \n> - Passive removed\n> - Movespeed increased to 335 (up from 325 live servers)\n> - New passive added: **Shock & Awe**\n> \n> **Passive - Shock & Awe:**\n> Shock: For every 5% of bonus attack speed you gain from outside this passive and outside Impure shots' active, you gain 0.5 points of flat Magic penetration. \n> Awe: For every 1 point of flat Magic penetration you gain outside this passive, you gain 1.25% of bonus attack speed.\n> \n> \n> **Double-Up [Q]:**\n> \n> - Changed to a skill shot\n> - Bounce mechanic removed\n> - Upon colliding with a target after it is fired, the projectile splinters into a spray of shrapnel onto the target and behind it in a cone dealing damage (Think of Lissandra Q and Graves Ult blended together on a smaller scale)\n> - Graphic animation could be a (recolored/altered) version of the new Bullet Time textures for the explosion spray\n> \n> **Impure Shots [W]:**\n> \n> - Strut steroid mechanic removed\n> \n> \n> **Make it Rain [E]:**\n> \n> - Mana cost reduction per level\n> OR\n> - Flat mana cost reduction\n> OR\n> - Applies Impure Shots' stacks\n> \n> \n> **Bullet Time [R]:**\n> \n> - Autoattacking while channeling no longer cancels the channel of Bullet Time (Press [R] again to stop or wait until channel is finished)\n> \n> \n> So a Synapses:\n> \n> MF is nimble _enough_ that she is along side the speeds of Sivir {{champion:15}} , Quinn {{champion:133}} , Jayce {{champion:126}} , Lucian {{champion:236}} since strut is removed.\n> \n> New passive doesn't stack upon itself, but is unique enough that it scales upon **what her kit currently emphasizes** on what she does.
