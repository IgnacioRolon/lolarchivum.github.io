They didnt update her lore, her kit was reworked losing her identity as a adc that you pick against sustain lanes, making her like the adc of &quot;why would you pick her?&quot; because of the aoe damage? -jinx,lucian,graves, corki.kalista says hi-....because she is a bully in lane? -caitlyn, tristana, graves, lucian, ashe,jinx says hi-....because of the pure raw damage she have? -draven, vayne, kog, jinx says hi-....and they are safer, and better at doing those 3 things...and leaving her in limbo state gameplay wise.\r\n\r\nIn the story part they never explain how she is a legendary bounty hunter/captain...is she is a master with guns? if she is so fast that nobody could catch her? Like, why her passive are hearts? she doesnt taunt anybody, I know she is alluring, but hearts in her walk?...\r\n\r\nI was reallly hoping some dimension on MF with this event...I mean she holds the achetype of the sexy gunner in league of legends universe...but they left her even more plain that before.\r\n\r\nAnd the worse part is that they dont answer or give any type of feedback on the matter of MF....is really discouraging.","replies":[{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2015-07-16T21:03:34.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They give feedback on MF.  You just have to find it.\n\nUpon that, I won't argue or give you commentary on her gameplay.  that's something I can't give you anything on; however, I can speak somewhat on her lore.  What I can say is, they will update her lore.  It will show WHY she is a great bounty hunter.  It may just be because she's fast and swift.  The woman can also use her charms and looks to get what she wants.  That doesn't suggest that she whores herself out to get what she's after, but she may just play with people and walk away leaving them wanting.\n\nAs of right now, your comment on her lore suggests that you think that this is all to her that Riot has planned.  Right now, they are about to test the new  format for delivering lore utilizing Azir and Xerath's lore pieces.  If that is successful, we should see everything very soon during the BW event, and I mean EVERYTHING for the BW champs.  They may not tell their WHOLE stories, but I'm damned sure that if Riot is able to get that system up the way they want for this event, EVERYONE will be happy (except for those who are forever negative)","replies":[]}]}
