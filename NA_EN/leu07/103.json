If she tries to retaliate against poke from her lane-opponent, she either gets destroyed or loses out on her entire manapool. \n\nHer laning phase is among the weakest in the entire game since she has no escape-tools from ganks, no tankyness and a passive which is responsible for her abysmal ratios.

The thing is, riot won't let public image champs like Ahri, Kata or Annie get nerfed or irrelevant. When have you seen Annie, Ahri or Kata in trash tier in the soloqueue? I have not. Heck, Cassio got some love from the pros because she fits the tank meta with her sustain damage, not because she is broken. The reason why she got banned many times was because the teams did not want to give comfort picks to let's say... EasyHoon or Febiven. I've seen other pro players from other regions playing Cassiopeia in these tournaments and most of them lost hard. \n\nAlso, I don't really know why people say cassio is a noob champ, you can't just roll your face on the key board like you do with {{champion:55}}, you have to be constantly poisoning targets (btw, you can't just simply switch between targets) and get close to do damage, you can get chain ccd, miss poison, you can get outplayed easily aswell. It's more about positioning perfectly and landing skillshots rather than E spaming. People just loooove to talk sh*t about a champ they haven't really played. Briefly, riot should focus their balance endeavors in soloqueue nightmare freelo champs, not some comfort picks for the pros. Why can't the pros be allowed to be strong with certain champ?
