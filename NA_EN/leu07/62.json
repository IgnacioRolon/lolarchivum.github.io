Also, right now she is not at her best imo, both thematically, gameplay and popularity wise. I believe Cassiopeia would be more popular and more appealing if she was moved to a more assassin type of roll. I believe it fits her theme better; when I think about snakes, deathly is the word that comes to my mind, snakes are specialized hunters and assasins, just one bite is all it takes, just one embrace of their body will do the job. Also, I think Cassiopeia&#039;s personality if more close to a calculating assassin niche. In &quot;Descent to the tomb&quot; the Shurima event video, when Cassiopeia betrayed Sivir she acted like an opportunistic assasin, stabbing Sivir in the back. That&#039;s just how I picture {{champion:69}} , a manipulative, calculating badass assassin bitch. I know her current direction might be far away from this theme that I&#039;m proposing, but it may be something to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThis is just my thought as a Cassiopeia main and fan.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2015-10-29T21:03:17.759+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe if they stopped nerfing her Poison and buffing her E she could be cool.... assassin or not, the hyper reliance on E makes her a terrible champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-10-29T19:41:40.193+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember someone posting a pretty cool kit for her which focused on that assassin idea, it was about using her poison to shut off various senses of the enemy until they were completely stunned and unable to see so she could go in for the backstab. Heck, anything would be better than what we have right now, so why not give it a try?","replies":[]},{"poster":"NavyDivea","date":"2015-10-29T21:01:13.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's neat and all but leave my snake lady alone, shes fine as is. In the right hands shes a huge lane bully that scales extremely well. She just needs a team to protect her in fights, granted if she E's someone without poison it hurts her dps a lot but that's more about paying attention to your targets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-10-29T20:55:08.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worst idea ever  ! Seriously you want to turn the Serpent lady into an assasin , Cassiopeia is perfect mage role , just need a better rework","replies":[]}]}
