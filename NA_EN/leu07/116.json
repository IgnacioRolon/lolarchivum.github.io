I have seen many other people (besides me) comenting about cass&#039;s current state soI wanna talk about how you people feel about Cassiopeia and also give some feedback about what I believe her main issues are and an idea I had to give her a little buff.\r\n\r\n This is what I think are her main issues:\r\n\r\n1. She is hard to play, which is fine, I love the challenge! but most times she does not feel rewarding at all compared to mastering Azir, Viktor or even Anivia. She is super situational, and yet, you could be better off without her and pick someone safer.\r\n\r\n2. Her kit yells lane bully yet her early got gutted, I still remember the pre-rework level 2 FBs, so yummy. I know this is because riot&#039;s new trajectory for her to the late game, where she is supposed to shine. But I think she got gated hard, she is not allowed to punish miss-position or bad plays from her enemies because you will get oom if you casts 4 Es. Seriously, just go some pots and Cass will never kick you out of lane. This can be solved by some Ap regen yellows, but that  denies a defense stat for her like health or armor. She could use a little mana buff imo. \r\n\r\n3. I play cass a lot, and in my experience, the 500 stacks usually caps at 40-43 mins. She is supposed to get this 500 stacks, as her design intends; to make her &quot;the late game monster&quot; as riot said. But games usually end now by 30-35 minutes in my experience, so most of the times (specially if the enemy team got an early lead) Cassiopeia is not allowed to get her late game state. I would say that her cap stack should be 450 stacks to make it a little fair.\r\n\r\nSo those are the main issues I find with Cassiopeia. I really love the whole late game hyper carry thematic (looking at you {{champion:96}}  &lt;3). And I think Cassiopeia needs something else for her late game... examining Cassiopeia, she plays soo very similar to an adc, though she is rather short ranged... She relies on constant E spam to make damage, much like an AA from an ADC. Now, following this pattern and comparing her to other late game carries like {{champion:67}} and {{champion:96}}, she could use a little health %magic damage.\r\n\r\n Here&#039;s my idea:  \r\n\r\nAt 500 stacks (or 450 if rito-sama allows it) Cassiopeia also deals 3% of the targets maximum health as magic damage with her Q and W with each tick (9% with a full Q), this could give her a nice tool to retiliate back at tanks and iniators that miss-play at locking her down. I don&#039;t really think this would be a huge buff to her, but a fair one to make up for her early game nerfs.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think Cassipeia could need a buff? Be comfortable to give some feedback too!\r\n\r\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/dc/66/ed/dc66ed80407463b2c2be4fdb82f694d9.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"SwapShadows","date":"2015-08-24T09:34:37.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"shes not weak it's just that cass players find her boring.\n\nalso shes like the biggest lane bully in the game","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-08-24T10:01:00.769+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwapShadows,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=57KZpaLN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-24T09:34:37.325+0000)\n>\n> shes not weak it's just that cass players find her boring.\n> \n> also shes like the biggest lane bully in the game\n\nEhem... {{champion:92}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:112}}  are bigger lane bullies in my opinion, like I said, you could just run cristaline + pots or boots + pots and you'll be fine against cass because she is very mana hungry.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-08-24T09:57:40.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh... not sure why you want to buff her very late game when that's not the problem at all. :P \n\nIf something needs adjusting, it's her early game; to make it more reliable to get to the late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-08-24T10:02:14.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ã‡erastes,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=57KZpaLN,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-24T09:57:40.598+0000)\n>\n> meh... not sure why you want to buff her very late game when that's not the problem at all. :P \n> \n> If something needs adjusting, it's her early game; to make it more reliable to get to the late game.\n\nBecause that's what riot wanted, a late game carry.

Since riot wants her to be squashed at early, it would be fair to give her that very late game carry feature, the %health damage, it does not seem like much in my opinion. Also, it would only be acquired at the very late game, if she managed to get there...","replies":[{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-08-24T10:17:55.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leu07,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=57KZpaLN,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-08-24T10:04:32.819+0000)\n>\n> I aggree with you, but right now this is what with got for her :/ Riot said no future plans for her, so I thought about ideas to buff her.

So why can't cass have both? it's not a lot of damage and it's in the poison. Also, it would be acquired at 500 stacks which means 42 mins. Where tanks already have MR stacked on them. Late game carries like kog and vayne are supposed to shred tanks. I thought Cass could use that too.","replies":[]}]}]}
