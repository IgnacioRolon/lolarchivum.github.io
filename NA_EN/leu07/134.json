Why buff him? almost anyone has been asking for Zed buff at all! even the mains say he is broken, if anything, people want him deleted. So why this out of the blue buff? (we all know the answer, gotta sell that project zed skin...) The lattest nerf (which was not big deo) was also half reverted. Meanwhile people asks to revert the Cassio&#039;s rework but nope, people asks for Soraka&#039;s W to not cost her TRUE damage to herself but no. Players ask to give Zyra some MS back like you guys said you would, but nope. LC$ patches incoming people... better drop until this madness goes off. Please be bored at watching Lee sin, Zed and leblanc be picked on the championships everygame. Damn, I liked to see a {{champion:134}}, a {{champion:69}} or a {{champion:101}}  here and there. But they don&#039;t make flashy plays so nope.","replies":[]}
