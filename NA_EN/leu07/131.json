I was wondering if some of the other items that were available during the Black Market&#039;s Brawlers map are being considered for Summoner&#039;s Rift? Specially.....\r\n\r\n**Martyr&#039;s Gambit**\r\n{{item:3911}}  \r\n\r\nIt was a clear countermeasure against assassins, and it also felt very rewarding as a tank support to **be able to willfully redirect damage from a teammate onto myself so that they&#039;d survive**. Talk about a good name for an item lol. \r\nIt gave my inmobile ADC or APC a window to react against Rengar or Akali or Zed if I timed it correctly. When the news about Dead Man&#039;s Plate being enabled onto the Rift came out, I hoped this item would come sooner or later! Is it possible?","replies":[]}
