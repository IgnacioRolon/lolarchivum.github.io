If he gets reverted he will be just one more gunner. I believe many people was having a lot of fun with him, I know some others believe he is a bit on the op side, he may need some tweaks here in there, but I think he is not that broken at all, let us be honest, in soloq or normal simply in normals people just pick the champs they want, not really think about the comp, I personally think that if you pick a hecarim/vi/leblanc/wukong/panth.. etc you will be able to shut him down, even a mage can totally destroy kog on a 1v1, take malzahar for example, or even Cass. \r\n\r\nAnyways, in resume, I like the indentity kog&#039;maw has right now and do not want it to be reverted :c","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-09-09T13:37:47.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  he may need some tweaks here in there, but I think he is not that broken at all, let us be honest\n\nwutt? he is busted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-09-09T12:18:45.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like for him to be killable though.
