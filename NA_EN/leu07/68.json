I hope she get the tristana/katarina/sejuani/sivir treatment\n\nthat being said I wanna share my take on mf and how I picture her.\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/IOKIboyl.jpg[/img]\n\nReading her lore...mf is a legenday bounty hunter, captain and a person that influences the political stance of Bilgewater.\nShe knows she is really good looking so she uses her looks....to get some things done.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I will be posting her skins and stuff.\n\n**Candy Cane MF**\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/6WWOWa0.jpg[/img]\n\nCandy Cane it could be such a great skin...her bullets are snowballs, her dance it could be jingle bell rock from mean girls.\n\n**Road Warrior MF**\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/i2pPmw1.jpg[/img]\n\nRoad Warrior MF....mmm its a really weird choice for a skin on mf...I could see it work on graves... But well, mad max is coming...my inspiration for this was Luis Royo millenium girls.\n\n**Waterloo MF**\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/wd6DDJ8.jpg[/img]\n\nWaterloo MF....with this skin I tried to make it more french military from the XVIII century...where she look more like a General. \n\n**Cowgirl MF**\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/BstMQ5k.jpg[/img]\n\nCowgirl MF....was the first skin I bought for MF...I think its her best skin -this was long time ago before arcade came up- she is blond, she is sexy....this skin doesnt need much change actually...I just fringe-up lol\n\n**Mafia MF**\n\nSo....with mafia I found myself on a crossroad...I really like the concept of MF being all 1920 new york ganster, she is literally wearing the hat, the suit, and all....but mafia jinx came in and they make her a flapper girl...because it fit her thematically and it was something you would have seen on that era.\n\nSo I though about it....for MF thematically what could fit her...in the mafia culture in the 1920....so here is my take.\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/mJBxg8i.jpg[/img]\n\nThe inspiration is quite clear (Jessica Rabbit)....if jinx is a flapper girl, MF should be a siren from the noir films.\n\n**Secret Agent MF**\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/V2Lt59p.jpg[/img]\n\nSame case with mafia...when you think \"MF is a secret agent\" the first picture that comes to your mind...its not a MF in a dress....you picture black widow.....so yeah.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-02-22T18:04:30.977+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely like that idea on Secret Agent MF a lot better then the one we have. Always thought it didn't really fit the \"secret agent\" theme they way they made it.  The waterloo being made into more of a general also is a much better idea for that skin.\n\nMafia MF on the other hand, being my favorite skin of hers, I still like it the way it is but that's a nice idea for it as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2015-02-21T19:39:26.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know MF is suppose to be THE sexual icon in league based on her background and stuff since she tends to use seduction to get her way, but please give her the Akali treatment and nerf her boobs.
