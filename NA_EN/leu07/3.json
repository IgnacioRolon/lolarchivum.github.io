It looks great don't get me wrong but you guys often go on about not touching certain assets due to doubling up on work for champs that require a VGU, but WW is already (high) on that list for VGU's so why update that splash that may need changing anyway?

Because despite being an early champ, Eve's aesthetic niche is pretty damn unique.  S&M blue invisible lady that eviscerates you with her hands (now visibly upgraded with claws in the splash art, which looks AWESOME)  It would be better to build her VGU around it instead of trying to change something for the sake of change.\n\nThe answer is MOAR and BETTER, not \"eh this doesn't look realistic lets change it\"\n\nGood things aesthetically:\n\n- Poppy and her bigger hammer. MORE HAMMER.  MORE TWINTAILS\n- Taric and his bigger gems and fabulousness.  MORE FAB\n- Tristana and her yordleness and big gun.  MORE GUN\n- Soraka, Nidalee, Annie (really good textures, don't know why you guys stopped using high quality textures like that)\n- Master Yi\n- Garen - MORE DEMACIA (RIP Garen punch)\n- Nasus - MORE DOG\n- Twitch - MORE RAT\n- Sion - the undead juggernaught aspect was amped up and the voice actor is great (SINDRIIIII).  The campy arnold parody was a pretty hefty loss unfortunately.  MORE BIGGER, MORE UNDEAD\n- Sivir - much better than before, but...\n- Karthus - MORE UNDEATH POPE.\n\nBad things:\n\n- Sivir - Ironstylus said she wouldn't be anglo, yet you guys made her pretty damn white.  Kind of a weird direction to take since she's in the desert.\n- Fiora - completely pointless VU.  It was basically change for the sake of change, there was no real improvement.  IMO you actually ruined all of her aesthetics, including all of the skins.\n- Karma - Might as well be a different champ\n- Trundle - Freljord hurrrrrr\n- Sejuani - Everyone in the freljord is a semi-nude badass but Sej has to wear heavy winter clothing?  Lol, wut\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR - Eve's appearance is pretty unique, her new splash art is REALLY great.  When you start thinking of doing her VGU, don't ask stupid shit like \"Why is her hair pink and standing, wtf is she wearing all those ribbons for, why is she wearing those weird clothes anyway?\"\n\nQuestions like that are for losers with no imagination.  \n\nWhy does Zerg Kerrigan have heels and a super tight ass?  Because the Overmind liked tight round asses that's why, stfu holy shit we got bigger problems here.\nWhy does Nami have boobs?  I dunno, who cares.  Mermaids.\nWhy do Space Marine commanders not use helmets, isn't it unsafe?  Because they're higher rank fuck you take a chainsword to the face you heretic.\nIsn't the BFG a little too dangerous?  plz get real broseph\nWhy DID the old lady swallow a fly?  I don't know why she swallowed a fly; perhaps she'll die.\n\n\nIn summary, think about what changing Eve's aesthetics will bring to the game, and what we'll lose by removals.","replies":[{"poster":"Konan527","date":"2016-04-15T09:35:14.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that new eve splash looks nearly perfect based on what we know of eve but from a story theme gameplay side of things riot should be allowed to evolve in the best way possible not just limited because of a current splash(but i would still keep it in a traditional skin even though i know they like to skip those and make the character incorporate some aspects of the base) Now this part is mostly personal since everyone has different views of what a champion is however karma was realistically a mess with her old look/story in need of an actual strong identity other than just i like jing/jang.Fiora was desperately in need of better gameplay and more cohesive look to better represent her theme of a grand fencer duelist ,i miss the grand lights in her old splash but this one better represents the character.It really doesn't make much sense for Sejuani to show off that much skin cause her theme is so focused on being a strong brutal warrior the bikini which does have a traditional skin is mostly just anime fan service bs.For Taric i feel they could have done more especially in keeping the gem knight feel because as far knights go all we have left is pretty much Morde and that's more of a haunted armor.The rest of your post is mostly fine.","replies":[{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2016-04-15T11:10:39.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason I don't think the splash art is a limiting factor is because Eve literally has no background/story/info.
