What feels shitty ?\n\nUh i could have sworn I got more, maybe it has not loaded yet man.\n\nFirst of, remember is normal, so I'm not sure how legit it can be to demolish a first time vayne lol.\n\nWell basically I feel like she is still a very counter pick type of champ. And her laning relies in sooo many factors that are out of her control.\n\nHer second Q cast dmg IT'S AWESOME, but it's really hard to pull off, plus is very easy to know when you are going to do it. Her team fight is really meh. Relies too much on her ult and the enemy team grouping and having someone like leo/alist/mumu to keep them in their place for a little while.\n\nHonestly my problem with her it's that she feels meh. I love her, I love her secret agent skin, I truly love playing with her, but I feel like she is a \"when the stars align\" type of champ. And even then it would prob be better to pick someone like jinx.\n\nThat's her problem, she has too much competition in her niche. Need AoE dmg? Jinx does it better. Need bully potential? Jinx/Cait/Trist much better and safer. Need to split push? Sivir will prob do a better job, and her ult and shield makes up for her lack of escapes.\n\n\nSHE IS FUN. I have tons of fun playing her, I LOVE taking an ADC 1/4 hp with one Q dmg, I love her poke I love her. I just dont see myself picking her if I want to win, or atleast not very often :S\n\nAlso I have problems with her build paths.\n\nHer Q doesnt work with Crits. Her R scales with both AD and AP (AP From ult, AD from W), her E scales with AP, and her W with AD but deals magic dmg, plus having a shield is awesome.\n\nSo the problem is, you rush IE? Or BT? If you rish IE then you never have passive. If you rush BT you lack IE crit dmg. But the thing is she is more of a caster, so you dont relay that much on AA's.\n\nBasically I still cant find her ideal build path. So far I think BT>Boots>Ghostblade>IE/LW>PD/LW/IE>Either more dmg or some def.\n\nBT into Ghostblade works really well with her  passive and W. The bonus ms from ghostblade makes her uncachable, and she usees the armor pen and AS and AD really well. Plus since her job is to be a lane bully and to roam alot, mid game the sustain and the 6 seg where she has godlike AS really helps her out. Then you build the IE/PD/LW combo for late game DPS. I think that's her most ideal build path but still testing :D\n\nEDIT: they also lied about her passive scaling on lvl. Shame on rito.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-25T21:56:23.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Noneia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AFGdOARq,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-25T20:36:35.846+0000)\n>\n> Seriously ?

Her mana cost where big thanks to that, then they rework her and it was still good, but they nerfed it now...her laning phase is not the same you must build her laning phase based on her strut. Its a diferent champion...and the bounce range wasnt nerf it was the angle...before it was 100 angle now its 60...but the range its the same.\n\nW: no GW removal is not bothering me....you can activate strut and if you have BT or a support that gives you a constant shield aka janna, lulu, karma...is good since you can kite and all that stuff...but if you dont its feels weird...minions take it off and yes she have 60% of attack speed but you dont max w first....and come on when W is maxed you must already have some attack speed on you and it doesnt feel different...its not like you have tristana,jinx demolish tower power. \n\nThe amount of stacks you need for impure to have an impact is really huge for a 550 range champion and if you reach 8 stacks in a trade then you must not have any ad power since the other champion should be dead...plus the flat % on her damage is easily mitigated by mr...and since you dont build magic pen its hard.\n\nE: yes the slow its better in early, in late you dont used it....you must wait 0.5 seconds in range while they are coming for you in a spell that last 2 seconds so its actually slow for 1.5 seconds....plus the damage is never outstanding and it not like varus slow that sticks to you even if youre out of the area of damage.....make it rain have saved me from ganks in lanes, thanks to the slow, and strut. But in mid-late game never, ever, in my life that spell have saved me XD.\n\nthanks for the feedback...and sorry for the typos.","replies":[{"poster":"Hochelaga","date":"2015-07-26T01:32:03.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw I just tested her on game again. her Q keeps the same stats damage PLUS the 150% extra damage.
