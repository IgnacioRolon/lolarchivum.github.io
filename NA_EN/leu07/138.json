Ionia is the place of asian folklore, balance, magic and elements. So I thought on why Ionia doesnt have more elements character or what if the school where Yasuo was from had different teachers that controled different elements, there so different pupils who excels in different areas?...this was my first train of thoughts when I was making this character.\r\n\r\nSo ive picked the element water, cause is my favorite, and I think that league doesnt have really that much characters that have water like their core....the only one that comes to my mind when I think in water is Nami. Then I showed concept to a friend and he was like...oh thats like a water skin for Diana? and I was like illuminated hahaha bacause the moon is responsible for the tides of the ocean....and I created this storyline in my mind that goes like this..... \r\n\r\n&quot;Long time ago, lunari and solari lived in peace. The lunari were people that studied magic, astrology, feng shui, that kinda stuff while the solari were the warriors of the country, in the search for the Moonstone, noxian attacked the Lunari (bard cinematic) and only a handful of Lunari survive and moved away to a remote island, the Solari forgot about the Lunari. Time passed by and the Lunari became a quite powerful society, even a myth. Until kalista show up and the shadow island event happened.......again only a handful of people survived and went to Ionia, where they created this town that was shroud in moonlight, and only the lunari could enter or go out (that would explain the magic,balance,stuff thats going on in Ionia)....waiting for the moon to become red and awake with revenge (diana&#039;s awake).&quot;\r\n\r\n**Silhouette Time**\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/nYEey7G.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nSo for this character, I wanted a warrior...serene, poise and femenine. So I started exploring the epitome of japanese woman, with the heian woman (the first one)...I thought the silhouette was really nice and different (lol doesnt have a silhouette like that to a gal I think) I also liked the fact that they were all covered up with layers and layers of cloth, but they took away the warrior factor and looked more like a sorceress...the same thing with the geisha silhouette (the second) plus it looked kinda generic and remind me of Sakura Karma.....I continued working on the silhouette based on the geisha and number 3 came around, I loved this silhouette, but then I played Liss and I was like...yeah it reminds me of Liss...so back to the sketch board....and number 4 came around and I like it a lot, it was mysterious, it looked kinda mad, it was femenine and looked like a warrior.\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\nSo I&#039;m bad with numbers...\r\n\r\n* Passive: Tidal.\r\nMisuki ignores enemies collision.\r\nMizuki doesnt use mana, she uses tidal (like yasuo uses flow) once is charged Mizuki enters in trance...that give her cdr for X/X/X seconds.\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/sojM7C0.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n* Q: Wave Crescent.\r\nMizuki unleashes a wave of water that travels in a straight line, that blocks 2 spells and slow the enemys it hits.\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/fcAqLOc.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n* W: Water Mirage....max 2 clones.\r\nMizuki creates water clones, this clones mimics everything she does, and take more damage, if a clone is not killed during the time that has spawned they heal Mizuki for X% of her missing health...they last 6 seconds.\r\nClones damage is X% max ad (lets say max 8%) + X%max health of enemy champion as physical damage...they can cast Q and R but the damage is going to be calculated by the formula.\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/QDHN4X7.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n*E: Water Shroud.\r\nPassive: Mizuki&#039;s basic attacks marks her target for the next 3 seconds. After 3 seconds the mark will detonate and steal X% MS and AS.\r\nIf Q or R detonate the mark, the target will recieve X damage. (the mark is the lunari symbol).\r\n\r\nActive: Mizuki shroud herself in water receiving less damage, gains more MS and Tidal charges faster.\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/IoYjDxL.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n* R: Tide&#039;s sentence.\r\nMizuki dashes fowards stunning the characters she hits for a brief period, after that a burst of water explotes from the ground knocking up all enemies in the zone.\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/F3TYVOW.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n**Splash Art (still a wip)**\r\nMaybe some feedback on this please...Im kinda having an artblock with it.\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/ypJO0ZG.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nAnd yeah! thats all....thanks for the reading and sorry for the typos (:","replies":[{"poster":"eve candy","date":"2016-02-18T19:46:13.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I don't see her in theme with the game","replies":[{"poster":"TheHobbits","date":"2016-02-18T19:55:32.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was about to say the same thing.

The ability to block spells as well as having high mobility.   What if she scaled off of AP to distinguish her from him and had part of the tide passive add an ap scaling to her auto attack.  IDK just spit balling here","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-02-18T20:16:42.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty very much!...mmm yeah well she parted from the idea of being a female yasuo...so I think is good that she is in the same design space....if she scale with ap I think it would go into diana (that would make sense do) or azir space with the clones and stuff....so idk XD but ty for the spit balling <3","replies":[]}]}]}
