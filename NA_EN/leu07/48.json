She gets zero love from Riot, period. Heck, even Yorick gets more attention than her at this point.\n\nThere was absolutely no interaction between the guy in charge of that project and her playerbase. The texture update was a real disappointment aswell, they didn't even care to listen to the feedback. Desperada Cass still looks awful compared to her old self and her classic skin also fails to resemble her splashart. \n\nWhat she'd need is a REAL makeover and not some new textures. Her tail animation is pitiful compared to the fluid movement of Vel'koz' tentacles. They also still charge 975 RP for a skin (Mythic) which has no new particles or a recall animation, that's a total ripoff. They need to upgrade it or lower the cost to 750 RP at least. I genuinely feel cheated for even buying this skin.","replies":[]}]}
