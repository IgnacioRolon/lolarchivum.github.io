She passed from a &quot;standard pick, you can pick her anytime and be K&quot; to &quot;Only pick her if the match up is not that bad, if you have a good frontline and there are not so many divers on the enemy team&quot;. I think a small buff to her somewhere would be nice (Q speed faster?), however maybe AP items buffs or changes would be enough to put her where she was before. Maybe it is just me that feels this way about Ori, but she feels a bit weaker than before.","replies":[]}
