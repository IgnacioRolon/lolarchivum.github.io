I was hoping to give some feedback about the skin here, since I don't have a PBE account to post in the PBE. boards thread located here:\n\n[Project Leona bug and feedback thread](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/b3nQxcfA-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-project-leona)\n\nShe looks pretty damn rad, I really like her, specially her E's animation and basic attacks. She looks like that freaking Tank Cyborg you can't put a scratch on, definitely getting the skin for sure! That Recall bruh, talk about being bad ass!\n\nBut the general consensus in that thread is that her particles are a little too desaturated (calling it eggyolk yellow doesn't quite define that desaturated yellow). So I have some pointers I hope come accross as constructive feedback for her skin!\n\nHer shield isn't bright like her sword unless you Q. I understand that it's to show Q's activation, but it's sacrificing a bit too much of the overall feel of the energy shield.  I think that perhaps, adding a triangle+the sunlight effect \"hovering\" the metal part of the shield could be a nice solution so we can keep the shield bright forever? I think it currently only has the regular Q particle glowing in the center instead.\n\nI did a quick color dodging on her recall to show the brighter shield and how it pops more\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Hx5GvuV.png[/img]\n\n\nHer W needs some serious attention though, currently it's her most desaturated particle of them all. Also I think that the explosion effect on the AoE can't really be appreciated (it looks amazing) because it dissapears too fast. Even at the peak of her charge up time it could be brighter. In the beggining it's barely noticeable compared to Base Leona's W cast.\n\n\n\nColor dodging again!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NJSne6k.png[/img]\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UDQMOIN.png[/img]\n\n\nI was thinking that perhaps, switch around the R's floor particle with W's explosion? I don't really know the limitations of particle work in the game ):\n\nNow the suit...I think it needs a bit more yellow in it. I was hoping leona would have her \"skirt\" turned to energy-like panels but I guess that's not possible. But can the two pieces on her waist be recolored to make them more prominent in the design? Also add a bit of yellow to her lower body, her thighs look like cloth and there's not much tech to them\n\nThere's also this thread that caught my attention, wich has more orange toned particles and the suit is darker!\n[Darker Suit](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/43ykwvNd-project-leona-orange-blade-shield-and-a-little-bit-darker?show=new)\nIf the suit was a bit darker, the yellow would pop tremendously.\n\nThanks in advance, sorry for my bad english!","replies":[{"poster":"Sniper 0","date":"2015-08-21T01:54:40.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I approve.

Its just really lackluster, clunky and I feel like Rito didnt give it the time it deserved.  Also it not being in the promo assured me that Rito has a bias against leona","replies":[]}]}
