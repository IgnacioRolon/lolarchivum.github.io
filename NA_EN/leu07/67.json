So what is so special about cassiopeia? honestly you need to work really hard on her to get the exact results (even less) that other champs get so much easier. I really hope they fix Cassiopeia in the mage update and the rework wont be another lazy job. Come on, aspect of the sperent is the most lazy thing you could have done to her, no real interaction, its just a nerf early to make her the same she was before rework once she gets stacks, it is really really bad and boring AF.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to give the daily &quot;cassiopeia sucks&quot; post.","replies":[{"poster":"Bonipherus","date":"2016-02-04T02:09:31.491+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making a dps mage is cool and all but... yeah... a marksman will ultimately be more efficient at dps than Cassiopeia because:\n1. marksmen are still useful without mana and will have better mana sustain options than she does.\n2. marksmen don't have to land skillshots in order to use their autos.\n3. marksmen don't have a mandatory 0.5 second delay between autos (graves and jhin are now the exceptions).\n4. marksmen synchronize better with lifesteal (spellvamp in her case).\n5. marksmen auto attacks crit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TonsOfGains","date":"2016-02-04T01:51:51.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not disputing that Cass is kinda weak right now.

It's not difficult, just depends on the scenario. It has no casting time nor channel, so if the enemy isn't expecting it you can pull it off. But again, reliability is a whole different topic. I'm just saying it has potential, and that should be factored in. I mean Janna revolves around the fact that her Q is a potential 5 man knock up, even though it's only potential and rarely happens.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2016-02-04T01:50:57.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I wasn't too fond of the 1.3k ap without mejai.\n\n\nPretty sure she's fine the way she is","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-02-04T01:58:42.875+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shac Norris,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b7208kXE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-04T01:50:57.502+0000)\n>\n> I wasn't too fond of the 1.3k ap without mejai.\n> \n> \n> Pretty sure she's fine the way she is\n\nEwww mejai on cass wtf.","replies":[{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2016-02-04T02:55:25.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, i was talking about the fact that mejai gives you 180ap (or something among those lines)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1 800 MID LANE","date":"2016-02-04T02:04:14.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you not seen all the board posts about how bad she is?","replies":[{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2016-02-04T02:55:52.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played her and did just fine, so i don't get all the posts about her being bad and stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 MID LANE","date":"2016-02-04T08:56:27.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's not bad in the sense that she sucks.

Even then, it can be a long shot. Her kit is designed to be a dps mage, but her mana cost prevent her from doing this properly and she's mostly limited to playing like an assassin/burst mage because of it. The problem there is that she has absolutely no way to get out and no way to defend herself if she even succeeds at killing the target in the first place. She's getting looked at soon, though, so it's not really an issue to worry about much longer.\n\nI suppose my original statement was wrong to some degree, after I re-read it.\n\nBasically, what people are saying is that she's not fun to play and not rewarding of it, either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2016-02-04T02:01:40.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is pretty weak, though I wouldn't consider her the \"AP ADC\".
