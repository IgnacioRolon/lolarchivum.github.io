She literally has some of the highest if not the highest early game damage in the game. Why? Her Q does decent damage and resets auto attacks on top of that her W increases her auto attack damage significantly for only being level 2 with an okay (not the best but reliable) attack speed buff. Miss Fortune absolutely dominates early game and while a few ADCs might eventually out scale her in damage around level 6 not many do.\n\nHer mid game is also definitely one of the strongest for ADCs, her ultimate can secure Dragon and Baron quite easily or destroy an enemy team. She also has pretty nice pushing abilities by slowing enemy minions so your minions can push further and due to her reliable AS steroid pushing towers isn't that difficult.\n\nMiss Fortune however falls off late game in comparison. She's probably one of the worst ADCs for late game but I can see why. If Miss Fortune was exceptionally strong no matter the point in the game then she would literally be broken.\n\nThe reason why Ashe needs a huge rework is because she doesn't have defined strong parts of the game. She's meant to be a utility ADC but she just doesn't have that feel to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Widder88","date":"2015-04-30T10:19:21.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree. I suck as Adc but I play AP MF mid. It is easy to dominate mid lane with MF. She needs no rework.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-04-30T18:36:27.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even AP MF is oddly strong? From what I seen it has powerful and safe poke while you zone the enemy like crazy. The ult is scary in team fights as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-04-29T20:53:06.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe rework happened because some space opened up in their otherwise packed timeline, and her rework was smaller in scale. MF should be similarly smaller, so if another opportunity arises, hopefully she gets considered for some changes. Otherwise, unfortunately it'll probably be a while off, since there are a ton of other reworks in the queue (Poppy, Yorick, Urgot, Taric, for example).","replies":[]}]}
