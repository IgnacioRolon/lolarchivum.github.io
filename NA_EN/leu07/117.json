As in don't pick katarina into a heavy cc team. While she has clear weaknesses, she also has strengths that are very viable and if well used, are amazingly powerful. She's very dependant on the enemy team and your team's composition.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-10-22T17:28:35.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"true!....still the nerfs on shunpo, hp, and ult, left her in a weak spot and playing against a lux for example (that katarina should eat her alive) is hard....hell even playing against a karthus have become a task.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-10-22T17:29:23.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kindred denies her pentas, but  her ult can actually give you a penta if you play her as a janitor","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-10-22T17:18:16.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Good, I don't have room to ban her anymore.
