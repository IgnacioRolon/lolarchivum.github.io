Some of these champs have also been without a nice skin for a long time, like Cassiopeia and Zyra, this would be a nice gift to people who have been waiting very long for skins from them.\nSo what do you say? do you guys want aswell an evil star line skin? \n\nQueen Beryl: a villain from Sailor moon\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/sailormoon/images/0/0d/Queen_Beryl.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090818022322\n\nedit1: Some people have commented that there is the Dark star line already, problem is, they do not have anything to do with the Star Guardians, Dark Star Thresh and Varus dont really make many sence, they are just there to look cool \"sugoi, kakkoi\", there is no connection between them and the star guardians.
