But then Riot absolutely demolished her when they removed the ability for her E to proc her Q. Their logic was that they felt it wasn't good she was countered by a 100g item (talking about pink wards back then). That same patch, they claimed it was healthy for a champ to be countered by two 2k+ items but he still needed some small attention, so they gave Zed a very minor nerf to his AS.\n\nYou used to play Akali by using your Q, then waiting until it was almost off CD then doing the following, ult, auto, Q, E, ult as needed. \nWhen Riot removed E from being able to proc Q, Akali's combo became much less fluid and incredibly clunky due to her poor auto attack animation.\n\nEver since that nerf, the only time I have ever seen an Akali do semi-decent was when her opponents were absolutely terrible. As of right now, Akali is easily one of the top 5 champs I DON'T want on my team. If her E was something more than just a really bad energy burner, then she might actually not be a trash pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heptapod","date":"2016-01-27T15:59:13.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot hates her and doesn't care about her.","replies":[]}]}
