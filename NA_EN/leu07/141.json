However, I do feel like Rumble and Vlad in particular are going to be abused when the item changes occur. They are already strong champions, and the changes in place will definitely make them stronger. For Vlad, WotA is going to rely less on penetration items, and there are more items with higher AP values, meaning he will gain more Health as a result, making for a tankier and harder hitting Vlad. For Rumble, the real benefit isn't that Liandry's is getting buffed (though it does help him considerably), it's that all of his items are getting smoother build paths. Needlessly large rod is almost 400 gold less now, meaning Rumble can back with less gold to buy it. He struggles at staying in lane if he is being aggressive as he has no form of sustain to bring him back up if he doesn't win a trade, forcing him to back and buy smaller items. I feel like Kennen is in a similar situation in how he is going to benefit form the changes. Swain as you mentioned likes these changes too, but I feel like he is going to be left unchecked for a while based on his unpopularity; similar things apply to {{champion:63}} {{champion:90}} and {{champion:74}}. \n\nAs for the champion I'm most excited about, I have to say {{champion:13}}. The RoA and Seraph's combination is going to be pretty strong for him in terms of damage, but he is going to be losing some tankiness, I'm not sure what this means for him but it's what's exciting for me. I'm not sure if he is going to be better or worse for these changes, but it means I get to experiment more with the blue man. WotA is looking good on him. I was packing Luden's/Deathcap as offensive items on him, but I'm not sure what to think with the changes coming in. D-cap is more expensive but will give more AP, whereas WotA is going to boost Ryze's tankiness with increased healing in conjunction with his ultimate at the cost of 100+ AP. I could get both but that doesn't allow for a defensive item and with RoA getting its health reduced, I'm not sure what is better. Second RoA to split the difference?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-06-23T02:55:51.871+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want to play {{champion:143}} .\n\nShe's always been one of my favourite mages and the new {{item:3151}} and buffed up {{item:3116}} look really good for her.","replies":[{"poster":"Borbland","date":"2015-06-23T13:44:37.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly they nerfed the slow from pets from 40% to 20%.
