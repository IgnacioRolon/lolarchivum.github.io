I hope you guys like it, specially the Cassiopeia fans out there! ^o^/\r\n\r\n\r\nOne could hear the noises of shattering glass and rumbles from the halls of the Du Couteau&rsquo;s Manor coming form Cassiopeia&rsquo;s chamber.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; yelled Cassiopeia as she was tearing down the curtains of her bed with her claws. \r\n&ldquo;What now?!&rdquo; she grunted just as a person entered her room without her permission.\r\n&ldquo;Who dares enter&hellip; ugh it&rsquo;s you, what do you want? you know I don&rsquo;t like visits&hellip;&quot;\r\n\r\n-&ldquo;I thought you would like to see your sister&hellip;&rdquo; Said Katarina with a subtle smirk.\r\n\r\n-&ldquo;Not now&hellip;&rdquo; grunted the snake lady. She did not want to be seen by anyone anymore since her failure at Shurima anyways&hellip;\r\n\r\n-&ldquo;All right, I wanted to come and see you. You&rsquo;ve been here for days doing nothing, it&rsquo;s time for you to hold up and stop suffering&rdquo; said the sinister steel.\r\n\r\n-&ldquo;What do you know about suffering? look at me!&rdquo; complained Cassiopeia yelling as she slithered towards her sister showing her cursed figure.\r\n\r\n-&ldquo;Very unfortunate indeed. But what else? you were searching for power weren&rsquo;t you? now embrace it and use it!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nCassiopeia stopped and looked down, she was right, she could feel the power her magic running through her now. The many dead she killed her way back Noxus proved it too.\r\n\r\n-&ldquo;B-but what can I do? my beauty&hellip;&rdquo; sorrowed the snake.\r\n\r\n-&ldquo;Talon came back from Freljord. Things are starting to move there, the tribes are assembling and some dark powerful magic is developing there, all this matter concerns Noxus. There is a carriage ready to take you there, this is your chance to prove you are worthy to be called a noxian. I&rsquo;ll take care of the Shurima business&hellip;&rdquo; and without another word Katarina left.\r\n\r\nCassiopeia had read in the concealed parts of the Library of Noxus about an ancient group in Freljord called The Watchers, powerful sorcerers that protect and watch over Freljord, or at least it was said&hellip; Cassiopeia knew more of course, nothing scapes from here.\r\n\r\nThe word &ldquo;power&rdquo; echoed in her mind, that&rsquo;s all she ever wanted anyways&hellip; Maybe she would get something worthy from The Watchers&hellip; and so she departed with new resolutions....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for the reading and comments!","replies":[{"poster":"RetroRage96","date":"2015-08-17T00:43:03.526+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow, someone posting a skin concept that is _actually_ the artist!\n\nWell done sir, I am working on one myself.
