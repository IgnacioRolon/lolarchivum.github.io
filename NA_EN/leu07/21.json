The only thing she's getting are hollow promises and straight nerfs, there's nothing beyond that. She doesn't even have a lore beyond 3 lines of text on her champion profile, nor does she get any skins or attention from their marketing team. \n\nShe's a complete and utter failure as a champion if you consider these aspects. What she needs is a fullblown VU ala Sion/Yorick at this point, I see no other way of raising her popularity. Her image needs to be completely re-invented.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-11-05T22:09:59.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy way to fix her, cure her curse and let her be the Du Couteau sister we never knew... from what lore says, Ahri is a no factor compared to Cassio's human form. Her kit can still be venom based, with opening a door to few new aspects :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-11-04T23:32:24.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt she is getting a skin anytime soon . . . the same with Zyra and Viktor. Riot still has Vi, Twisted Fate, and Biltzcrank to give skins to this year. The Snow Down skins will have one if not two of these champions in it. Riot doesn't like to make skins for unpopular champions. it's a known fact.","replies":[]}]}
