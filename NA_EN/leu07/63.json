Deep sea Kog&#039;maw does not have a recall and it&#039;s only particle effect is that you turn slightly brighter when you activate W. This is just an example of the many skins that share this characteristics. Is it in the future plans to improve this skins or make their price lower? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowball4u","date":"2015-09-15T03:32:23.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They already own our wallets, what are you trying to take","replies":[]}]}
