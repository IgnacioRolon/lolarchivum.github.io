It has often been said that no soldier has ever been as fortunate as General Du Couteau to have been graced with daughters. His youngest, Cassiopeia  - despite lacking her sister&#039;s killer instincts - was equally renowned in at court for her stately character and elegance. Cunning as she was beautiful, the temptress could never be found far from the arm of any foreign dignitary, her wiles prying secrets from the lips of even the most wary attach&eacute;. With the Noxian barbarian pacification campaign having ground to a standstill, Cassiopeia had set her sights on a diplomat from a tribe of the Freljord region. Thinking him an easy mark, the scheming seductress set about beguiling him. He refused to confide in her, however, until she swore an oath of secrecy upon his sword -** a strange weapon with a serpentine curve to the blade.**\n\nOnce her tryst was over, Cassiopeia provisioned her father with information regarding the barbarian resistance. As she divulged this intelligence, a wave of revulsion washed over her. She screamed in agony as her silky skin hardened to scales, her lustrous hair thickened to leather, and her manicured fingernails sharpened to claws. Dazed, she fell upon a group of horrified servants, rending them limb from limb in a heartbeat. When it was over the blood soaked figure was no longer the ravishing jewel of the Noxian court, but a horror trapped somewhere between woman and serpent. Unable to serve in her traditional capacity, Cassiopeia departed for the League, continuing her service to Noxus on the Fields of Justice.&quot;\n\nso riot...\nhttp://66.media.tumblr.com/3b8022b1fd43846eea492f3213b58d32/tumblr_inline_o8u278pkny1qehet7_500.gif\n\nyeah yeah yeah I know that cass old lore means nothing I just wanted to use the gif :c but yeah Elise and Cass are like overlapping...is the same achetype.","replies":[{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2016-09-09T04:37:04.661+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it's not.\n\nElise is a narcissistic serial killer. She is somewhat similar to the Wicked Queen from \"Snow White\": they're both obsessed with their beauty and keeping their social status, and they're willing to do anything in order to accomplish their goals, even deceiving and killing.\n\nCassiopeia might have acted the same, but she had very different motivations. Her only interest was to seek power for Noxus and she didn't mind trading her beauty with her new serpentine form because both are just tools to achieve her goals.\n\nWhile Elise deceives and kills to keep the status quo, Cassiopeia ambitiously fights to find a place in her country. Their age difference partially explains their different mentalities.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2016-09-09T14:14:26.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think LeuO7 meants that they overlap with the fact that use their beauty as a way to get what they want and that's power.They both killed people to get what they want.\nUnlike Cass,Elise also wanted to restore her beauty and stay youthful.\nThey both kill to keep their current social standing.\nCass was willing to sacrifice anyone(Sivir&co) restore Noxus's glory/power,while Elise is willing to the same to innocent&naive followers and husband/s.","replies":[{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2016-09-09T16:17:48.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">that use their beauty as a way to get what they want\n\nCassiopeia doesn't do that anymore in the new lore. Also, she can't hide her mutation like Elise does, so she's definitely grown out of that phase.\n\n>They both kill to keep their current social standing.\n\nNot true. Cassiopeia has no clear social standing. She was the daughter of a Noxian nobleman, but he disappeared and a military coup d'etat has overthrown the aristocracy. Lastly, even though she was rich, she's never been in a position of power.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2016-09-09T16:35:51.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cassiopeia is a terrifying creature - half woman, half snake - whose slightest glance brings death.

Before she was a powerful and devoted high priestess of Vilemaw, a person twisted by devotion and power who lured adherents with promise of life and power.  Now she's a weaker version of Cass's old lore.\n\nShe had beauty, seeing it as a tool to twist the weak allegedly, but it was taken from her.  Then, despite having the power she used this thing she saw as a tool to get, she withdraws from the world, too hurt by the loss of her beauty to do anything?  Not only that, but she spends the rest of her lore just getting pushed around by external forces while she clings to wanting to be beautiful, ignoring the power she already had and the power she later gets.  She stumbles across The Black Rose, which offers her a way to risk sacrificing everything for her beauty?  So she takes it, using their people, not her own.  They right for her.  Happenstance somehow makes a confluence of ridiculous factors ( a knife falling on her hard enough to pierce her heart?) give her what she's been searching for,  And when she gets it...she disappears into the shadows?  Okay, so not completely.  She ~~lures people with with promises of her beauty~~ oh no, not really, the Black Rose does that for her.  But she still uses her beauty!  (Only not really) as a means of...keeping her beauty and doing nothing else with her life other than serving the forces around her that use her.  I mean, she took the deal Vilemaw gave her, according to the lore, because she saw how she could benefit from it, but what benefit exactly?  It makes no sense.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty sad background for a champion, and actually kind of a boring trajectory.  I mean, ultimately, she was strongest at the beginning of her story, and weakest at its end, and mostly just got tossed around by things beyond her control in between.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2016-09-09T14:17:12.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post is simply brilliant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-09-08T22:54:23.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually believe that said blade is the one that is stuck in {{champion:14}}s head","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-09-08T23:02:26.787+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=zybs47Ng,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-08T22:54:23.266+0000)\n>\n> I actually believe that said blade is the one that is stuck in {{champion:14}}s head\n\nreally? it makes sense tho, elise brings the blade to the pale lady a.k.a Leblanc and voila Sion is reborn/created/revived.......\nplot twist the pale lady is actually Vlad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-09-08T22:58:11.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, I can dig this kind of theorizing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-09-09T17:11:18.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if the Pale Woman is LeBlanc.","replies":[]}]}
