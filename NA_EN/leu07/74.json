I think the theme is quite good and fits Cassiopeia.\n\nHer particles.. Q being a red rose that quickly turns black  and explodes in black petals. Her W would be a dark red smoky area that releases black petals. Her E could be turned red and leave some black petals as it travels, and her R would be a black light that turns enemies to stone with black roses plants  entangling the enemies. So what do you guys think about this concept?
