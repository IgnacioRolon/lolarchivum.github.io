So better just play anything else. I think that her current state feels like the second one.","replies":[{"poster":"jDVL20eCYs","date":"2015-08-21T23:58:26.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you just talked about annie...\ncassio perform better in high elo then low elo... just as azir that still super broken is xd","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-08-22T00:23:39.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I truly don't have much problem with Azir being strong, he is hard to use and he should feel rewarding to master. So should Cassiopeia, but she takes time to truly master, specially in higher elo's against people that can just cc lock her down and avoid her skillshots. But Cassiopeia does not feel really that rewarding when mastered, specially when you can pick an easy to use Ahri and be so much safer while also being a beast.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-08-21T21:16:56.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And why do we care?\nShe was in a better-than-good spot, just because she's now BALANCED doesn't mean she needs more buffs to undo that.\nBeing BALANCED is a good thing, y'know?","replies":[]}]}
