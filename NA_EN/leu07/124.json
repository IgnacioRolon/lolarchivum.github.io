So here is Taric serving you beauty and yes....Aphrodite of Pisces was a huge inspiration. Hope you enjoy and like the concept.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/C0SQfog\r\n\r\nAries - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/i2EB0gLl-zodiac-patheon\r\nTaurus - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/OhqTZrLE-taurus-taliyah\r\nGemini - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/JIbr36RV-gemini-leblanc\r\nCancer - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/aMs9uQog-zodiac-diana\r\nLeo - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/oUyPwGsd-leo-leona\r\nVirgo - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/6GEpwWhp-virgo-irelia","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2019-11-29T02:56:14.783+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean i'd fondle those gems","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meritas","date":"2019-11-28T17:16:21.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so 90s fantasy art.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2019-11-28T20:38:00.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah royo/vallejo and julie bell are huuuuge influences for me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anadanament","date":"2019-11-28T13:05:15.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am in love with these.
