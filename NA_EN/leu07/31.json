I was wondering how youre guys feeling about MF after that change on her W....and her state in the game in general...is she good? is she on the weak side? is she is strong? ty very much","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2016-05-22T18:21:40.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miss Fortune is just a trash-tier champion right now. There's not much of a reason to pick her over any other ADC simply because she heavily relies on her team throughout the entire game to setup kills for her, which is pretty counterproductive anyways because even when she is ahead she still needs her team more than any other Marksman in the game. If you don't have an extremely experienced Miss Fortune with a strong, premade team comp built around the Miss Fortune, she will usually just end up being irrelevant throughout the entire game and weigh her team down.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2016-05-23T06:52:02.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how to play mf right now: Can you press R without an assassin on the enemy team jumping your ass? \nYes- Great champion\nNo- Not even a champion","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2016-05-25T02:53:28.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not necessarily. Miss Fortune's ult is still extremely easy to interrupt and avoid altogether, plus it's damage early game is pretty poor considering all of the damage scales with her AD, which is the lowest in the game currently. Its why she's so garbage, she's just too easy to counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2016-05-25T04:32:08.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what i find the most frustrating about her kit is the love tap passive, it feels like you're being punished for focusing someone down with your basic attacks instead of feeling rewarded for switching targets as they tried to implement :(","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2016-05-26T02:44:09.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It gives a deceiving burst but that's it, it doesn't do anything because her base attack damage is already so pathetically low that AD Janna would literally do more damage with her autos.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Defended","date":"2016-05-22T16:22:06.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No Reason to pick MF.\n\nEzreal is a  better MF\n\nEzreals Q does more damage but is on a way lower CD and is easier to land and more range\n\nEzreals W and passive is Miss fortunes W\n\nEzreals has a teleport when hes in danger.
