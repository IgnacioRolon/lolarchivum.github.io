No, because he'd be completely useless outside of his ultimate, and his ultimate was used for mostly utility anyways.\n\n> Her Grevious Wounds didn't give her any special power, in contradiction to what people believe\n\n...\n\n> I mean, sure it was nice for that one moment the enemy ADC used Heal, but it was a 2 seconds Grevious Wounds and the entire concept of Grevious Wounds is flawed anyways.\n\nYou just contradicted herself.  ADCs do not run {{summoner:21}} anymore.  Fact.  The only time they do is when I **TELL** them to because I'm going {{champion:41}} support, and I don't take flash and don't' want to take ignite as my second summoner spell. \n\n Being an anti-healer carry was the only thing that Miss Fortune had over her opponents.  Now, like I've said literally hundreds of times before, she's a jack of all trades and a master of none.  Why bother taking her as a duelist when Vayne and Twitch do it better?  Why bother taking her as a caster when Lucian and Graves do it better?  Why bother taking her as a split-pushing carry when Sivir does it better?\n\nYou can continue to delude yourself into believing she'll be good.  Go ahead, pick her ADC post 5.14 or 5.15 or whatever fucking patch she's getting released, just don't whine to me that your teammates flamed you after Lucian and Sivir bullied you out of the lane, or that you fell off so hard that Vayne roflstomped you mid game, despite the fact that  Miss Fortune is supposed to be Vayne's hard counter.\n\nI would be perfectly OK with these changes if they gave her acceptable compensation buffs.  These buffs are not acceptable.  They do not address the main problems that Miss Fortune has.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-07-11T02:48:30.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"How is being a jack-of-all-trades, but not being the best at anything bad, or even balanced?\n\nShe can duel really well and outduels most ADCs, she can teamfights pretty well and has it much easier than most ADCs, she scales incredibly well into Early and Mid game but has a hard fall off Late game.\n\nI think you contradicted yourself actually.

He's got initiation, poke, zone control, and disengage.  Pretty much everything.\n\nBack when he was powerful, the tears of bot laners could fill the river.  Now, he's outclassed by pretty much everyone else.  Hard initiation?  {{champion:89}} does it better.  Poke?  {{champion:117}}  does it better.  Zone control?  {{champion:53}}   does it better.  Disengage?  Well, some may debate me on this, but I believe that {{champion:40}} does it better.\n\nGrievous wounds gave MF something over all of her specialized counterparts.  Now in each category of what she does, someone does it better, and does it WAY better.  With how alike ADCs builds are, you need something to stand out.  Once grievous wounds is out of her kit, she's not going to have anything.  She doesn't bully as hard as Sivir, she doesn't poke as well as Varus or Caitlyn, and she doesn't carry as hard as Kog'Maw or Vayne.  She's just kinda there.\n\n> I think you contradicted yourself actually. There's nothing wrong with her being able to do everything effectively, not the BEST, but not terrible either.\n\nSee what I said above.\n\n> Sorry, but as someone's who has mained this champion for a really long time, I think I know what I'm talking about.

Nerf Rito plz.\n\nI'd see your ranked ratio with her, but you're not regestered on OPGG.\n\n[Now I haven't been doing too hot with her lately because of the Devourer bullshit, but I can at least prove that those recent matches are just a bad couple of ones.  This is coming from a REAL Miss Fortune main, who REALLY played her in ranked, and REALLY gets pentakills through means other than the Malphite + Orianna + Bullet Time Wombo Combo.](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Remlap1223)\n\n> I'm not the best player in the world by any means, but currently for probably the past 20+ games, I've been going around 18-1, 23-3, 25-5 with her and I don't see a single problem with her strengths and weaknesses, she's a great champion.\n\nEither you're extremely ballsy, or completely fucking retarded, because I know from my personal experience that people check match history and shit.  Usually it's to bring up how Bronze One I am, but they quickly shut up when I pentakill the enemy team with titty princess.  Regardless, I have the proof, and you don't.  Hell, you might actually be better than me, and the changes might not affect you.  In which case, by all means, be the hipster and say how good you are with a dumpstered champion.  Hell, I do it with Gangplank, so more power to you if you do.\n\nHowever, this isn't what we're arguing about.  You're arguing about whether or not MF is going to be playable after this patch.  As a MF main, I know how low of a skill floor MF has.  Hence why she has a 50% ish win rate right now, despite being sub-par at best.  Her skill ceiling, while higher than most \"easy\" champions, is definitely eclipsed by Vayne or Twitch, which means there's not much higher to go after you learn her basics.  Keep in mind that Sona is considered trash tier for all the same reasons and her winrate is still higher than 50%.  When she's released, if her strut isn't fixed, if her Q bounce is still extremely finnicky, and her magic damage doesn't crit to compensate, she's going below 50% winrate for certain, and probably even lower than 45%.\n\nCall me Bruno Mars.
