As the game went on, he would just E, AA me, and proceed to run away with his MS passive... if I decided to chase him, he would just ult and proceed to explode me. He tower dived me once, I ulted him in his face, he would just have thrown his Q and an ignite and when I ulted, he just ulted while in CC! NO Assassin is that safe, Zed can&#039;t go back to his shadow while he is ccd... I don&#039;t know why Ekko&#039;s R does not cost any mana, that&#039;s stupid for such a strong ability. In the video, when he time traveled the few seconds back, he turned his arm device, how can he do that when he is turned into stone? LOGIC. He would then proceed to burst everyone over and over again, just by that cheap E+AA+Q combo, then run away.\r\n\r\nI really hope those pbe nerfs to him are just a little taste for more upcoming nerfs. He needs his Q&#039;s width, ratio and slow reduced, and also its mana cost increased. He shouldn&#039;t have that W passive, how does that thematically fits him? to deal more damage to low health enemies? that&#039;s a Zed thing, not a time shifter thing. He also needs a mana cost on his ult and that he can not cast his ult while in cc. Maybe, just increase all his mana costs, really, he never went oom the entire game.","replies":[{"poster":"GuileRaven","date":"2015-06-03T06:52:05.385+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"\"ult while cced\"\n\nCough Cough bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-06-03T17:01:39.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"*OR* a bug.

Also, he had flask and pots, so eventually Cassio WILL run oom if she keeps trading, leaving her extremely easy to kick out of lane. Yes, I can try to freaking kite him when he E+AA+Q me, but guess what? he has MOUNSTROUS MS and I get slow a lot by his Q, if Cassio keeps a chase, she will just get kited with his Q or probably he will just R and rip you apart.

Ekko's ratios are actually quite low, his Q (in comparison to many other skillshot Q midlaners *ahri/zed/xerath* etc) pales in comparison sitting at an initial .2 ratio, and a .6 on the return. It does decent damage if you hit both with a total of .8, but it's honestly VERY easy to avoid the second part if you have a brain and weren't previously CC'd. His W numbers are a bit on the high side, but for a massive 3 second delay which is almost completely avoidable in lane unless he casts from the fog, the numbers should be high.\n\nOnly thing I have a problem with is how super effective his ult is at everything, however, I feel that only a single aspect of it needs to be touched. It either needs to have less damage, less healing, both, or a higher cooldown. I personally feel like it's CD should be higher. As it stands it's up almost everytime Ekko comes to lane leaving only moderate windows of opportunity to actually kill him.","replies":[{"poster":"kanacho","date":"2015-06-03T07:10:10.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"His ultimate scaling is extremely high, and though his ratios don't seem strong on the surface, it's a lot of the hidden power like Lee Sin had. Remember that little text difference that made him a whole lot more broken? His AOE Slow use to be an AOE Slow and AS slow for the same percentage, meaning that it would completely shut down AS bruisers like Xin, or ADC's that he got remotely close too, until that CC wore off, leaving a huge window for you to vastly outdamage the enemy team.\n\nEkko's W not only is a massive AOE stun, but also gives him a massive self-shield (scales well like riven's dash shield), ontop of a passive that does % damage when an enemy is at 30% Hp or less. It's basically Zed's Passive (a tiny bit weaker in terms of % required on activation), combined with riven's super carry scaling shield, and veigar's event horizon with a longer delay, but a vastly more effective stun which is very easy to land in team fights when it's hard to dodge everything.\n\nThat's just 1 ability, and his passive that gives a MS buff to himself, a slow to the enemy, and huge burst is another example of hidden power, not to mention his Q makes it so easy to slow MASSIVE numbers of targets, and is easy to catch the return in team fights. It shows that Ekko becomes absurdly strong in team fights and ganks, where enemies are more distracted with your teammates, while you can land all this free CC and the unexpected damage. He's also got great mobility, one of the best escape/reengage tools, and so many things that make him so much like a pre-nerf Lee Sin that it should have been obvious to avoid this happening AGAIN.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vik4prez","date":"2015-06-03T12:40:35.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as im aware, Ekkos opponent doesn't get 3 seconds of delay on his W.

There are no other options. As soon as you hear the \"Step right up!\" if you're even slightly competent, you'll back off a good distance for about two seconds until the bubble dissipates. \n\nCongratulations, you've just made Ekko's W active useless. The only time you should ever be getting hit by it is if he casts from the fog, or during a sloppy teamfight where you can't help to be aware of it's position. Also, I believe you're exaggerating some points about trading with Ekko in lane. Yes, he has the ability to come at you instantly with E and hit his Q, HOWEVER, like any other caster for that matter, he's very vulnerable after he just dumped his kit. An Ekko cannot ever 100-0 you directly with an E>Q>Auto>Q unless he's absurdly fed and in that case he deserves to do that being an assassin.\n\nI'm not sure what midlaners you're talking about that *struggle* to return damage back, but Ekko has a fairly weak laning phase. I highly highly doubt anyone will let him E>Q for free and not do ANYTHING back unless you're very low elo and don't understand trading. Granted his ult is a get out of jail free card, and it should be considering he's a time-shifter, but lets not forget plenty of other midlaners have very similar abilities that can save them from impending doom.\n\n- Ahri has 3 flashes on her ult that all do decent damage and can cross walls.\n- Leblanc's Distortion can not only cross most walls, but you have 4 seconds to return, meaning you can traverse FAR more distance than that of Ekko's delayed after image, and return to safety coupled with a low cooldown FOR FREE (on the return obviously).\n- Zed's R, I don't have to say anything about this, albeit receiving a 1 second delay, if I remember you have SIX whole seconds to go back to your shadow.\n\nOf course these examples aren't an exact comparison of Ekko's ult, which I will agree is kind of overloaded/overtuned right now for what it does, they still offer great safety at lower cooldowns, while offering good damage as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Onegarion","date":"2015-06-03T07:21:05.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if you overlooked it, but why not make it so it has a Mana Cost as well?

And to the other people saying he does run oom, he did pick up a flask=never oom.
