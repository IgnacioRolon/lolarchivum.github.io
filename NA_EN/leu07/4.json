I think she has a pretty decent laning phase. I do not really know what her role is supposed to be but I believe she is pretty bad at killing and chasing, like, it is very easy to just walk away from her and her tentacles, I found it very frustrating that someone would All-in me and then he would just walk away easily when the situation was no favorable, and there was nothing I could do, landing her E on laning phase is ok, it feels good, but in TF or fighting solo in the jungle it feels pretty meh, there is not really a big punishment for walking out of it or a reward for killing the spirit, the effect seems too pitiful to me, tentacles spawn way too slow and they are easily detected and evaded. I would like some feedback on how and when to use her from experienced Illaoi players or maybe from a rioter. Just my inicial thoughts on her! \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-04-27T20:16:33.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's pretty much the new Darius (pre-rework), she gets curb stomped by people who know how to play around her, but she curb stomps anyone that doesn't know how to play around her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IIIR e v e n g e","date":"2016-04-27T20:03:04.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she is bad, so is Aurion Sol, Amongest two newest champ barely anyone plays, RIP Original League Champ Design team","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-04-27T20:10:08.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IIIR e v e n g e,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=319BQl28,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-27T20:03:04.729+0000)\n>\n> she is bad, so is Aurion Sol, Amongest two newest champ barely anyone plays, RIP Original League Champ Design team\n\nwell. illaoi just needs some general changes to her spirit mechanic maybe. or giving her some resistances for tentacles nearby etc.\n\ni dont think its going to be terrible difficult to get her into a good spot. her kit overall has potential.\n\naurelion however, oh boy. the design team could have seen his problems coming from lightyears away. the gameplay around his stars is so incredibly clunky.","replies":[]}]}]}
