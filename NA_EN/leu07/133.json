She just seems to be outclassed in every way, the only pro I truly see in her is her duel potential, and even there, the counterplay is easy, if you can't duel her, then don't. Let's check some aspects of her gameplay.\r\n\r\nHer passive seems like a joke to me, the only purpose I find on it is to get faster to lane. \"It is actually quite good for chasing\" I don't really see it... any damage will take the *Strut* off, even minions, what about when you are in a TF, get untouched in it and you want to chase on enemy scapees? if you were in a lane, the minion aggro due to your AAs would have worn it off. It seems to me that Sivir just outclasses her totally with her passive, so why pick mf?\r\n\r\nHer Q is actually a very good trading tool since, if I'm not mistaken, it resets AAs. But then again, if she will mostly outtrade you, don't trade and farm. Her Q also has an akward ap scaling, I get the people that wants to go all hipster and unique playing ap Miss fortune, nevertheless, she's even less viable if you build her ap, it doesn't even fit her indentity as a gunner, Trinity force can compesate fot this ap scaling but I find it too expensive and not that effective on MF. You can poke in lane with Q, yeah, she is a lane bully, but I believe this becomes a double edged blade, if you want to take advantage on that aspect, you will get ganked a lot, and Mf has no scapes, zero mobility (truly, her passive does not count). So why pick her for the poke when you have Ezreal with his Qs and Ws? or why pick her for the bullying when you got Caitlyn? both of those champs are very viable in team ranked comps and solo Q, unlike of course, lady MF.\r\n\r\nHer W passive is ok, the only thing that bothers me is that it is Magic damage, again, it does not fit her as a gunner, it makes the armor penetration on her less effective. Good steroid, applies Griveous Wounds, all that is very nice, nothing more to say about it.\r\n\r\nHer E is like... ugh Magic damage and ap scaling all over again... I'm not gonna explain myself again why I believe that is very very illogical on MF. It's a good brush check, it may* save your butt, not so good as a chasing tool anyways. This ability is just kind of pityful and has a big mana cost, pls don't spam it more than once in lane or you'll get oom faster than Anivia without tear. Koggy's E is actually even better than Mf's E, Cassiopeia's harmless W has more utility (I say harmless because IMO Cassio's W does less damage than a supp morgana's W, but that's another thread). Anyways, she just seems to be outdated in her ability kit. \r\n\r\nFinally, her  ultimate. The only good thing about it is that it looks cool, period. Why would you pick her because of her AOE damage ult if she just stands there doing again, magic damage with again, an awkward ap scaling. Yes, it applies GW passive stacks, the damage is not great anyways; I would much rather pick Graves and have that instant insane nuke and then keep doing damage with AA, or Jinx's ulti which is a very nice AOE global nuke with health% damage (wtf). Again, Ezreal's ultimate which has lower cd and many more uses (camp steal, wave clearing...). Even Vel'koz built as a supp has a much cooler looking and more effective ultimate. Mf doing her ult in a TF is like \"Hey league of mobility/gap closer, I'm here, yes, the ad carry, showing off my ult while I'm standing channeling, pls kill me, I don't have a scape or self peel like every other meta adc\".\r\n\r\nBriefly, we've seen how her abilities are outclassed by mostly everyone. I would like to add that honestly, she needs a VU O.o. Please save Miss Fortune, one of the symbols of League of mobili... ehem Legends... \r\n\r\nPst. If you differ in opinion, please don't spray your venom, be people.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-03-02T19:07:01.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.op.gg/summoner/champions/userName=wuks\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=diamondeagles\n\n\"Useless\"","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-03-02T19:14:28.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wuks,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jvzMcNmc,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-03-02T19:07:01.634+0000)\n>\n> http://na.op.gg/summoner/champions/userName=wuks\n> http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=diamondeagles\n> \n> \"Useless\"\n\nYour win rate with MF does not prove she is in a good state.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"darkmage1000","date":"2015-03-02T17:59:15.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree. i played ap mf for a while and got a penta and retired from ap mf. she is useless as an ad carry as lucian is the better mf. he has the gap closer, a better version of her q, and a mobility buff w and his ult is the same as hers just alot better he can move and do alot of dmg to minions oh and it scales off ad, and attack speed. i liked to mf when i first started playing league and since i have got all the adcs she is the worst right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-03-03T01:54:15.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=darkmage1000,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jvzMcNmc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-02T17:59:15.323+0000)\n>\n> his ult is the same as hers just alot better \n\nEach wave of MF ult hits everyone in the area.

Jinx and Twitch will put out the same numbers without being locked in place for 2 seconds and their damage wont be 40% magic, which they have no pen for. Sivir wont do as much damage, but her ult will make landing the wombo's a great deal easier. \n\nAnd going off what I posted above. Her mixed damage is a bad thing. It doesn't actually scale well unless you already have a few hits in to make up the lack of penetration. \n\nBascially, MF's ult says Wombo. Rest of her kit says duel/picks. She can be strong. She is a lane bully. But using her ult puts her at a disadvantage as well as it's easy to walk out of and she wont even get the full damage. \n\nHonestly there isn't much she can do that Jinx can't do better. She has slightly stronger harass on her Q and mixed damage. She is also the better duelist. It's not so much I think Jinx's kit is loaded. But those powers are just not strong enough to justify her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"One ayyed king","date":"2015-03-02T21:40:24.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MF isnt meant to be played or do damage like typical carries. Her role is to support AOE team comps from a safe distance with her ult before moving in to deal damage with her autos after the major damage threats have been taken care of. In a meta with powerful assassins, tanks and split pushing your not going to see her very often but when it comes to standard 5v5 teamfights she is one of the better carries. \n\nin fact there was a time not that long ago at the early stages of season 3 where MF was picked quite frequently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DropFill","date":"2015-03-02T21:29:55.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sincerely?

She wants to fight from 550 range and has no dash.  She's quite effective at fighting in lane at this range, but in a teamfight her lack of safety results in her tending to be just a walking ultimate.\n\nI think she compares extremely unfavorably with Jinx.
