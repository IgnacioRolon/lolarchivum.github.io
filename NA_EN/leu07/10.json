As an regular Miss Fortune player, I'm very pleased with her animations (except maybe the bases&#039;s face, it looks sort of korean lady), and new particles (specially the ult animation and how she shoots with impure shots active), however, I&#039;d like to ask the balance and rework team why did you take this direction with her rework?\n\n- Does Strut remain active for the duration of the impure shots activation like teemo&#039;s W?\n- Why can&#039;t strut gain a Garen like passive that minions can&#039;t deactivate after it reaches lvl 11? \n- Strut&#039;s scaling per lvl is in the total speed gained? or the time needed to reactivate the speed gain? (This isn&#039;t noted in Moobeat&#039;s patch notes)\n- Why is Make it Rain still magic damage when Varus&#039;s Hail of Arrows (very similar skill, since it has a slow and a small cast delay) is physical damage and still applies grievous wounds, and scales with AD? Not to mention it pops his W charges if the target hit has any.\n\n\nI understand the need to remove grievous wounds from her kit as you&#039;ve done with other champions, such as Tristana and Fizz. I read that the removal of this effect is because Riot wants to get rid of the mechanic entirely. However, by doing so and not adding an equal power boost somewhere else, you&#039;re practically nerfing her once more after the Black Cleaver&#039;s shenanigans nerf (and Black Cleaver got reworked and is no longer a priority item on her, it&#039;s an item tailored for bruisers now). She is now even more comp dependant and her trade potential in lane was reduced because of the removal of grievous wounds. In trades, double up doesn&#039;t really add much to her damage output except for the AA reset, since the aditional damage is based on the second (and pretty unpredictable) shot. \n\nI&#039;ve read a few of the ideas floating around the forum to \"fix\" her kit, such as removing Make it rain&#039;s magic damage component in favor of applying impure shots stacks (and it&#039;s damage). This I believe is a good idea, since it enables her to use the skill earlier in the game  as a 1 point wonder (most MF players won&#039;t even add points into it until asolutely necessary) and it forces the MF player to evaluate  if you&#039;re either using Make it Rain to possibly enhance your damage/trade potential/aoe shenanigans with ult or save it as a kiting tool. The mana cost of the skill is extremely high for the utility it brings, so this alternative seems more attractive, at least.\n\nHer Q is another thing that bothers me a bit. It&#039;s really unpredictable and targetted. I don&#039;t know if the animations have been smoothed so she doesn&#039;t stop mid cast. The damage adition was nice but I thought this skill was going to be reworked entirely. Sivir&#039;s ricochet mechanic comes to mind. It&#039;s a fairly safer tool to use, has infinite targets (with a 40% damage reduction) and aditionally, it sinergizes with her ult so she can get those autoattacks out faster when she casts it. it&#039;s also possible to use it in teamfights because she doesn&#039;t need to target and measure IF the bounce will hit mid fight, she just needs to attack the closest enemy to get the skill to work in her favor. Oh, and** it&#039;s also an AA reset on cast. **\n\nMy thoughts on Miss Fortune&#039;s Q was more of an activated AA reset like Sivir&#039;s that gives her the possibility to hit a target behind the first with reduced/higher damage for the next three attacks or so. IMO it fits with her thematic, a bounty hunter takes risky chances and seeks advantage of their surroundings to come out ahead. With a Q similar to this, she could also use it in teamfights and set up impure stacks shots so she can ult and deal more damage.\n\nI&#039;m really sorry about the wall of text but I love her as a champion so it saddens me that she&#039;s still fairly beneath other adcs in terms of...well, everything","replies":[]}
