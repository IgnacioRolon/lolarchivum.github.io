We already know that Cass was \"transformed by the venom of an ancient Shuriman tomb guardian\", both from her short bio and from the 'Descent into the Tomb' video that preceded Azir's release.\n\nTurning Cass into a Darkin would require retooling her character on a very core level that, frankly, I doubt Riot would go for.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2017-11-30T19:58:57.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"well, isnt poison a weapon?","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2017-11-30T20:02:26.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nNot dignifying that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iLBGAMing","date":"2017-11-30T18:57:46.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He wasn't looking for Cassiopiea, and she wasn't the only statue in that temple... {{champion:58}} was there too.\n\nHe was looking for a Darkin that is appearantly been transfered to another secure location that appears to not be the temple he was looking for her in.","replies":[]}]}
