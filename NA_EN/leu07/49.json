MF is a big deal in the Bilgewater universe and she got overshadowed with the GP rework/VU (who already has a VU on him), the **temporary** map, and the **temporary** mode. I really appreciate all this mode, and all the stuff that is going on in League,\r\n\r\nWhen ironstylus did a little tease of MF VU (it was a really long time ago)...I was really hyped about it....and well time passed, and my hype grew bigger....I&#039;ve even drawn how I imagined her VU, and now its out there, and its the model of arcade MF (which is almost a year old) with some new animations...there is no recall animation, no voice over, no new idle animation or taunt, etc....I feel like...they didnt flesh out the archetype of the sexy girl with guns which belong to MF and they truly missed the opportunity of given her some dimension....and small details are just not there....for example the sleeves start on the arm....not in the forearm like in her splash art, or when she gets the strut she should have a different run animation since she is going super &quot;fast&quot;, etc. I was really hoping that they went all the way in with her and not in between like they did it.\r\n\r\nI know is a huge upgrade for how MF used to look, and thanks you for that riot. But I would really like if  you guys put the resources on stuff that are going to be permanent and not on stuff that is **temporary.**\r\n\r\nsorry for the typos!","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-07-09T06:37:53.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt that the Model update is just temporary.\n\nNew VO and new animations can be added later on,they don't need a new model for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-07-09T01:58:19.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freljord was definitly the best event i hope they do another one this year","replies":[]}]}
