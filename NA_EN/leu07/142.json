Ahri is so easy and stupid to use... I main Cassiopeia, she requires some actual endeavor to win with her. I rarely pick Ahri, I used her recently and I was soo impresed of how broken she is, she is too strong and safe and easy to use, for someone like me who doesn&#039;t really use that type champion with that playstyle, it was really easy to steamroll the game. She&#039;s like almost reaching that 54% win rate with a relevant pick rate aswell. If Cassiopeia gets more that 10% with a 53% win rate there would be no doubt that she would be nerfed to the ground simply because she is not the typical anime girl that every wannabe otaku girl makes a cosplay of (ejem, a lot of Ahri&#039;s cosplay...). \n\nSo yeah, I&#039;m tired of the cool kids in league (Ahri, jinx, vayne...) that always and obviously get more love simply because they never nerf them even when they need it. Specially I hate Ahri now because of all the love she gets, she is not a deep and interesting character, just a slutty fox, seems like  not only in real life slutty people get the attention but in here too lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Hex the FenFen","date":"2015-08-05T06:04:01.069+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"SOMEONE ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT ZYRA NEEDS A NEW SKIN THAT WASN'T ME!!!!!
