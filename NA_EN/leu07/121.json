She is strong and viable now, I won&#039;t deny that (maybe a little bit of an overkill with the mana sustain nerf, though). But she is not what the playerbase wants. Several complaints have been made for over a year since her rework on the pbe, and yet, not much has been done. You can&#039;t even fix the freaking invisible miasma bug that has been reported like a thousand times! I really think she&#039;ll need another rework to make her fit in identity (poison mage). Actually, I was hoping when riot announced the rework a year ago that she would have some sort of constriction ability, why is she even called &quot;The serpent&#039;s embrace&quot;? she even had this phrase &quot;Feel my embrace&quot; when she never coils around anyone. I think that&#039;s a nice idea for changing her E into something more snake-like. I mean, she is so damn outcasted she even can&#039;t get the Chroma Pack, It was so hilarious yet frustrating when on surrender they announced a supposedly Cassiopeia Chroma pack as well as other champs getting it, but she didn&#039;t get the assets, this has not happened to any other champ, why cass? She&#039;s not worth it to even finish the job to push her chroma to the pbe like the rest of the champs? I&#039;m sick of the Cassiopeia hate.","replies":[{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2015-07-28T03:13:56.595+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cass isn't strong and viable. Cass is shit tier right now.

It's just as Yenn said, the nerfs did far too much damage to her. Her average winrate is at 45% while her pickrate went back to what it was before the rework even happened. She's worse in every single regard now, the rework was a huge downgrade for her.\n\nWhat Cass needs is another rework, period.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-07-29T05:38:54.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what was said in a recent thread can basically be summed up like this : \"Cass players can fuck-off!\"-Riot 2015\n:(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-07-29T05:10:36.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it's sad that {{champion:17}} {{champion:27}} are more of a poison mage than she is. \n\nFor christ sake i'm pretty sure {{champion:122}}'s passive is a stronger DOT than her poison for 90% of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nagma","date":"2015-07-29T04:57:50.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES GUYS WE WONT GIVE UP .
