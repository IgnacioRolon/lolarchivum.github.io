Cassiopeia cannot purchase Boots items.&quot;\n\nHow would this passive work with % Movement speed increases such as MS quints or Luden&#039;s Echo? And if this passive is to enhance her serpentine thematic of being slippery and you know....a Snake, isn&#039;t it possible to add a slow resist (Like swifties) when she reaches a certain amount of movement speed or reaches an amount of AP? Since she can&#039;t access slow resist in any other way than from Swifties. Having Swifties with Cassio was super useful because of the kite+Chase potential\n\n**Miasma **(W)\nMana cost increased to 70 at all ranks from 40/50/60/70/80\nCooldown increased to 22/20/18/16/14 from 14/13/12/11/10\n&quot;Cassiopeia spews venom in an arc in front of her, leaving toxic clouds for 4 seconds at max range or at terrain hit.  \nEnemies in the clouds are continually afflicted with Debilitating Poison, slowing them by 35% and grounding them, prohibiting the use of Movement abilities. They also take 20/35/50/65/80 (+0.15) magic damage per second.&quot;\n   - Slow now 35% at all ranks from 25/30/35/40/45%.\n   - Now fires multiple clouds in a large arc that **lands at max range (800)** or first terrain hit.\n   - Now GROUNDS enemies in cloud, preventing them from using movement abilities** while** in it.\n\nMy main concern (and of a BUNCH of people that have played her) is Miasma. I get the thematic of being cornered by a Snake, you can either face her and get ulted, or pass through it and get crippled. The terrain collision doesn&#039;t bother me at all, I think it&#039;s understandable since she spits poison in a direction.  I also understand not wanting to enable the Cass player to use it at pointblank range because she needs a weakness against divers or people that can gap close/blink to her effectively or work around the range of the skill, HOWEVER, a fixed range of 800 removes decision making and playmaking potential in my opinion, so why not add a minimum cast range of say...300 and allow us Cass players the possibility to decide where it lands between said range? Think of a ring AoE, The arc could be more &quot;circular&quot; at 300 range and spreads out until it reaches 800. \n\nThe skill, despite being a &quot;nova&quot; type skill, doesn&#039;t even have Champion collision, and It doesn&#039;t interrupt dashes already happening like Poppy&#039;s W does, The zone control is exclusive to the 800 range, while old miasma didn&#039;t have this handicap.  In the video, Vi doesn&#039;t even let go of her Q (it gets cancelled of course), but I believe that if she let go before stepping on W, she would have gone past the AoE just fine, since it doesn&#039;t interrupt, and the slow wouldn&#039;t have lingered on her so she&#039;d be &quot;safe&quot; from Cassio&#039;s fangs.\n\nAnother issue the skill has, the poison doesn&#039;t &quot;linger&quot; after leaving the area, this is completely anti thematic, Poison IS a &quot;lingering effect&quot;, even after finishing contact. I think that either the &quot;grounded&quot; effect or the damage should linger a bit after leaving the area for at least 1 second, OR, targets poisoned by Noxious Poison from Q AND Debilitating poison from W should get an additional &quot;poison&quot; effect, possibilities are endless here. Mini root, mini stun, movement speed steal, extra slow, MR reduction, etc.\n\nThis is just my grain of salt for a champion I love and would like to see succeed and carried to it&#039;s full potential, thank you!","replies":[]}
