I think that taking into account that it must be a very powerful magic to turn enemies into stone like Medusa did (and for eternity were her foes turned to stone), Cassiopeia&#039;s stun should be strong, so I give this idea to make it inmune to tenacitiy and to cleanse/qss. Make it the ultimate stun, if you land it you are rewarded that your enemy/ies is stuned for the whole 2 seconds. I dont think it would be broken since it still has the counterplay of turning around and it would still be hard to land. Just an idea that came to my mind c: Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Kaozi","date":"2016-02-15T17:41:17.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There would be too much burden of knowledge IMO. The point of QSS is it removes ALL CC. No exceptions, bar death. If I were to change it I would either reduce its cast time or increase its range. Her short range really hurts her late game more than anything else.\n\nAt the worst you could make it a suppression, but it doesn't meet the requirements for that. (user is CC'd as well) That would make it immune to cleanse and mikails.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheUltimateSpear","date":"2016-02-15T17:35:36.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good to me!","replies":[]}]}
