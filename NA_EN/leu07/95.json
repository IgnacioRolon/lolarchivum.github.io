I will totally try it on Cass, it gives health, MPen, and you dont have to worry about oponents stacking health, overall, a nice dps choice for battling mages. What do you guys think? is this combination going to be more viable now? I did not do it before because yisus, it was too much gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-12-06T23:50:34.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**League Community:** \"We hate getting permaslowed by Rylai's due to champions like Brand and Cass being able to apply it constantly with their DoTs and spammable abilities.\"\n\n**Riot:** \"... we also want the slow to be less attractive to mages who canâ€™t reapply it consistently.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheAceofStaves","date":"2016-12-13T15:00:43.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now the item sucks.

All the hype about getting it early is just that, pointless hype, you get it earlier with a passive that basically no longer exists against champs you actually need it for, aka brain dead tankmasters with 600 movespeed that cant be slowed.\n\nSo what you're left with in the end is a 25% less stats Rylai with a passive that basically doesnt exist vs summoners with the above mentioned combination of items/masteries, all that for a 600g cost reduction....worth it?
