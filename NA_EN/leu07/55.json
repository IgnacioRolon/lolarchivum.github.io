I don't even play Varus but it's nice to see more options. I'll admit that I struggle really hard vs him when I go AP Kog (my favorite mid laner) but I don't feel it's unfair or anything. I'd say the same for AP Ez. since he lacks CC, has poor waveclear, doesn't roam well, needs Smite and has a long exploitable scaling window. He actually even falls off a bit late-game since tanks will build MR and block/reduce the damage of everything except his shorter-ranged W).

I believe the change made to the cooldown being iniciated inmediately when he casts Q is what is making him a bit too much, he can charge that Q, throw it from the fog of war, rip a squishy by half and 2/3 seconds later he can repeat that (note that his Q can also go through multiple targets unlike {{champion:76}} and {{champion:126}}). I don't consider him OP actually, like many have said, he is slow af and can get jumped on/chain ccd easily, I suppose because of the tank meta, he just gets a huge beefy frontline that can peel for him so he can stay back and snipe everyone down.

Many traditional supports (not utility mages, although some can be played as decent supports) are balanced to be effective without much gold. After all, a one second stun is a one second stun no matter what level or gold income you have. Problem is when people figure out that if you give a utility support the income of a laner, they have an edge over certain champions designed to solo lane.\n\nI'm not quite sure about Lulu's history, but I can see why she would be toned down a bit. It was kind of like pre-rework Soraka, where the lane wouldn't be very interactive (poke Soraka? She heals herself. She spams Q all day. She silences you if you try to kill her. She gives herself mana to spam Q more. Neither of you are going to die. Neither of you are going to do much of anything). Lulu is a bit more interactive than that, not having to be reworked at all, but Riot might have had similar reasons.\n\nIn other words, champions with high utility (supports) sometimes get toned down so they don't out-class other champions. \n\nVarus, on the other hand, doesn't have nearly the same amount of cc as Lulu. He has poke, some damage steroids, a slow, and a root. That's much healthier for a solo laner than instant-cast hard cc, as hard as it is to say.

I dunno where you got that from. \n\nI actually agree about that though, I hate getting hit by one Q and losing about half my health.\n\nHis Q is acting a lot like pre-rework Nidalee's Q.\n\nOr you know, current Nidalee Q late game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-07-04T00:43:12.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...
