Hecarim is the only centaur in the game. Therefore, he is the only one who can represent my Zodiac sign.\nI laughed at that \"Varus Saggitarian\" it was hilarious\n\nSaggitarian's bad signs represent the savagery, self centered behavior and leadership among others\nHecarim EXACTLY matches these traits. He is a completetly EVIL Saggitarian in the form of a Centaur. He is 10/10 fit.\n\nAlso, Skarner will have a VGU one day next year probably either late 2020 or 2021 roughly. Wait for him to get his VGU first, then I would like to see your Scorpio concept because I am very connected with Scorpions somehow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OoTriloDiveroO","date":"2019-09-27T10:45:28.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leu07,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=i2EB0gLl,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-08-28T22:45:27.202+0000)\n>\n> yeah hahaha that cancer joke never gets old, I'm a cancer too &lt;3 \n> I'm gonna share my list, I'm choosing champions that kinda goes with 2-3 signs traits that I'm picking up  \n> \n> my list:\n> Aries - Pantheon - Strength/Power/War\n> Taurus - Taliyah/Allistar/Sivir - Willpower/Money\n> Gemini - Leblanc - Deceive/Knowlegde\n> Cancer - Yuumi/Diana - Protection/Nourishing/Moon\n> Leo - Leona - Sun/Splendor/Leader\n> Virgo - Irelia - Maiden/Clean\n> Libra - Shen/Kayle - Balance/Justice\n> Scorpio - Miss Fortune - Power/Secrets/Revenge/Sex\n> Sagittarius - Hecarim (I'm still effy about that one because hecarim doesnt have the traits of a sagittarius) - FreeSpirit/Joyous\n> Capricorn - Ornn - Grumpy/Hardworker\n> Aquarius - Zoe/Illaoi - Believer/Young forever.\n> Pisces - Xayah &amp; Rakan/Nami/Soraka - Humanitarian/Spirituality\n\nHey there!\nI main Nautilus at the 7 season,and he is my favorite and kinda sad what he did not get a skin....Anyway,i want to quest you about his zodiac,because i don't really understand what kind of zodiac he have (shame me for an Nautilus main...)\n\nAnd when you'll tell me his zodiac,can you make a skin about him,please?i would be happy if you'll do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StormBladeMaster","date":"2019-08-30T14:14:15.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your choices and i understand why you made these choices.
