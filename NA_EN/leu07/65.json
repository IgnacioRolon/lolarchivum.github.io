It has short range and can get counterplayed by turning around, even kalista can just keep looking forward while hopping backwards and she won&#039;t get stunned (logic...)\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I know they both have their cons and pros, but I think Cassiopeia really falls out of flavor when compared to  other ap scaling mages like Azir or Viktor. Just my thoughts.","replies":[]}
