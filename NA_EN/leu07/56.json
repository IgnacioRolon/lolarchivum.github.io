Are there other things that may be her problems from your perspective? IMO, the passive is for the major part of a game, a big weakness, until level 15 it is just a big weakness she has, it does not feel impactful, the only good thing is when you actually use the extra item slot, which might aswell be until 40min+ in the game, unless you got ridiculously fed, which we all know it happens seldom with this new cass. I think her passive must be buffed somehow, it is not impactful at all and it is a big disandvantage.","replies":[]}
