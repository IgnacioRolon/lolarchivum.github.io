The thing is the current one is a damage amp on the second hit that also procs her passive and can crit on its damage and her passive. So actually no her new one is much stronger. You seem to forget that her current Q applies her new passive which can also crit. So you take her new Q and add in her passive and the damage is pretty fucking stupid on minion kill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2017-02-23T06:38:04.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RexSaur,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lwKV2xHz,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-02-23T05:53:35.433+0000)\n>\n> It already does bonus damage on the second target, it really doesnt need 1 shot you considering how powerful her ult is.\n\nPowerful upfront damage and powerful ranged damage with ult.

Her ult is pretty easy to escape from, and the back line should be far enough away that they can literally take a step backwards and get out. \nAlso, if you were a tank and didn't displace or stun her, then you weren't tanking right or you weren't playing a Juggernaut and not a tank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GarthBrooksXD","date":"2017-02-23T05:49:09.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Lethality makes up for it sweetheart.","replies":[]}]}
