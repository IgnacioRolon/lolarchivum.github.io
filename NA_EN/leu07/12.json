Even if she did get changes, we still have to wait for Poppy, Yorick, Taric's reworks in addition to changes to champs like Aatrox, Rammus, Urgot who are in weird places in the meta. \n\nI'd rather rito come with a plan for the snake lady then just give me useless info to satisfy me for the time being.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2015-08-30T01:03:12.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Quit acting like you're the only one they ignore.","replies":[]}]}
