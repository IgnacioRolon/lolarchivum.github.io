The only champ I truly FEAR laning against as Cass is the shadow fellow Zed. Some toxic guy told me cass counters Zed hard, but I disagree entirely. Cassio is so mana hungry that trading with Zed is useless, considering he is energy based, so anytime he swiches places with his shadow to trade with you, you will get oom after 3 Twin Fangs (E) and he will just pot/lifesteal his life-bar up. Not to mention his insane long range/high damage/wave clearing poke. After 6 it only gets worse... probably because I would not be full mana bar after some trades and he can easily ult me and scape like nothing (I  find it extremely hard to ult a Zed after he ulted me) sooo only after I rush the 3100g {{item:3157}} I dare to duel him (still scared though). If I want to leave lane at early game to get the most needed {{item:3070}}  or any other item he would just push hard and won&#039;t let me go... Things get even worse if he gets a {{item:3140}} just to laugh harder at me. \r\n\r\nSooo all that been said, can someone give me a strategy to deal against the so polemical {{champion:238}} ? or {{champion:69}} simply does not stand a chance against him? or maybe I suck hard?","replies":[{"poster":"DrMeatcurtains","date":"2015-04-23T14:02:56.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, kinda late to this thread but most of the stuff here is really good info. \n\nThere's a couple things you can do vs zed. Depending on what runes and masteries (like if you run a standard AP page) you can try for the level 2 all in. Take Q level 1, harass him when he tries to cs. Level 2 get E and just spam the QE combo till he dies. If you dont kill him, at least force him to back and try to get somewhat of an advantage in lane. He generally wont try to all in again till 6, make sure you dodge his harass. Once you get 100 stacks the lane becomes more forgiving since you can heal a bit. \n\nIf you run a more late game rune page(mpen marks, scaling health yellows,scaling ap blues and ap quints) the goal is to come out of laning phase without dying. In this situation, you basically wanna play like a giant pussy because you know you are gonna outscale him late game. Not much to say here other than just farm and poke with q when the opportunity arises. \n\nIn terms of builds there's a couple things you can do. Zhonyas is basically a must, but depending on how the lane is going you can choose to go ROA and be a little bit tankier and soak some damage up. ROA>Sorcs>Rylai's makes you pretty tanky, ~3k health and with a zhonyas you can choose to just kinda facetank him. If you go tear you tend to be squishier and bit weaker until you get seraphs. Once you get seraphs the shield is basically enough to negate one of his abilities. \n\nSurviving his all in: as soon as he hits level 6, you know its coming. Like someone else in the thread mentioned, once he ults, he's gonna appear behind you. Turn your character to face him, ult and spam QE till he dies- this goes for most Zeds in lower elo's. Once you face a good zed, they're gonna know what you're gonna do so save your ult for when you have a better chance of hitting it and just exhaust them when they pop R. Exhaust is pretty good on cass, esp if you go against an assassin like Zed or LB. Once it gets to late game, whoever gets ahead just kinda tends to snowball. Zed can delete you with one QWE combo if you're not careful and likewise if you catch him with Q you can delete him with like 3E's. Hope this helps, enjoy.\n\n\nEdit: Also, good job on coming here and asking how to play vs Zed instead of making another \"ZED IS OP QQ RITO NERF PLOX\" thread. These boards need more threads like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2015-04-22T06:24:17.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just all in him level 2 like cass does every lane opponent, he can't match your damage output that early. Also later when he ults you, ult backwards as cass and stun him as he reappears, then drop poisons and move between him and his ult shadow. If he swaps back you can keep chasing with twin fang and get the kill. If he gets ahead its really rough though. Zhonyas definitely a second buy after your mana item.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-04-22T06:27:39.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GodzillaMagnum,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EntIyw7k,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-22T06:24:17.487+0000)\n>\n> Just all in him level 2 like cass does every lane opponent, he can't match your damage output that early.

After that just wait. Zed will naturally push lane usually, if he does wait for a Q to hit, then go in. if you have to wait till lvl 3, make sure you hit 3 first, and put that second point in E. at lvl 3 with that setup you can outtrade anyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2015-04-22T06:36:04.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're not using mana to last hit or missing your abilities you can definitely all in. Q > EEE > Q > E (as many as you can squeeze in) > Ignite will kill most lane opponents if they don't flash. If you're autoing him every time he goes to last hit, he won't have full health either.

Skill order would be level 1 q, level 2 e, level 3 q, then 1 in w then max your e. With two points in q you can bully him out really easily. Last hit minions with e if you miss/dodge to sustain your pool. Then you need to practice stunning him when he ultimates You. He is forced to look at you when he reappears (1 second) remember you have a small cast animation on your ultimatE. When successfully you can qw e spamm and destroy him. A good zed will simply ultimate you then immediately warp back to blow your ultimate. Because yours has a higher cd than his. Then when his is up he has a window to kill you. If this is the case you could rush zhonyas but usually it is better to get tear into Rylais on cass. Plus you have built in cDr in your passive so this tactic becomes less relevant as the game progresses. Not to mention you outscale him super hard, stalling the game helps if you are behind too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"stomped ur ass","date":"2015-04-22T06:55:46.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cass is pretty good against Zed. The damage output she has early is insane. I'm pretty sure she needs to land the poison before she can begin to harass like crazy without going mana hungry--not completely sure.\n\nI'd recommend watching Cass at high level of play on youtube. \n\nYou can also poke him when he tries AAing a minion.\n\nCass should be able to bully out a lot of mid laners.","replies":[]}]}
