Thinking maybe similar to the current E, with the lines then being shared of stars or shards of the Moon raining down onto the enemies as selected enhancing armor penetration with or with no concern for Magic {as referencing the movie, as if each child could take a strike with a knife onto the enemy: Moon Shards Rain.} Will think about R.  I like this concept.
