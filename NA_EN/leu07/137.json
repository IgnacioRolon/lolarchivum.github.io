This ability stacks up to 5 times&quot; &lt;,&lt; , since her mana cost and usage is insane or she should either get slow resistance or passive magic pen, and the ms stuff cannot build boots let it be a passive in other skill. \r\n\r\nGive the range back to the Q...or the damage...hitting Q doesnt feel important at all...you hit Q just for your E, is a skill that doesnt stand alone, since the last rework.\r\n\r\nThat W doesnt work at all in laning, I only find it useful for the ppl to not flash from a wall, you hit the target and the person just move a little bit and thats it....why not let the grounded effect stay like the poison?\r\n\r\nThe E is a plain nerf,  you still need to hit the Q or the W, because the damage is sooooo weak that even minions survive if there not poisioned in late game, her mana cost are hugeeeeeee but like HUGE! so you last hit to get some mana back &lt;,&lt; but guess what you only get mana back to cast another Q or another E and thats it.....and the heal &lt;,&lt; pls.....plus the 1/0.75 second of cd anytime it just make her lose DPS.","replies":[{"poster":"CriticalMethods","date":"2016-05-07T18:54:54.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I like her because her passive is realistic...
