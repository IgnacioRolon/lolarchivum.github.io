So good job on that part riot.\r\n\r\nHowever....mmm 750 tier skins means have a new model but no recall and no new particles, while 975 skin have particles and a recall.\r\n\r\nWith the recents vu...I think they should study lowering the price of some skins. For example guerrilla tristana, she doesnt have a recall or diferent particles from the base skin.  Same goes with bilgewater katarina, and many others.\r\n\r\nWhat you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Rotkiw15","date":"2015-02-25T01:14:57.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a nice idea.I also think they should make simple recolors and reskins for 520rp again.","replies":[]}]}
