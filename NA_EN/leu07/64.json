Ap just get cdr and Zhonyas (and its stats are truly meh) with the nerf to rylais, ap just have raw damage, period, and even so, ADs just deal more damage early and mid game. The only reason why aps are picks are to stop Tanks from building tons of armor, so Ads can do more damage... From someone who doesnt like to play ADs, this is really frustrating. AP needs better items.","replies":[{"poster":"KMSorDieTryin","date":"2017-03-11T05:04:29.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly have to agree. I find it annoying when I am winning lane against a {{champion:238}} or a{{champion:91}} as an AP champion.  And you have like a 2 kill lead or something and you are about to go in for a kill but they are saved by a {{item:3155}} shield and can just back and tp into lane or something. When if they had a 2 kill lead on me for whatever reason I would not have nearly as much protection and it would be much more of a struggle for me to play against something who can dive me and theres not much i can do. It also makes it harder since the new items like {{item:3814}} have been introduced making these champions even more of a struggle to deal with. I feel like before all these ad+mr items were introduced these champions were not much of a pain as they are now.\n\n this whole weak AP item topic isnt really dicussed but it is a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2017-03-11T13:31:40.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-03-10T23:16:56.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The actual data says otherwise\n\nhttp://beta.champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&amp;order=descend&order=descend","replies":[]},{"poster":"Its All Skillzz","date":"2017-03-10T23:06:30.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"its cause ap items have been nerfed to shit constantly, and the ammount of raw ap you can get in the game has been constantly removed over time. i remember have over 1k ap at full build now ill be lucky to see 700-800. also death cap is so insanely expensive and has an awful build path that its not really bought till last. zhonya is not even good anymore unless your facing zed even then its not useful lol. later when he has max cdr his ult will be up almost twice as much as your zhonya cd. another factor is the amount of offensive mr that was added to the game. {{item:3814}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2017-03-10T23:33:50.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What we need is an AP version of {{item:3139}}, AD champs have all the fun toys.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-03-10T23:39:54.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet you wouldnt want an AD {{item:3157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Its All Skillzz","date":"2017-03-10T23:45:56.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WhoIsThisDude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YPFHgatI,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-03-10T23:39:54.484+0000)\n>\n> Yet you wouldnt want an AD {{item:3157}}\n\nwould be broken on some champion and make others sitting ducks. lol adc pops zhonya gets surronded by enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2017-03-10T23:44:13.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WhoIsThisDude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YPFHgatI,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-03-10T23:39:54.484+0000)\n>\n> Yet you wouldnt want an AD {{item:3157}}\n\nLast thing we need is Zed with a Zhonya's that helps him A LOT.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-03-10T23:31:58.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> and utility\n\nGonna have to stop you right there\n\nAP typically has way more utility than AP.
