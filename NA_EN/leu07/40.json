All the Elderwood skins so far have had their own themes and colours; Bard has a blue cloak and a big red leaf beard; LeBlanc has the red hair, purplish wood and large green leaves; Hecarim has the woven wood, green leaf hair, green chest crystal, stone armour segments and wood horns. This is basically a bipedal Hecarim without the stone armour, looks-wise.\n\nArtistically it's beautiful and basically official splash quality, but design-wise I feel like there's a lot of untapped potential. She needs something to make her unique compared to the other Elderwoods, like different colours or some unique shapes. Maybe some flowers in her hair that add a splash of colour, for instance.\n\nI don't mind cohesive themes, the Battlecast line is my favourite after all, but so far each Elderwood skin has been very distinct and I hope they keep up with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Quindec","date":"2017-02-28T02:15:48.144+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe like an autumn orange color to make her distinct","replies":[{"poster":"Geodude333","date":"2017-02-28T16:56:11.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea of Autumn being her thing.

To me all the elder wood skins resembled seasons, bard - fall (odd color leaves), hecarim - spring (very green vibrant colors full of life) and Leblanc - summer (the colors somehow reminded me of frogs? Usually o see them a lot during the summer especially during monsoon season) so lissandra would fit the winter elder wood theme extremely well! To make things more unique for her maybe add more Grey and snow. That color would resemble dead frozen trees with her hair being a bunch of dried out twigs and maybe add thorns into the roots. \n\nHer Q could be a sharp coned piece of dead bark, Grey colored with twig vines around it and maybe thorns.\n\nW: the area around her would be filled with frozen twigs and dried out vines could surround the enemies it hits.\n\nE: the claw could be a claw of dead wood with very sharp looking fingers and leave snow on the ground.\n\nR: it would entangle herself or her enemies in a bunch of vines and twigs and the area would be filled with dried out leaves falling off the vines.\n\nThat would be my 2 cents at least ^^ not really sure of the elder wood skins are based of seasons but I always felt that they were.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Almighty","date":"2017-02-28T10:18:27.448+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I love this idea.
