I hope she get the tristana/katarina/sejuani/sivir treatment that being said I wanna share my take on mf and how I picture her. [img]http://i.imgur.com/IOKIboyl.jpg[/img] Reading her lore...mf is a legenday bounty hunter, captain and a person that","url":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/0Ux8fEg3-mf-vu","image":"http://i.imgur.com/IOKIboyl.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Check the link for the MFVU :c\n\nSo as an avid MF player...in late S2 she recived a buff where she didnt have cast time with her ult...with s3 changes on armor penetration she became a monster with her ult and black cleaver in her power, so her ult got nerfed, her w was nerfed too, and well cleaver was nerfed too...in s4 armor penetration got nerfed...leaving mf in a weird state where you only \"have power\" in early game.\nThen they rework her...and it became harder to play with her...you need to stack your impure to make damage...and well there is no easy way to do that unless you used r from the beginning of a team fight, but she became a really great duelist thanks to the rework.\n\nWith all the changes in gold flow and the comeback mechanic, any game last between 33-40 min...making even harder to mf to do something comparing with other adc with no escape mechanic example: kog, kog have his range, his armor shred, and poke with ult, plus his slow is really good. Jinx...well jinx have and arsenal of weapons that make her peel for herself, her passive help her in teamfights, her rockets hits in aoe, her range, and her ult have %health plus is global. Varus, ult that peel for himself and % damage with his w. Draven, insane dps, his e is a self peel mechanic plus ms with his w. Ashe her ult is strong plus she have permaslow and her attack speed is one oh the highest and she does have a nice range. Sivir, spellshield, ult for running, insane dps in aoe (I liked more old sivir...they called me troll for using her on ranked....they gave her some visual update and the girl is strong as fack)\n\nAnd the new shiny adc have really strong early power, plus farm tools, and late game, so MF is in a really bad spot right now....is the comp is aoe, mf shines, but so does lucian, jinx, graves, kalista, ez and sivir, and they bring late game potencial, and reposition tools and not a channeling spells that make you an easy target fo vi, reksai <,<U (yes Im still butthurt), or yasuo wall....or braum wall.\n\nBased on the new context of reworks that have been going around...she needs a rework overall. Her identity is not there, she is like a legendary bounty hunter, who I think is kinda reckless...she lured her enemies or flirt her way out if  she need to.... and she should be the aoe queen.\n\nThis is like....my kit for her.\n\n**Passive: Fortune Shots**\nMiss Fortune&#039;s basic attacks and apply stacks of Fortune Shots for 4 seconds. Upon reaching 4 stacks, the target is charmed  for 0.25 / 0.50 / 0.75 seconds, an enemy cannot be affected by Fortune Shots again for a few seconds. \n\nMiss Fortune&#039;s autoattacks deal 6/8/10% AD bonus magic damage, stacking cumulatively up to 4/6/8.\n\n**Q: Double Up**\nMiss Fortune fires a shot through an enemy to hit an enemy behind them, dealing physical damage to the first target and increased physical damage to the second, applying on-hit effects to both.\n\n**W: Strut**\nPassive: Miss Fortune gains 25 movement speed after not taking damage for 5 seconds, which gradually increases to 70 movement speed over 5 seconds.\n\nActive: For 3/4/4.5/5/5.5 seconds, Miss fortune doubles her passive movement speed bonus, and she removes any slows.\n\n**E: Make It Rain**\nMiss Fortune rains hundreds of bullets down onto target 400-radius area. This area lasts for 3 seconds, slowing and dealing magic damage every quarter of a second to enemies within....remove cast time...make it rain applies Fortune Shots.\n\n**R: Shock and Awe**\nPassive: Miss fortune gains bonus attack speed 20/30/40% and while W is active she gains 80% of magicpen.\n\nActive: Miss Fortune empowers her Twins Pistols within the next 8 seconds, gaining access to an alternate set of abilities.  She may only cast one of those 3 abilities.\n\n* *Q: Cannon Ball: *Miss Fortune fires a massive cannonball at an enemy unit, reaching the end of its range, the cannon explodes, dealing physical damage in a 800-range cone behind the target , knocking it and surrounding enemies back.\n\n* *W: Bomb Stiletto*: Miss Fortune uses her guns to dash quickier, enemies along her path take physical damage and she leaves a trail of fire for 5 seconds that will continually deal magic damage.\n\n* *E: Bullet Time: * Miss Fortune channels for 2 seconds, spraying up to waves of bullets (The number of waves fired scales with her attack speed) in a cone in front of her, dealing physical damage and applying Fortune Shots&#039; passive magic damage and stack to all enemies within the area.\n\nSorry for the long post she is one of my favorite champions ever, and sorry for the typos :c english is not my forte.","replies":[{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-04-01T16:57:45.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Miss Fortune.
