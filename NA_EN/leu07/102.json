It is definitely less rewarding and more risky to go for a trade in the laning phase, her set-up 0,9 cd on her E makes you lose a lot of dps, hence, the enemies can outtrade you easily with a faster, easier and more damaging combo (like brand).\n Her W feels better, but I think it is overrated really, people can just walk easily out of it. I tried maxing her Q since the damage got up, I found myself oom even more often than her Stashu version. Yes, you are even more manahungry now... I feel like it is important to stack CDR on cass now, so I go for morello instead of tear, and its sustain is not that great at all, also, with soo many things you want to be building her to be efective and of course Void Staff is not between the first items you may wanna rush her, she can get countered easily with MR since she cant buy boots anymore. \n\nMid-game she still feels weak, her new W does not compesate all the nerfs to her dps and her Q range. I think she got some really nice potential lategame with how swifty she can be, specially if you build Ludens, but her Stashu lategame version was anyways stronger. \nSo yeah, Cass definitely feels more on the weaker side this midseason, I expect she is going to have less winrate and less pickrate, specially since she is sooo outshadowed by the other mages that are pretty strong now (brand, malza, velkoz). I feel like I have been very objective with this review I gave. \n\nIdk if I am not playing her well now (if so, how does one has to play her now?) or if i am not building her properly. This are the thoughts of a regular and simple League player.","replies":[{"poster":"Tesrac","date":"2016-05-04T18:40:42.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was super leery about the changes to Cassie when they were first announced, losing 30% ap and 25% CDR late game is a huge nerf to her late game damage, they made her W pretty worthless as a zoning tool and knee capped her mobility till the mud game leaving her even more vulnerable to ganja and tower dives.  They upped the damage on her Q, but decreased the range and increased the man's cost, making it less viable as a poke/zoning tool and they did improve the ms buff on it they added the decreasing effect to it so you only get that extra boost for part of the proc.  Compared to the changes they made to the other mages it just feels super lackluster and like the wanted to punish Cassie players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2016-05-04T17:29:28.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also, you want to build both tear and morellos i think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yeulx","date":"2016-05-04T16:54:45.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not that shes weaker like riot said awhile back that they are shifting the power in the mages to fill niche  things.... like u only want to pick cassiopeia when the enemy team has a ton of dashing champions.. lucian...ext because of her new grounded mechanic","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-05-04T16:59:19.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But she still gets countered by people with mobility O.o her W is not gonna move around with the person, they just gonna walk out of it.
