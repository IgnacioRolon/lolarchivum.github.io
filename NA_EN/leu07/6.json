I havent experimented a protect the kog comp or a game where I should be playing kog...I think thats more because of the preseason changes, where there is no place for champions that take their time to scale to lategame.\n\n{{champion:104}}  **Graves**\nHavent played him...but got a sheer of games against him....his new Q is really easy to dodge, but when youre alone with him in lane is really scary, he has become a great duelist and more bursty than before...and I mean, it makes sense, his weapon is a shotgun....dunno why but he sustain really well in lane without a healing support, and he is really REALLY tanky...he was nerfed in the pbe but is was more like a slap with a feather in the hands nerf.\n\nHavent play Quinn or Corky so Im not gonna say nothing about them XD....thanks for the read and sorry for the typos","replies":[]}
