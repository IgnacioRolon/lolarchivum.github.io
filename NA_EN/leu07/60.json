I like building raw damage on MF cuz in late she just would have a really good steroid that I could mantain for a really long time thanks to the Love tap mechanic.\r\n\r\nWith this change,  mmm Strut is going to be available with 2 seconds after you casted it (if you aa 4 targets in 4 seconds) , and Its going to left MF in a spot where youre not longer rewarded for playing around Love Tap, lowering her skill-cap, making her easier to play, and getting nerfed (even more) to the ground because of that change &gt;,&gt; that she didnt need....like for real, she is not the one ppl are complain about &gt;,&gt;","replies":[]}
