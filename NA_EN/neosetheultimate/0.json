Full tanks with cc ridden kits, enchanters with shields on top of roots, control mages killing you while you watch helplessly inside their \"no fun zone\" all of these things grind the fun to a screeching halt. What if, instead of giving you 25% tenacity, the cc duration followed the URF rules. That way cc runs out extremely fast and people aren't being held in a Veigar E like animals in a zoo.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-06T05:01:28.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make URF random again.\n\nBut between the ton of tenacity you get for free, tenacity from runes, stupidly short spammable QSS/cleanse.. there are bigger problems.","replies":[]}]}
