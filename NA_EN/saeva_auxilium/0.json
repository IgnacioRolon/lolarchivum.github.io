(Regarding Rewards)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first I thought everything would be like before, regarding getting IP/BE, but I found out we are now getting those things after levels. Then again, I'm just not getting anything. No BE what so ever, am I doing something wrong or? Can anybody tell me, maybe I got it wrong when I get the BE but I'm just confused at the moment. \r\n\r\nAs well regarding rewards some people get. I havn't played league for too long, but I thought I'd be getting something at least. And appearently I didn't get any missions, meanwhile my friends got them. \r\n\r\n(sorry if this is the wrong board, never posted anything on here)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T05:18:07.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You still get BE the way you did in the old system, by disenchanting shards and getting some as drops from chests and capsules. I do see that you did actually get the Rune Collector mission which refunded your old runes and gave you 2000 BE.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinx Gimme Soda","date":"2017-11-14T03:47:46.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"@BroPoro I haven't received any blue essence at all upon leveling, the capsules only contain champions, but every reference I see online say \"You should receive champion shards and blue essence\" so what gives??","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-14T04:36:35.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It looks like sometimes you get champion shards while others you can get just flat BE from them. Either way, those shards are essentially just BE waiting to be disenchanted if you already have the champion or simply don't want them.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinx Gimme Soda","date":"2017-11-14T06:09:12.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got 3 levels without a blue essence drop... The first chest (My lvl 29 capsule) I got anivia and annie.. a total of 270+90 BE when disenchanted... I had 94 BE at the start.. which didn't even equal a 450 champ...\n\nThen my next one I got decent loot, 4 champ shards, no blue essence, but the champ shards equalled about 800 BE... but no blue essence...\n\nStill couldn't get a champ, unless I wanted a 1350 champ.... then I got another level, was able to activate my nami shard.... but literally 3 levels for 1 champion, thats rough... I got from lvl 1 to lvl 28 before the BE revolution, and I had enough champs (including draven and jinx) to play draft pick... I win 50% of my games, so I'm like henrietta, I got shorted a bunch, and also, my capsules didn't include a single BE drop..\n\nFurthermore, I rerolled my skin shards, and get skin permanents for champions I don't even own.. and with this new BE bullshit, I have to wait 3 years before I can get the champions that I have skin shards for..\n\nListen, I don't care how it \"looks\"...\n\nYour articles say you should get BLUE ESSENCE & CHAMPION SHARDS, not one or the other... and what about my lvl 29 champion capsule.. it totaled 360, which is exactly half of 720... isn't that fishy? I got ripped off, and tbh I am losing interest in league of legends because of this BE...\n\nIts frustrating being on a new account and having to grind worse than runescape to afford a champion... It was better before, regardless of the math you presented, I've played for 3 years now, and its never been this grindy.. Its not right, I understand you wanna push your agenda and make more money, and make champions less obtainable... But its not right to also rework how the skin rerolls work... Now you can reroll and get skins for champs you don't even own... so now you have to either buy the champ, or disenchant the skin permanent for 375 ORANGE ESSENCE which is 1/3 the skin's actual value... If I woulda just disenchanted the 3 shards I woulda got more orange essence..\n\nThis whole move to encourage microtransactions really leaves a bad taste in my mouth... I'm probably gonna start looking into a new game, and I literally play like 12 games a day on average, since the BE update I'm down to like 2-5 per day, look over my account, winning or losing games literally feels like a waste of time... Before when each game equated to a bit of IP, I had goals set, now I know I have to level 10 times to get a 6300 champ... I feel completely demotivated... \n\nI want to purchase yasuo, but its gonna take me 3 weeks to get that champion, so why bother playing? Even if the math works out the same... The IP per game, made it feel like you were making progress, now its all RNG... its just stupid.. You don't feel like you make any progress, even when you get a champ capsule, because I've lvl'd 3 times and have yet to receive a blue essence drop, at all..\n\nIDK I'm ranting at this point, but this update is gonna cost you a big chunk of your userbase... it just seems so greedy overall","replies":[{"poster":"Cthulhy","date":"2017-11-14T19:16:48.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new system is, game wise, noob friendly. And it clearly has updated so they can easly enforce more shit down our throats like pointless and costy chromas, in-game emotes (jesus, i almost uninstalled league when i saw this myself in game) and minor things like wards and icons...\n\nI miss the early seasons because of the simplicity of it. But ever since i started playing there was a problem with runes and masteries and the solution was always the most simple: REMOVE RUNES AND MASTERIES..... hell, i could even live if they had removed Summoner Spells as well...\n\nI don't see reasons to keep playing anymore to be honest... I like some characters because they are developing them pretty well but besides that, the game has fallen into the trash tier of free-to-play sort of video game that i see popping up on boring ads... it's a sad turn of events but it is how i feel to be honest...\n\nI'm guessing it's for the best because everything has a life span... Hoped League could go down with some honor... and not like... this...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Atsureki","date":"2017-11-10T04:15:32.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i know i did the rune collector mission and it doesn't seem to have given my any BE because it said it would give me a deal of 10,000 and another of 500 and im still sitting at 4259 so i myself have no idea what is going on :/","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T04:44:37.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-whispers- check your looooooot ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Atsureki","date":"2017-11-10T07:15:35.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for the info.....i feel kinda derpy that i didn't look there XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
