After he told me that I logged out and was able to log back into my account and even join a game.  I'm so confused as to what would have caused this?

You run the risk of someone abusing your account and possibly getting it banned, in which case we may not be able to help due to not being able to tell who the original creator is. Moving right along....\n\nIt sounds like your cousin probably got sent a message by someone abusing the chat emote system. It's not very well known, but with a certain command you can make your chat look like a system message. I went ahead and double-checked your account, and there aren't any bans at all so you're still good to go!","replies":[]}]}
