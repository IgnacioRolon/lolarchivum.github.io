I've tried recovering the account via email but to no success due to the region transfer(i think). my IGN is \"Stewps\" and i really don't know what to do at this point, I've submitted a support ticket but all i got was an automated response saying the line is long.  i feel as if every passing minute my account gets farther from recovery. if you have any advice or anything like that, all help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T04:15:52.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing access to an account **really sucks!**. I've had it happen once or twice with other games and it always puts a load of stress on the table. I know it can be hard, but if you remain patient, we'll have an account specialist with you on your ticket as soon as possible. \n\nWith some investigation and verification, I'm confident we'll get this sorted out with you. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
