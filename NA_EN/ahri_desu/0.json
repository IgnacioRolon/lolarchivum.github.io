I did not know the new pre season will reduce the amount of Orange Essence obtained from disenchanting skin shards. Is it possible for my skin shards to be disenchanted at the normal rate as it was before the pre season as it was uncalled for and feels really disappointing to hold on to skin shards in which I already had no use for but did not disenchant. Thank you very much.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T05:05:22.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not sure we'll be able to give the old disenchant prices now that the conversions have happened. There was a status message up in the client and on the status page for the recent weeks letting players know that values would be changing, and it was most beneficial to disenchant any shards you didn't immediately want before the patch dropped.","replies":[{"poster":"00miku","date":"2017-11-09T07:38:54.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe the message in the client was very specific in mentioning to disenchant \"Champion shards\", which is completely misleading.","replies":[{"poster":"Silence Glaive","date":"2017-11-09T08:31:40.963+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://archive.is/2017.10.31-040744/http://status.leagueoflegends.com/%23na\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Rb4uABI.jpg\nThis is the message that was shown on the service status page as of halloween.

I know it is my fault for not thinking it not only applied to champ shards but also skin shards, but since the system is just new, and it was not 100% clear of what will happen to skin shards(or why the amount has dropped significantly), is it possible to get an ability for a short time(like a day or two) to be able to disenchant shards at the previous price? Thanks a lot, it feels really bad holding on to shards I had no interest in just to have it worth even worse. Was it ever in the tool tip that I should disenchant any skin shards I am not interested in almost immediately? I don't think I have seen it. I feel these announcements should be much more clear in the future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlyingLizard4","date":"2017-11-09T13:44:31.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stupidly assumed it only meant champ shards as it was blue essence that was being combined with IP, as Orange essence wasn't changing I didn't think it effected that.","replies":[]}]}
