I believe that depends on the writer and the story they are telling. I'm sure Riot could work it in leagues lore if they wanted too.\n\nIt shouldn't matter if the robot is self aware or not. We just need a cool machine that slaps hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-01-28T20:53:48.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The focus of the story would not be on the machine then, but on the one who controls and/or built them.\nWhich would make this person a better candidate to become a champion in the game than the actual robot, the robot then would just become a tool in the game as well as in the lore.\n\nBasically like how Ivern summons Daisy.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2020-01-29T21:22:16.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, it could still be interesting if the robot has a certain level of artifical intelligence, being able to learn and adapt, and its creator isn't an active role in its lore anymore, either because the creator is dead, has gone missing or something else.\n\n\nNot to mention that the robot could also be made into something similar to {{champion:421}}, by which I mean that it doesn't talk but only communicates through beep-sounds.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bulshlaka","date":"2020-01-28T16:44:13.274+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once a curious girl of flesh and blood, Orianna is now a technological marvel\n\nBlitzcrank is the only OG i think\nthey need to put them in the universe somehow as robots aren't particularly a thing\n\nthere are plenty that are super enhanced like victor and camille tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2020-01-29T12:08:17.560+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love me some robot characters. Some of my favourite in fiction are (Marvel's) Machine Man and The Fury, the latter especially.\n\nWhile I agree with what Yamada is saying, I think it's not looking at all possibilities. Robots don't need consciousness, they need intelligence. This can come in many different forms and be limited. Story narrative doesn't also need to come from the champ created but the characters in the story overcoming the issue if the champ is the issue. The reason I love The Fury isn't only because an unstoppable killing machine that can't be reasoned with is far more of a threat than Doom or Magneto will ever be but because of how it highlights what a hero must overcome to defeat it. \n\nRiot have luckily given themselves a get out of jail free card in creation that allows them to create more andriods, robots or whatever in the form of Bracken Crystals. Blitz lore states that he was fitted with a one, and over time, Blitz started to learn and adapt. The Bracken Crystals have intelligence in them as stored memories and energy. This allows Riot to create AI without actually having to create AI.\n\nOne of my own champ designs is for a rogue suit of armour with a big Bracken Crystal fitted in it. Originally it was design as a Piltoveran protection armoured suit to be warn by a decorated police officer to fight threats such as Jinx or Urgot but in an early mission he died (while in the suit) and the suit's own intelligence which was Bracken took over. Now it's just walking 'Projection Unit' with a corpse inside, projecting the community from anything and everything while trying to work out it's place in the world and work out why it can hear the 'songs' from other crystals.\n\nAnywho, more AI is needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-01-29T12:34:54.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't want to offend you, but your narrative is basically already covered by Blitzcrank.\n\nIn the end, you think of an intelligent robot who protects the people of Piltover/Zaun with the power given to them, while trying to find their place in the world. This is basically Blitzcrank. Even the source of the \"intelligence\" how you call it here is the same ever since they changed Blitzcrank's lore, Viktor built a Hextech crystal into his body and ever since he was learning, adapting and in the end became conciousness.\n\nThe difference is that Blitzcrank is a complete automaton, while your concept is a suit worn by a corpse.\nWhich I will admit is an interesting (and kinda creepy) idea, but I don't think this makes him different enough to warrant him as a champion in the game.\n\n______________\n\nThere is the possibility to add more AI through Brackern crystals. But this narrative is already covered with Blitzcrank, like I explained. A new robot champion would need something that makes him stand out here. Just putting a crystal in a robot/suit/technical device is not enough.\n\nBut while we are talking about own concepts: I had an own idea some day that **might** at least partly give OP what he is asking for. I was also using the Brackern crystal explanation, but instead of giving it to a unit that works alone I built it into some kind of device to control cameras.\n\nThe idea has been that the champion is a girl inventor from Piltover who is collecting data all over the city through cameras, she is working together with the police by selling them intel about what is going on and about criminals. To help her with this stuff, she has built a device with an AI she calls \"Argo\". This device however has been taken over by the Brackern in the crystal without her realising this. She thinks it is just her programmed AI acting weird, when in reality it is an ancient being talking with her.\n\nThen we can also have a meaningful emotional relationship between the actual champion and that \"AI\", with also giving them potential for in game interactions between them.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2020-01-29T13:07:18.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can fix the lore. One of the biggest things I like about all the lore is the idea that Skarner's kind is the very reason that many Piltoveran champs even function, how it trades and how important the crystals are to all of it, yet he is a side character. I want a character that is in Piltover and directly connected to the Bracken. I basically wanted my champ to be a Bracken intelligence in the form of the suit acting on their own. But don't get me wrong, mine is no hero. It might have started off that way but once you realise all your kind is being trapped in hundreds of thousands of devices 'screaming' (not singing) to be let out, 'protection' soon changes to slaughter.\n\nYour character is good and the idea of Bracken interaction though, I like it. \n\nThe difference in adding him to the game is how he is designed and how his abilities work. Blitz is a round boy, with a hook hand. My character is more sleak, melee fighter. I mean Naut and Pyke lore is basically the same thing after all (or was, not sure what they've retconned from Naut's side).\n\nAnd yes, it's creepy for a reason. ;-)","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-01-29T13:28:20.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naut's and Pyke's lore are really close to each other, but Riot actually didn't intend it to be like this.\n\nBack when Pyke got released, Riot wanted to ship a lore update for Nautilus, completely changing him. He was not supposed to be a revenant anymore who died because his crew betrayed him (just like Pyke), they intended him to be an ancient golem for the cult of Nagakaborous.\n\nBasically he was an empty suit that got possessed by the magic of Nagakaborous to serve the god and collecting the tithe. But the community didn't like it, people wanted Nautilus to stay the revenant who is on a mission for vengeance (even if that role was now filled with Pyke), so Riot didn't go through with the changes and just slightly altered him that he now also collects the tithe.\n\nRiot tries to avoid doubling up in lore like this, they were just forced to do it in that case since the backlash from the community was too big.\n\n_____________________\n\nI agree that Brackern crystals shouldn't just be an afterthought in the lore, tho. There should be some progression in the lore with them. They are the soul crystals of an ancient species, using these in machines should have consequences at some point.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
