Itd be nice if autofill was a choice the player could pick before they queued up or something.\r\nGot autofilled to Bot lane adc.. A role i hate and never play. Fed my ass off to an Ashe and lost us the game.\r\nI dont dodge often, but if i ever get autoed as adc again i will.. Its best for everyone.\r\n\r\nIve never heard anyone say anything good about the autofill system. Do you think Riot would ever get rid of it?","replies":[{"poster":"Darkstar Annie","date":"2020-01-03T06:45:58.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Autofill = autoLPloss, dodge or play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"citlalli5755","date":"2020-01-03T06:07:09.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i'm down to wait for longer que just to play a fair game.  often times I get ass clowns who are auto fill support so they play like shit just cuz they don't want to.  I had a dumb ass a couple games ago just run it down because he didn't want autofill support.  and guess what happens after that game?  he is autofill protected.  so by default he loses autofill games on purpose and try to end them as fast as possible so he can be autofill protected next game and get his favorite and NOTHING will happen to win because he is too smart for the system and as long he doesn't say any BAD words, he will continue to abuse the loop hole in the system for days on end.","replies":[{"poster":"Disco Swiss","date":"2020-01-03T13:11:33.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inting is a shitty thing to do, but who can blame them for being upset.\nWho wants to play a role for 20-40 minutes that the player knows they aren't going to have fun with?\nAnd like you said you get clowns who just want the game to be over asap\nOr you get someone like me\nA person who plays melee tanks for a VERY good reason.\nThe only thing autofill benefits is the enemy team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Admirition","date":"2020-01-11T02:28:19.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I take fill as my second choice.
