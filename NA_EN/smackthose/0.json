I was a poor kid, I've tried league on many things, mostly under 300 dollars. These days I play with low spec shit for fun, so enough with proving my credibility, let's get to the meat. The Acer Swift 1 for $260 on amazon will run league at around 40 frames with some tuning of the graphics settings. Don't expect much else from it though, this thing is only equipped with Intel Pentium N4200 and the shitty included Intel HD Graphics 505. I would say hook up a mouse to this thing and you'll be competitive.
