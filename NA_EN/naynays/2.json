Pantheon is clearly inspired by ancient Greek/Spartan warriors. He resembles the average soldier of that place and era too much imo. \r\n\r\nThe thing is, he doesn't have to look 100% like one, imo. He has a few Hellenic skins which you can tweak to look like the average soldier or commander of that time.\r\n\r\n**Visual idea, Classic and Myrmidon**\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qj3HEGu.png\r\n\r\nThis is just an example on how to significantly tweak our Spartan while still retaining the Hellenic elements. (A modification of another game's char).\r\n\r\n**Current Classic & Myrmidon for comparison**\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IvPbOtq.png\r\n\r\n***\r\n**Abilities**\r\n\r\nPassive • The regular with a tiny upgrade: At lvl 12, Pantheon's next basic attack deals 75% extra damage after a succesful block.\r\n\r\nQ • Same stats, is now a skillshot that pierces everything (i.e goes through minions and hits the champion behind them)\r\n\r\nW • Slight changes, mostly in animation: Instead of jumping he now runs forward really fast and pushes his shield upward knocking his target up.\r\n\r\nE • Just an animation upgrade.\r\n\r\nR • Same. Wanted to suggest clones with a hoplite formation but it would change him too much.\r\n\r\n***\r\nTaunt • \"This is TARGOOOON (or Rakkor)\" while bashing his shield with the spear.\r\n\r\nJoke • \"The Rakkor don't joke arRROOOOOUUUUND\"! ... \"Why am I yelling\"?\r\nJoke 2 • \"Yes, I'm still a baker\"\r\n\r\nExtra: **I believe Pantheon needs a voice-over!** Something like Gerard Butler or Sion if we compare it with LoL. A lower, heavier voice.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-02-24T18:18:27.384+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon is 1 of my Classic Champions that i love & i think its time for him to get a VU personally, i mean i play him with his Drangon Slayer skin but i can't play him with his classic it doesn't work for me anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"NayNays","date":"2015-02-24T18:24:37.289+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understandable, he's pretty outdated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alëk","date":"2015-02-24T20:06:09.653+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"He definitely needs a VU.

His kit is good, but lacks a small something.\n\nMaybe instead of a spear attack buff, it's simply whenever he gets hit while block is up, he counters sort of like jax, reflecting a bit of damage back based on level, like a shield slam?\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2015-02-25T08:08:52.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god that's sexy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Album Orna","date":"2015-02-25T00:00:46.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this VU concept.

Sparta was the war city of Greece and separate from Athens's ideals even when Greece united under the threat of war by other countries.

They had to be at the constant ready for a rebellion against their own slaves. The fact is, Hellenistic ideas shouldn't be with Panth's design. He also should not be shirtless. He is a warrior based off of the Spartan warriors and, as such, should be clothed in armor as they were. Exposed armor would lose the mighty Spartan warrior feel.
