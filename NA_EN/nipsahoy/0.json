Seems based on particle effects from spells and what not.  When theres more people on the screen it gets worse.  In ARAM its really bad happens continually.  Never had these problems before and nothing on my hardware setup has changed.  CPU Graphics card and everything is all the same and my computer has never had any issues with LoL as far as graphics are concerned.  Any ideas?  I tried turning the graphics down and it didnt seem to make any difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T17:55:13.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be some bad game files struggling to render files, or some driver issues that need an update.
