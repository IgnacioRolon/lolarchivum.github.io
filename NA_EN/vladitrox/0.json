It's been fun, LoL has had it's ups and downs, but ultimately, HotS is everything I wanted that you guys never did. I hoped and prayed you guys would fix many issues in your game and add more fun and exciting features, but you never did. Instead, you guys are too concerned with saturating the game with new champions and overpriced skins. Once in a while you make flashy YouTube trailers and although they are enjoyable, they don't make the game itself any better. I'm glad your budget has room for pointless things like that instead of improving the game and fixing it's rotten community.\nA wide assortment of original and fun maps, fun champions from our favorite Blizzard games, and the core gameplay is just fun and entertaining, I'm sorry but HotS is just a better game. Even when I was losing I was having fun. Matches don't last forever and I don't waste hours of my life sitting in stupid pre-game lobbies arguing with teammates about champions and lanes. Faster loading times, faster matches, more interaction, and a better community, what else is there to say? Blizzard has defeated you, and soon I can see a big majority of your player base leaving (including myself and friends) for greener pastures. Not only this, but your notorious Korean community, they are Blizzard gamers by heart, and they will undoubtedly leave LoL for the more serious contender. \n\n**Things I won't miss in LoL:**\n- The toxic community\n- Completely unbalanced and unfair ranked matchmaking system that sticks me with the worst players on the planet and doesn't give a crap about my actual skill at the game\n- Notoriously slow and boring pre-game champion selection screens and loading times\n- Summoners Rift - after 10,000 matches on the same map, things get boring after a while even with the revamp of the map\n- The toxic community\n- Overpriced skins and champions that look fancy in their portraits but mere stick figures in game\n- Lack of anything original or new to the core game in three years to keep it entertaining\n- The toxic community\n\nWill LoL die out from HotS? Probably not. But I feel Riot games is going to be on the other slope now. This loyal player who devoted many hours of my life to your game is done. I'm finished, and I'm not coming back. And maybe this post will enrage some of the community or mods, but honestly, Riot games should read it. I'm in the IT industry and I care about what happens to companies and jobs. You guys need to step it up. Your business was never ambitious enough with LoL as a game. A different map rotation besides \"Summoners Rift\" and more fun gameplay elements like what HotS has would have made your game great. But instead, you barely touched the core framework or elements of this game. You just keep worrying about making new champions and skins to fund your company. That is not a good business model. \nFurthermore, you guys failed to improve the notoriously toxic community in this game. In my 25 years on this planet, this game has the most toxic human beings I have ever met in my life. And I feel as if you guys never did anything besides pointless banhammers to improve the system. Toxic is not just the trash talking, but the quitting and poor sportsmanship. You guys don't enforce it at all. And it's probably because you're afraid of losing customers. But that is not the right way to approach problems like this. HotS is sticking quitters and toxic players with other quitters and toxic players. Simple. They are addressing the issue before the game even hits the shelves. \n\nYour company is undoubtedly on life support from LoL champion and skin sales. What is next in your chapter? Goodbye Riot games, I wish you luck, but I will not continue to support your mediocre game that is LoL anymore. Make something new and original. Skins and champions are fine, but when you neglect the game itself, people will leave. Goodbye and good riddance.","replies":[]}
