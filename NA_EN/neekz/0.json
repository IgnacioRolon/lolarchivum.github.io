I have never had any one else on my account, in all the years that I have had this game.\r\nI sent a message to riot support, to try and resolve this issue; I received a very disingenuous and robotic response, almost the same as the message that I received in the beginning for the suspension, not including any evidence or facts about my suspension. I know that some other people have experienced the same random suspension, but I want to clarify some of the possibilities as to why, because I need access to my account to play in uLoL.\r\n\r\nPossible Causes:\r\n1. I recently moved, and my new address might have registered as some different player having access to my account.\r\n2. I duo wiuth my friend a fair amount, and sometimes we go on large win streaks.\r\n\r\n_**But other than these, I cannot understand any other logical explanation as to why.**_\r\n\r\n[My op.gg](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Wondurs) is clear evidence that I was not boosted, unless I would inefficiently pay someone to log into my account and go on a 7 game loss streak.\r\nLastly, I have never had a significant jump in elo. My largest improvement was Post Season 4 - Season 5 where I climbed from Silver to Plat, but I have remained plat ever since.\r\nCan some Riot Support give me an answer that is genuine?\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Łulu","date":"2016-11-04T04:48:11.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if this work's but you could try bumping riot support on twitter to look into it if you feel like the answer you got was quite robotic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-11-04T04:46:02.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"neekz","date":"2016-11-04T04:47:20.606+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel trolled to the maximum level.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YOU LOST LMAO","date":"2016-11-04T04:47:10.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"your ban was well deserved. you are not allowed to MMR boost at all.\n\nyou have violated the terms of service and deserved this ban greatly,\n\nstay boosted kid.","replies":[{"poster":"neekz","date":"2016-11-04T04:50:13.743+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never boosted/been boosted so I don't see any reason why I \"deserve\" this ban","replies":[{"poster":"YOU LOST LMAO","date":"2016-11-04T04:51:53.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wondurs,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pmAYWgPI,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-11-04T04:50:13.743+0000)\n>\n> I have never boosted/been boosted so I don&#x27;t see any reason why I &quot;deserve&quot; this ban\n\nsee how it feels to bash on my 2 week ban post kid?\nlearn to mute players ingame, its there for a reason.\nif you cant take mild toxicity then just hit the mute button and problem solved.\nmakes me wonder your gpa in school .\n\nstay boosted, kid.","replies":[{"poster":"neekz","date":"2016-11-04T04:54:56.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-11-04T15:06:45.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, don't take this 5v5 guy to seriously or let him get to you. He seems to have a perma ban of his own and is just ragging on you because he isn't getting sympathy anymore.\n\nOn your main topic, perhaps your account info got leaked.  Double check your emails and password and see if your support ticket can check into it.  Should your story be true it might be something silly like an account leak from a long time ago thats getting checked and dinging your record","replies":[{"poster":"neekz","date":"2016-11-04T15:57:09.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if it was long ago, I do not see how the ban could still be applicable.
