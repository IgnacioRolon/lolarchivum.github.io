I Ended up qualifying for the series again, but was not awarded one.  Does the promo helper not apply in tier promotions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T23:37:12.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strange to hear that you didn't get a promo helper if you were eligible for it, so I checked things out for you.   I see you had lost a series on the 11th.  You got into another series and were promoted with a single game on the 12th.  Nothing seems out of the ordinary here.  Hope that helps with clearing things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-03-15T20:40:50.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you demote out of the division you were in?   That would reset any promo helpers you had.","replies":[]}]}
