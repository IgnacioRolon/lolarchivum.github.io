Tryndamere and Kayle already have the market on the invulnerability ult, and Irelia and Olaf have the CC reduction.\n\nI think so long as something in the kit preserves the panic that sets in when Poppy ults, it'll be okay. Her personality is best shown through from the reactions of the enemy team. They need to have a mass \"oh shit\" reaction when Poppy ults. Something of a controlled panic, because they know they have to stop her but it's not going to be easy.\n\nWhat if her ult translated this into something of a scaling threat issue? Say, when she ults, she gets a buff that increases her movement speed, tenacity, AD, AP, and damage reduction by a small amount for a period of time, but then have those values go up every time she's crowd-controlled during the ult? Or rather, every quarter-second she spends crowd-controlled, I'd hate to see Annie's stun only give the same benefit as Quinn's vault for three times the CC.

As a long time Poppy play and lover (I must've played 50% of my Ranked games on her for the last 3 seasons), there are a few things that I really fear about this rework, and a few other which intrigues me.\n\nFor a starter, what did you guys identify as her core gameplay elements? Right now, I feel liek all of her abilities are bland and/or problematic. W is barely interactive, Q is a simply AA reset move, and her innate is simply \"being tankier\". At the same time, her Innate is purely broken where no number tuning could make the ability feel good without being completely overpowered (like it is right now), her Q scales with pretty much everything (AD, AP and enemy max health),  her W is a shitton of stats that you can keep up fairly easily through lane, and I don't think I really need to point out the numerous flaws in her ultimate. So when faced with a kit that's so fundamentally broken, how do you proceed in term of reworking the champion?\n\nOtherwise, in a similar fashion, Poppy also has *many* different playstyles she can opt to go for since her kit doesn't really enforce anything (high AP scaling, %dmg increase, %dmg reduction, CC, high base damage). I've seen AP glass cannon (which isn't actually great now that DFG is gone), AP bruiser, AD bruiser, full AD, full tank, on-hit/hybrid, support (triforce), support (true support)... I'm not even sure there's a single item I haven't seen built on Poppy apart fro mthe Hextech core and Bonetooth necklace, and I wouldn't bet on the former. It's safe to assume that she won't be as good at doing everything, so the question is, what playstyles/roles are favored by the new kit?\n\nLastly, for now, you mentioned how E is being kept, were there any work done to make it feel better? I feel like it is a really frustrating ability right now on live since the placement of both yourself and the target are very random when you stun them. Sometimes you'll hit the enemy over smaller ledges (like the Blue buff river ledge or the mid lane raptor one), sometimes you'll be stuck between your target and the wall, sometimes you'll bodyblock the enemy inside the wall, sometimes it won't stun. On top of that it can currently be canceled by both dashes and blinks, which means that you end up blowing your only mobility spell to end up out of position and without having closed the gap nor inflicted any damage. When you trade E for flash, it's somewhat ok, since even if you get harassed back, you blew an important cooldown, but getting denied by things like Akali/Yasuo/Amumu dashing to me, or Lucian simply using his 6s cd spell to not only not lose anything, but even gain better harass thanks ot his passive is kinda irritating. So was there any technical/behind the scene work done to make Heroic Charge slightly more reliable/rewarding?\n\nThanks a lot for talking about it ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-08-11T17:28:33.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about her early jungle, as in the first two clears, is that a role she can still do well?

Wait and see just a short while longer and let us know what you think of it when it's done.\n\nMy worry isn't that you're not keeping her ult (it's terribly designed) but that you're apparently reworking her into a tank. Right now, if you ask any poppy player what kind of champion she is, the answer would be a bruiser/assassin. She serves a similar role to Irelia or Jax, and that is *not* the same role that a tank serves. Her current kit has nothing in it that really says \"this champion is a tank\" aside from the ramping mechanic on her W, which is in practice not actually used because of the fact that you can activate the ability to instantly stack it. Past that, her passive is damage mitigation that gets *less* effective as you build tank items, her E isn't a particularly tank-centric ability, and her ult is like a more overpowered version of Tryndamere's ult.\n\nThat doesn't say tank to me, that says melee carry or light bruiser. I understand that most of her kit won't be remaining, which is fine, but I really hope you guys are able to keep her role the same, where that role is basically \"melee carry with burst mitigation abilities\". Poppy has *never* been a tank, and that's not how anyone who plays her views her role. Her role is somewhere in between Master Yi or Yasuo and Jax or Irelia. *Please* don't rework her into a crowd-control oriented tank with low damage and high durability/disruption, since that's really not what she is.","replies":[{"poster":"Michicha","date":"2015-08-11T13:21:40.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm thinking they're keeping her in the realm of \"Juggernaut\" bruiser, ala Garen Darius Mordekaiser Skarner reworks on the PBE Currently.

She's a melee carry and every poppy player will tell you that. Changing a champion's role works when it's not clear what the role of that champion even is, as was the case with pre-rework Sion, but Poppy *has* a clear role right now, she just doesn't have a well designed kit.\n\nReworking Poppy into a pure tank because she visually looks like one and has *one* ability that fits a tank playstyle is like reworking Lux into a pure support because she kind of looks like she might be a support and has a shield. If a rework is going to totally change what kind of champion a given champion is, you may as well just delete them entirely and make something new because all that will remain is the name.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-08-11T05:30:47.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think most people want that gone the same way fiora's ultimate needed to go. \n\nBut there isnt many anti-carry in the game.

I would say the problem is that most that play her main her as she has never been a free week champion and that like any riven she needs alot of knowledge and practice because nobody wins their first game as poppy and people just give up instead of trying harder. p.s tanky evelynn gage is so awesome.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Backl4sh1","date":"2015-08-11T14:54:36.705+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is she getting a new VO or Model update","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-11T15:26:24.739+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes both.","replies":[]}]}]}
