After he did just that I stopped farming and waited for the game to end. At the end I was reported by several of my teammates, including the trolling shaco, as well as the enemy team who was unaware of our chat logs. I&#039;m not asking to be unbanned I just think its funny that all of the time I spent in this game has just been locked due to an automated system. What&#039;s more is the Shaco who admitted to intentionally feeding and throwing, has had it reinforced that this is something acceptable to do. He messaged me after the game saying he couldn&#039;t believe the team blamed me, and that I was right he would never have let us win, and just mocking me in general. 30 seconds later my account is permanently banned. So gg Riot ill take my business elsewhere and will encourage my friends to do the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Phelas","date":"2017-07-25T14:07:05.681+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, because you surley got banned because of one game.\n\nStop fucking lying, there was a two week ban prior, or you're just extremley toxic anyways and skipped the two weeks and went straight to perma.","replies":[{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-07-25T14:09:12.559+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea, they aren't going to ban for 1 afk.
