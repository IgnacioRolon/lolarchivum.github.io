I could use my abilities and autos but they came from no model. I could also go into a fog of war and not get a vision of anything hit some jungle creeps and they would agro for a second and then have no idea what to attack. The only things that could hit me were the bot in the game, dragons, turrets, rift herald and Barron. Even death didn&#039;t solve the problem. \r\n\r\nNot gonna lie it was kinda fun but wouldn&#039;t want it in a real game so just thought I should mention it.{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-09-19T17:51:20.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The practice tool is notorious for odd behavior. ;-; I think having you disconnect may be part of the issue here. I can poke around and make sure it's something that's just happening in the practice tool and not a real game.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[{"poster":"StainedViolett","date":"2017-09-21T09:11:53.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you so much ^^. as long as it doesn't happen in a real game its all good lol. was really fun tho running around like that{{sticker:sg-kiko}} ","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-09T22:00:12.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Practice tool works in mysterious ways. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}
