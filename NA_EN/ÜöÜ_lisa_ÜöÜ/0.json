Not only do I not like it, but she looks anorexic, plain and simple. And it&#039;s not just me who things that, people on different boards and forms online have commented on that Janna&#039;s splash art is an offensive incorrect depiction of the female anatomy. \nWhen I&#039;ve shown Janna&#039;s splash-art to random people, some who play League of Legends others who don&#039;t, and asked them to list 3 things about the splash art, almost all of them has commented that she looks too skinny or straight up anorexic. \n\nThese are Janna&#039;s main splash-arts over the years.\nNow tell me, which one do you like the most?\nhttp://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1413399611983/jannapsd.jpg\n\nIn Janna&#039;s most recent main splash-art: she has a really skinny neck, bony stomach and humongous tights. \n\nI get Riot wanted to do a mixture with her original artwork and one with her second artwork to show off Janna is both beautiful yet airy and mysterious.\nBut if they were going to do that, why not make the art concept look more like Tempest Janna, which looks better, is a powerful non-offensive splash-art, and fits her lore.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/n254a-VC8VQ/maxresdefault.jpg\n\n**My suggestion to Riot, and the creators who made Janna&#039;s new Slash Art is simply to please change it. It&#039;s offensive.\n**\n\nAlso I would like to tell everyone to please keep their comments civilized when discussing this. And I DID NOT make the .gif you see at the top of the post, that is simply a _\"rough\"_ suggestion.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-07-18T14:02:47.810+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Downvoted because the gif makes her boobs larger, flat is justice.\n\nJk, but honestly I don't see what you are complaining about. Yes, she is very thin, that makes sense for an air user, not to mention she isn't human so she shouldn't be compared to the anatomy of a human. Besides that who says champions cant be unhealthy? Having a problem like that would actually make the character more flawed and deep. \n\nBesides, if you keep forcing things to go towards whatever is \"healthy\" then you won't be able to go to any extremes with design and you will effectively put yourself in an artistic box where you have to make everything at least similar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2017-07-18T13:52:58.842+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's not a human so human standards of thin or fat don't really apply to her. Your objections are as absurd as someone saying poppy is too fat and they should make her skinnier. Different species have different body types and what may be unhealthy for a human could be perfectly normal for a different fantasy race.","replies":[]}]}
