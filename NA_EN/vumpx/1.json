We're striving to create more skins in various tiers, so more players have an opportunity to grab a skin for a champion they enjoy, since not everyone can (or wants to!) spend a decent amount of money on a skin when they simply want a new outfit.","replies":[{"poster":"VuMpX","date":"2015-02-05T21:41:32.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So even if a Lot of people voted you wouldnt consider changeing?\nIf that is so i think it would be better if you let the community decide with Votes how much upcomeing skins will be.\nI think that would be a huge improvement since then the community would play a far better role in upcomeing skins.\nI will still buy Inquisitor nautilus but im just saying i would pay 1350 for it if it had new particles.\nJust sayin","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-02-05T22:30:54.073+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude.\nnot even with 10'000 votes a change like that would be acceptable; the order of players all over the world is *millions*, and this is nothing but your desire ( or of few cherry-picked ones like you, that exist with no doubt).\n\nThe player base actively asked for cheaper skin sets, this is it. I can understand how such cool concepts can' t be developed fully because of that, but understand that there is other people out there and this is designed for them.\n\nIf this is not enough think system wise: it' s not like developers and artists roam freely at riot, they have schedules and resource management behind that, projects, budgets... they can' t just change mind and completely overhaul a budget target for this, especially at this development time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-02-05T22:01:15.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That idea is fine and all, but maybe you should consider what a 750 skin should be ***thematically *** as well as how much work goes into it in the future.

Also they made some changes to Nautilus, so people aren't seeing why the same can't be done to Ashe. Then you have people who keep comparing her to other skins at the same or cheaper price despite not realizing that those skins were designed under a different method than today.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2015-02-06T00:09:24.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but in Nautilus's case, the change made was to his anchor, was it not? Something which visibly shows up on his model and thus HAS to be changed or else it'd just look weird as all hell.\n\nWhereas Ashe's arrows are just... arrows. Arrows with ice magic attached to them. So they look like magic ice arrows same as usual. I honestly can't see the validity of the complaints save for people in general never being satisfied and always wanting more. And of course, if they actually got what they wanted and got new particle effects, they'd be on here complaining about why the skin costs so much and why it can't be cheaper instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-02-06T00:29:17.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's not as if they haven't change arrow particles before, the issue is that it's a 750 skin.
