To get to the point, I read the chat restriction rules, but for some reason my brain can't comprehend wether I'm legible for season rewards or not. The page describing chat restrictions claims \"so the most negative players with chat restrictions at the end of the season will be ineligible to earn ranked end of season rewards such as the loading screen borders or the Victorious champion skin\", so does this mean only the most negative players who have had multiple chat restrictions can't get season rewards, or all players who were chat restricted cannot get the rewards? Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T00:01:27.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll be *ineligible* for ranked rewards if you have an **active** chat restriction when the season ends, which is on **November 7th at 23:59 PDT**.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
