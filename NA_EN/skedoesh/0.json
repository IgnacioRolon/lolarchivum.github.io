It seems to happen on certain actions ingame, like first blood, first tower etc. It stays hung up like this for everything from half a second to a couple seconds. It really messes up the gameplay. I also have smaller FPS drops, all the time.  It always happens when nexus gets destroyed, at that point it hangs up for a couple seconds. My video drivers are up to date, and my comp is more than able to run League. It usually is at 144FPS during startup, but then it drops to the low hundreds when I walk to lane. After that it goes up and down all game long. \r\n\r\nIn my logs/Game - R3d logs/ I have a ton of logs, ranging from 20kb to 700kb filled with a lot of errors and stuff. I tried repairing the client multiple times, but it still gives the same errors. No idea what to do anymore, it's pretty unplayable in this state.\r\n\r\nCPU : 4790K,\r\nRAM : 16GB,\r\nGPU: Asus Strix 1080,\r\nMOBO : Asus Maximus Hero VII.\r\n\r\nIt seems i'm unable to add the log files to this post, so i'll share one from my dropbox instead. Hopefully it can shed some light on the problem. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/5eea7bkkcs6zudd/2017-04-26T19-10-47_r3dlog.txt?dl=0","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-26T20:16:59.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strange to hear the issue is still happening despite repatching and updating your drivers.

Yeah, pretty stumped at this issue myself. I can play Dark Souls 3, For Honor, Skyrim with tons of mods and The Witcher 3 at full graphics with a decently stable framerate. Somehow league is bringing my comp to it's knees and I just don't get it. With all the errors I have in the \"R3d logs\" txt files I am amazed that the game is even running at all. Seems like I am missing a ton of files, but repairing client gives me a everything was fine message and nothing gets downloaded. Ingame the textures are fine though, some small glitches every 20 ish games or so, but nothing gamebreaking.","replies":[]}]}]}
