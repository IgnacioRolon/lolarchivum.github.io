A few years ago my main account was banned due to semi-toxic behavior mostly banter, some toxicity. It was a sad time because of all of the skins, ranks, and champions I collected. I understood that their decision was not reversible and I gave up on trying to get another chance. \n\nI recently ran across a forum discussion (https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/4AE9RKcR-riot-unbanning-permabanned-accounts) where a player posted about his account being unbanned from a permanent suspension, another 'shot' if you will. I said \"wow\" maybe they are considering unbanning accounts and offering second chances. \n\nI submitted a ticket to player support to ask about and request a second chance. Two days later I was responded to by Cinquedea and the discussion will be shown at the bottom of this post. I wanted to reach out to the community and see if any of you were aware of this 'experiment' and where it was that we could 'apply' for it. \n\nI pointed it in another discussion that the rules to be banned have gotten far too strict. They hardly allow banter like many other online games (COD, WOW, Runescape, Fortnite, etc) and I hardly believe that this is due to make their community a better place. No other game would ban their player base this heavily and I now believe there is a conspiracy at play because of Riot knowing their game is highly addictive. A person who gets permanently banned does not simply quit, but spends countless dollars on other accounts, rp, etc. \n\nAnyways, enough my rant! Just wanted to see if anyone else was aware! I tried to ask more questions in the email, but was quickly shot down. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**My message to Riot:**\n\nHello,\n\nI am an old time league player who received a ban many moons ago. I have since reformed and I would be delighted to come back to the game and play. I am hoping for a second chance and the ban be lifted on my account so I can enjoy the game on my first ever account.\n\nI've done some research and saw that Riot is sometimes willing to lift the ban. https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/4AE9RKcR-riot-unbanning-permabanned-accounts\n\n**Response from Riot:**\n\nHey there Ancient Alien,\n\nThanks for reaching back out about this permanently suspended account. It's always great to see a player wanting to return to the rift and be a positive influence on the community after some time away. Unfortunately I do have some bad news for you here. Due to both the nature and the age of this suspension on your account we will not be able to remove or reduce it in any fashion even despite the time that has passed here. I can see the post you linked, which I believe is referencing an experiment we ran last year that has since run its course and is not still ongoing, and we will not be able to help you out here.\n\nI sincerely do believe in you to return to the rift and be a positive influence on the community, but unfortunately you will not be able to do so on this account due to the circumstances. I'm sorry I couldn't assist with this suspension but please do let me know if you have any other questions I could assist with.\n\n**My message to Riot:**\n\nCompletely biased and unfair I didn't get a shot at this experiment! Oh well! Thanks for letting me know. Nice to see that all players are =/=. \n\n**Response from Riot:**\n\nHey again Ancient Alien,\n\nI do understand your frustrations here, but you did not reach out to us during the short time-frame that this experiment ran, and we can't make special exceptions to extend it for other players as that'd hardly be fair to those not only who did meet the deadline to apply for it, or who didn't make it in before the end of the experiment like yourself. All players are held accountable to the same rules, and penalized based on the same parameters, and I can assure you this isn't a case of bias against you.\n\nI'm sorry for the circumstances here, but please let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n**My message to Riot:**\n\nWhere was the announcement or sign up? I was never invited. Completely unbiased and unfair. How come I didn't get a chance? \n\n**Response from Riot:**\n\nHey again Ancient Alien,\n\nThere wasn't any sort of official sign up or announcement because it was a small experiment and intended not to be a major deal, and it was only for a short period of time. We did not extend invitations out to all permanently suspended players.\n\nDid you have any other questions unrelated to this experiment, as you did not write in when it was ongoing, and it is no longer running, and as I have mentioned before us not reducing this penalty is not any form of bias against you. If you do not have any other questions that are unrelated to the removal of this suspension I'll be moving to close this ticket as I've made our stance here as clear as I can. Thanks again for reaching out!","replies":[]}
