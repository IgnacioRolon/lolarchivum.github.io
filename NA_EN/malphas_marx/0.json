Some of us had to spend **real money** on these things. It was the biggest pay-to-win aspect of this whole game as you needed more than the allotted three pages to function in more than one role, and while just removing them is a good idea to introduce new players; not compensating the ones who paid to play just feels miserly and just outright mean. We didn&#039;t pay for functionally useless cosmetics, we paid for things to **play the game** can you at least give use keys or chests? We probably weren&#039;t going to spend money on it anyway, so can you at least give us that if you&#039;re not going to refund us? We don&#039;t want another useless cosmetic we can only show one at a time. We want tangible, usable rewards for playing the game for so long!\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll even use Matt Castro&#039;s quote regarding the subject to express how I feel.\r\n&quot;If the new runes come out, and all we get is a summoner icon. I&#039;ll quit; I&#039;ll quit on the spot.&quot;","replies":[]}
