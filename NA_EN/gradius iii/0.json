Here’s how on a week by week basis. \n\n*_Some event missions remain unannounced as to when they will take place in-game, but the majority seem easy enough to complete when they do happen. As such, they’ll be listed as default tokens earned by the END of the completion table. These missions are: Watch LoL E-sports (50 tokens), and the secret mission[s] confirmed by Riot (40 tokens). So let’s start!_\n\nAs you probably already know, in order to get the kai’sa skin, you also need tokens from additional games based on performance. Some way, somehow, if you do everything perfectly, you will still need to get a net of 1,210 ADDITIONAL tokens (or 202 extra per “week”). \n\n**Week 1: Sept. 27 – Oct. 7 **\n-\tTokens from Missions: 40\n-\tTokens from winning one game (1st mission): 10\n-\tTokens from Purchase of Worlds 2018 Pass: 200\n-\t1st Win of Day (11 days): 165\n-\tPerformance Score tokens: 202 \n•\tTo be on track: **617**\n\n**Week 2: Oct 8. – Oct 14**\n-\tTokens from Missions: 40\n-\tPick’ems (group stage bracket): 10\n-\t1st Win of the Day (7 days): 105\n-\tPerformance Score tokens: 202\n•\tTo be on track: **974**\n\n**Week 3: Oct. 15 – Oct 21**\n-\tTokens from Missions: 40\n-\tPick’ems (Play-off stage bracket): 10\n-\t1st Win of the Day (7 days): 105\n-\tPerformance Score tokens: 202\n•\tTo be on track: **1,331**\n\n**Week 4: Oct. 22 – Oct 28**\n-\tTokens from Missions: 40\n-\tTokens From Tales from the Rift: 40\n-\t1st Win of the Day (7 days): 105\n-\tPerformance Score tokens: 202\n•\tTo be on track: **1,718**\n\n**Week 5: Oct. 29 – Nov. 4**\n-\tTokens from Missions: 40\n-\t1st Win of the Day (7 days): 105\n-\tPerformance Score tokens: 202\n•\tTo be on track: **2,065**\n\n**Week 6: Nov. 5 – Nov. 11**\n-\tTokens from Missions: 40\n-\t1st Win of the Day (7 days): 105\n-\tPerformance Score tokens: 202\n•\tTo be on track: **2,412**\n\n**Misc./Hidden Missions**\n•\tBonus tokens (Watch LoL E-sports and secret mission[s]): 90 tokens\n•\tTo Be on track: **2,502**\n\n\nSo how hard is it “REALLY” to get the extra tokens based on performance? Well, let’s assume you started a bit late and are taking up the task with 40 days left. 1,210/40 = 31 extra tokens per day. Let’s just say 8 tokens is the average per game you can gain (you can gauge how hard this is by yourself by looking at the table below)… it would be about 4 Summoner Rift games a day. So… roughly 2 hours of playing per day for 40 days. This also assumes you don’t want to spend the tokens on ANYTHING else. \n\n8 tokens on average would be like saying: you win 2 summoner's rift with at A- or higher and win 2 more with a B+ or below (so kind of optimistic, but it is in the ball park). But if the average was 6 tokens, then you win 2 summoner's rift with A- or higher and lose 2 with a B+ or below so that is only 1 extra game a day (not terrible). \n\n\n.................................................................................................................................................\n..........................Summoner's Rift...............ARAM, Twisted Treeline, Rotating Game Mode\t \nRating.........................Win......Loss.............Win........Loss......................................................\nS+, S, S-......................14............8...............10............6......................................................\nA+, A, A-......................10............6................5.............4......................................................\nB+ and below..............6.............3.................3.............1......................................................\n..................................................................................................................................................\n\nIf you had a job and could only play 1 game through Monday-Thursday... then on Friday THROUGH Sunday you would need to play 24 games to make up for your absence IF your average Performance score income was sitting around 8 tokens a game. \n\nHope this helps to anyone interested in the skin/battle pass,\n~~~ Gradius III\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAs a side note... are you excited for the new Kai'sa skin? Share your thoughts below!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n**UPDATE**\nAccording to this source: &lt; http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Missions >, you all have an additional week to achieve tokens with 40 tokens more being granted in missions.

Spread over the time period of a minimum of 3 weeks (possibly 4--- See my **UPDATE** section at the very bottom of the post), then assume 18 extra games per week. Basically, you'd have to play an extra game a day than what I already recommended above to be \"safely\" on track.\n\nMy update section simply lists a URL that suggests that Riot will extend the period to earn tokens with the after party event... in which case you have an extra week to gain tokens and are only a few games behind IF THAT IS THE CASE. This post is meant to be on the side of caution as opposed to cutting things close. \n\nIf you don't make it but have around 2k tokens but no money for RP?
