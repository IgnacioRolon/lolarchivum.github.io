I do not however think anyone else on my team should make me lose control of my champion.  I didn&#039;t like Kalista&#039;s ult for that reason and I think Tahm Kench is even worse.  Losing control of my own champion is just annoying.  I&#039;m sure the pros will find all kinds of interesting ways to use these abilities to their advantage, but meanwhile 99% of the players will get aggravated.  It brings on a whole other level of trolling when I&#039;m sitting there trying to recall to get back to base quickly to buy so I can return to lane just to have Tahm Kench walk up and eat me.  Stop taking away my ability to control my own character.  It&#039;s not fun.","replies":[]}
