It happened to a lot of people upgrading from Windows 8, to Windows 8.1 as well when using an nVidia graphics card (stock or after market). The driver updates during the install process and the card by default gets enabled to force stereoscopic 3D when playing games. I had the same thing happen to me a few years ago.
