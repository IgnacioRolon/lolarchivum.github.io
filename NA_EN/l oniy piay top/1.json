Roast me all you want; that won&#039;t stop my love &lt;3\n\nEDIT-\n\nHere's a logical argument for skeptics:\n\nNothing is good, and nothing is bad; furthermore, no one is good, and no one is bad. When person A calls person B a \"bad\" person, they really mean that person B fails to satisfy some subjective guidelines arbitrarily set by person A (A similar statement can be made for \"good\" people).\n\nAll judgment comes after an individual interprets something through their own subjective mind. Therefore, no absolutely good or bad thing can exist.\n\nEDITx2-\n\nFor this reason, I always attempt to see a person as their whole self, so that I can understand things from their perspective as well as possible. Most people merely glance at the surface and then instantly label someone as \"good\" or \"bad\" in order to avoid conflict, but I extremely dislike that. Everyone deserves a chance at sympathy; not giving them that seems unkind.\n\nEDITx3-\n\nAll of you are completely disregarding everything that I say and blindly sticking to the popular opinion. Please at least attempt to listen to me instead of forcing your opinions on me with unfounded pity. I'm entirely fine; I'm just stating my mind. If you disagree with me, that's fine too. Just don't pretend to know better than me without even attempting to back up your ideas.","replies":[]}
