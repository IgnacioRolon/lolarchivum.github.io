His leap range isn't enough to jump from midlane bush to midlane champs, nor minions.\r\nWhen he is taking Blue Buff, i would like him to jump from Blue buffs bush to gromp, to generate stacks and move and clear faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also been askin', will he be OP then?\r\nWell I can certainly say NO.\r\nBcs of champs like Hecarim, Rammus, Sejuani, Evelynn, That make ganks so easier.\r\n\r\nIt's very hard to gank as Rengar without his R, and he is just very bad at it.\r\n He has no dashes, and the only way to gank better is to bait someone to the bush and then you jump on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPls Rito, consider it, just test it and you will see, it's a small change but with BIG IMPACT!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-01T23:12:12.715+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy April Fool's Day to you, too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NaughtyWord","date":"2019-04-01T23:21:50.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:107}} needs a buff in the same way I need carbon dioxide.","replies":[{"poster":"12345kerim12345","date":"2019-04-02T13:38:43.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He DOESNT NEED A BUFF THAT WILL INCREASE HIS DAMAGE!!!\nI am saying that, in case Rito wants rengar to be a normal champ he should increase his leap range.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"cars3n","date":"2019-04-01T23:25:35.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could jump half a lane that’s just broken.
