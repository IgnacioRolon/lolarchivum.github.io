Instead of him leaving and remaking, he decided to ruin the game for all of us \r\n(08:22:32 PM) Player Support Bot: Hey! We&rsquo;re getting a ton of new chats right now. It may take upwards of 30 minutes to get to your chat, but if you sit tight we&rsquo;ll help you out as soon as we can.

In these cases, playing to the best of your ability is what you can do in the moment, and sometimes that can end up in a win. \r\n(08:27:49 PM) MileyStayTwerkin: we have no smite \r\n(08:27:50 PM) Gunny: It&#039;s our goal with the penalties we give for players to realize that this sort of thing isn&#039;t okay. \r\n(08:28:04 PM) Gunny: So that it stops happening. \r\n(08:28:08 PM) MileyStayTwerkin: we lose every dragon \r\n(08:28:10 PM) MileyStayTwerkin: baron \r\n(08:28:12 PM) MileyStayTwerkin: no ganks \r\n(08:28:32 PM) Gunny: I can&#039;t really change what has already happened, but we can work together to help prevent it in the future.

Another option is intelligent conversation.\n\nYou did not get punished for talking, you got punished for running your mouth like a 15-year-old who cant control their ego-erection yet.\n\nAlso hilarious how you randomly accuse people of being liberals, like it is some sort of insult. Being intelligent and not tolerating trash does not require being liberal, although i understand it is a handy excuse for cultist and incel rejects - must be politics, not just people disliking you for your attitude and behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MileyStayTwerkin","date":"2018-06-27T20:54:55.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Definitely can tell you are a liberal","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-06-26T04:47:34.609+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing mostly negative chat in your logs.
