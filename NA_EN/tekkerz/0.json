Also Pool Party Ziggs is $10 of RP! Less then some other pool parties like lee sin, but lee still gets a badass recall, so why cant ziggs too. Overall i am very disappointed with this skin and adding a custom backing whould make it a lot better! \r\n{{champion:115}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:115}}","replies":[{"poster":"Morrofox","date":"2015-04-08T12:50:05.178+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf IS this?
