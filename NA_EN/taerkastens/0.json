My computer starts up league fine, but when I first start a game it tends to lag out fps horribly whenever someone does something significant in the game (eg. first kill, my first death, first abilities... etc...) This usually happens until 20 minutes or so into the game.\r\n\r\nRecently my FPS has dropped to an average of about 10 from 55-60 average. It was after the last small \"bug\" patch I'm assuming was what my client did today. I am not sure why but my computer is finding league to be near unplayable where before this it was much smoother.\r\n\r\nI can say that when I switch tabs and then reload the league tab my game runs at about 60 fps for 10 or so seconds. During this time my game seems to run faster and smoother than I've ever seen it. However, after that it goes all the way down to 10 fps and I'm having a bad time again.\r\n\r\nPlease Help, Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T02:19:31.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low or deteriorating FPS issues are usually caused by specific display driver or windows power setting problems.
