I contacted my isp and my connection to their server is perfectly fine. Does that mean riot's server is at fault? not the smartest guy in this area and would appreciate an explanation and solution as well if possible. Just in case people say 60 ping its fine, its actually not when ur so used to 30 ping for 2 years+","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-11-03T21:33:36.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you get this problem solved?

I also checked the internet speed with and without the ethernet and I see a resounding 20-30 mbps increase with the ethernet! Hopefully this will fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"xPlus","date":"2016-07-23T08:25:53.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unfortunately no, im using ehternet all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T18:29:48.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A consistent high ping like this can be for a few reasons, but the sudden change might indicate a change in your ISP's routing taking a long way to our servers.
