{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-07-25T04:15:46.801+0000","title":"[Champion Concept] Lyon:  The Patriarchate of Zaun","subforum":"Community Creations","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Appearance:**  Bears a strong resemblance to [Dr. Caulder](http://www.gamehiker.com/wiki/images/1/1c/Caulderface.jpg)  from Advance Wars:  Days of Ruin.  There is a very simple reason behind this: {{champion:222}}.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nLyon is a burst support assassin.  He specializes in reducing the healing and defensive capabilities of other supports to better secure his own ADC's kills.\n\n**Strengths and Goodpicks**\n\nLyon's abilities infect targets with a disease that can be detonated by his own basic attacks to do a large percentage of a target's maximum health as physical damage, allowing him to easily burst down even the tankiest of opponents.  He is particularly strong against healing supports and supports and carries with on hit abilities due to his abilities' heal reductions and the ability to turn enemies against each other.\n\n*Works Well With:*\n\n{{champion:222}} Lyon and Jinx are a terrifying bot lane.  Lyon's ultimate completely cancels all healing, as well as dealing true damage over time, allowing Jinx to easily execute her targets with her Super Mega Death Rocket!  In addition, Lyon's neurotoxin allows Jinx to easily land her Flame Chompers! to root enemies and burst down opponents.\n\n{{champion:21}} Miss Fortune's heal reduction on her impure shots can easily nullify almost all healing bottom lane.  The stacking magic damage can easily burst down champions afflicted with Lyon's bio-weapons, and Lyon's neurotoxin can easily set up an easy hit for Miss Fortune's Bullet Time.\n\n*Excels Against:*\n\n{{champion:201}} While Braum's Unbreakable can prevent his carries from being infected with Lyon's bio-weapons, he will be infected himself, allowing Lyon to use Braum's own passive against the carry he's attempting to protect.  Lyon's passive, Q, and ultimate will also remove his impressive healing and resistances, and burst him down quickly.\n\n{{champion:16}} Soraka's heals are greatly reduced laning against Lyon, and Lyon's ultimate completely counters Soraka's on one champion.\n\n**Weaknesses and Counterpicks**\n\nLyon has  no escapes outside of his ultimate and no immobilize removal.  Auto attacking Lyon while his heal is active will completely nullify it's healing, making him vulnerable to poke support mages.  \n\n*Struggles against:*  \n\n{{champion:25}} Morgana is Lyon's hard counter.  Her Dark Binding and Black Sheild will completely nullify almost all of Lyon's abilities, preventing Lyon's Neurotoxin from forcing the carry to attack her.\n\n{{champion:43}}  Karma 's  displacement abilities will allow her to easily lock down Lyon, and her shields ignore the heal reduction.\n****\n**Stats:** \n\nHealth:  437 (+89 per level)\nAttack Damage:\t48 (+3.6 per level)\nHealth Regeneration:\t5.5 (+0.6 per level)\nAttack Speed:\t0.644 (+2.9% per level)\nMana: 220 (+55 per level)\nMana Regeneration:\t7.5 (+0.65 per level)\nArmor: 19 (+3.3 per level)\nMagic Resistance:\t30 (+0 per level)\nRange:\t475 (Ranged)\t\nMovement Speed:\t335\n\n*Primary:* Support\n*Secondary:* Assassin\n\nAttack Power: 6\nDefense Power: 3\nAbility Power:  9\nDifficulty:  7\n****\n**Abilities:**\n\n*Passive* Fascinated by Death\n\nLyon's bio-weapons will be expunged immediately if Lyon autoattacks an afflicted enemy.  If Lyon's target is afflicted by two or more bio-weapons, they will take an additional 10% of their maximum health as physical damage.  This increases by 5% per additional bio-weapon expunged.\n\nIf a target dies with one of his bio-weapons still inside, it will mutate, permanently increasing the duration of the time it is dormant in an enemy champion by one second.\n\n**Q** Autoimmune Virus: *Mana Cost:  50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 Cooldown:  12*\n\nLyon's next auto-attack will gain 375 range, will penetrate all units up to that point, and deal an additional 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 (+100% bonus AD) physical damage, and reduce the afflicted targets' armor by 15 / 17.5 / 20 / 22.5 / 25% and slows them for twice the amount for 3 seconds.  Subsequent enemies will take 15% reduced damage down to a minimum of 45% reduced damage, but the armor shred and slow will remain unchanged.  The virus remains dormant in afflicted enemies for 4 seconds after the effects expire.\n\n**W** Patient Zero: *Mana Cost: 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 / 120 Cooldown:   20  Range:  175*\n\nLyon vaccinates himself or an allied champion from his bio-weapons, granting 15 / 17.5 / 20 / 22.5 / 25% tenacity and healing for 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 (+1% per 100 AP) of a champion's maximum health over 5 seconds.  Champion damage will cancel out the healing, but also apply the \"unvaccinated\" debuff to the champion that attacked, and all units within 200 range of the \"Patient Zero\", applying grievous wounds and reducing their magic resistance by 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20%.  The virus remains dormant within afflicted enemies for 4 seconds after the effects expire.\n\n**E** Neurotoxin: *Mana Cost:  70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90 Cooldown: 18 Range:  650 Width:  60*\n\nAfter channeling for 1 second, Lyon sprays a neurotoxin that drives enemy champions insane, dealing 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 (+25% AP) magic damage to enemies in a line and causing enemy champions to attack each other for 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 / 2.25 seconds.  If there is no nearby champions, the affected champion will attack their minions or neutral monsters.  If neither minions nor champions are present, they will instead run in fear of Lyon.  The toxin remains dormant within afflicted enemies for 4 seconds after the effects expire.\n\n**R** Pandemic *Mana Cost:  100 Cooldown:  120 / 110 / 100 Range:  800*\n*Passive*:  All abilities will remain dormant in enemies for an additional 2 / 4 / 6 seconds.\n*Active*:  Lyon chases down an enemy champion and injects them with his most powerful bio-weapon, suppressing them for 1 second after reaching them, then vaulting off the champion, knocking Lyon and his target back Lyon's movement speed.  For the next 5 seconds, the afflicted enemy will take 100 / 250 / 400 (+33% AP) true damage over 5 seconds and has 100% reduced healing.  If the enemy champion dies with the bio-weapon sill active, the champion will explode, resetting the duration and spreading the disease to all enemies within 550 range of the champion.  The weapon remains dormant within afflicted enemies for 4 seconds after the effects expire.\n****\n\n**Lore:**\n\nWhile most see Zaun as a city of science and technology run amok to the detriment of its citizens, their Mayor, Arnaud Lyon sees it as a paradise.  While  his duties are to run Zaun, his true passion is his terrible scientific research.  By usurping Zaun's leadership, he repealed most of the laws in place to allow him complete freedom to perform his terrible experiments for the sole reason satisfy his own curiosity.\n\nBorn with an IQ of 250, Arnaud Lyon is one of the brightest minds in Runeterra.  By age 1 he had already learned how to walk and talk with a first grade vocabulary.  By the time he was 3, he was already conducting scientific experiments on Zaun's household animals with his childhood friend Edumundo {{champion:36}}.  While his parents were unnerved about his lax morality, they were impressed with his intellect was immediately put in elementary school, his parents hoping the teachers could teach him morality better than they could.  He graduated elementary school without incedents and skipped middle school entirely.  He graduated from his high school with honors at age 13, well before he hit puberty, and by the time he turned 21, he had already completed his first doctorate.  While he was universally adored by his hometown, Lyon still had not sated his vast curiosity, and left for Piltover to study under the prestigious Cecil B. Heimerdinger {{champion:74}}.\n\nHeimerdinger was extremely impressed with Lyon's massive intellect, instantly allowing him to teach at the Yordle Academy after he instantly reworked Heimerdinger's CH-2 electron battery into a stun grenade.  The first and only human professor there, he was renowned for his extremely successful genetic engineering and  cloning research, which had inadvertently led to the birth of his daughter  {{champion:222}}.  As years went on however, fellow Yordle professors grew concerned of his philosophy of progress over ethics when he had accidentally turned a student into a chicken, and instead of researching on how to change him back, he refused so that he could conduct a psychological case study on how the parents would react.  He was finally expelled from the academy for ethical reasons after he accidentally killed a student by incorrectly coding her genes, and brought her back to life with necromancy, which was heavily frowned upon in the City of Progress.  Furious, Lyon captured the Yordle professors responsible for his removal from the academy via Zaunite agents, and proceeded to use them for his most gruesome experiments.  His plans were foiled by Ziggs, the Hexplosives Expert, who had broken into the prison Lyon owned, and freed them.  The hexplosives Ziggs used in the assault had left Lyon permanently disfigured in his face. To add insult to injury, he was charged with corruption by Zaun's government, and exiled to Piltover, where Caitlyn and Vi had then promptly charged him with kidnapping, murder, and jaywalking.  Lyon was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in Piltover.\n\nLyon had only spent one day in prison when his daughter began destroying the city.  After ransacking Piltover's Treasury and plunging the city into darkness, she broke her father out; no trace of them remained but the echoes of  their laughter.  By the time they returned to Zaun, Lyon had already plotted his revenge upon the Zaunite government.  Forming an alliance Dr. Mundo, Singed, Viktor, and Warwick, Lyon's insurgents had seized Zaun in less than a day, and Lyon installed himself as Mayor. Lyon rallied the Zaunite people under the guise of freedom and progress, and eventually turned his sights to the League of Legends, where he could have a battle of the wits and terrible weapons and conduct his horrible experiments with impunity.\n\n\"City of Progress?

Assassins are suppose in most senses to be a hard carry and snowballer who takes most of the kills and deals massive damage from that, but with very little teamwide utility to compensate this damage. Suppports are just as they are named. A character who gives support to the other champions by giving up kills and cs to the carrys and have kits to give the carries buffs/ debuff champions and a better chance of killing someone or escaping while dealing very little damage themselves. To give a single champion both is pretty OP. Maybe make him a mid laner? So you can keep most of the damage, but tone it down a bit and remove most of the shred/CC. Or tone down the damage and keep the shred and utility so he can be more balanced as a support primarily?  Overall I see his kit being very mid lane centric and kinda like warwick and kassadin where hes very easily poked and kited early until he grabs his ult and then gets crazy good engages.  Im assuming on his ult he jumps at his target to do the suppression? Otherwise im not sure how he would effectively get it off without dieing instantly. Its up to you how you go with this concept and I do like the kit. Just needs some tweaks to give him a legit identity that isnt too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-07-25T13:54:22.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm trying to make the guy not scale well damage wise.  He isn't meant to be a huge damage assassin, he's meant to be high utility in terms of shredding armor and crowd control over huge amounts of burst damage.  His passive is far too unreliable to chunk enemies health constantly due to the sizable cooldowns of his abilities.  I want this guy built with CDR, not huge AP or AD.  As for your assertion for support assassins, while probably not going to be metagame anytime soon, I'll point you to everyone's least favorite pussycat pre 4.10 on who would fall under the \"support assassin\" role {{champion:76}}.  Kassadin support was also a thing before his rework took the silence out.  I wanted to add something to the game that hasn't been really successfully implemented in its idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Goldenelk598","date":"2014-07-25T14:41:44.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True nidalee can be along the lines of a support/assassin(although with the nerfs to her q now its certainly less viable since she needs items to help her damage more now), but that was mostly due to her amazing healing ability and her traps for warding. As for kassadin support riot did make that change by taking away the silence as you pointed out which makes me think they are not too fond of the support assassin idea as well as that silence was incredibly stupid and OP for his engage ability. So your saying that early on his damage will be high and then fall off late game? Thats an idea, but an example in which that wasnt too highly looked upon is braums passive. It was extremely strong and high on damage early and riot has seen to it to reduce that over the last couple patches. Idk again this is your concept im just not sure how that early damage will be seen since it could snowball the lane early.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-07-27T02:56:49.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well a popular (but dumb imo) support pick is Blitzcrank, at least, people play him as a relatively valuable support in terms of the fact that he can snowball the lane.  As for Braum doing damage, the difference between Braum and Lyon is that Braum is a tank, and Lyon is not.  He's beefier than most assassins, but he also doesn't have any hard engage, nor any escape options outside of his ultimate.  Braum has hard engage, and the ability to block projectiles, because he's meant to tank.  Giving damage on top of his disruptive abilities would bloat his kit.  Lyon's abilities, specifically his  Q, has high early damage because early game armor shred is remarkably unhelpful.  He's ment to sort of be like a support karma.  High early damage and disruption to later utility.  Maybe it's not what Riot is looking for, but I'm trying to make a non meta champion that's unique and not all about movement, but about what he can bring to team fights.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hi Im Dude","date":"2014-07-25T06:05:28.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the whole idea behind supports is that they don't have high burst but have more of a utility based kit to better aid there laning partner for easier kills hranted to them and to provide means of escape if an ally gets caught. From what I'm reading, if I'm reading it right, this guy has a super super broken kit with too much aid to allies. His passive stack with each hit and  deals back percentage health, His Q deals a certain amount of damage and has 100% ad scaling, his W grants tenacity and heals percentage health back while afflicting those around them (Alistar has this same concept but does not afflict enemies with grievous wounds), his E is a fear that makes an enemy champion attack another while having high burst to it, and finally if your caught by all of these abilities and you manage to live, he has ult that deals true damage with ap scaling (not dealing magic damage as well over time but counted as true damage)and there's no way to heal back from it because it reduces healing effects by 100%.

Partially my bad for making a typo on his Q, but I also put this on here for feedback.  I'll knock down the base damages on his Q and R because those I was uncertain of (and meant to put 100% BONUS AD, not fully 100% AD, that's just crazy.)  My entire concept for this champion was a support that reduces the defenses of enemies, and his signature move being an ability that causes enemies to attack each other.  Somewhat ironically, after I came up with the idea, Smite released their new god, [Serqet](http://www.hirezstudios.com/smite/latest-news/view/smite-blog/2014/07/15/new-in-smite-serqet---goddess-of-venom), which totally stole the \"taunting allies\" aspect of the kit from me, and also gave me ideas for how to implement Lyon's abilities.  And if you bother to click the link, Serqet is WAAAAY more powerful than Lyon is, and she isn't OP in practice either, despite having 2 dashes, invisibility, and being primarily built for damage.  It was my complete intention that Lyon is a primary support, not assassin, much like Sona is primarily a support that can be built as an AP burst caster mid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2014-07-25T15:01:56.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So he actually looks pretty good BUT he does have a few problems. First, I feel like his Q shouldn't scale with Bonus AD since he is mostly AP.

Just gotta make it fit with what he's building since you really don't want mixed scalings as they rarely go well.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2014-07-25T15:02:11.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also his grievous wound is somewhat unreliable.

Seriously, a passive that does percent health damage? What does that bring to your lane partner if you're meant to be keeping them safe to farm and grab kills? A full 20% of their HP gone in an instant if you've used all four abilities used on them is just too much on top of what they do individually. That's too much poke, your opponent would be able to do nothing come level 3. Making your abilities remain dormant in a target for longer would be fine if they die while afflicted-though I just don't see how you'd get that to work if you weren't supporting.\n\nHis Q is fine in concept, maybe tone down the exact numbers on the debuffs...oh, and remove the damage from it. No bonus AD at all. The armour shred and super slow more than make up for it, have that scale down with more targets hit instead. The range on it is also comparable to Blitz grab, so maybe that should get shrunk as well?\n\nW? No Tenacity. Seriously, that stat is only raisable by 2 items and a single, 21 point mastery in normal games for a reason. Slow resist like Swiftness boots would be a better idea. I do like the risk/reward for cancelling the heal-either let the target get juiced back up, or keep them low and give yourself and your allies an MR shred. Cool idea.\n\nE...I don't know enough about the game on that one. I just have no idea how it would work in a real situation. Defer to someone with more experience on that.\n\nThe ultimate...oh man, the R. This has no use on a support at all. Scaling **true damage**? That completely nullifies **all** healing? Not gonna fly beyond the drawing board. Now, if it were magic damage, did Grievous Wounds instead of flat healing negate...reduce the base damage on it as well, you've got yourself a neat combo finisher! The carry follows up after scoring the first kill, and the next target(s) suddenly finds themselves weakened and crippled. But what does Suppressing the target for one second do? In fact, I'm not sure I understand the way it gets applied in the first place. Does he run faster? You mention MS. Does he leap to the target and push off them like Quinn? If so, why the Suppression on top of that? You also mention knockback. Is this ability a ranged push like Tristana's ult, or a knock up?\n\nThe lore screams Mary Sue. Not gonna lie, it really does. He's got a super special snowflake backstory(runs eerily close to Jayce/Viktor at times though), runs an entire city-state, is friends with nearly every Champion from said state even though most don't like each other, and contradicts existing lore for most of Piltover. This needs a re-write man.\n\nJokes/interactions/taunts, I do quite like. They're witty, they fit his personality and are legit funny. Keep most of these.\n\n\nAgain, this kit is almost purely magic assassin in its current form. Far too much damage in all stages of the game for a support-you'd be better off having this guy *be* the carry. So over all...it's a start. A good start, needing a lot of refinement. Just let that creative euphoria ebb off-believe me, I know how good it feels-and let your senses of 'what would it feel like to be on the receiving end of all this', 'how fun is this to play' and 'what new thing does this champion bring to the pool' come back.
