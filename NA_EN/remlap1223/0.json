I feel that Miss Fortune can sometimes end up being really crippled because the minions can blow a fuse and chase her into the jungle.  Garen gets his insane health regeneration immune to minion damage, which allows him to push minion waves with impunity, so i think the least we could do is cancel that out for Miss Fortune so that she can chase a fleeing Sivir better without that one purple minion just gutting her movement speed.  It'd allow Miss Fortune to better survive in lane, while still having champions like Twitch and Zyra to counter her.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2014-08-14T19:26:22.911+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"*(Not a champ designer or on the balance team, so this is just my opinion as a frequent MF player)*\n\n**TL;DR:** I think this would make her a lot stronger than it might seem at first.\n\nFirst, just some general thoughts on her passive:\n\nMovement speed is really, really powerful. Especially +70, which puts her at 395 without boots (that's faster than a Master Yi **with** Boots of Speed). This speed, combined with Q, allows her to bully lanes pretty hard early, so it's important to have it get knocked off in lane. That gives windows to fight her \"fairly\".\n\nTo the suggestion of preventing minion aggro from dropping it:\n\nIt's usually the caster minions that knock off the passive, since you're shooting Q through them to harass. And that's actually pretty important for gating her harass ability. If they didn't do this, you could harass with impunity, and then rush at them with ~400 MS with no downtime.\n\nShe would essentially have all of her current harass power, PLUS the ability to rush at you like Draven does. Only she'd rush at you with her auto->Q pattern*, and the ramping magic damage (and grievous wounds!) from Impure Shots.\n\nAs small of a change as that might seem to be, I really think that would put her over the top. If we made that, I'm afraid we'd have to trim some of her more obvious power. And at that point, I'm not even sure it's an overall improvement.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\\*To compare to Draven some more:\n\nAt level 3 (two points in Q), Draven's axe does (total AD + 55% total AD) damage, while Miss Fortune's auto->Q combo does (total AD + 85% total AD + 35) to the main target. That's a bit more damage up front, and probably evens out at around 2 or 3 autos. That's about what you'd expect to get from an early level all-in rush like this. Depends a bit on if Draven catches his axes (or has 2 before going in), but it's a similar level of all-in damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-08-14T20:13:31.782+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well despite whether or not you work in the balance department, I still appreciate Reds commenting.  MF is my main ADC, she was the first one I played (Ryze was my tutorial champion), and while you make very valid points, I still say that kiting Miss Fortune can do the same thing without RNGesus knocking you off your high horse because the purple minion decided to go Rambo on you.  Why not nerf Strut's movement speed by like say, 20 points, and allow her to charge forward past minion waves?  Draven already counters Miss Fortune, it would help her get back into a viable ADC choice, and Ashe suddenly just got a lot more viable as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-08-14T23:21:55.482+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rather than knocking back her passive's general MS bonus to let her keep it when she gets hit by minions I'd like to see minions disable her passive to 1/2 instead of knocking it up all the way.

Additionally, it gives MF a strong ability to position her ultimate as a late game teamfight starts. Making it a harass/bully tool as well might be too much.\n\nAs others have brought up, you could dilute the power of Strut to make it less overbearing in a harass situation, but I almost like the clear, focused strengths of the skill now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AvariceSyn","date":"2014-08-14T23:24:35.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"MF is one of the strongest early game lane bullies. The only thing that keeps her from spamming (other than high mana costs) is her passive. To an MF player, not having your passive up feels like a 50% slow/cripple. You have to choose your harass wisely and be more tactical with double up to avoid taking minion aggro and losing that massive speed boost. She may not have mobility outside of that, but that's also what allows MF to still be a viable pick in the mobility meta.\n\nIf she didn't lose her passive from minion aggro, there's nothing to stop her from being the bottom lane monster I remember from S2.\n\nThink about all of the movement speed items they added to the game recently. Zephyr, revamped Phantom Dancer, revamped Shurelya's, boot enchantments, etc. It's extremely difficult to get away from a movement speed ADC (include ms quints and 3 or 5 boots with furor and kiss your ass goodbye).","replies":[]},{"poster":"God Of Avacyn","date":"2014-08-14T14:41:00.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"I think that garen is a tanky fighter, and if minions disabled his passive, he wouldnt be very good in engages, and miss fortune as a squishy adc.

I find MF's passive to be very helpful when it comes to simply getting to your lane. I don't roam that much unless I have a definite gank set up for mid.

Garen is different since top lane is about sustain and if he doesn't want his passive knocked, he almost has to self deny himself minions at the price. This isn't health regen.
