Once he comes into contact with his first target, he disappears from the map, striking up to five enemies, and reappearing behind the last target struck, dealing 25 / 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 (+ 100% AD)(+30% AP) physical damage and applying on hit effects.   Basic attacks and Meditate will reduce this ability&#039;s cooldown.\n\n>_If Focus is active, the ability will critically strike for an additional 60% (+40% {{item:3031}}) all enemies besides his target, and deal the Focused basic attack&#039;s AD physical damage to the first target struck, and reappear in front of his target.

While channeling, Master Yi reduces incoming damage by 90%, pauses Highlander&#039;s duration, reduces all of his cooldowns including Meditate&#039;s by one second per every second channeled.  Taking champion, epic monster, or turret damage will interrupt the channel.

During this time, Master Yi will also deal 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+25% bonus AD)(+30% AP) bonus magic damage on his auto attacks and regenerates 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 mana per attack.  \n\n> _Master Yi can cancel the ability at any time, refunding the mana cost by 10 for every second of the duration remaining._\n&gt; _Master Yi can reactivate the ability at no mana cost if he takes down an enemy champion while the ability is active within the next 3 seconds._\n&gt; _Master Yi can only gain Focus during this time if he casts Meditate._\n---------------------------------------\n\n> **R:  Omega Strike**\n\n> TARGET RANGE:  3340   COST:  100 MANA COOLDOWN:  125 / 105 / 85\n\n> **PASSIVE:**  Champion takedowns reduce the cooldown of Master Yi&#039;s non ultimate abilities by 50 / 75 / 100%.\n\n> **ACTIVE:**  Master Yi begins channeling for up to 3 seconds, gaining power and range as he channels.  Once he reactivates this ability, after 0.5 seconds, he dashes with such force that all enemies in the area are struck with supersonic force, dealing 150 / 200 / 250 (+40% AP) magic damage, up to a maximum of 450 / 600 / 750 (+120% AP) magic damage to all enemies struck, and stunning them for 1 - 2 / 1.25 - 2.25 / 1.5 - 2.5 seconds depending on the length of the channel.

There is no reason to take lock-on away from Yi's Alpha Strike, especially not when you literally replace his entire relevance to be dependent on RNG given the target he even dashes to is dictated by RNG in this design.\n\nPeople seem to like it for some reason, but I strongly disagree. No way in hell will I approve the end target of ANY dash to be almost completed dictated by RNG (there is a reason why despite Yi's hit during Alpha Strike while somewhat random, the end point is always the target he locks onto to cast the spell save for when the target dies before the dash animation is completed), let alone someone like Yi who has always have had his precision based gameplay based on his precise use and timing of Q on precise targets and to dodge things as well as go pass obstacles, now he can't.\n\nIf you don't even get the core idea of Yi, then you shouldn't even be talking about reworking him. Because you WILL miss the point entirely and create disasters. And it shows, because in this iteration, Yi is a gated AA champion with RNG mobility (that is never a good mobility to begin with, so it's straight up trash) and with the ultimate of his kit dedicated to him being a 1 shot AP assassin imitating that AP Yi absolutely no one is asking for (which also results in this supposed 3 second channel. Like, WHAT? Even if you were to use AP Yi, this is ridiculous. To put into some perspective, Karthus's ultimate that hits all enemy champions globally regardless of distance is a 3 second channel. You really might as well say that Yi doesn't have ulti in this design). Not to mention his core identity, refresh and true damage, are also gone. Why does this champ even exist in this form, if not just to suck ass and be absolutely useless in practice?\n\nNo.\n\n..........\n\nI don't play Wu to judge that part of the OP. But I know enough of Yi and SINCERELY believe this Yi's design is hot garbage.\n\n* Yi can not choose who and where he even dashes to, which is just ridiculous. \n* His AA is gated and doesn't scale well, and if anything it's only shifting him to be a CDR assassin which is completely missing the point of Yi. \n* This build requires Yi to spread his stat proprieties WAY too thin. No one has got time to focus both CDR, Arm Pen, AS, AD, Magic Pen, and AP all at the same time or be locked out of the vast majority of your own kit. This is just insane.\n* His core identity of on-kill refresh is gone. \n* His true damage is gone. \n* You're just shoving AP 1 shot Yi in here when literally no one is asking for its second coming. His ulti is completely unrelated to his intended build and even only uses secondary scaling than his recommended stats, and even then it also comes at a too much of a drawback to even use. Useless.\n\nThis Yi is absolutely useless, and his design can barely be called Yi.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2017-12-21T16:21:26.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Woah, pump the brakes there high speed.

Who the hell makes mobility/dashes/whatever based on RNG (unless you're CertainlyT who thought Zoe's W was such a great idea)? Not to mention, Yi has always been able to use it for situational escapes but never too big on escaping to begin with (he has never been about escaping to begin with, he's what it means to be high risk and high reward; not those fake \"\"\"high skill cap\"\"\" champs), this wouldn't help all that much besides completely killing his ability to even pick his own target with the sole exception of when there is only 1 target.\n\nAnd that is hardly the only complaint I've got in this design.

Damn. I... think he'd be pretty OP, as his burst would become powerful with Focus, while having great sustained damage :\nQ + auto + W auto-reset (reapply focus) is a burst of 500% AD (2 focused autos) which can crit (!) + 30% AP.\nand continue with Highlander.\n\nHOWEVER. I have huge issues with the kit.\n\nFirst off, his Q dashing on the last target can be a huge problem. You will end up in a place you definitely don't want to be because of a random badly placed minion. I suggest instead : last champion hit by the ability\n\nThen, why should R make you dash back to original location if you have focus? I see no utility for this, you wanna go in, not poke as Yi.\n\nFinally, Something I dislike : it has a LOT of small unnecessary (overloaded) stuff and in that way resembles a CertainlyT  kit => little weaknesses, hard to balance?\n\nI would remove the unnecessary stuff that takes powerbudget : \n\n-> Passive is fine\n\n-> Q is fine\n\n-> W is insanely powerful !!\n90% Damage Reduction during channel + up to 70% Damage Reduction for 1 to 5 second? That's insane ! A full meditate basically grants you an Alistar ult. Might be fine to have big damage reduction during it, but when you can auto afterwhile... these are extreme values.\n\nI feel 50/55/60/65/70% damage reduc during channel and 20/25/30/35/40% after would be more logical , and even quite powerful.\n\nOh wait it's interrupted by every single source of damage, not just CC? Well that sucks. Eh... I'm not sure I like it then. It becomes insanely situational. Like, wait in a bush hope the enemy comes close, meditate and then all in? (profiting all of the damage reduc?)\n\nIt retains the skill aspect of blocking powerful abilties and autoreseting, but feels kinda weird to just meditate through one autoattack/spell.\n\nCooldown reduction on spells for using it, I don't like it that much because once again it's hugely situational. Got a full meditate? Great. Got an instantly interrupted by basic auto meditate? Meeeeeh.\n\n-> E : does it remove slow on activation, right? Like Garen's Q? Then I'm not sure I like it. I think I'd rather have a % slow resistance. It feels weird cause it's your steroid, so you have to use it, but by using it you kind of remove your ability to cleanse slows, which kinda sucks.\nI love the fact the ratios allow for several buildpaths, and the magic damage is interesting. The mana gain per auto seems fun, but largely unnecessary and taking power budget for no real purpose.\n\n-> R well the automatic dash back to original location is kinda wtf as I said. It doesn't reaaally have any synergy with the kit tbh. It's kinda like a big poke tool, but with an ult cooldown. I mean, the charge time makes it so that you don't really wanna use it in fights.\n\nOr is the combo R+E (can you activate E during R channel?) so that Focus is disabled and you don't dash back? But you lose on the first autoattack focus burst. Eh I guess it's ok if you get R's damage off. I mean the dash back with missing health damage doesn't really work. Either it's a teamfight where ennemies are low, and they're not just gonna wait 3 s for you to ult them; or they're full life and it doesn't do anything.\n\nEdit : oh, another thing. Q making you untargetable once you hit a target after the dash completely removes Yi's ability to reactively dodge projectiles with it (you get hit before entering untargetability). I don't like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2017-12-21T11:52:27.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"About Wukong, Overall it looks good while keeping close to his current kit, but there are a few points I'd like to address.\n\nPassive-\nWould make things challenging to activate during the laning phase without using a decoy as he would need to hide in the bush to use it. I'd kind of rather see something that would reward Wukong for staying in the fight, a bit like {{champion:5}}'s new passive or Diana's. I personally like the idea of him gaining armor and mr from attacking an enemy champ with AA's or when dealing physical damage myself (likely the second one since that would be useful when he ults as well).\n\nCrushing Blow-\nI like it, but might be a bit like Panths Q in the sense that its an unavoidable attack, with the addition of armor breaking and a possible slow depending on the passive. It also sort of feels a bit like the Monkey King from Dota, where although its a skill shot, is an AOE and stuns enemies hit, with the Wukong from Smite working in a similar way (although the slow on a is a spin attack around him.)\n\nDecoy- \nI'm not to sure about keeping the AP scaling on his decoy while giving it true damage. It could lead to Wukong building AP just to cheese the damage from it and while it would make the ability more useful, it would still have an issue with not being very effective against ranged champs as they would be able to stand a safe distance away from the Decoy. \nAlso I'm not sure about making it the ability that doesn't scale in cost while making his Q scale instead. currently I feel that part of Wukong's mastery is knowing when to use his decoy and making good use of pressing the S button instead to fake a decoy and this change would make it less useful to fake a decoy instead of actually using a decoy.\n\nNimbus Strike-\nPretty good, but I sort of feel like it would be more effective if Wukong actually spawned a pair of very weak, short lived decoys to throw off the enemy on top of being able to switch targets. that way its harder to guess what target he is actually after.\n\nCyclone- \nPretty good, Wukong did need less power focused on his Ult and reducing the range of his Ult and damage increase certainly would work. I'd kind of would like to see his Ult have a way to focus on a single target more, a bit like {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} and {{champion:254}}'s ults do, but since that would change what is essentially Wukong's bread and butter ability, this change seems to be  the best of both worlds, being better focused on a single target, while keeping other champs at bay via a knock up to prolong them being able to effectively assist them.\n\nOverall, I think its a good direction, but could use some changes here and there. It's a good modernization of his kit and I believe could even give unique and healthy play styles for both Assassin and Diver(/bruiser) Wukong players by having them focus on two different aspects of his kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Christ Superstar","date":"2017-12-21T08:53:29.748+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will certainly make them less binary - though, number will need tuning. ;)\n\nTake my upvote!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fedoran","date":"2017-12-21T05:55:20.842+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, just a tip, but this is a LOT to read, and I think it would serve you better to format a suggestion like this differently.\n\n_Many_ people on the boards frankly don't have the time to read so much information from just ONE post and ONE suggestion.\n\nI would suggest:\n\n-Added spacing to make it easier on the eyes\n\n-Use of bolds/italics more actively to create, specifically, **contrast** in the text and draw attention to important values (Note that CAPSLOCK is only acceptable in the middle of a lowercase block of text, because it is very noticeable compared to the other case, use BOLD for titles)\n\n-Include TLDR ---> now this I have trouble doing myself but can help for those who still can't be bothered\n\n-Have mini TLDRs for each ability (in the instance of this suggestion) so people can quickly understand what it does before reading values\n\n-Similarly to use of spacing, be sure to just add different little bits like bullet points or arrows, etc, to make the writing less boring and better structured.\n\n-Unless you are using someone else's writing (in which case they should be credited) or unoriginal/previously mentioned (like you talking in a different post) writing, don't use the quote boxes!
