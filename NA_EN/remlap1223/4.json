It just will not function half the time.  It is basically an overload with a really short range most of the time.  I know for a fact it&#039;s not jumping to enemies, but it also might not be shredding MR.  Recommend that a red looks into this.\n\nEdit:  Also, I think the range is bugged too.  I've been able to successfully auto attack an enemy, but unable to hit his E, despite it suppposed to have 50 more range.  It doesn't feel like it's at 600, it feels like it's at 500.  Either that or it's bugging his auto attack's range.   I dunno, Ryze feels really inconsistent right now in terms of his E.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-13T11:08:04.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can promise you that it is in fact jumping between units.\n\nIt functions differently now, read the tool tip, and test in a custom.\n\nThe Bounce range is small, but shown when you cast.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-05-13T12:26:30.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it's not.
