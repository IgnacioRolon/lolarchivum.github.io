Doesn't mean I hate it, I love the Captain Fortune's skin, but it really shows a fantasy, not the character.\n\nNot to mention, all her other skins are based on her original model, that's kind of how skins work. By making Captain Fortune the new main skin, the skins would become skins of a skin, which would be awkward.\n\nBuy the skin if you want it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-08-03T08:29:10.927+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't a champion just have a nice thing happen to them and the people that play them without some bloke complaining that everyone should get the same thing?\n\nThis wouldn't be special if we decided to do the same for all the champions.
