They did not hesistate to tell me that I made over 500 mistakes in that game (yet they failed to specify what they were, primarily because they weren't focused on making me a better player).  I think what really set me off and made me write about this was in the middle of the game (them nitpicking me started from the beginning when they checked my ELO with NAOPGG and figured out I was Bronze I).\n\nWhat happened that set me over the edge was when it was mid game and the enemy Lee Sin was coming bot lane with Yasuo against the top laner and ADC.  I pinged them to be careful because there was no vision of them outside of them, and generally 2v4s against a tank, two burst assassins, and an ADC that deals true damage generally means that you're fucked if you don't know it's coming.  The response I got?  Not \"thank you\" not \"Soraka you saved our asses\" it was \"don't you ping us you bronzie.\"\n\nYes, you heard that right.  I got flamed for being a good team player.  Solely because I was Bronze.  To really add insult to injury, you know what my score was endgame?  4/0/17.  I didn't feed, I didn't steal any kills from the ADC (despite him being the primary one that was flaming me all game), and I fucking picked a support that synergized well with the carry because I wanted to be a good team player.  Yeah, we stomped that game, and yeah, I considered that S+ rank I acquired at the end of the game properly deserved (unlike the one I got from that game where the enemy carry intentionally fed), but this game wasn't one of the best I played.  It was one of the worst because two assholes thought that just because they were platinum that they were allowed to flame me all game for every little mistake I made.  Forgive me for not playing this game perfectly 24/7.  Don't you think if I played this game perfectly, I'd know it by now, and would be picketing outside of TSM asking why they're looking for supports in SK when the best one's right here?  (HEAVY SARCASM OBVIOUSLY)\n\nI quite frankly don't know what's worse.  Having to deal with the toxicity, feeding, and AFKing in ranked at my ELO trying to climb, or having to deal with \"well, all Bronzies are fat ans stupid HEU HA HA, HOH HOH, SNORT, HO HO, WERP WERP WERP WERP WERP\" in normals.","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-06-12T20:19:32.317+0000","up_votes":111,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's not them shaming you for being bronze, that's them shaming you because they're elitist assholes.\n\nYou get this kind of behavior at all levels of play.  The plat 5 player will trash talk the silver 1 in his game.  The Gold 5 player will trash talk the silver 3 player in his game.  \n\nBeing bronze obviously carries a negative perception, but in general it just boils down to people who are insecure about themselves and feel a need to lord their perceived superiority over others.  Those people are empty inside, they're trying to justify themselves by saying they're better at something than you purely because of a ranking (which may or may not even be true).  It's best to just ignore them.  And honestly making this thread isn't going to help the cause, and if they saw it they would probably appreciate that they made you upset because that's just the type of people they are.\n\nReport and move on with your life imo.
