This isn&#039;t the first time this has happened this season.  I don&#039;t know about you, but I don&#039;t like getting shit-stomped for 15 games in a row.  Last season, when something like that happened, MMR was recalculated, and I&#039;d get a much better skill matchup.  Now, because of dynamic queue, I&#039;m constantly getting stuck with premades, so something like that is impossible to implement.  So here I am, going to continue to lose to premades, without any hope of possibly winning.  This is beyond stupid.  Even if I wasn&#039;t getting matched with premades, my MMR isn&#039;t properly recalculating.  I&#039;m still getting stuck playing against players much better than me.  This is goddamn infuriating.  This is why I took a break, and it looks like it&#039;s going to be for good now, since I can&#039;t seem to get a single fair matchup in over 25 games.","replies":[{"poster":"EddardStark84","date":"2016-04-18T17:02:17.000+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":40,"body":"Oh look another thread blaming all of their misfortunes on something that isn't actually the cause of their misfortunes.

It's stupid. There are *way* too many clearly boosted players and the premades are hellish to deal with. I don't even play Ranked anymore because of it.\n\nThis Season is cancer not only because of the balancing (which is at an all time low) but because of Dynamic Queue. Even if you don't get placed vs premades (which in this elo you do a huge amount of the time, especially boosters) you have to deal with having boosted players on your team. And even then when the boosted players are on the other team, you won not because of your skill but as a result of a boosted player who decided to play solo. It is ridiculous. And with all the stupidity, toxicity is at an all time high which results in more tilt, more rage, and an overall far worse experience. It's not even remotely fun. Beating your head against the wall for 30 minutes straight loses you less brain cells than playing Ranked this season does.","replies":[{"poster":"Parceval","date":"2016-04-18T21:40:06.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"It's possible you're like Oddone that the game is just getting more difficult and the players more talented, and you're not as invested at a level above your peers, as you once were.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2016-04-18T22:14:38.015+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've seen, I  think in Oddone's case just from watching him since season 2 is that he's just done with League mentally.

Even if the game is balanced like shit (which it is), I still should be getting around a 50% win rate in normals because I'll have my MMR adjusted, or I'll even get the off chance that someone will carry my game.  That hasn't been happening, and this isn't the first time this has happened this season.  The only thing that makes logical sense is that Dynamic Queue is fucking up matchmaking.  I haven't been playing the best lately, but that does not equate to a fucking 25 game lose streak.","replies":[{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2016-04-18T18:35:01.447+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Dynamic's inbalace is affecting you more the higher rank you are. You are silver, if anything you benefit from DQ.\nI was able to climb from S4 to G1 in 2 weeks, maintaining ~65% win rate as support. I had like 200 MMR higher than my division average, meaning i skipped 3 divisions (S5-S3, S1->G4, G3->G1) Oh and im playing only solo. \nThat means if you are good enough you'll climb very quickly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grashnim","date":"2016-04-18T16:44:41.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didn't mean to imply you were boosting.
