OR PICK .. that champion. Making it impossible for a teammate to ban a champion that one of the last players on your team has hovered means it is still very likely that the enemy team can pick that champion. For this reason, .. I wouldn't agree with this. \n\nAs for denying new champions goes though, .. I could see an argument for doing something like this in Normals, .. but I think it will become more likely that the first pick team will almost always end up with the new champion, then you will still probably just get a dodge from the other team. \n\nPeople either want so badly to play the new champions that they will ruin champion select for everyone else, or they want to just ban the new champion because they are either too strong or people don't know how to play them, so they end up trolling or feeding. But, .. as much as I hate this expression. ... \"It's Normals\" ... You're supposed to use this as your training grounds. \n\nRanked on the other hand. I almost think you have a better argument for new champions being automatically banned for the first week. I would not be surprised to see a Nunu ban as 1 of the 5 from both teams for a while. As I said before, he is too new so people don't know how to effectively play as him, with him, or against him, and most of the time new champions are overtuned since the PBE is not intended to establish balance. \n\nSoooo, .. I would say that I don't really expect either of these suggestions to happen, but I wanted to give you my full thoughts on it because I always feel that is important.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2018-08-30T14:52:06.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to blind pick if you want to play new champs\n\nAnd of course i'm going to ban champion x even if my team mate has picked it because if they aren't the 1st pick, there's a possibility that the enemy will pick it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-08-30T02:58:39.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Na, you people who want to first time new champs/reworks on the day they get released in ranked can stay getting banned out.","replies":[]}]}
