I'm really frustrated because I'm working really hard to try and play better and I had left  a game once because I had chores to do but I plaid through full games and I was given another penalty for leaving when I plaid really hard through each game and I need to be earning loot.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T02:13:54.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't be getting an LPQ punishment for only one left game, but rather this only happens once the system starts to notice a trend over a short period of time. The main reason is because everything has IRL things to do every once and awhile so it won't take effect after just one game. Be sure to play through those games without afk's/leaves and you shouldn't get another once enough time has passed. Once you've played enough games to show it isn't a trend, your hextech loot will unlock as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BatRider56","date":"2017-12-06T00:20:20.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that but I keep getting them even tho I'm working really hard","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-12-06T00:13:42.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you receive a Leaverbuster, your next 5 game queues will put you in low priority queue.","replies":[]}]}
