In order to get permanently suspended, you have to keep exhibiting negative behavioural patterns throughout an extended period of time, without showing much or any effort to reform. I'm assuming your account has been through all three punishment stages (or just the 14-day one), which renders this punishment completely justified (due to your negativity and toxic behaviour). Even the smallest mistake after your 14-day account suspension is enough to end up in a permanent suspension. It even says so in their reform card (something along the lines of this being your final warning).","replies":[{"poster":"Raining In NYC","date":"2019-02-12T12:47:35.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Funny , I bought an account on lol websites and I play a game and got permabanned after one discussion","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-02-12T12:53:16.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is another reason why I find it stupid to buy accounts.

In a game I played earlier today, someone was autoleveling an account with a low-quality script that just repeatedly right-clicked the enemy Nexus, going 0/20/0 in 24 minutes. The Ez who was hoping to have some fun in mid ended up going 1/2/7 because he had to deal with a super-fed Ori.
