It'll be idle at the \"victory\" screen for around 3 minutes then it finally shows the end game screen but everyone has already left. Also, sometimes after I click the \"victory\" button it goes to the end game screen right away but with nothing on it except the message \"skip waiting for stats\". It eventually loads after a while.\r\n\r\nThis happens literally all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T23:06:56.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having a hard time getting reconnected to the client lobby.
