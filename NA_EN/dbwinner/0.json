While reading the passage about it seems as if Ornn could be a tank not only that but the last tank released was Tahm Kench on July 9, 2015 it has been over 2 years since we have seen a new tank which makes it likely Ornn will a Primary tank. If Ornn isn&#039;t a tank he could be an assassin because the last primary assassin released was kindred 10/14/2015 which is reaching the 2 years since a new assassin has been released.\nPlease give me your Thoughts on what Ornn could be.\nThank you for reading.","replies":[]}
