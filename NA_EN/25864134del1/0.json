I&#039;ll be the first one to admit that I am a toxic player who is easily capable of starting to insult people (calling them trash, mostly) when they make serious gameplay mistakes or personally attack me. Fine, I deserve a punishment. But does it have to be a 2 week ban and a perma ban sometime later? I know my temper won&#039;t change. Eventually someone will once again trigger me to the point where I get multiple reports and an autoban. But I never troll in any other way. I always (99% of time, at least) play to the best of my ability, never intentionally feed or ruin game in other way. So wouldn&#039;t a permanent chat ban/restriction will be a more fitting punishment for me? I would eagerly mute myself if there were such an option, most people communicate with pings nowadays anyway, words are no longer essential for efficient gameplay. I understand that I deserve a punishment, but I do strongly feel that this is the wrong one... You don&#039;t give a life sentence to a person who screams profanities on a street, after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-04-26T18:20:18.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as it's been 11 months since this thread was created, I am locking it.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification)\n or [Discuss the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-05-22T18:26:48.674+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"14-day ban out of nowhere sounds like you were using slurs, which Riot explicitly has a zero-tolerance policy regarding.
