One. How do we fix his chargeback when he doesnt owe anything? Two. will i get my woad scout quinn back and will he get kled back once the suspension is lifted?","replies":[{"poster":"SparksFFF","date":"2017-03-18T21:47:35.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he has been waiting for a responce. and he will be paying it back i just wanted to know if the skin was going ot be put back into my account once the chargeback is paid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T21:45:40.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this chargeback issue deals with personal information, there's not much I can do on the boards to help. You can get more context into what happened with the skin you got from him if you write to us in a ticket.\n\nAlso if your friend isn't seeing a chargeback amount, have him submit a ticket as well and our billing specialists will be able to get that fixed for him.","replies":[]}]}
