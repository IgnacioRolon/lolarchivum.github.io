Thanks for your concern, devs want your feedback so it&#x27;s important your voice is heard!\n\nok well the current ranking system i hope isn't effected. i do think it is fine the way it is maybe add a few more mastery levels down the road...the only real issue i have..is the grading system...i think it really needs some adjusting and tweaking,......when you can go 18/3 on an adc and only get a b+ because you didn't kill like 300 minions.....it makes you not wanna play the role...it makes you not want to care and to give up....to me right now adc role is not fun at all....alot because of the grading system...no matter how good i do..i just cant get that s.,.and then you get stuff like talon and zed and really....alot of the grading systems just need tweaking its currently whats making the game unfun for me...\n\n\"no matter how good you do....your not good enough.....but thanks for the carry anyway\" is what it says right now....","replies":[]}]}]}
