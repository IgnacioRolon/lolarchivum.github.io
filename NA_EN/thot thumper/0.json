I've noticed lately, that on my main champions (Riven and Rumble) I have no problem getting ahead in lane. I know how to get kills, and how to push my advantages. What frustrates me is that when I get fed, and laning phase is over I have no idea what to do. I'm awful at shotcalling, and sort of just run into fights, do as much damage as I can and dying shortly after. I need to learn what to do when I'm on front, and laning phase is over, because right now it seems to be the only thing thats stopping me from climbing the League ladder. Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)\r\n\r\nP.S. In your opinion, is skillcapped worth the money? By that, I mean do you think I will improve by enough as a player to make it worth the money/time?","replies":[{"poster":"PapaShongo53","date":"2015-01-30T13:31:47.179+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how much skillcapped costs, but if getting out of Bronze means that much to you go for it.  Watching streams of top laners would probably work just as well though.\n\nAs a top laner there are a few things you can do to carry the game.\n\n1.  Continue to dominate your lane opponent, take his tower, kill him some more and take his 2nd tower.  Keep doing this until they send 1 or 2 more people to stop you.  The important part here is to not die for no reason.  Make sure you have wards deep in the jungle, not just at the entrance to the lane.  Getting multiple people top takes the pressure of your other lanes and can allow them to catch up in farm, take towers or dragon.  However, if your team is all in base shopping or otherwise not being productive you need to not die.  If you see your bot lane pushing down towers with a big wave, try to keep the attention on you as long as possible even if it means dieing (unless there is a baron threat if you die) if it allows your team to take multiple towers, especially inhibs.\n\n2.  You can roam to the other lanes and get kills and push down towers.  You can usually dive mid and get out alive, especially with Riven stun and burst.  Killing mid and getting that first tower down opens up a ton of map control for your team.  From there you can usually rotate to bot and get a couple of deep wards in their jungle and either do the same to bot lane with a 4-5 man dive, or you can take a free dragon.  Once you're fed and the enemy tier 1 tower is down you can safely roam as long as you are doing something besides just getting kills.  You need to be taking towers and dragons, otherwise your opponent will just farm back into relevance and you may lose.\n\n3.  You can be a complete dick to the enemy jungler.  Ward the blue buff bush, wraith bush and the deep bush behind red and krugs.  Anytime you see the jungler pass by one of these wards, go and kill them.  The jungle is currently dangerous to farm and the junglers are starved for EXP, denying them their camps and setting them far behind when laning ends is crippling, as once your team has map/jungle control it is extremely difficult for them catch up.\n\n\nI recommend #1 as being the most effective in lower ELO's since the biggest problem there is map awareness, a lot of the time you can push without punishment, especially if you get to the point you can 1v2 their top and jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-30T13:54:02.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was gonna give some random advice, but this guy covered it and then some.
