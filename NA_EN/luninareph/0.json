We then turned her into a mid-to-long-ranged poke mage with an ADC passive, a Q people could walk out of, a W directly lifted from Leblanc but made point-and-click for almost insultingly simplistic activation, and an E that did approximately her entire previous kit in one spell plus a little extra yet still managed to feel worse than any one of those previous abilities.\r\n\r\nNow we have removed approximately a third of her damage capacity, poured even more emphasis into her ill-fitting passive, buffed her copy-pasted and conceptually facile support abilities, and, incidentally, destroyed the shield-bomb as a final iron spike to the hearts of those of us who used to revel in that very tactic.\r\n\r\nThe stated reasoning behind this is that Riot is &quot;trying giving her access to an end game fantasy... and feel we can do it through her more distinctive powers.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is not Karma&#039;s fantasy and it is not Karma&#039;s &quot;distinctive powers.&quot; Putting power into W--an ability blatantly ripped off of Leblanc--puts the axe to that right away, to say nothing of the abolishing of her most distinctive ability: the shield-bomb. I have been saying since the Karma rework first came out that new-E was an ability that did too much, and it needed to be simplified. And here I can&#039;t even feel victory in my accuracy with this statement because the decision--the method of actualizing this simple truth--was to REMOVE what made it special and leave it completely, mind-numbingly generic.\r\n\r\nAn AOE shield that makes you run faster. Whoopee.\r\n\r\nKarma HAD a fantasy. Karma was about duality. She was about choices. She was about complexity and subtlety. She was about intertwining combat with salvation. Karma&#039;s old abilities added offense to defense and defense to offense, with a balance between the two, yet a nuance of difference that provided uniqueness and decision.\r\n\r\nDo I want Karma reverted to old Karma? **NO.** Old Karma NEEDED fixing. She NEEDED a rework. Do you know what she didn&#039;t need? Whitewashing. She didn&#039;t need to be dumbed down to Mage Champion 101. Do I want changes to new Karma? **YES.** Do you know what I don&#039;t want? To see her pared down EVEN MORE until all that is left is Support Champion 101. Do you know what these changes are doing? Do you want to take a guess?\r\n\r\nKarma&#039;s abilities have a lot of words and numbers associated with them. Do you know what they ALL boil down to? Point cursor at champion. Click. That is IT. And if you dare to say &quot;that&#039;s what all abilities are,&quot; then forgive my harshness, but you are a fool. Karma&#039;s old W was best utilized on what was NOT her target. Her old E could sometimes be best aimed at MINIONS. Janna&#039;s whirlwind, Leona&#039;s shield, ALL of Lulu&#039;s spells, Sejuani&#039;s dash, Ahri&#039;s orb--ALL of these are abilities that have depth, application, complexity. Karma has been boiled down to so little it&#039;s amazing she can still function at all. There is no fantasy here. The meat of her gameplay was stripped away and left behind only a faint mist of ultimately inconsequential patterns, and now even that is being blown off and away.\r\n\r\nDo you want to give Karma a fantasy, Riot? Do you want to make her distinctive? How about we go back to what she was SUPPOSED to be in the first place: a short-to-mid-ranged APC with complicated support capabilities? To that fantasy that gathered a cadre of devoted fans when Karma was so broken that to even CHOOSE her in team selection was to invite ridicule and leavers? THAT was a fantasy with power, Riot. Do you really want to fix Karma? Throw out this milquetoast reboot that has sunk into anonymity and make a Karma with fire and depth, who has abilities of her own, not souped-up leftovers from other champions&#039; kits. Make her Lissandra. Make her Lulu. Make her Nami, Janna, Orianna. But for the love of god, don&#039;t make her EVEN LESS than her distasteful, disheartening, disappointing rework already did.","replies":[{"poster":"Xyirx","date":"2015-05-28T03:46:05.270+0000","up_votes":78,"down_votes":4,"body":"Here was the video I recorded with old Karma.

I don't think she's milquetoast or copypasta at all.  People loved her old passive because it made her dangerous when she was low on health...except the health gain from her old Q was rarely enough to justify the risk, whereas the RW heal ENCOURAGES smart engagement when Karma is low.  It's why I was so pissed that the heal was removed on the PBE until they put it back.\n\nYou talk about how her W is a copy of LeBlanc's, except somehow dumbed down since it's point and click.  However, Karma's tether doesn't slow and has a smallish range, which makes it require the most thought of all of her abilities.  Never mind that almost all of Karma's damage is a skill shot or that the slow from Q is required to complete W's channel on more mobile champs.\n\nWith that being said, why the fuck would they remove the RE shield bomb?  It was something KEPT during the rework BECAUSE it was iconic to her.  If anything, just make the damage from it proc 1/2 the passive if that's their main concern.\n\nThe root on RW is odd.  I mean, it's moving damage away from non-Q, but you use RW in lane to recover health and deceive the enemy.  I don't know whether it'll be a net gain or loss in lane power.  Yes, you lose a big chunk of damage when baiting the enemy with RW, but you also potentially get an extra Q during the root and you make it an INCREDIBLY stupid idea for the enemy to turret dive now.  I really don't know how to feel about it.\n\nTL;DR: I can't write short posts and I need help.","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-05-28T07:08:56.955+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because she is now packing one of the strongest shields in the game and can now get it down to a less than 6 second cooldown.\n\nThere is no counterplay to shields.  You can't reduce them.  You can only either burst them down or wait them out.  Please note that this shield can last for 4 seconds, leaving less than two seconds time between each shield with a potential 410 _base_ amount every ~20 seconds.\n\nBasically, anybody who can't burst her ass down now (which with the tank meta present will be half of the enemy team) is going to have a miserable time against the new Karma if she goes bruiser.

I am also very glad you agree with my assessment that these changes are making Karma more generic and uninteresting than she was previously. Our opinions of neo-Karma's state pre-these changes is irrelevant if we agree that these changes are taking her in the wrong direction, since that is really what this thread's primary complaint is.","replies":[{"poster":"PureMystic","date":"2015-05-28T05:50:05.275+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can clearly comprehend your message.\nI'm just tired of hearing people drag down sans-fans-Karma.

And I do not want to make any statement on her power or usefulness. \"Poke utility mage\" is an easily viable archetype, and I play several of them. Old-Karma was NOT a healthy champion. She NEEDED to be fixed. Neo-Karma is a much healthier champion. But I do not like her, nor do I find her particular iteration of the \"poke utility mage\" enjoyable. I find it dull.\n\nI believe her thematic was indeed clearer as old-Karma. For one thing, look at how her Mantra abilities have changed:\nOld:\nQ: Damage that gains healing when Mantra'd\nW: Hybrid ability that increases in power when Mantra'd\nE: Shield that gains damage when Mantra'd\n\nNeo:\nQ: Damage that does more damage when Mantra'd\nW: Offensive ability that gains defensive properties when Mantra'd\nE: Shield that gains damage when Mantra'd\n\nNewest:\nQ: Damage that does more damage when Mantra'd\nW: Offensive ability that gains defensive properties when Mantra'd\nE: Shield that shields better when Mantra'd\n\nYou'll notice that old-Karma had balance: her abilities that did one thing gained the opposite property to work in unison when Mantra'd, and her hybrid ability increased both sides of its power. Neo-Karma has an offensive leaning: Q and E become more offensive when Mantra'd, while only W gains new defensive properties. Newest-Karma? Damage ability does damage, shield does shielding. At least W still crosses boundaries, and the overall summary is more balanced, but it's also just straight-up improvement instead of having an intertwining of aid and harm.\n\nIf you want to see everything I liked about old-Karma and why, I will just link this old thread from the time of the switch, since this thread doesn't need to have all of that stuffed into it again: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4134282&page=3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jmonster129","date":"2015-05-28T05:52:31.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PureMystic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iJZHrOTr,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2015-05-28T05:24:10.117+0000)\n>\n> Your post was far too try-hard eloquent for me to take completely serious and your dislike of what makes new Karma good is also off-putting for me\n> tl;dr stop disliking what I like\n> Her changes were unnecessary on new-Karma she was quite balanced.

Expanding on her mantra usage is good because it differentiates her from someone who has a similar ult like heimerdinger, Karma's mantra is meant to increase the effectiveness of her abilities, not to actually be as strong as a standalone ult like heimerdinger's, which is why it has a lower cooldown, is accessible from level 1, and functions with her passive to allow us to get multiple mantras off at once.\n\nOverall the changes are more healthy for her identity as a high poke damage utility mage","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"El Hutch","date":"2015-05-29T05:41:01.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been a karma player since before the remake and i loved her kit albeit a lil wonky and tbh it took me a while to enjoy the new kit which i love i mean loved. the changes made come from a good place but they don't feel good . here are my problems \n\nyou cannot wave clear! with your e \n\nthat means you cant land skill shots because creeps are in your damn way\n\nwhich means you farm with your q \n\nwhich means q is on cd \n\nwhich means you are useless\n\nalso the changes removed the cool ability to do damage the enemy who is out of position and near  my creeps. the kits just less fun all around . \n\non a side note im happy with most champ remakes and balance changes  specially the new Ashe .","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-05-29T03:45:50.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, this thread is like the unison of pre-rework karma fans.

I don't think she's milquetoast or copypasta at all.  People loved her old passive because it made her dangerous when she was low on health...except the health gain from her old Q was rarely enough to justify the risk, whereas the RW heal ENCOURAGES smart engagement when Karma is low.  It's why I was so pissed that the heal was removed on the PBE until they put it back.\n> \n> You talk about how her W is a copy of LeBlanc's, except somehow dumbed down since it's point and click.  However, Karma's tether doesn't slow and has a smallish range, which makes it require the most thought of all of her abilities.  Never mind that almost all of Karma's damage is a skill shot or that the slow from Q is required to complete W's channel on more mobile champs.\n> \n> With that being said, why the fuck would they remove the RE shield bomb?  It was something KEPT during the rework BECAUSE it was iconic to her.  If anything, just make the damage from it proc 1/2 the passive if that's their main concern.\n> \n> The root on RW is odd.  I mean, it's moving damage away from non-Q, but you use RW in lane to recover health and deceive the enemy.  I don't know whether it'll be a net gain or loss in lane power.  Yes, you lose a big chunk of damage when baiting the enemy with RW, but you also potentially get an extra Q during the root and you make it an INCREDIBLY stupid idea for the enemy to turret dive now.  I really don't know how to feel about it.\n> \n> TL;DR: I can't write short posts and I need help.\n\nI am very glad you enjoy neo-Karma, and I went and read your mentioned post as well. Thank you for mentioning it, I like to read actual discussion about Karma.\n\nI was honestly extremely optimistic for the rework when it first happened. It was a very different direction for Karma, but I was hopeful it would work out well. However, for me? I was bored by her in minutes. Do I have mana? Use Q. Is somebody close? Use W. Is there any kind of clash between ally and enemy? Use E. You could practically macro it. I will agree that R-W is the most interesting ability on her new kit, but that doesn't say much--and... the health gain on her old Q?? That was NEVER the part that I cared about benefiting from her passive. Q recovered health based on base first, % of max HP second, and AP third. Using R-Q was the thing you did LAST because it would remove the benefit of the passive. You popped R-E for a shield with an extra 80 health or so and enormous shield-bomb, then tried to burn them down with W and Q OR run away with R-W OR pop R-Q if you're pretty sure they'll get through your shield too fast and you needed the health the most.\n\nW does not require thought. W may not slow, but E speeds up, and the overall effect is almost identical. If you use W and they flee, you follow with E. If you use W and they dive in, you E to block them. If you W to scare them off and they run, you're done (and maybe you E to get yourself back to safety more quickly). If you use W to scare them off and they dive in, you E to block them. I do not find this an interesting paradigm, not even slightly. Again, I WILL agree that R-W is a much more interesting ability that DOES actually take some thought, but I never felt the least enthused about W, successful or not.\n\nI cannot for the life of me fathom the removal of the shield bomb. I WANTED them to pare down the effects of E--I've criticized this multiple times--because there was NEVER an occasion where you felt you were using R-E to its full capacity, what with all of the effects it had going on. But what I always said was, remove the AOE shield component and just leave the shield-bombing. Instead... they've cut the shield-bombing. I just. I can't even understand this. Not even a little bit.\n\nI also cannot write short posts. If you find help, send it my way as well XD","replies":[]}]}
