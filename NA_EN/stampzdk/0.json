I don't know why it is transferring, I can not even log in to comment because the combination username/password is not available in the current region. I changed my password so hopefully Im not being hacked, but its is really frustrating because I have a lot of RP left on the account. Please help, I really want to keep playing, its really boring this summer without league.\n\nAccount name is : aznnetfreak","replies":[{"poster":"JhanTheJedi2","date":"2017-09-09T13:40:52.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it fixed now?
