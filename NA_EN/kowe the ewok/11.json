Yes he can be frustrating to play against at times. Is he overpowered broken freelo? No. Not in casual play and not in competitive play.\n\nMultiple champions are much stronger than Lee Sin right now - Jarvan and Vi in particular. In casual play, I'd even rank Pantheon and Fiddlesticks higher than him. A skilled player on \"lower-tier\" champions like Warwick, Udyr, Master Yi, Sejuani, Amumu, etc. will often outclass a Lee in casual play. I've been a jungle main for 2 seasons and I have never ever been scared of Lee Sin.

Lee gets extremely low on his first-clear and can barely clear 3 camps before he needs to back. Almost every other champion can clear 4 camps or clear 3 and then gank. **I can clear every camp in the jungle TWICE on NAUTILUS and MALPHITE before backing for god's sake.** So yeah, Riot is taking steps to tone down Lee's power relative to other junglers.

No. So please, stop frustrating me by up-voting \"NERF LEE OMG!!!!\" posts to the top of boards everday.\n\nIf you disagree with my opinion, please, respond with some arguments.

In either case I don't think this is true. I doubt that Riot bases their entire balance scheme around 1 champion. Although it might be amusing for us to think so.\n\n> Riot seems to forget that he has great clearspeed and sustain while having great ganks\n\nThey didn't. Lee (and other early-game pressure junglers like Elise, Evelyn, and Kha'zix) are largely the reason why the Jungle monsters were made to be harder to clear. So that champions couldn't just itemize damage, full-clear the jungle, and gank without any trade-offs. Now those trade-offs do exist! I think you overestimate Lee's \"clearspeed and sustain.\" His clear is decent, but his sustain is garbage. A 40 damage shield and 5% life-steal and spell-vamp for 4 seconds is barely noticeable. It eases up pretty quick into the mid-game, but Lee gets beaten up really hard by the jungle-monsters early on. Lee's early presence is nothing what is used to be. It is still relatively strong, yes, but not as strong as it once was.\n\n> Many champions don't have half of that earlygame presence since they're much more lategame orientated\n\nWell, that's sort of the point isn't it? Lee is made to be an early-game champ, and others are supposed to shine in the mid and late game. Is Lee's power relatively too strong early game compared to the late-game pay-off of other champions? Perhaps, but I don't think this is something that can't be fixed by turning a few nobs. Some other champions could use some light buffs, or the jungle could be changed in some small ways to benefit champions who don't itemize damage early. (EX. Tier 2/3 jungle item passive damage buffed so that defensive junglers can keep up in farm, while Junglers who itemize damage gain relatively little in terms of clear-speed).\n\nThe solution isn't in nerfing Lee Sin, but elsewhere. And even then, the problem is largely overstated.\n\n> However Riot Balances the jungle for the earlygame, not the lategame.\n\nI don't believe this is true. Riot has taken many anti-snowballing measures in Season 3 and Season 4, making the game overall less oriented towards the early-game. The game will likely always have a tendency to favor early-pressure champions however because gaining early leads are the best way to win games. I don't think Riot is focused on \"balancing around the earlygame,\" just that the game in general favors early-game champions in its inherent design. Riot may have some work to do here, but again nerfing Lee Sin probably isn't the solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2015-02-09T07:01:33.539+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, history proves my point.\nEnchantment broken on Warwick, J4 an Xin?

This may just be my personal opinion as somebody who literally only plays jungle, and who has played tanks, carries, and bruisers in the jungle. I feel I have a lot of experience in facing Lee Sin on a variety of champions and don't find his current power overwhelming. As I said before though, this may just be my opinion and *it is entirely possible that Lee could be relatively too strong early.* I think nerfing Lee will just make him unplayable though. I don't want a cycle of nerfs to be the way to approach every balance problem in League. \n\n> They balanced the jungle for the earlygame, they even said so that they wanted to avoid early ganks. Which kinda maces sense:\n\nNow I understand what you are saying. I agree that they tried to make some balance changes *in regards to the early game* as they saw the early-game being too influential in the game. But I think we can all agree that those changes were beneficial in most cases. In fact, most of those changes hurt Lee more than other champions.\n\n> But that exactly means that champions who fall too far behind early on can't catch up.\n\nYes, that happens for EVERY role in the game. I think you may mean that jungle is relatively more punishing. To that I say no, it's not. The jungle isn't as hard to clear as everybody cries about. It takes some figuring out, but it is really easy to keep up in levels and gold, even when your team is behind, and even if you are playing junglers other than Lee Sin and Jarvan.\n\nYou also brought up Eve as an example. Everyone agrees that champion is straight garbage. Using her out of the 20 or so possible jungle champions is a straw-man argument.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Auron","date":"2015-02-09T17:17:42.603+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you just say 25% lifesteal AND spellvamp (more than {{item:3072}}, {{item:3146}}, {{item:3152}}, etc.) IN ADDITION TO a shield is nothing?

In competitive play, I completely agree with you. But he is only part of the champion pool that limits diversity in competitive picks overall. That's another pie altogether, but because I play casually, I'd prefer to turn the rest of this discussion towards that topic.\n\nIn casual play, I don't think Lee Sin is choking out diversity at all. In fact, I believe that just about any \"traditional\" jungler except maybe Evelyn can be played in SoloQ and can win games consistently if you play according to champion strengths. \n\n> What is Lee Sin's weakness\n\nThis is where I think a lot of people misinterpret Lee. I'll start with the obvious, but often overlooked change in Season 5.\n\n1) Lee has a relatively difficult time staying healthy during his early-jungle clears. Thus he is has limited opportunities to use his strongest period of the game (early-game) effectively. This isn't season 4 where Lee could go and gank, and if he screwed up, could turn around and full-clear his jungle and try again. Now, if Lee ganks at inopportune times, or focuses on farming when he should be ganking, he will be punished. This trade-off actually exists now.\n\n2) Lee lacks linear strengths. Yes, he has MANY options. He has a lot of tools at his disposal. However, it isn't always clear how he can combine these tools to make powerful plays. As such, it takes a lot of lot of experience on Lee's part to abuse his mechanics correctly. Players can easily play against Lee's most power/linear tools (IE, Insec Kick and Early Ganks) by either warding or grouping. In such circumstances, Lee is instantly pressured to become more creative with his mechanics to become useful. It may be hard to pin him down specifically, but does it really matter if you can turn around and kill the rest of his team after?\n\nLee is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. He can do all things *well* but can't do any one-thing amazingly consistently.\n\nTo compare with other strong champions right now - Vi and Jarvan. Jarvan and Vi both have relatively safer and faster early clears (Both with arguably better neutral monster control and objective control as well). Moreover, their power is very straight-forward - dive into the enemy team and press all their buttons over the carry. They can rely on their tankiness and teamates to follow up on their initial burst of damage and lock-down. This linear power is extremely valuable because it means that people playing these champs can unlock their champion's potential MUCH more easily than Lee Sin players can.\n\nSo to conclude, Lee Sin doesn't *really* have clear weaknesses. Instead, his *weakness* persay is that he lacks a category at which he can decisively be better than other champions. As such, he relies on his ability to do all things *well enough* to win games. However, I can lock in J4, Vi, Pantheon, or Fiddlesticks, have a much clearer gameplan on how to win the game, and effectively abuse my strengths better than Lee Sin can abuse his.\n\nI understand this may be confusing, but I hope it helps explain why I think Lee is over-hyped. Yes he can do a lot of things *well.* But he is always outclassed in every category by some other champion.

Thus he is has limited opportunities to use his strongest period of the game (early-game) effectively. This isn't season 4 where Lee could go and gank, and if he screwed up, could turn around and full-clear his jungle and try again. Now, if Lee ganks at inopportune times, or focuses on farming when he should be ganking, he will be punished. This trade-off actually exists now.\n\nI tried Lee over the weekend. I found his early-game sustain and clear speed to be on par with warwick because of his passive energy regen, W protection+lifesteal, and endless abilities on ridiculously short cooldowns. Q in, AA twice, W, AAx2, W again, AAx2, E, AAx2, E again AAx2.. ad infinitum.\n\nI think he would be less awesome if his passive did not return energy, and he could not ward hop.","replies":[{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2015-02-09T18:41:03.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Early-game sustain and clear speed to be on par with warwick\n\nI don't know why I even post on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2015-02-09T18:46:18.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=coppinslinger,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qEsEq6ih,comment-id=00070001000000010000,timestamp=2015-02-09T18:41:03.413+0000)\n>\n> I don't know why I even post on the boards.\n\nHis sustain isn't on par with WW, but his clear speed is far superior.\nHe has just enough sustain that by the time he hits level 3 he will have 75% of his health left, and he can get more while clearing crab so that he'll be at near full health.\nSomething most junglers cannot do at all.","replies":[{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2015-02-09T19:03:25.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The condition you are voicing is that you can have 75%+ health at lvl 3 (after clearing crab).\n\nI can do this on.\n\nPantheon, Hecarim, Malphite, Cho'gath, Malphite, Mao'kai, Master Yi, Nunu, Rek'sai, Volibear and OTHERS\n\nSome junglers HAVE to back after their first few camps.

The main issue with Lee Sin is that no matter what you are about to go up against, EVEN IN CASUAL PLAY, Lee Sin is never a bad pick for the jungle.

The same thing that counter 95% of the champ roster? Please, tell me again, beside twitch, shaco e and eve, that can jungle, , who doesn't get affected by wards. Don't wanna be a party pooper but you know that lee can gap closer in a instant with Q and W right?  ganking via lane?

His utility sure doesn't. \n\nI have no problem with lee sin having mobility or early power. The problem is that he doesn't pay up for it like other jungler. He doesn't have a clear weakness. He isn't squishy, can fit any comp, there is no kit that hardcounters him. He doesn't pay for his mistakes.\n\nYou can engage and kill a off pick oriana. She can slow you, get a ms boost if you are melee and maybe ult you (that is dodgleable).
