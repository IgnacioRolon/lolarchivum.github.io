There are better choices.\n\n- MR items were nerfed, Mercs are a must buy on tanks anway. Why waste money on a doubled stat?\n- Magus doesn't help with mana sustain and simply delays an actually useful item like Rylais, Liandry's or Morellonomnicon.\n- Devourer was nerfed incredibly hard. Most AD'lers are better off with Warrior. Jungler's like Lulu or TF are not viable anymore (after nerfs to this item) anyways.\n\n----------------\nPlease Riot. Do something about these horrible items.\n\n**You could at least start by adding increased health and especially mana regeneration to compensate for the more durable monsters.**","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Pixy Misa","date":"2015-01-05T01:30:38.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, Why can't we get Spirit stone back, and have it build into a tanky item?","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-01-05T01:51:37.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'd argue that NEEDING to rush a jungle item is just a sign that's it's overpowered.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2015-01-05T02:02:09.828+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"A jungle item is called a jungle item because it's supposed to help you doign your job - in the jungle.\n\nJust like Spirit Stone and Madrads Razor did last season.

And as for the rest, I don't really think it's a case of them being OP as much as everything else not being to standard. Sometimes that's justified in its cost, but usually it's not. And also, for something to be considered overpowered, it can't really have an equivalent that could work equally well. All of the items listed (that don't suck) have a  counterpart that can effectively replace their spot.\n\nAlso, let's be clear that you're complaining about the enchantments to the jungle items. not the jungle items themselves. The jungle items are very useful. They aren't very strong, but they're designed to be accompanied with an enchantment *eventually*. There's nothing wrong with rushing them, and there's nothing wrong with not rushing them. There WOULD be something wrong if something had to be rushed almost every game, almost every time. See trailblazer+devourer 4.20 patch.\n\nEdit: Except sightstone, which was an odd choice to include in your list.

It may take some time due to the absolutely massive overhaul of multiple systems (jungle itemization and the jungle itself), but I can see what riot is going for with the majority of the changes, and once they are better tuned for the overall gamestate, I think they'll be clear improvements from the old items.","replies":[]}]}
