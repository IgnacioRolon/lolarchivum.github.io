Just saying most jungles are 2 levels behind mid and top levels 7-11+. It really sucks to play for jungles and it hurts jungle diversity. They could buff the jungle EXP catchup mechanic. It might have gotten indirectly nerfed when camp respawn time doubled.\n\nInstead I think we're getting smite multiple charges in the next patch which will probably help.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MetalGearTeemu","date":"2015-01-07T10:32:48.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Making the jungle a required role compared to a shared resource usable by the entire team with occasional hard junglers like Dota 2 hamstrings them as badly as enforcing the brusier/ap/support/adc lane dynamic does. \n\nThere is no easy answer other then scrapping it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-07T21:41:17.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way to answer was literally answered in the Video.

Is that something that toplaners do in high elos o-o\n\nYeah. I noticed some top laners are taking a camp then recalling and using the gold on pots/wards. Camp EXP gets you level 2, it's pretty worth. If the enemy top laner does this fast pushing won't help you if they TP back to lane. Now they have more exp and pots than you.\n\nAlso trynd benefits a lot from the fury. Trynd is weak until he builds that up. Smart to jungle to get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Aspynn","date":"2015-01-08T03:07:05.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still a bit confused on jungle paths. But why weren't these strategies used before now?\nWould the jungle be extremely behind from losing his two smaller camps, or would he go straight to raptor things/red buff? And is it common in higher ELOs to steal the small buff monsters? That was very smart but badly played in the video.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-08T03:38:14.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It is common in high elo play for the duo lane to take a camp before coming to lane.  If they do, and you don't, you'll get zoned from three waves because it's worth a bit more than half a level.  For example, on blue side you'll often see duo take krugs while jungler starts gromp -> blue -> wolves, recall -> chickens -> red ->gank.\n\nTaking two camps from the jungler is weird.  I don't think it's profitable in general.  Maybe if you had like a Fiddlesticks laner or something.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2015-01-07T00:42:40.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Balancing the jungle is so damn hard :(... \nalthough here's a nice solution: make camps do 100% more damage and receive 50% less damage to/by players without machetes/jungle item for the first 5 minutes on the player's side (counter jungling by laners is still acceptable)? then remove this debuff by 5-6 minutes so that buffs can be donated.\nFeel free to share this idea so that rito can finally implement some change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-01-07T21:44:16.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh\n\nlow elo new jungle is paradise for junglers. nobody knows the trinket timings and gank timings can be anywhere from level 2 to level 6.  it's pretty easy to get a killing spree or at least a few assists as a jungler these days.\n\nold jungle it was the same route every damn time, and every time you ran into a damn trinket ward and the laner backed off and you went and farmed your wight/golems.\n\ni can see why it may be difficult for high elo players because the new jungle gives terrible income so without succesful ganks and perfect leashes you're SOL.  but i'm probably not gonna be the one complaining unless someone finds some magic ward timer that screws me again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unedible","date":"2015-01-07T00:44:58.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito.
