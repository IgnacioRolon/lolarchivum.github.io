He wrecks havoc in yoloQ and tournaments. Even when he's behind 2 kills he outdamages basically any mage but maybe {{champion:134}} (who already got nerfed on PBE). He shines with insane burst, damage sustain, mobility and pushing power, he destroys tanks and squishies alike.

It's mechanical balance (which riot almost never touches) rather than a numerical one.
