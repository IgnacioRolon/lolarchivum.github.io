Trading with one Q has never made sense on Cassiopeia, because her cooldown is so short on the thing.  You should be able to land two Qs in the same timeframe that say {{champion:103}} returns fire with one.\n\nIf your trade is QEEQ, then run away using the Q move speed, you should get at least 4 amped ticks, maybe 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-03T19:16:52.697+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get that many E's off your opponent is honestly bad.\n\nNo offense but 20% MS is far not enough to chase an enemy who outranges you by 300+.\nNot to mention that you will be eating minion auto attacks during the whole time.\nSomething champion designers commonly seem to forget when design close-combat DPS squishies...","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-12-03T19:32:46.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"> If you get that many E's off your opponent is honestly bad.\n\nTwo?  Are you expecting the opponent to turn tail the moment Q lands?  If they do, sure, you won't land Es but they will have taken free damage.  If they don't, landing two Es and a Q is not all that big a time commitment; they're going to get one rotation of spells off and on most mages that's a lost trade.\n\nCass's historical problems have been gank survivability and facing mobile opponents who can juke her Q.  If you're regularly landing Qs she is still a decent laner even with her current sucky numbers.\n\n> No offense but 20% MS is far not enough to chase an enemy who outranges you by 300+.\n\nCass generally shouldn't chase.  Cass generally should zone.  More often than not, you'll be using the MS boost on Q to disengage.\n\n> Not to mention that you will be eating minion auto attacks during the whole time.\n> Something champion designers commonly seem to forget when design close-combat DPS squishies...\n\nCass is only short ranged by mage standards.  By ADC standards, she's got quite long range.  If you can trade on Caitlyn without taking much minion damage, you should be able to do the same on Cass.\n\nI know Cass is undertuned right now, but her play patterns are still quite similar to the ones she had when she was a dominant laner.  Eventually, her numbers will be balanced; when that happens she'll be a powerful but immobile trader and it's likely that the same QEEQ pattern that was good back in the day will be good again.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-03T20:01:22.945+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"So does Cass face mages or ADCs in lane? ;)\n\nNot to mention that Cass has 125 less range than her abilities show when compared to ADCs du to how auto attacks are handeled.\n-------------------\n\nOn a sidenote: \nThis idea of making her a lategame APC instead of the balanced-through-all-stages she used to be won't ever work anyways.\n\nSimply because she can't target swap like a carry AND can only start attacking after a DELAYED skillshot hit her target. \nSo she either has to significantly outDPS carries (not gonna happen) or has to get her range adjusted so that she can actually trade with othe rmages.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-12-03T21:25:38.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> So does Cass face mages or ADCs in lane? ;)\n\nThe point is that her interaction with opposing lane minions is no more difficult than ADCs, and plenty of ADCs can go mid and trade effectively.\n\n> Not to mention that Cass has 125 less range than her abilities show when compared to ADCs du to how auto attacks are handeled.\n\nHer E range is still longer than almost all ADC ranges.\n\n> Simply because she can't target swap like a carry AND can only start attacking after a DELAYED skillshot hit her target. \n\nShe gets a boatload of free CDR and has two enablers, one of which has a 4 second cooldown.

I rather enjoyed playing Cass when she was strong in season 2, and I'd like to be playing her again.  That's why I'm spending the time to discuss her new kit.\n\nI'd recommend you stop thinking about Old Cass.  She wasn't a healthy champion; always oppressive in lane, always weak in teamfights, always obnoxious in brushes.  That's why Riot left her in a useless state for years.  A rework was necessary, is happening, and now we need to make the best of it.\n\nI don't think she will have difficulty switching targets with the current mechanics.  I'm mostly worried about her getting squished and her problems dealing with champions like Zed that can make it hard for her to do any damage at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-03T22:01:21.383+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Oppressive in lane\" Sorry for being so harsh now: But do you really start believing this trash?

I guess people do start believing bull**** once it has been told often enough...\n\nIt was very true in season 2.  Cassiopeia was the most dominant mid laner, with zero bad matchups and a number where the enemy just hid under tower all lane.\n\n> Cass was barely played. If she was that strong she would've been a more popular pick wouldn't she?\n\nCass was barely played, because Riot left her intentionally undertuned, because a balanced Cass had a broken lane phase and still sucked in teamfights, even though she was up 2 kills and 50 cs.\n\n> Not to mention: If cass is oppressive - what are Zed, Ahri, Zigges, Xerath, Kat or hell - Syndra who 1-combo's you if you have anything less than 80% health!\n\nNone of these champions are anywhere near as good as Old Cass was in lane before being nerfed out of the game.  Old Cass had zero bad matchups and it's hard to claim anyone even went even against her; the closest was Morgana but Morgana would just farm and had no real kill potential.\n\n{{champion:238}} is a guy I usually beat in lane.  Right click him more, you can abuse him pre-6.\n\n{{champion:103}} is a skill matchup for almost everyone.  She lands charm, she wins.  No charm, no wins.  One of my favorite mids to play against, feels both powerful and fair.\n\n{{champion:115}} is a pusher.  Near zero kill potential in lane, but pretty good at shoving waves and pinning the opponent to the turret unless they have good wave clear.\n\n{{champion:101}} has good and bad matchups.  Typically excels against immobile opponents and struggles with assassins.\n\n{{champion:55}} loses almost every lane.\n\n{{champion:134}} is probably the strongest overall 1v1 laner today, but she's pretty weak to ganks, has a high skill cap, and can be outplayed.  To me, still feels fair, but certainly others disagree.\n \n> Cass was slightly UP, but close to fine.\n\nCass pre-rework was one of the worst champions in the game.  Worse than Olaf for sure.  Probably better than Urgot.  He's also in a similar boat due to his broken laning phase.  Still, this is the tier she belonged in pre-rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-03T22:44:23.517+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"In season 2 Cassiopeia was oppressive for 2 weeks.\nNot because of her kit, but because of the freaking broken synergy of:\nWill of the Ancients + Hextech Revolver + Spirit Visage\nWhich allowed her to heal for about half the damage she dealt.\n\nBefore and after this item combination broke her she was completely fine. \n\n(P.S: This combination also broke Vlad and Morde and was fixed relatively fast)\n-----------------\n\nP.S. calling pre-rework \"worse than Olaf\" truely shows that you never played her.
