Normally they have about 1minute and 30seconds to be a dick about it or just jab at them before the game starts and in MOST games that's the end of that.\n\nAdding this, would just give players WITH OTHERWISE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO an opportunity to just abuse a player for the entire loading screen.   Hell some players are bad enough even when they have the game to distract them.  Games will end before they start.  THIS isn't even the only situation where this would just become terrible.

Such a huge leap the two aren't even comparable.\n\nMost people would view giving someone a hard time in a game over the internet either as harmless ribbing or just flat out trolling.  They don't view it as actually harmful to the person which is part of the reason why it happens so often.  It's the idea of \"lol I made them mad, but they'll get over it.\"  \n\nTo them it's like giving them access to water balloons.  They don't have to use them, but it's not REALLY going to hurt anyone right?  Right?
