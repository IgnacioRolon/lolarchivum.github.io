No Adc/support duo is going to care if they get stunned by a camp at lv 1, and even in a scenario where the stun is impact-full you have the possibility of the support tanking then just going B, setting their ADC ahead and barely setting them behind.\n\nIn comparison the Gromp camp will destroy two people, since its poison effect will apply to both as they AA it. This means that in tournament play purple side is forced to make a lane switch and guess which lane gets shafted by that (again). It also limits jungle paths and therefore limits junglers, as the only place you can really start is the Gromp, as your duo will be taking Krugs.

Possibly make tier 2 upgrades give 1.25x XP or increase XP scaling, as at the moment jungle feels highly unrewarding in terms of both gold and XP for such a hard role.\n* Have camps spawn at Lv 1 only with a passive \"deal bonus %HP based magic/true damage in a dot to any champ without smite/machete the duration of the debuff goes up with each autoattack sustained this bonus is lost after the camps first death.\" this would likely be around 3-5% to be punishing to people attempting to poach a camp, the first AA can apply it for 1-2 ticks so if a hit is sustained during a leash or follow the champ doesn't lose huge amounts of HP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silverthane","date":"2014-12-10T17:28:53.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"how did you come up with your name?\n\nalso is it possible to smite 2 camps and receive both bonuses? like say golems and red?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-12-10T04:40:10.106+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"b-b-b-b-but ya get like 20 g more per camp doe with tier 2 smitem\nwow didnt see the jungle buff again\n\nI love how riot intended to buff jungle so sustain junglers werent overshadowed by damage junglers with spirit stone\nbut all they did was gut damage junglers \n\nRIP kha, 9001 nerfs just so something else could be buffed to make u useless","replies":[]},{"poster":"JadeKnightblazer","date":"2014-12-10T05:13:30.101+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"I like these neat little changes and hope to see a PBE player play through it :D  Finally feels like the Jungle is a well...
