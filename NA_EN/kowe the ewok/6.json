Enemies standing in Cassiopeia W dash out of it.... The same goes for all sorts of stuns.\n\nIt&#039;s simply incredibly frustrating to die because of this &quot;feature&quot;, you see the stun animation above your enemy&#039;s head just to die to one of his abilities.\n\n(This bug frequently happens when abilities are cast during a small timeframe. The game has a HUGE tolerance window for when you see that your opponent is CC&#039;d - and the point of time where it at actually stops him from taking action)\n\nIt'ld be a big gameplay change to lower the tolence window - but I believe that it'ld lead to much less frustration.\n\n\nEDIT: Since I was asked - my ping is constant 18~24ms.
