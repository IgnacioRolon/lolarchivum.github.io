Currently, he only has a useless passive that converts MR to AP, which could be replaced by adding mr scalings to his abilities. There you are, room for new gameplay without touching his abilities. Now here is the tricky part. His passive must fit his archetype of a flying gargoyle guardian and add new and satisfying gameplay options. Here's what I thought.\n\n(Names subject to change obviously) *Guardian's Wrath*: Galio stores the magic damage negated by his Magic Resistance. Upon reaching a certain amount of magic damage stored he ascents higher (assault from above?), gains a small movespeed buff (not necessary) and his next ability gains new and powerful effects. The effect ends upon casting an ability or after 20 seconds. \n**Resolute Smite becomes Petrifying Smite**: Galio fires a continuous ray of magic from his eyes dealing massive damage over 2,5 seconds to all champions it hits and applying a stacking slow. It has the same AoE circle and same cast range, but is a continuous beam. Galio is allowed to move freely, but the distance between Galio and where the ability is cast is fixed. Kinda like Lucian's ultimate where he can move, but the skillshot is fixed. Deals 100/175/250/325/400 (+70% ap) (+50& mr) maximum damage and slows for 40/50/60/70/80% maximum if a champion stays in the aoe for the whole duration. Invovles a new and satisfying mechanic and involves counterplay. Just imagine Galio firing a huge ground targeted beam while flying high... Priceless and iconic.\n\n**Bulwack becomes Sentnel's Bestowal**: Target gets a small, but constantly refreshing, shield (think inner turrets) for the duration and is healed for the same amount Galio is healed. Shield absorbs 50/10/150/200/250 (+20% ap) (+50% mr) damage and constantly refreshes and healing paradigm remains the same.\n\n**Righteous Gust becomes Reprobating Gust**: Galio claps his wings so hard he unleashes a shockwave in a cone. Enemies hit while facing Galio are interrupted (small displacement like Quinn's Vault) and enemies not facing Galio are knocked back slightly. Allies hit get a huge and short speed boost. Damage remains the same cone range similar to Miss Fortune's ultimate and gives +100% movespeed for 1 second.\n\n**Idol of Durrant becomes Idol of Judgement** Exactly the same effect, but Galio gets a small 400 range gapcloser and slightly knocks people up so that they can't escape even with Tenacity. Basically, not different effect on champions not building Tenacity. Just imagine Galio dropping in a team from sky-high and taunting them without chance of escaping. \nGalio is now a really unique and fun to play champion with unique and demanding mechanics. For this passive to work he needs retuning in his basic kit and a ton of visual improvements, which he needs anyway. \nI really hope someone notices this. \n@RiotStashu\n@Morello\n@Ghostcrawler","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dayblazer","date":"2014-11-28T03:59:59.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He a niche pick to shut down mids.

I personally love Galio, he is my main champion and I try to play him every game unless I must ADC for my team. I'm just gonna post my thoughts on him. Long post incoming.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbilities:\n\nPassive- Runic Skin: Pretty good but..I rarely need to build MR because I usually just find myself in a situation where all the magic damage comes from the support. Late game I get around a 75AP bonus off of it which is nice actually, but I get that bonus not because I want the magic resist but because my essential items just happen to give me that, along with my base stats, runes, and masteries. I usually don't need the 25MR from {{item:3174}} , but I need its mana regen, I don't need the 25MR on {{item:3111}} , but I need tenacity and MS, I don't need {{item:3001}}  50MR but its passive works great with my ult. Cool I got 3 items that I need, giving me ~200AP and ~120MR (runes/masteries included), I have a decent amount of AP myself I'm basically immune to their support damage. Being supposedly a tank, I have 0 armor or health items so I need those to last a couple of seconds against their AD team. \n\nGetting {{item:3065}}  or {{item:3102}}  that are great items with Galio that give good passives and health is kind of useless because I don't need more MR so those are a no, {{item:3110}}  gives insane armor and CDR but gives no health and its passive works against my ult by reducing attack speed, {{item:3143}} also works against my ult, {{item:3068}} gives decent health and armor and works well with my ult too so I think ill get it. Unfortunately 45 armor won't last long with all the armor penetration out there, a {{item:3075}} will give me insane armor and works good with my ult too, ok. At this point I have ~180armor ~120MR ~2.5k health, ~200AP and with room for 1 more item, I got a decent amount of health, good armor and even though i don't need it good MR so I guess a damage item is in order, maybe a {{item:3089}} to boost my damage. Problem is, my ~120MR is too much for just their support its kind of a waste,  ~180armor with ~2.5k health is not amazing and you'll probably get killed fast (even if you bulwark yourself you won't heal as much as you will recieve damage), and your damage will just scratch their tanks because you don't have magic pen (unless you are near them for abyssal scepter to help you a bit, and even then it won't be much), and even though you can hurt their ADC or APC significantly you will have a hard time getting to them with your poor mobility and their CC or making an impact with their probable heals.\n\nQ - Resolute Smite: This one is pretty good, really good slow, damage, and decent CD. I guess people complain about mana cost, more about that later.\n\nW - Bulwark: Again, pretty good, armor/mr steroid to yourself or allies, heals you decently. Kind of contradictory though. What do I mean by that? Supposedly you are a tank, but this ability heals you more with more AP. Makes you wonder, build tank and heal less, or build AP and heal more (not to mention you hurt more)? Hmm.\n\nE - Righteous Gust: This one I believe it could use a few tweaks. Not the best damage unless building AP but that's ok and it gives a pretty good movement speed buff in 1 direction. Unfortunately your movement speed is 380, 400 if with alacrity enchantment, the enemies just out-run you because they have a higher movement speed than that and because probably they can jump/dash away or long range CC you. The times when I find this the most useful is when chasing down an enemy that survived in a teamfight or when you want to run away, and even when you want to run away the short cast time it has is usually enough for the enemy to CC you and therefore, you are dead. \n\nA slight tweak I've thought of is, if the wind is strong enough to push your allies forward, shouldn't it be strong enough to push your enemies back? It only makes sense to slow enemies down when walking in the opposite direction of the wind. Anyways, that's just a thought. (and just to make sure, I'm not making it my idea, there has probably been other people that have said this that I'm not aware of.)\n\nR - Idol of Durand: A pretty good ult that could CC the whole team. Yes, it's kind of lame when the enemies have tenacity and possibly flash away before they take your damage (if they don't have flash and try to walk away you can sacrifice your last .seconds of channeling and move to interrupt your ult before they get out of range, if you really want them to take your damage) and also really unfortunate when you decide to press R and let's say, Janna, decides to press R right before she gets taunted, cancelling immediately your ult (they still get damage though, just not the CC..which is kind of what matters mostly). But hey, you can't really complain about that, otherwise then make Katarina's ult unstoppable too for example, that wouldn't be nice right?\n\nWhat you can complain about is how hard it is to pull off, casting aside all the possible unfortunate interruptions. Your E just doesn't and if you don't want to burn flash then it's gonna be very hard to land more than a 2-man ult. Maybe tweak it just a bit, making Galio push himself in a Shyvana fashion and begin taunting maybe? But of course traveling less distance otherwise it would be too strong. Or maybe the idea is just plain strong, anyways, it was just a thought.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLaning phase/Late game\n\nPeople complain that Galio has trouble early game because of his lack of mana regen and the fact that he is melee which can cause farming and getting poked troublesome, which is true, lvl 3 cast your 3 abilities in a row to kite away from a gank for example and you are left with 1/2 mana that won't be regenerating soon, and you probably can't rely on your melee autoattacks to do most of the job when trading and you are exposed to getting poked when farming. But even if it's true, your abilities hit quite strong early game, the lack of regen before chalice and your farming is what you must manage and overcome, personally, I feel his mana manageable and farming not so hard. \n\nSupposedly you are a tank, but If you go tank, your hard-to-land abilities will significantly hurt their carries, and just scratch their tanks, your 2 autoattacks every 3 seconds will be beyond laughable because they are slow, a bit weak, and even weaker because you won't have armor penetration, IMO it's not so impactful as other tanks can be.\n\nIt feels way more impactful building AP, but it kind of still lacks consistency, I normally have 25% CDR, and casting your 3 abilities in a row leaves you with a 5 second useless before you can cast another Q and after that another 3 seconds standing there waiting for your W and E to come up. Your ult will be hard to use at its maximum unless you have your flash available to burn it up to get a hopefully uninterrupted 3-or-more-man ult almost deleting their carries, if they survived, you better zhonyas and pray to get saved during those 2 seconds or be able to walk away to continue to deal damage from afar.\n\nLong story short:\n- Not so useful passive since teams are mostly AD during these times.\n- His E doesn't quite help to setup an ult.\n- His ult is hard to setup, easily accidentaly interrupted or easy to walk out of.\n- Being a tank doesn't seem too impactful as other tanks and ulting being an APC leaves you in a risky position.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPhew, long 1st post haha. I like him how he is but he could surely use a couple of tweaks.

My feelings of lack of satisfaction playing him on Summoners Rift I believe come from his utter lack of instant mobility.  Galio's ultimate threat is so immense and so universally respected that people -actually- move away from Galio.  When playing Galio your not fooling anyone when you start running straight up towards them.  If your {{summoner:4}} is down, then your Ultimate is effectively down.  That isn't very satisfying.  On the ARAM map the mobility of course isn't that big a deal where everyone is channeled together.  But I'd hazard a guess that people would rather Galio be functional on SR. \n\nTo this end I'm going to postulate that right now Galio is in the same stage as Maokai was before a few tweaks sent him to god-tier pick-ban level in the top lane.  If we could give Galio a repositioning tool (more abrupt than just the movement speed on E) through combo'ing his abilities I feel that he will much more widely usable and satisfying champion.  Thankfully there are some simple mechanics in game players are familiar with that we can lend to Galio.  I think Galio would play wonderfully with a E+Q combo ala {{champion:59}} (the knockup can be cut as Galio doesn't need that in his power budget.).  Galio's E creates a telegraphed zone of threat that enemies can avoid.  If Galio's Q lands on his E it does some bonus damage and Galio swoops in with an {{champion:266}} like animation.  Galio can now dive in to an enemy team to taunt or jump to his backline to peel with his ultimate instead.  A simple change like this end should increase Galio's reliability without adding untold damage or CC to his power budget.  \n\nThoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GG Beers","date":"2014-11-28T22:49:54.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's incredibly boring and clunky to play, same reason Anivia isn't as popular as she should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2014-11-28T23:03:23.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> He's incredibly boring and clunky to play, same reason Anivia isn't as popular as she should be.\n\nI enjoy both of these champs but I don't feel like they can win me games, so I don't play them.

Firstly, It makes the said carries lose damage output, which is a benefit to your entire team.
