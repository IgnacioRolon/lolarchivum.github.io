Has there been any changes to its requirements or anything? Its also not showing up in client. This game is really tough to play (there have been so many negative changes to this game its unbearable) so I take week-long breaks and miss out on patches.

At least in the bug section even if a rioter doesn't get to it first someone else that has had the issue before could come in and help out way easier since not that many threads are made there in comparison to the gameplay section","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-05-26T18:13:40.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure I got my first win of the day yesterday, maybe you just missed it?","replies":[{"poster":"Suckdeezbeez","date":"2018-05-26T18:18:24.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, like its not showing up anywhere on my client.
