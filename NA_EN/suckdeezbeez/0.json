If every single one of them did that, then it would at least be a minor punishment, taking away their unlocked skins, icons, champs, and so on. Any who don't do that are removed from the game and the problem is solved in at least those instances. Quite frankly, Riot and 99.994% of the playerbase (people without permabans, according to Riot's figures on this, which I see no reason to doubt) don't give one whit for how permabanned players feel about being ejected from the game for consistently appalling behavior. Most permabanned players stop playing the game. It's extremely rare for a permabanned player to be so oblivious and/or unbalanced that they accumulate multiple permabans on a series of accounts. Riot does not have the wherewithal to prevent that except when a highly-visible player (such as a popular streamer) engages in this behavior, in which case they may issue an ID ban (Riot employees manually ban any account that such a player is seen to use).","replies":[]},{"poster":"BBKong","date":"2019-11-04T00:00:10.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a punishment, genius.

The chances of every single perma-banned player coming back is infinitely small.\n\nThere is a **LOT** of progression in the game. The thought of starting this game over from scratch after years of unlocking champions and skins can easily destroy the desire to play again.\n\nI know if I were to lose my account (for whatever reason) I wouldn't touch the game again.\n\n>If you tie the game to a phone number like they do in Korea you get ONE account and that is it.\n\nNA is far more adverse to tying personally identifiable information to accounts. The idea behind the game being F2P is it opens the door to people who are still unsure of the game to spend money on it. If they're unsure of spending money on the game than they are extremely likely to be unsure of the game if it asks for your phone number. People despise telemarketers and often make sure that their number never has the chance to be sold for one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
