Is there any sense to this world. I get that people don&#039;t want to play a 4v5 and that is a way to keep players from taking unnecessary L&#039;s but geez Riot acts like things like power outages can&#039;t happen. First game of the freaking day and I have to lose it and be in a lower queue( and don&#039;t say I shouldn&#039;t be quiiting games like that. You get put in a lower queue if you are remade in ranked) But their are players out there quitting games because they have to go at the 10 minute mark and start a game as soon as their team ff&#039;s.","replies":[{"poster":"Aviatinq","date":"2016-08-14T14:47:11.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Get a laptop.

For the simple fact that you don't know what the reason why is. Your dog could have unplugged your computer. Your mom could reset the wifi. Most people won't quit a game after picking their champ and getting into the load screen.

If you don't connect for two games then you suffer no punishment. That's an efficient way to dodge a game for when you fuck up and say for example go jg but forget smite. Two fuck ups in a 10 game period isn't bad I'd say. But that can apply to normal's only. A different more shorter period can be applied to ranks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
