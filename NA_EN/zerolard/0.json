The second play is only a half second behind the first, so they overlap leading to a very annoying sound. I can fix this by turning off voice lines for the game.\r\n\r\n1. Enter game as DJ Sona\r\n2. Wait for her to say a voice line\r\n\r\nI have only played one game after the first time this has happened, but the bug occurred in both games.\r\n\r\nI have not tested this with other sona skins, and I do not have a video to show it happending.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-28T22:16:21.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey zerolard,\n\nI hopped in a game with DJ Sona and I was unable to repro this issue. \n\n> I can fix this by turning off voice lines for the game.\n\nAre you hearing any audio at this point, or is this just to stop the overlapping VO all together?\n\nOut of curiosity, was there an enemy Sona?","replies":[]}]}
