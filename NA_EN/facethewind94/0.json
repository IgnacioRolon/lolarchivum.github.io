I can say they are separate tracks for penalties. One does not influence another. In your example they would receive a 2 week ban for intentional feeding/trolling if they got off of a 2 week ban for toxicity.\n\nHope that clears things up for you.\n\nThe 0rphan\nRiot Games Player Support\nMorgana Support","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-06-04T16:25:05.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That said, bear in mind that if you use zero-tolerance language, such as death threats and slurs, you will immediately be perma-banned. \nIt is also possible that if you do flame someone and they take it directly to support, the human agent could also bump you up to perma-ban, even if it's for a different offense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-06-04T12:39:41.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that clears things up.
