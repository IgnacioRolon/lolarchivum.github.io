In my time I found that I loved playing the assassins, so needless to say when the assassin class was getting looked at I was pumped for this update. With Talon, Leblanc, Kata (only naming ones that interest me) getting major reworks and fizz zed akali ekko getting minor ones I thought this was going to be epic. I have to admit I LOVE the new kata. The one before I hated playing. Now I say that this patch is lack luster because I believe that with the characters I have played constantly that there are some problems that need to be fixed. Most of the time I play kata due to Talon getting banned all the time. Well with the new Kata I am finding that the dagger from her q land 350 units away from the primary target is more often than not causing the spin to be completely out of range. Granted this is in lanning phase but i still notice it in team fights just not as much and it also feels like her w dagger takes to long to land. So personally I think the dagger should land 200-250 units away and the time it takes the dagger to land from her w should be reduced a little. Secondly Talon...so I love his new E and if no one wants him I ban him cause he is strong....but I&#039;m finding his new passive is rather hard to proc considering how easy it is to dodge the return of his w. In point its supposed to be 2 stacks from his w one from his q and a auto causing them to bleed but i&#039;m finding that people (i have and easy time when against a talon myself) dodging his return w and causing me to rarely ever get that bleed. Now i see Riot is seeing what people think about talon because after my last game I got a survey asking if i thought his kit was straight forward which i agree with to a point. I think in order to fix it because it is stupidly easy to dodge they should either make it come back quicker ( 100% not gonna happen since they are trying to add counter play) or increase the radius. It used to be 45 degrees now its 22 so i think it should be 33 degree radius which should help. Leblanc I think is fine the way she is but I cannot for the life of me land her e...so I hardly play her, which means I cant give my thought on her gameplay. Now the next one is Fizz which all honesty I feel has ruined assassin Fizz. For one the change to his ult makes it super hard to get in and follow up. I tried using it as a finisher but that doesnt seem to work as well. Since the ult adds his w passive you want to start with his ult so you can get it on and by the time you engage you can use your w for the big burst damage....in most cases I never use it because it takes to long to set up. Bruiser fizz can use the new passive where as assassin fizz doesn&#039;t. It just feels like he lost a lot of damage. Akali i know is getting a buff next patch so Ill wait to say anything about her but the reason of the champions i think are fine, I just believe they need to tweak talon fizz kata a little more to get it where it should be. For the champions that I didn&#039;t talk about (mainly cause I dont play them like shaco rengo kha) please say what you guys think about them. Is this patch lack luster for you? Do you think I&#039;m crazy etc. I&#039;m hoping i&#039;m not the only one finding this class update lack luster even though its my favorite class. Hopefully Riot will read this and take some notes from what we say. However ZEDS NEW PASSIVE ON HIS ULT IS SSSSSSOOOOO GOOD!","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-15T06:08:46.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not voting because there's no \"god-awful abomination\" option.
