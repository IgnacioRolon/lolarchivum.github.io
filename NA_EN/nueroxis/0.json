Trying to figure out if this is legit or not. Can&#039;t find anything about it on the main site. The way it says it works on the site is everyone gets their own personal link. You send your link to your friends, they go to it and get their own link etc, etc, and everytime you share it to someone and they go to your link you get a point. Get enough points and you can turn in for RP. Was just trying to figure out if this is real or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T02:36:05.649+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wuks is correct, additionally, if the URL doesn't link to a riot domain [examplelink.riotgames.com] then it's generally not something that's affiliated with Riot Games or League of Legends. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part, it's a good rule of thumb.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"HannesLB","date":"2016-12-22T17:08:45.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if its **[URL REMOVED]** it has the same overlay as the new riot official site it is all the same even the terms of service.

It's fairly easy for other sites to emulate the design of another, so even if it kinda looks legit, the URL gives it away. If you visited that website at all, I strongly recommend changing the password for your League account **immediately**.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NimbusVine","date":"2016-12-06T22:43:30.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Targons Blade,\nI have a little issue with this, and i can find it on a support web-site.\nThe problem is that it tells me to complete some information to check, am i a human.
