I was allowed to choose the same element I chose the first time - In this case air. Ended up seeing I could choose it again when I got enough for the second evolution. Clicked it, the circle above my portrait went black then suddenly changed me to fire. This is the second game I did where I wanted to try it again. Played a third one earlier, same thing happened with water but when I clicked on it, it just made me stay at water. Didn&#039;t let me choose another form and just retracted the same way it does when you choose your second form normally. Don&#039;t know if this just happens to me or not.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-19T20:10:00.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
