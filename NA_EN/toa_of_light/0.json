Something I do is I tell my team to mute the player as well to help me and my team avoid tilt. \n\nTry to avoid typing in chat. I find I tilt less when I type less. So don't use chat unless you need to communicate something more complex that's important, like telling your team to push waves then take baron, or to prep an objective before it comes up. \n\nUSE PINGS NOT YOUR KEYBOARD.\n\nIf someone is just complaining in chat, mute them, it can and will put you on tilt.\n\nDo NOT send even one even slightly sarcastic or flamey message in chat. If you do it once, you will do it more. \n\nThink about how to win the game and focus less on individual players. Playing support and your ADC is a lost cause (gets caught out of position constantly despite warnings, takes dumb fights repeatedly)? Roam, do not go back to lane, invest resources into deep warding the enemy jungle and ganking other lanes. Keep in mind everyone makes mistakes once or twice and that doesn't mean you should just give up, it's just when they don't learn. Mid/Top and your jungler won't gank? Roam/TP gank if you can't win your lane. Keep in mind there are lanes your jungler will have trouble ganking, and if you want a gank, let them push and freeze the wave near your tower. ADC and your support keeps getting caught? Simply ask them to stand behind you, just let them push and let you you farm so you can scale. Jungler and you're behind? Play around a strong/winning lane. When your laner is pushed tower, in most situations your laners will get to you faster than theirs if you find/fight the other jungler. Use this safety to get wards into their jungle and when they gank the opposite side of the map you're on, invade their jungle/set up vision.

Riot unfortunately does not take trolls or intentional feeders seriously.  Not saying toxicity is ok, but its typically fueled by something worse, which is inting. The amount of players I have had straight up walk down mid lane and go 0-12 is appalling. And yes, I am guilty of being toxic in those situations. I report these players, follow their accounts and yet Riot never bans them.  So to me, Riot is saying, its not ok to be toxic but its totally acceptable to intentionally feed. They are sending the message that its ok to waste 4 peoples time, that in life its ok to Intentionally lose, and its ok to have a negative attitude. Furthermore, riot is FORCING us to accept intentionally feeding without saying a word, for fear of being banned by big bad riot. Riot themselves fail to understand why most people are toxic.. I think it would be beneficial for them to go through chat logs and see that the majority of people are toxic because they are in a game with someone that is inting. I think this is riots major flaw. I am sorry riot, but you will never stop flaming if you don't stop intentional feeders. I would love to hear from someone in riot that can explain to me why intentional feeding is never punished but toxicity is? I would love to hear their rational as to why its ok to Int, but its not ok to get upset at someone for inting and wasting 30+ minutes of your time? \n\nRiot should stop their double standard and realize that inting and toxicity are hand in hand and intimately related.

It just makes the game more toxic as a mistake is immediately followed by threats of reports and the majority of toxic play doesn't fit into reporting categories, only toxic speech allowing more and more trolls to ruin ranked games while the players trying to play are getting reports and chat-restrictions/bans.  The more Riot pretends to improve their system to make the game less toxic, the more their system feeds the toxicity and makes it worse.  Beta this game wasn't toxic, it was like any other multiplayer game.  Season 1 the game wasn't that toxic, season 2 it got more toxic though.  From there, their system of reports and bans and chat bans were introduced and developed and it has resulted in Riot citing \"changed behavior success\", yes all I see are trolls getting away with being toxic while other players are not allowed to speak in chat in the slightest negative behavior towards them without risking the trolls reporting them.  Yeah, people who get reported are no longer getting reported; but the game is becoming ever more toxic so what is their crappy system really doing for the game?  I've run into more ranked trolls this season than ever before.  People just ping you dead and in-game taunt and stand in your lane etc instead of doing reportable behavior, and meanwhile troll even harder in-game than they used to.  Half my friend group has stopped playing League regularly or altogether because ranked has become increasingly more toxic.  Example, I had a support take nunu (who I was showing as my pick and he took just to piss me off) with smite and follow me around the jungle last hitting my jungle creeps and taunting after each one he stole.  It was all he did for 15 minutes and when I got invaded at blue he taunted and ran away without casting a single spell or doing anything.  I reported him for inting, I'm sure nothing came from that report but I got a chat restriction for bitching at him in chat which started as me pinging him and telling him to go bot after he smited my blue buff.... which I thought was a pretty level-headed response to him stealing my buff in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kmathieu2220","date":"2017-10-06T02:25:59.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just, like, don't be a dick to people?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2017-10-05T19:22:38.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Board members can actually help you identify issues if you copy and paste the logs you received with your punishment into this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-10-06T01:06:47.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think he understands that he says is toxic, he just wants help not being toxic anymore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toa of light","date":"2017-10-05T19:25:08.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"? what u mean","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-10-05T23:40:29.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel you there amigo.
