I've contacted Amazon support over 4 times and all they've had to say is \"our $50 Gift codes have expired, please contact the main publisher as they can distribute more codes.\" I lodged a support ticket 12 days ago and it has been dormant for EIGHT DAYS. This is absolutely unacceptable. I have never had issues buying RP on Amazon before but this is a nightmare and I'm tired of being tossed around between Amazon support and Riot support. Give me what I paid for, it should not take 2 weeks to come up with a simple code.","replies":[{"poster":"Mariah Carey","date":"2016-10-12T15:28:26.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been 17 days since I paid for $50 worth of RP and to be frank it should not have taken this much effort to just get an answer from Riot. It seems asinine to ask but will the Star Guardian bundle be extended beyond October 13th? I bought RP in anticipation for the new skins but at this rate I doubt I'll receive my RP before the bundle expires.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T23:28:49.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your ticket and it looks like it has been limbo due to an error on our part.
