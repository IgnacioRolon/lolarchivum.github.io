The match with the image was played yesterday, so no punishment was given out. How come someone can do this, actually ruining a game, and get off free when someone else can be invested in the game, have someone make a mistake, and flame them and get banned? It just doesn&#039;t make sense to me. League is the only competitive game I can think of that punishes players that want to win and try to win for letting their emotions show, all the while not banning people that intentionally throw or ruin games. This is honestly ruining league for me, I have so many games where people like the zed ruin games for me and it bothers me so fucking much. I really just wish riot would do something about their terrible punishment system.","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2018-03-04T20:52:46.267+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Did he actually build that during the game?

You might not be smart enough to realize that you can't pull off a slick zed move and grab a kill 1v3 under the enemy's nose. And even if you fail, at least you stacked those tears - you're just scaling for late game am I right? Lol.\n\nSee, the problem is people forgive intentional feeders to no end. Had a post exploring this topic awhile back and got downvoted to oblivion by \"snowflakes\" as some would say. The best commentary on that thread was when a player defined inting, then I used their definition to diagnose how someone doing exactly what I'd described (like forcing and losing a 1v1 or 2v2 for the 10th time instead of just sitting back and farming safely until they catch up/can get help from teammates) fit perfectly their definition of intentional feeding. The person's response was basically - that's not intentional feeding. Really, when it fits your exact definition of intentional feeding, it's not intentional feeding? Does society let someone drive drunk 10x and get in car accidents - injuring or killing other people and keep saying... it must have been a mistake, keep your driver's license? No. But you can do exactly that in league. People are just freaking ridiculous.\n\nYou can say whatever the hell you want to teammates or do whatever you want to harass them all game. Just don't type certain words and the system won't punish you. Then go and report the person you harassed for 25 min because he accurately tells you you are an idiot for flaming him for: going 2/3/1 in a shitty matchup while being camped the entire laning phase, not teleporting into a losing 3v5 you forced after he told you NOT to engage (when you also don't give a tp ward to begin with), die 1v2 because you ignore the 3x he pings you NOT to gank his lane RIGHT NOW (wait for a whole 5 sec so he can clear minions and get spells back off cd), etc. You can make that person's life hell and rather than you getting punished for it, he will get punished because you convince a teammate or opponent to help you report him for toxicity (and harass him with you all game). Then said player goes on the boards, explains the entire scenario (kinda like I just did here - but sub me into the spot of the guy being harassed all game), and the boards will claim \"you're just toxic feeder\" and crap like that.\n\nIt amazes me how much people will rally behind stupidity and assholes. How you can play for 1.5 seasons where 50+% of games you have intentional feeders and/or assholes harassing you all game, yet the only person who is punished is the guy who is most correct and trying his best to HELP his teammates. God forbid some asshole asks his teammates to ward for 20 min straight because none of them ward and are getting picked off for it. Heaven forbid a guy reply to a toxic teammate who doesn't understand the game and explain how ganking through a giant minion wave to force a 2v2 on an opponent of higher level (because you have tons of xp and cs to soak under tower - via the 25minion wave) to try to help his teammate understand the game better and make GOOD decisions. Or that you ping a teammate to NOT invade right at that moment because they will get 3 man collapsed on with no support from top or mid due to minion wave location and/or back timers. Then the jungler forces invade anyways and dies for 5th time for no gain exactly like you warned them would happen. Only a toxic asshole would warn his jungler of something like that or try to explain it so they STOP doing it. Jungler has every right to harass their teammate the entire game and belittle them for trying to help them see the flaw in their invade timings and get them to do a better play instead lol. Of course reading this, we see how flawed the jungler is for thinking something like that, yet in game, it's the toplaner who is punished. Because 20 min of trying to save teammates from stupid plays like that and getting harassed by his teammates who for some stupid reason think the jungler is correct makes him reply to their toxicity with some of his own. Sure, he could mute, but it's hard to communicate, and he did his best to have FAITH that just maybe his teammates could eventually see reason - after 10+ times of their strategies failing and his strategies working despite massive gold and item deficits the two times they actually listened to him. But no, just another auto-loss thanks to teammates too blind, arrogant, and toxic to open their eyes and realize all the hurtful stuff they claim about their toplaner is actually what they themselves are. And rather than flame them the entire game like they did to him, he gave them the benefit of the doubt, put up with their bullshit, and even tried their sure-to-fail strategies a dozen times if only to give them the chance and to prove that their strategies wouldn't work and MAYBE just maybe they should try listening to him.\n\nNot like if you had an analyst, caster, lcs player, or coach they would tell you to do stuff like... ward. Don't force outnumbered fights if you can't even win an even-numbered fight. Stall at towers when behind - they're there for a reason. Rotate to pressure a 2nd lane's inhib tower if you killed an inhib instead of fighting in the lane with the dead inhib because it gives you either a 5v4 (someone's gotta be in the other lane to deal with supers) or lets winions take towers while you 5v5 - rather than giving the enemy the chance to 5v5 while they clear supers. Nope, not like any of that simple shit should be known by someone of gold elo or silver. I mean you might have had to be that smart to escape bronze, but clearly your teammates didn't need to be. You might be smart enough to recognize the difference between a bot lane that's intentionally feeding and one that got screwed by repeat 4 man ganks and a tough laning matchup. But your teammates don't have to be smart enough to recognize when you WIN your lane top despite being ganked every 1.75 min, flashed on on cd, roamed on by 8/2/0 fed enemy mid any time you leave tower, and are vs a counter-pick. Your teammates just get to look and criticize you because you aren't grouped to help protect them so they don't die 4v3. How dare you be so selfish as to apply splitpush pressure in a 1v2 scenario, grab a kill, force the other person back to base, and then look to roam and collapse on the enemy 3 man group harassing your teammates - you're team will be dead by that point. How dare you build damage so that at least ONE team member will have damage and do 90% of an enemy carry's max hp in burst damage and lock them down out of position for your team to finish off - while you get perma-cc'd for 5 sec straight and tank 4 enemy's damage and combat summoners; you didn't peel the enemy tank jungler off your adc and she 1v4 killed your 3 squishy carries while you were solo tanking 4 enemies (3 of whom are fed through no fault of your own). Yes, clearly the game was lost because toplaner built damage so he could keep outplaying 1v2 camp of his lane and frequent ganks by fed enemy mid or random flash ganks by fed blitz support and adc. If he'd built full tank instead, he could have forced the sejuani to focus him as well somehow and solo peeled 5 people for his team. Tanking them for a literal 3 min straight before his 3 carries could kill a single enemy because that's how behind they were from inting in lane and jungle. F U C K toplaners like that losing the game for their team that tried so hard and played perfectly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BBW Chaser","date":"2018-03-04T21:49:11.685+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"Bruh just a \"bad game\" here in riot we do our best but casess like that are not \"clear\" and they very hard to detect if the players actually \"int\" we dont want to make zed players who build 6 tears to be afraid to break the meta cause here in riot we love to see non meta builds :) so enjoy this troll in your game and if you dare to tell him that he is a troll you are gonna get banned for 14 days :)\n\nACTUALL RIOT RESPONDE...","replies":[{"poster":"6inarow","date":"2018-03-05T02:00:08.378+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BBW Chaser,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FcrYRY9M,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-03-04T21:49:11.685+0000)\n>\n> Bruh just a &quot;bad game&quot; here in riot we do our best but casess like that are not &quot;clear&quot; and they very hard to detect if the players actually &quot;int&quot; we dont want to make zed players who build 6 tears to be afraid to break the meta cause here in riot we love to see non meta builds :) so enjoy this troll in your game and if you dare to tell him that he is a troll you are gonna get banned for 14 days :)\n> \n> ACTUALL RIOT RESPONDE...\n\nanyone that thinks this isnt clear cut either has brain damage or doesnt want to admit what the obvious decision here should be.
