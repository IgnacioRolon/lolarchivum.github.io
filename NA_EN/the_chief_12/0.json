Ping was fine (always around 40-45) and nothing was open or downloading behind league. Figured it was a riot problem. Then I noticed even the menu was lagging and pre game lobbies. Three days straight any game mode I play in i lag, even the login screen lags. After i entered my password it takes about 10 seconds to login before it was instant. Never has this happened before. I made league high priority in task manager didn't help. I deleted programs i don't need anymore to make space, didn't help. Turned updates from Microsoft off like a troubleshoot online said, didn't help. Uninstalled and reinstalled game didn't help.\r\nCan anyone give me ideas to help fix this persistent lag? i'm ruining the game for my teammates and won't play until I know it's fixed.\r\nLmk if i need to include more information about PC.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-18T04:40:26.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it's taking so long for you to even login, it really seems like this issue is centered on something to do with your connection to our servers.
