Shuffle, Ultimate, Range or other?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":30,"down_votes":3,"body":"So if I&#039;m understanding the issue accurately, the problem with Azir has always been that he has the best aspects of two identities of a mage; he has the long range and damage of a immobile hypercarry while at the same time having one of the longest ranged dashes in the game which when combined with his ultimate make for an engage/disengage tool that is argueably not only better than any other mage but most tanks, divers and other such champions that are usually seen as initiators.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdlitCROvlg\nThis is an example that shows his massive area of influence and ability to engage for his team. In this example, he finds a pick on lulu. I have noticed that most teams in professional play favor champions that can find picks which I believe is just another reason Azir is so popular in pro play. But even without this capability, he is still favored because of his impressive DPS.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEC0va27U-w\nThis is an example to showcase Azir&#039;s value as a damage dealer alone. This shows that even if he isn&#039;t using his drift into ultimate combo, he is still highly valuable as a terrifying backline damage threat.\n***\n\nSo, assuming this logic is correct, there are two very apparent avenues to solving Azir&#039;s problems; EITHER embrace his ability to dash onto the enemies and ulti them wherever he wants OR embrace his ability to do really impressive DPS from a distance.\n\n1.) Remove dash completely: This would embrace his ability to be a tremendous back line threat, giving his team outrageious magic DPS.\n\n2.) Remove his ultimate: This would encourage Azir to make the really big and flashy plays that he does by dashing really far all over the battlefield and doing TONS of damage while hopefully outplaying entire teams of players but it would disallow him to engage and peel for himself and his team.\n\n3.) Reduce the range on his Shurima shuffle: Either reduce range on his e, his q or both. This would encourage Azir players to still engage for their team and do tons of damage they will just need to be more in the middle of the fight then previously seen.\n\n4.) None of the above: perhaps I have totally missed the ball and you disagree. If this is the case, select &quot;N.O.T.A&quot; and PLEASE, for the sake of all things sensible in the universe, EXPLAIN YOURSELF! Please use sentence structure and proper logic and communicative skills.\n\nAll this being said, I am looking forward to see what people think about this issue.\n\nP.S. I am a former very serious Azir main. 361,219 champion points plus I would reckon at least 40,000 champions points for the games I played before champion points were created. I thought I would mention this to give some legitimacy to my understanding of the champion.

Buffing his base HP probably wouldn't be have much of an effect.  Buffing his shield however, depending on how its done, could potentially work as a defensive steroid.  I'm still not sure how significant either would be though, since other battle mages have some insane durability (Annie's E, Vladimir's... everything, Swain's R, Malzahar's passive).\n\nThe best thing I can think of is have his R block ranged auto-attacks, but that would make Emperor's Divide an insanely broken ability given it already does so much (massive AOE displacement, wall, blocks dashes, high magic damage).\n\n> Look at zyra for comparison(which is another zone control mage): 0 mobility, no 450 dash, nothing, no reliable disengage from ult, nor from the rest of her kit, even if you outright remove his e he will be safer.\n\nAzir has so many safety nets because he's an auto-attacking mage.  Zyra can cast her spell combo then wait out her cooldowns if there's danger headed her way.  Azir doesn't really have a set spell combo, outside of his Shurima Shuffle.  An Azir attempts to get off as many auto-attacks as they can without getting themselves killed, meaning he'll be actively participating in a fight for a longer amount of time.  Unlike a traditional Marksman, Azir doesn't have lifesteal either.  Generally speaking, once Azir's lost some HP he's not regaining any unless his team has a champion with heals, or he goes back to base.\n\nEven if Azir actually needs his dash removed, it's probably not going to occur.  Riot only removes spells in champion class updates or in VGUs, neither of which are likely to happen for Azir.

If you do so beforehand, you better have some hard CC on him (Malphite is great for this, but Morgana/Thresh/Nautilus can do the job).

In a gank Azir uses a massive amount of mana to escape, but he still zooms from the middle of the lane to his turret nonetheless.\n\nI'm of the opinion that his R is perfectly appropriate.

Any good Lux/Ziggs/Vel'Koz/Xerath can land their skills reliably near their max range, and they DO out-range him.  All four also have hard crowd control on a basic ability, though Xerath's isn't quite as good at keeping melees off of him.  I already mentioned this earlier, Azir's soldier command range is 800 units, his Q 875 units.  All of the abilities on those four champions are 900+ units (bar Vel'Koz E, at 850).  Saying Azir out-ranges them is completely incorrect.\n\nNow in regard to Taliyah/Zyra/Anivia, the only short range ability of these champions is Anivia's E (600 units).  Anivia's R is 750, but she can back up immediately after she casts it.  For the most part, their range is equal to Azir's (between 800 and 1000).  All three champions also have hard crowd control in their basic kit.\n\n> The thing is their cc is unreliable, going in on them gives both sides room to outplay(though it depends on the champions involved, zyra for example is very easy to \"outplay\"(people are really too liberal with that tem) which is why you don't really see much of her in the mid lane, but a better way to say this is that there's a risk that your defenses will be avoided and you'll die, that's not as much the case with azir's ult, as it's much better at getting people off you than well, the entire kits of zyra/anivia/taliyah, that's not nessecerily a huge issue as zyra isn't a mid laner, whereas if we take azir's dash away anivia and taliyah will be able to do things he can't(pick potential for both+roam for taliyah), but there's still somewhat of an issue here, mostly it's just that if we decide to focus on his zone control identity, his e needs to go away completely and no more safety nets added, though then he'll have issues pre 6.\nSo maybe some skillshot cc.\n\nI agree that his E is problematic.  Comparing Azir's Ult to the basic abilities of Zyra/Taliyah/Anivia is unfair though.  It's an ultimate ability, do you expect it to not have some extremely strong effect?  Once he uses his R, he won't be using it until for another minute at the very minimum.  Worth noting, there are assassins which can circumvent Emperor's Divide anyway, such as Fizz, Katarina, Kassadin, Zed, and Talon.  They may either completely dodge Emperor's Divide, or just go over it by baiting out his R.  Sure, it blocks off a large majority of fighters, but control mages tend to excel at that to begin with.  \n\n> I really think that you are overestimating the role of the shurima shuffle in azir's current state, when I banned azir it wasn't mostly due to his shuffle, it was because he dealt immense damage and it was nearly impossible to do anything about it, as he would just ult and/or dash away, his defensive mobility is a much bigger issue than his offensive mobility, even if it's the same ability.\n\nAzir's identity is as a backline DPS champion.  He is intended to deal immense damage with his soldiers.  The way you deal with it is an assassin is supposed to jump on him, an artillery mage (or Varus) can poke him out before a fight even commences, or you CC him (which is a generic way you can beat any champion).  His problem lies in his E's dash.  Replace the dash with something else that isn't more damage and he can be fair.  \n\nAnd the reason I \"overestimate\" his Shurima Shuffle is because it is one of his strengths that can be removed.  He's a broken design because he has too many strengths for one champion.  If you remove his auxiliary strengths and focus him into only a few then he won't be problematic.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2016-08-10T19:26:52.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Messaiga,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uQT9IMmq,comment-id=00000001000100000001000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-10T18:21:58.198+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s just how his kit design works since it&#x27;s based upon auto attacks for the majority of his damage output.\n\nIt doesn't change the fact that his range is effectively higher, if you take the average adc for example, their effective range is quite similar(slightly shorter for average, slightly higher for people like caitlyn) to these mages, trading range for reliability is nothing new.\n\n> You can look at varus for comparison, he has strong ranged poke, decent dps if he goes close, but his ult as a defense is a lot weaker than azir&#x27;s ult.\n\n> Varus&#x27;s Q also has a range of 1625, which makes it a lot easier to position before fights.  \n\nIt doesn't.\nVarus HAS to get close in fights, if he doesn't auto attack and basically only uses his q he isn't doing much, it gives him something to do before fights and when zoned/ out of range, but he has to get close to be worth picking.\n\n>If he goes in for auto-attacks and gets jumped on he can activate Ghostblade (if he went for the ArPen build) and throw his R onto any assailant.\n\nAs I've said, if it's an assassin the R can easily miss due to mobility/invulnerability, as when the assassin gets to him a snare simply won't save him.\n\n>Obviously this isn&#x27;t quite as reliable, but his R is easy to land and a 2 second root is fairly decent.  He also can build lifesteal, as well as the elixir of wrath, both of which make him harder to kill.\n\nAnd azir can build abyssal, zhonya's and rylais, they both have highly cost efficient defensive items, and lifesteal might not be available for azir, but hp and armor aren't really available for varus.\n\n> Yes, his poke is very strong.  Should it be so strong?  No, I think it should be tuned down.  Would lowering his range fix it?  Perhaps, but I prefer the solution of just lowering the damage his poke does overall.  \n\nIt's possible, but there are so many options with him, his kit has a lot in it so there's a lot of different places which can be sacrificed for a clearer identity.\n\n> You beat assassins by taking exhaust mid lane.  They jump on you?  Exhaust them and CC them.  Either both of you live, or you live and the assassin dies.  \n\nThen they disengage and go in on again when exhaust is down, you don't just \"beat assassins\", there's no easy solution to them, there's some way to limit their effectiveness, but they are supposed to be strong against certain things, and they are strong against them(as each champion is supposed to have strengths and weaknesses), and it so happens that assassins are strong against zone control mages.\n\n>The only champions this doesn&#x27;t really work well against is Rengar or Talon due to their combat pattern (initiate from stealth).\n\nzed doesn't have to fully commit to anything, le blanc bursts fast and if you exhaust her she'll just back off, kass can easily just jump back, fizz will generally go in with q, and back off if you exhaust him, otherwise he will use e to finish you off.\n\n> I have nothing against Zed/Talon/Kassadin/Kat/Fizz for the fact they can bypass Emperor&#x27;s Divide and dodge CC abilities, that&#x27;s fair game.  If the one class dedicated to killing squishies couldn&#x27;t outplay like that they probably wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.\n\nAs I've said, people are way too liberal with the term \"outplay\", if you get caught by something like zyra's snare/anivia's stun/taliyah w on fizz/zed/le blanc when your mobility is up(and remember, each of these has at least 2 dashes) then you fucking suck, I don't understand since when not being terrible at your champion became an outplay.\n\nThis is kind of what I was talking about before, anivia has some reliable burst(r+e) alongside her passive on top of her ult to defend herself from assassins+keep her out of danger, taliyah is rather new so I'm not entirely sure about where she stands, zyra on the other hand, once you reach a certain level of play is just \"reliably outplayed\" her kit just doesn't do anything to those champions when their players know what they are doing, so you just never see her mid. \n\n> Every champion is supposed to have a few things they excel at, no?\n\nSupposed is the keyword here, though that statement is fair for azir, he should excel at some things.\n\n>In this case, Taliyah has pretty good waveclear, pick potential, and roams.  Anivia&#x27;s burst with just E -&gt; R is insane and she can deny whole areas with her W and R.  \n\n>Zyra punishes an opponent&#x27;s engage extremely hard and can output a lot of DPS via her plants.\n\nIt's kind of why I keep saying it's not fair to compare azir to zyra.\nZyra's strength is incompetent and uncoordinated play, you can actually see her winrate drop with elo, she has the natural weakness to poke and roam, but she is also weak to assassins, weak to mobile bruisers(have fun dealing with irelia), weak against tanks as cinderhulk and random aoe damage kills her plants, and weak against immobile bruisers once they get deadmans(which is always), bonus points for righteous glory or talisman, then she just does nothing.\n\nHer only strength is her \"overtuned\"(you gotta do something right?) damage, but when people play properly it's just never worth it.\n\nThis is why no competitive play for years->rework(which was a huge buff)->ignored in competitive(aside from na for some reason, I was actually curious where that would go if given the chance) but very high winrate in solo q-> back to 0 competitive presence.\n\nZyra's design is actually rather poor(well it's more a clash of values between balancing for proper play vs average play), which is why I don't really want to compare azir to her, as he will always have too much in that comparison.\n \n> Worth noting, if he did not have his R he&#x27;d have no hard crowd control.  He&#x27;d be pretty gimped. \n\nThat's definitely true, what I'm getting it is that it alone is just too damn good at it's job.\n\n> I feel like at this point we&#x27;re both just rehashing the same argument over and over again. \n\nYeah I think we're basically saying the same thing over and over again, while also not really disagreeing either, so this probably should be my last reply on the matter.\n\n> His kit is not broken because it&#x27;s too safe for a champion.

To be clear, you are suggesting to keep all of his abilities the same, including e, with the stipulation that he can no longer cast q while mid dash with e to do the \"shurima shuffle\" and can no longer cast e while his soldiers are moving from his q to follow his soldiers to their destination.\n\nI am conceptualizing two ways this could work:\n\n1. Orianna method: If orianna commands her ball to move, WHILE it is moving she cannot cast any of her other abilities. If she does they will not go off right away; instead they will go off when the ball reaches its destination. this same concept could apply to azir. If he casts q while he is mid e, his soldiers will not be dispatches to their location until AFTER azir has completed his dash. And If azir cast e while his soldiers are moving, he will not dash to them until AFTER his soldiers have reached their destination.\n\n2. Xin Xao method (I think this is true for him. not sure but it gets the point across): If Xin dashes at someone and they dash away while he is mid dash, his final destination will be where the enemy was standing AT THE MOMENT XIN USED THE ABILITY. If azir uses q mid dash, then he will to continue to the location his soldiers were at the moment he casted the ability. And, If he casts e while his soldiers are moving then he will go to the location the soldiers were at at the moment he casted the ability.\n\nLet me know which you think you would be better or if you think neither would be any good.

A constant 40% slow thanks to his soldiers being able to constantly reapply it is too much as many are figuring out, this is a problem for many DPS based mages, it's screwing with their balance.\n\nSome ideas I have for potential changes depending on what direction they want to go with would be.\n\n1. Heavily reduce the damage on his Q but also decrease the cooldown and increase the damage of his soldiers, make it so it is the re positioning ability for his soldiers and not the initial burst to his combo and I would also reduce the range of his soldiers autos, make it so he has to really juggle his soldiers and have to constantly preposition them during a fight.\n\n2. Reduce the mana costs on all of his abilities and remove the mana cost on his soldiers but make it so autoing with a soldier costs mana with multiple soldiers increasing the cost (In that if an auto with one soldier costs 5 mana then using two soldiers costs 15 mana and three costs 25). The idea behind this is if he's going to be so good late and early then make it so he's like Anivia and is very mana dependent. This could be an indirect way of nerfing his early game as he would have to invest in a mana item like Roa or Tear which would delay his power spike.\n\n3. Outright remove his E and replace it with another ability. As others have said, he's supposed to be slow and need to use his soldiers from afar to deal damage but even if you gap close on him he has a very strong mobility move to get away.","replies":[{"poster":"JosephAngelo","date":"2016-08-06T23:14:21.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ooo very interesting ideas :D I like it! I agree with your statements on ralai's. I think the item is plainly and obviously too good. The #1 reason that item should be bought is for the utility that the massive slow provides. Yet, there is no trade off for picking an item that gives this much utility because it also gives so much damage and survivability. So when choosing AP items to buy, I think more often than not players are saying \"why would I not buy ralai's?\" instead of \"should I buy Ralai's?\". I would like to see a world where ralai's is a niche buy, when you are facing champs that you think would really depreciate in value if they were slowed (udyr, hecarim etc.).\n\n1. I honestly wouldn't mind if his q did 0 damage. I honestly love that idea of champions having spell that don't do damage but instead they help the champion's abililty to do damage with their other spells. A perfect example of this is anivia's wall ability; it does zero damage but if positioned correctly it can force an enemy to remain in anivia's ultimate for a longer amount of time and make the enemy take a predictable path to which she can more easily land her q, which is a skillshot. love this concept. Plus, this really pushes more strength into his soldiers which I think is maybe where it should be.\n\n2. This next idea is really neat! this takes me back to pre-rework ashe (miss you babe). When I first read \"reduce the mana costs on all of his abilities\" I was thinking wow I don't know about that; he already doesn't need to build a mana item because they are so low but then I read on. I kind of like this idea. He already scales well into the late game so why not make him commit to that identity of late game mana scaling hyper carry like karthus, anivia and kog maw. sounds good to me.
