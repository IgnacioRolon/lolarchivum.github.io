And then I realized that I only had 969 Riotpoints and I really want to buy a 975 Champion. So i drew this Picture for you Riot, but I dont know how to put the picture in here... How can I do that? &lt;3 I hope you could gift me 6 Riotpoints after I put the picture in here, so I can get my 975 Champion.\n\nThanks alot!\n\n--Snip--","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T22:02:24.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I removed your info for security reasons.
