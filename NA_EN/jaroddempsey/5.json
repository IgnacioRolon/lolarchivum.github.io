Having a definite \"check [in] a box\" would help to work against that. Granted varus did go a long way towards that but did end up falling short considering the gays in the story had their love portrayed as their greatest weakness and their ultimate downfall for which they were trapped indefinitely in a hellish prison as an evil godwarrior mutilates their flesh into a body for himself and subjects them to psychological torture while slaughtering innocents. TLDR it does add depth and that depth provides important representation for some fans.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-08-08T23:06:16.489+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"No, it doesn't.  The people who promote a culture of shame would do so with or without this box checked.  Leaving orientation unclear does not promote it by itself.\n\nRepresentation is a different beast, and not everyone requires a character to be \"like them\".  I honestly feel bad for people who need something like that, because exploring characters that are \"not like you\" can have far more meaning when done right.\n\nI'm not saying these boxes shouldn't be checked, but you're asking for it to be done in the wrong way.  Riot could just go through and list it for every single champion, but that would be terrible.  What we need are stories that show who these characters are, and if their orientation is important to who they are it will make a natural appearance.  If it's not important to who they are maybe it should stay unclear, at least until a story requires it.","replies":[{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-08-09T10:08:58.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.

It would make sense for her to be asian like the rest of the bunch. She's black for diversity sake, same with Pyke to the same degree. Illaoi is more an islander which is totally different so we won't talk about her.\n\nI appreciate Ekko and Lucian so much more. It plays into their characters because Ekko gets this down on his luck inner city kid feel, he reminds me of growing up in Chicago. Lucien plays into that Denzel Washington \"man on fire\" vibe, man on a mission, Nick Fury badass mofo. These character almost HAVE to be black to sell that characterization and that's why I identify with them.\n\nI can't give Riot brownie points for{{champion:43}} {{champion:555}} so much.

I just think that representation in it's current form is stupid and gives Riot just a box to check so that we can have a good black to white gay to straight ratio, instead of actually exploring interesting characters.

Sivir is white too in Shurima.\n\nAnd where did islanders come from do you think? Islanders have black ethnicity.\n\nI agree it limits interesting characters but black, white, straight, gay, lesbian, trans whatever can be interesting if it is done correctly.

Twisted Fate is Definitely Bi, Having once dated Evelynn and Graves is his Partner yo. Taric loves Everything and Everyone Beautiful, So he's Poly and Pan, Taliyah's Implied Bi according to one of the writers, but they never even mentioned it in the Bio, They could just, Exist, and be Gay, Les, Trans, Bi, Pan, Ace Whatever, And 20% Isn't even that much when it's just 32 chars.\n\nwith only 32 Characters of 134, I think Representation is fine, like, Really, I'm not gonna look Taric and Say he's straight, he's Pan as fucc.
