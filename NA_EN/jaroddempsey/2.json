This in addition to the effectively halved mana output of new mfb in early game is why new mfb is so terrible, especially for mana dependant enchanters who need it the most in early lane. In addition to all of this, it incentivizes  using mana for pokes which as an enchanter is extremely wasteful and dangerous.\n\n**TLDR**\nOld mfb did its job of giving players a rune choice to address some of their mana sustain problems before they were able to build items to compensate for it, new mfb completely fails at this for those that need it the most when it is most needed.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-04-05T01:43:33.660+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"good they have to actually manage their mana now like it should be","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-04-05T01:58:08.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The OP is actually wrong..... because.... well.... you know..... it takes into account no actual MANA items.

The math puts Redemption builds at about the SAME heals overall as an AP build, but it gimps their DAMAGE, SPEED, and overall utility.\n\nNami's Passive is a godsend if she goes AP as is her E, and her Q and W don't do weak damage if she as AP. Furthermore, her W hits multiple times, and only if you go AP does it scale well on the amplification. On Near full builds, my Nami W's do regularly around a 26% per bounce bonus. That's 52% on bounce three, meaning on AP her third bounce heals will heal FAR more than a redemption. Namis who go Redemption tend to die about 2 more times per match than AP builds.\n\nSona and Janna's % move speed boosts also scale to AP, as does their damage boosts. An AP Janna's additional AD to her barrier target can get up to 80 on an AP build. It sits around 40 on a non AP build. Her move speed on an AP build can get over 580. Move speed on a Redemption buid might hit 530. \n\nThere's HUGE sacrifices to always going Redemption. There's one other major side effect of it: It gets you in this habit of playing too passive and not properly representing in your game. You may heal well, and have a semi map aware presence, but you are less likely to attempt to control the game, and less likely to be the team leader, and often redemption splits your attention. You might globally heal someone, but you don't see the Shaco or Rengar coming up behind you and killing you.\n\nI've been playing support since Season 4.

But a straight up nerf? This rune essentially gives you a free 250 mana as well as 1% TOTAL mana regen every 5 seconds. This also scales both with itself and with any mana items you build.\n\nBasically a free ocean drake. That scales with future ocean drakes.\n\nThe only catch is you have to throw a spell at your opponent once in a while rather than sit under your turret spamming them on minions. You are forced to actually participate in the pvp aspect the entire game is built around to properly utilize the rune.\n\nI realize this is a huge hit to weaker players that have a hard time competing against another human, but if you wanted to play PvE you should not have been playing League of Legends - i warmly recommend Path of Exile or Diablo 3 instead, those games are a lot of fun for more casual players - and they let you go at your own pace.\n\nTry to look at this from the other side of the spectrum - think about your most hated mid lane matchups and the fact they likely suffer from this just as much as you do.","replies":[{"poster":"JarodDempsey","date":"2018-04-05T04:00:56.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it gives you 250 free max mana, which does next to nothing for mana sustain which is what mfb's original purpose was.

They easily outdamage their marksman until level 6-7.\n\nThis may of course be different in the lower ranks. Not everybody plays in the middle elos (diamond+).\n\nDont think this rework didnt affect me at all. I used to run manaflow presence of mind taric support for literally unlimited mana in the early levels - now i have to build mana if i want to keep my marksman alive. On one hand this means a weaker early game, but on the other it opens up a couple new build options to me as i only have to buy one mana item rather than two.","replies":[{"poster":"JarodDempsey","date":"2018-04-06T17:44:14.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps i should have been more specific in that i meant enchanters as their core playstyle eg those that rush a shield/heal skill and whos mana is primarily best spent on that skill. Karma is almost always built for poke instead of her shield so i wouldnt consider her to be much effected by the stack requirement. Sonas w has low cost assuming shes not rushing it but she uses it regardless to proc her passive so the stack requirement also has little effect for her. Lulu is a tossup, sometimes she goes poke other times she goes primarily shield though thats a bit rarer nowadays, if she goes shield then this new mfb will be somewhat detrimental to her though her lvl 1 q is only 50 mana and the range+passthrough will allow it to not be too much a struggle to stack. Janna suffers the most from what you mentioned since she rarely pokes and primarily saves either of her damage skills for engagements. Using q isnt as efficient or as realiable as w but it can be safer, in either case spending mana for poke is not ideal, especially since it puts her cc on cooldown. \n\nIn general if new mfb does anything it discourages people from playing the primary intent of the enchanter playstyle and thats to focus on enchanting their allies, which is disappointing to see since most other classes are already focused on attacking enemies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2018-04-05T06:23:57.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JarodDempsey,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9WEOjLsq,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2018-04-05T04:00:56.064+0000)\n>\n> it gives you 250 free max mana, which does next to nothing for mana sustain which is what mfb&#x27;s original purpose was.
