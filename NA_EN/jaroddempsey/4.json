Because a world where everything goes, only just means the one holding a bigger bat/club rules. Subjugation of the weak and the vulnerable will be rife and any diplomatic, intellectual, and moral/ethical etc discourse will be impossible and irrelevant in the world where everyone bows to the one who can hold a bigger axe waiting to hack the other in half because they disagree with them.\n\n\"Freedom to pursue your ideals\" sounds good when flapped out of one's mouth, but one must realise such a thing will never be possible if the environment doesn't explicitly allows such a thing. And an environment of such gentle nature does NOT exist in nature, but instead in human designs. Tell me, how is it going to be possible for a blind person to access education without any sort of establishment, which would mean some orders are in place to create and facilitate such a thing, without having any kind of order? How is it going to be possible for a kid in the country town to access medical attendance at an affordable price and prevent the doctors from ripping them off? How is it going to be possible to forbid slavery and crimes against other individuals who can not fight back by themselves, ie the disabled, the born-frail, the old, and the young? Or how is it going to be possible to trace the responsibility of a crime, without some kind of metric like laws, to define and enforce such a thing and discourage potential future instances from taking place; or do you suppose a world full of revenge seekers over another's crime a proper forms of society? Those things don't grow on trees up for grabs, someone have to be there to create the necessary infrastructure to allow those things, which will need a gigantic resources to realise, and it can not be done without any kind of proper order in place.\n\nA world without order only ever provides ample \"freedom\" to those WHO ARE ALREADY IN POWER, and punishes those who are not already at the apex; the weak can not stand up for themselves, sure they have the \"freedom\" to fight, but we all know for a fact they can't do shit anyway precisely because they are weak and vulnerable, ie it's a fake \"freedom\" like a good Catch-22. If you haven't noticed anything, that \"freedom\" you speak of, is the exact opposite of actual freedom.\n\nYour pond vs river analogy is also utterly nonsensical in my eyes. There is a reason why human societies develop AFTER the invention of \"orderly\" things like language, formality, moral, laws, etc, which are all fundamental to a society's existence. Even if you want to go back into the warring states era, each states still had its own laws and order. So what exactly does chaos even bring? If you have to use the 'water' analogy, chaos is the mirage oasis in a desert; it looks good from a distance, but its \"good-ness\" is imagined and fueled by your desperation and is in reality non-existent, a fake promise that results in death.\n\nUnjust as fights may be, the fight for order only needs to fight ONCE, an once achieved, there will be no bloodshed; that's one hell of a bargain in comparison to endless wars, don't you think? And if orders are true to its words, reforms and whatnot can nonetheless happen, just that it will be less chaotic when it does. It's a complete fallacy that order will only means stagnation. Remember, all of the laws, moral codes, whatever, exist to SOLVE problems, not to create them. They might create problems independent from the problems that were there since the very beginning (prejudice against homosexual, for instance, was a created problem), but that's a minuscule minority to the issues they fix and the amount of lives it improves, **and also why law and order gets updated in an _orderly_ fashion**. On the other hand, pure and utter anarchy will result in absolutely nothing, and the world will be stuck in a permanent stone-age where even something as trivial as drinking water can kill you (no order, no recognised basic human rights, no establishment, no infrastructure, no clean water. One of the first attempt to \"clean hydration\" came in the form of the invention of alcohol in the ancient age, which required some kind of order to distribute the knowledge and mass produce it, so that people were not dying like literal flies, and a civilisation could even be had). The only liberation a world without any order can bring is death, and that's not \"freedom\".\n\nRemember, the sole reason why every countries are properly ordered, or at least most of them try to anyway, is because chaos lost in the wars that lasted eons with order. If you have to use your chaos ideal in application of this, people exercised their freedom to fight and die for the peaceful and progressive society the order offers, not the endless strife and destruction that will only be brought about in its absence. That should say something.\n\nWithout any forms of order, no one can be productive, and the world will be permanently stuck fighting over the smallest of things. A world of endless strife is utterly counterproductive, and will ultimately results nothing. That's why rules and orders were even made, to give people chances in their own terms. Order is what both PROMISES and GRANTS a person freedom, the chaos only does the former. Therefore, to suggest that the lack of laws should be the answer, is both immature and highly uninsightful.\n\n..........\n\nAlso, as I was saying in another thread, I also find it VERY ODD that people can only see order in the worst light of dystopia, but can't do the same for chaos, in which they go out of their way to fantasise a great deal of and in the most positive way ever. \n\nI guess it's to do with media having a fetish to be as meaningless rebellious as possible, but seriously, you don't want to live in a world where orders don't exist. Wanna know how I know? Buy a 1 way ticket into the most lawless part of the world and stay there for 5 years, then come back and tell me how you think orders are BS.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2018-07-13T11:10:08.529+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aB5QMIEE,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-07-13T09:00:37.672+0000)\n>Snip\n\nDo you know why countries are founded?

It is not. \nThe concept of personal freedom is one of the base tenets of western civilization - its why we rebel and why we fight so hard _if we choose_. \nIt is not _order itself that is bad, dude_. It is \"order through slavery\" that IS BAD. \n\nFurther, you have this odd notion that endless war always means someone is out to get you and theres no way to get your roots settled. Thats just plain wrong and a product of your own fevered imagination in regards to freedom - Where Garen offers slavery Darius offers survival. Under Garens shadow you CANNOT band together to fight for what you believe in. \nUnder Darius's ideals you CAN band together to fight for what you believe in. \n\n\nI think thats the fundamental piece youre missing. Youre not understanding that people can and will band together, and that those groups will eventually grow while protected by fighters who believe in their cause, who believe in their ideals. \n\n__________________________________________________\nAlso, as i said earlier, even if garen lost it doesnt mean hes going to suddenly change his ways. It means that hes no longer FORCING PEOPLE to bend to his will - whats going to happen is that God-king garen will stop expanding and grow naturally through diplomatic means as Darius, and the forces hes allowed to flourish, push back against the tyrant if theres any signs of conquest. \n\nThats kind of the whole crux of the event.\nGaren, the tyrant who offers protection through ownership, is expanding his empire and murdering those who dont want to give up their autonomy. \nDarius, the force of change, offers freedom through choosing what you fight for and giving you the ability _to_ fight in the first place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-13T12:22:53.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paroe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aB5QMIEE,comment-id=0003000000000001,timestamp=2018-07-13T11:10:08.529+0000)\n>\n> Do you know why countries are founded?

If you have to use the &#x27;water&#x27; analogy, chaos is the mirage oasis in a desert; it looks good from a distance, but its &quot;good-ness&quot; is imagined and fueled by your desperation and is in reality non-existent, a fake promise that results in death.\n> \n> Unjust as fights may be, the fight for order only needs to fight ONCE, an once achieved, there will be no bloodshed; that&#x27;s one hell of a bargain in comparison to endless wars, don&#x27;t you think? And if orders are true to its words, reforms and whatnot can nonetheless happen, just that it will be less chaotic when it does. It&#x27;s a complete fallacy that order will only means stagnation. Remember, all of the laws, moral codes, whatever, exist to SOLVE problems, not to create them. They might create problems independent from the problems that were there since the very beginning (prejudice against homosexual, for instance, was a created problem), but that&#x27;s a minuscule minority to the issues they fix and the amount of lives it improves, **and also why law and order gets updated in an _orderly_ fashion**. On the other hand, pure and utter anarchy will result in absolutely nothing, and the world will be stuck in a permanent stone-age where even something as trivial as drinking water can kill you (no order, no recognised basic human rights, no establishment, no infrastructure, no clean water. One of the first attempt to &quot;clean hydration&quot; came in the form of the invention of alcohol in the ancient age, which required some kind of order to distribute the knowledge and mass produce it, so that people were not dying like literal flies, and a civilisation could even be had). The only liberation a world without any order can bring is death, and that&#x27;s not &quot;freedom&quot;.\n> \n> Remember, the sole reason why every countries are properly ordered, or at least most of them try to anyway, is because chaos lost in the wars that lasted eons with order. If you have to use your chaos ideal in application of this, people exercised their freedom to fight and die for the peaceful and progressive society the order offers, not the endless strife and destruction that will only be brought about in its absence. That should say something.\n> \n> Without any forms of order, no one can be productive, and the world will be permanently stuck fighting over the smallest of things. A world of endless strife is utterly counterproductive, and will ultimately results nothing. That&#x27;s why rules and orders were even made, to give people chances in their own terms. Order is what both PROMISES and GRANTS a person freedom, the chaos only does the former. Therefore, to suggest that the lack of laws should be the answer, is both immature and highly uninsightful.\n> \n> ..........\n> \n> Also, as I was saying in another thread, I also find it VERY ODD that people can only see order in the worst light of dystopia, but can&#x27;t do the same for chaos, in which they go out of their way to fantasise a great deal of and in the most positive way ever. \n> \n> I guess it&#x27;s to do with media having a fetish to be as meaningless rebellious as possible, but seriously, you don&#x27;t want to live in a world where orders don&#x27;t exist. Wanna know how I know? Buy a 1 way ticket into the most lawless part of the world and stay there for 5 years, then come back and tell me how you think orders are BS.\n\nPlenty of people break stupid 'laws and orders' all the time for a beneficial life.\n\nJust because a law or an order exists doesn't mean its right.\n\nI think you romanticized Law and Chaos a bit much.\n\nThings in the US are pretty dystopian.

The gathering of resources needed to survive, the building of a legacy upon which immortality is gained, the need to protect your people. \n\nThe freedom that Garen offers is fascism - hes a dictator, a tyrant garbed in holy light. You follow his will or you die by his blade; he IS the one power. \nThe freedom Darius offers is the freedom to choose your ideals - to choose what you want to fight for, to advance as YOU wish and not how your god king wishes. \n\nBoth have their merits, and the war of the god kings wont end... Even if darius wins, Garen will _still fight for his ideals_ because thats the freedom darius offers. Its not a false choice, its a _real_ choice.
