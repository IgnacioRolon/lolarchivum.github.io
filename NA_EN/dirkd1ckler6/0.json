In the end I had 9 wins and a loss, I was mid tier silver last season so I thought maybe I can jump straight to gold, but the opposite happened and I got into Bronze 2. Last year my performance was mediocre yet I was placed into Silver 5. So I am pretty salty with my current elo, is there any possibility to get riot to change this? or do I have to climb the divisions?","replies":[]}
