Before these started happening I almost never got lag spikes, but I think it has something to do with the new client update. I checked with my ip and riot at the same time and while yes with the provider I got 2-3 ms and with riot I got 70 but then jumps on riots end to 250 and above. So i believe this is a riot problem because I've heard of many more people complaining in game about this and it should be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T22:32:07.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client and game are separate applications, so it should really impact each other.  This seems more like a degrading connection to the game server, like packet loss.  For this case, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for an analysis of what's going on.  Let me know what you find, and we'll go from there!","replies":[{"poster":"boocifer","date":"2017-05-12T20:20:42.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I checked with the log reader and one of the most recent times had a major issue with packet loss. This is odd to me because on this game its the only one where I've had these issues. I've been playing on games like; The Division, Squad, Overwatch, Player Unknown's Battleground, and Elder Scrolls Online. I'm curious as to why this game is the only one that I've had issues with packet loss. Also when running the ping test on my command prompt ( ping 216.52.241.254 -t ) it shows the same in game happenings with my ping, from jumps from 56 ms to 300 ms. I'm guessing this is the packet loss but why this game if no other game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sodedecokenzah","date":"2017-05-12T21:33:28.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exact same situation I'm in! My internet runs perfectly for every other thing I choose to do but as soon as I get into a game of league with other players I get huge lag spikes, more often than not. I tried everything and even replaced my router thinking that it was a problem on my end but to no avail I still have constant ping issues. It seems like if it isn't happening to top league streamers Riot doesn't seem to care. I'm from south Texas and I'm thinking it may be an issue with the Dallas hub.","replies":[{"poster":"boocifer","date":"2017-05-25T20:54:38.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, im in Tulsa, Riot probably doesnt care about the midwest people. just waiting on dyrus to notice it.","replies":[]}]}]}
