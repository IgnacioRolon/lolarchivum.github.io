When I open the store or a profile it just freezes and doesn't show anything and if I'm lucky enough it loads in 10 minutes but then when I press something it freezes again. It just suddenly started around 3 - 4 days ago, initially I just got random lag spikes in game but now it's a lot worse. My internet is as normal as ever so the problem is not from there","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-24T23:27:02.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network seems to be struggling to reach the game server, and this may likely degrade to the point of failing to connect at all.    Though your internet is normal, you can still have problems reaching specific servers.  My recommendation would be to go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot any local issues or blocks that might cause this.  Be sure to test it in a custom game though to prevent any penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhaelys","date":"2017-06-25T16:11:10.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My internet quality has absolutely nothing to do with this so I don't feel the need to check guides. I am not the only one experiencing this issue too so the ones that need to check the quality of their servers are Riot themselves","replies":[]}]}]}
