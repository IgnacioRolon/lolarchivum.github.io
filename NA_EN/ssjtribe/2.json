Imagine Jax having his own real upgradeable weapons at the store, similar to Vik&#039;s HexCore, or Gangplanks ult upgrades. However, Jax can only purchase one of these items. Maybe a Broadsword that grants AD. A Trident that grants attack speed. A Bo Staff that grants AP. A bow that makes him ranged? Or even a magical lamppost that increases his armor and magic resist. It could anything really.\n\nHis skills would likely stay the same but the rest of your build is heavily influenced by which of these weapons you purchase. I feel it&#039;d be a cool idea and really encourage build diversity.","replies":[{"poster":"Ionian Vulpix","date":"2017-03-31T22:42:57.359+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change the items from real weapons to Lampost, Fishing Rod, Spatula, and a throwing potato for ranged.","replies":[{"poster":"SSJTribe","date":"2017-03-31T22:51:21.067+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hire this person asap","replies":[]},{"poster":"RFPSHBYQl7","date":"2017-04-01T07:33:30.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd constantly spam adc Jax.
