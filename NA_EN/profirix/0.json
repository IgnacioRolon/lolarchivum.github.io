I had to give him up as a support because his impact in low/mid elo games is just too poor. He needs to be buffed.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I know that this is purely experimental and on the test server, but seeing potential nerfs of this caliber are unsettling for someone who loves playing the champion and wants to be able to main him again as a support. With a cooldown that high, I cant pull off some of the cool regurgitate poke damage without being useless for the next 26 seconds.\n\nEDIT: Maple Nectar released these potential changes further down in this post:\n\nTongue Lash (Q)\nSlow Duration :: 2 >>> 1.5\nCooldown :: 6 >>> 5\n\nDevour / Regurgitate (W)\nDamage :: 20/23/26/29/32% (+2% per 100AP) >>> 27/29/31/33/35% (+1% per 100AP)\nCooldown :: 14/13/12/11/10 >>> 28/25/22/19/16\nCost :: 90 >>> 60\nNEW :: Triggers half its normal cooldown on enemy cast\n\nIt makes me a little bit happier to see the offensive use of the devour spell not get punished as much. Similarly, the mana cost buff is a blessing considering that 90 mana with Tahm's small mana pool is a nice change.\n\nFINAL EDIT: And it looks like they did away with any form of buff in the 8.16 patch notes. The damage buff to W was removed. I'd argue that tongue lash changes aren't really a buff because of his small mana pool and poor mana regeneration but at this point I think I'm going to take a break from League. Riot has killed my desire to keep trying to improve.","replies":[{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2018-07-25T02:00:11.120+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nani the fuck riot. 26 second cd on a non-ult skill?

In fact I dont think hes viable toplane anymore. Toplane kench is worse than support kench. You dont provide good peel for your allies or much cc if you play him like a fighter. Additionally, if you go against bruisers they usually outscale him and will be more useful in the lategame. In the lategame all you can do is just devour for your allies. Not only that, but hes a lot more squishier now from his nerfs, especially  bruisers who go conqueror against him.  \n\nToplane kench is not the reason they nerfed him. HE was nerfed as a toplaner a long time ago when he first was released and they changed him to be more viable  as a support. Now they are just  trying to nerf his support role.","replies":[{"poster":"Draconian565","date":"2018-07-25T23:53:00.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"^This.\n\nTahm Top cannot build full tank anymore agianst he's against a Klepto or Grasp user.

His \"e\" is nerfed a lot so the healing and shielding is not enough to make him feel  tanky in the early levels. Compared to supports who provide heals and shields, they can give more sustain than tahm kench himself. Now \"e\" just feels like a wasted part of his kit. It's like a weaker version Locket of The Iron Solari and Redemption that's part of his kit. I rather save my mana now to cast \"e\"  than to use it. Might as well have a support like janna or soraka give me bigger shields or healings than having a part of my kit wasted for small healings and a small shield. No point of having all that grey shield for healing when pyke can heal a lot more of the grey health and supports who can heal/shield me more. \n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"THE D1C","date":"2018-07-25T10:51:09.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LagLwtvo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-25T02:00:11.120+0000)\n>\n> Nani the fuck riot. 26 second cd on a non-ult skill?

It also wouldn't change his pushing power by much because Tahm's mana pool is so small so he would only get 3 Ws off at Lv1. At Lv18, he would only get 9 Ws off on minion waves. It's nice in occasional situations when u just need to push the wave, either as a support or a top laner. \n\nThat or if the ally is CC'd, add another 3 seconds onto the current CD, preventing saves every time and extending the duration of the W.

With Skarner he has limited options as well, but for Tahm the only punishment is that he is significantly slowed for the duration, which usually won't even matter because he's in the middle of a 1v1 or 2v2 that just turned into a 1v0 or a 2v1.\n\nIncreasing the cooldown to almost 30 seconds for a basic ability forces you to max it first. Won't that just mean there is LESS interaction between Tahm Kench and his laners as his Q is less powerful so he has fewer reasons to even try and harass and will just stay back and eat his ally whenever something goes wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Draconian565","date":"2018-07-26T03:56:28.373+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"But Tahm needs 3 stacks, every other suppressor is instant. Tahm takes a lot of damage when he's trying to get the three stacks and no one's going to let the carry get stacked on for free (assuming team isn't letting their carry die on purpose).

But there aren't. Tahm Kench is an extremely dangerous champion to 1v1 BECAUSE he has a suppress at level 2 and it is point and click and it lasts for 3 seconds.

By the time you max it to get 3s, you'll be in teamfights, which as the logic suggests, u need 3 stacks while getting beaten down by 5 people.

You aren't going to deal that much damage with Tahm unless the enemy allows you to sit on them for a minute or so. With how much burst is currently present in the meta, your target will be dead long before you put any meaningful damage onto them. Tahm as a support is all about the utility: your slow and your devour either to save allies or ensnare enemies. Then you use your ultimate to reposition or take advantage of an out of place opponent. If you are lucky, the enemy will let you apply 3 stacks of Acquired Taste, but it will likely only be applied by Q and autos since you can't afford to waste your W on poke.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
