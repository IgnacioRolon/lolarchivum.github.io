Leona&#039;s job is one of a peel tank without any disengage. Once she goes in, shes stuck in the fight. Meaning she is more likely to die than many other champions. You aren&#039;t providing her with anything more than a shorter cooldown on a single target stun and a minimal increase in zenith blade root duration. What is the goal here? From what I see, she does significantly less damage on every basic ability, including her passive, to the benefit of slightly more frequent use of a stun. Is that a fair tradeoff, or are you intentionally nerfing Leona?\n\nI ask these questions because I used to play Leona religiously until I discovered that every other tank support does her job better than she does.\n**\nEDIT: Wow, I was not expecting this much feedback, thanks! In response to some of the comments, I want to make it clear that Leona losing damage is not my real concern, it is what she is getting in return. Is the reduced stun cooldown worth the amount of damage she is losing? Zenith blade cooldown is unchanged as well.**","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-07-01T18:27:00.012+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":5,"body":"We're looking to give Leona more stuff to do in a teamfight. At present she blows her combo quickly and then can't contribute much meaningfully until her CDs are back up. Given she's putting herself in the middle of the fight by necessity we'd like her to have things she can do there that matter, hence the auto attack reward on the ult and the CD decrease on the Q.\n\nIt's also worth calling out that the Q change is a pretty substantial buff. At max rank with 40% CDR it's a difference of a 4.2s CD versus a 3s CD. The stun's got a duration of 1s, so that means the time a target's unstunned drops from 3.2s to 2s. \n\nFinally Leona's also looking very strong in the current patch (6.13). There'll be a mixture of things contributing to that, one of them though's the changes to XP that affects supports in particular. Leona's pretty level dependent to contribute, much more so than most other supports, so it looks like she may have benefited more  than most.

I mean, you only get 5 seconds, and in big fights, you will probably be focused on a single target. Most Leona plays I see there is very little weaving her spells to get that passive damage proc because of how quickly her passive gets applied by her.\n\nOnly giving her 5 seconds to apply up to 5 attacks at max rank doesn't encourage her to hit (let ally proc) hit (let ally proc). in fact, at level 6 when you first get it, its more likely you are going to ult, E to target, AA-Q-AA to get all 3 procs of your extra damage off. Her passive is TECHNICALLY applied 6 times (would be 7 but one of your buffed autos was also your shield bash) if your adc follows up really well, you MIGHT get 3 procs of the passive. MAYBE.

Similar to the idea of how RIOT wants to delay the damage that assassins do so that they don't immediately kill their targets but instead offer their targets a window of potential action (still curious to see how that goes).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kubox","date":"2016-07-01T16:43:45.122+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lowered damage on a tank support at the exchange of more stuns and longer roots is basically the best change one could hope for.\n\nShe lost damage that she didn't care about as much as CCing people and now gets better at it. And in the case where she does a good job bot and feeds her carry (and herself), her overall dps got slightly higher in the case where she constantly attacks a target as she does her job.\n\nI dunno why peeps are crying, this mini-rework is clearly a buff in my opinion. She'll be a better pick than Alistar vs single, potentially duo threat comps, while Alistar will still be the go-to pick when you need someone with stronger CC but longer CDs.","replies":[{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2016-07-01T18:16:56.803+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not so much her damage that bothers me as much as her ability to stay on a target.
