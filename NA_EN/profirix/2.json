There are now some changes on the PBE that completely rework Neurotoxin and get rid of the anti-tank mechanic associated with the ability. It is being replaced by a DoT that does 3 ticks of 20/30/40/50/60 (+0.15) magic damage each second (duration doubled against monsters).  \n\nDoes anyone think this might hurt her ability to deal with tanks? I know she has become a lethal assassin, especially with the runeglaive changes. Does this mean though that her Q needs to be completely changed?\n\nI would like to see your thoughts on this. If any Rioters see this, I would like some context on these changes.\n\nEDIT: I realize that the current iteration shows a cooldown of 1 for all ranks. Not sure if this is a false value or actual. That would change my opinion a bit.\n\nEDIT: A lot of us agree that a mana cost reduction would benefit her if this change is implemented.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-08-07T03:02:33.253+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's a good change.

She will do little damage while tacking on a huge mana problem since they are not reducing the cost of the ability. This also greatly impacts her tankier builds meaning there is much more risk for less reward.\n\nIf it is strong, this will be incredibly toxic (heh) in lane as she is able to provide constant pressure without being gated by the fact that she deals less damage when her opponent has less health. She will hurt just as much no matter how close you are to death. Build a tear and you are essentially casting a Cass E without needing to land a skillshot first, ergo little counterplay. Not to mention if this ability works with Muramana it will be totally broken. \n\n I like the idea of a spider character having a DoT, and I also like the idea for lane elise to get buffs, but I don't want her to be broken or gutted in the process.

Think about it this way. Liandry's ticks for 3 seconds after the last tick of damage from an ability. Making an ability DoT effectively refreshes the Liandry's passive over and over again until the 3 seconds of the Q are over. I'm pretty sure the same thing works with Rylai's as the slow refreshes with each tick until the damage expires and then it will still slow for 1 second after the last tick of the Q.
