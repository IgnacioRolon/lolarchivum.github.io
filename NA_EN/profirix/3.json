Why do you think that is?\r\n\r\nIt boils down to 2 main things:\r\n\r\n1. He is an immobile champion. Sure he has all kinds of CC, but being immobile has a huge price even if you build him full tank. Most popular and successful champions in League have high mobility, frequent-use gap closers, or dodge moves. Cho has none of these things. Ultimately if a teamfight shifts, he finds himself stuck behind everyone else in an advance or retreat. He can peel fairly well against enemies who are pursuing, however he suffers tremendously when trying to predict enemy movement in a standard poke scenario.\r\n\r\n2. Reliability of his abilities. This partially coincides with point 1, but trying to land Rupture or Feral Scream against the most played champions in League today is much more difficult than it used to be. Granted, the reward (hard cc combined with a slow and a silence) are valuable, but he pays a heavy price for missing those abilities, which frankly are too easy to dodge. \r\n\r\nUltimately, he won&#039;t see more play or greater success until some reliability is put back into his kit. The Feral Scream changes many patches ago ripped away the only reliable ability he had (I&#039;m not saying it wasn&#039;t necessary). But if Riot really wants to address his low win rate, they need to focus more on his reliability and less on pure stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Zankren","date":"2017-04-06T22:38:57.587+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.

Given that he would have all three of his AOE abilities still (one would just be a slow instead of a silence, I don't see how it would hurt his jungle clear.

A cone of slow would be near useless because they're still going to dash away from Q.\n\nCho gets free, constant dps from his current E. It costs no mana and happens every auto. In addition by switching it to his passive you make it so it ranks up by level instead of by rank. Do not argue that he could still do as much damage with it, that would be broken and unhealthy gameplay. In addition to fucking the mana cost on his clear speed you've also taken away his mana sustain and health sustain by removing his old passive.\n\nFurthermore Cho has a very large melee true damage nuke. If Cho get's in melee range of a carry they're probably dead. So what good is a melee silence going to do for him? Nothing. His ranged silence helps him get into range by stopping people from dashing or blinking away (therefore stopping them from dashing out of his Q). Cho can get a slow on W by buying a Rylais, so we can add lowering itemization choices to the list of reasons why it's bad.\n\nYour change butchers his early game, and provides no more reliability. He loses a ranged aoe silence, sustain and the option of early wave-clear (since as a passive he can't rank vorpal spikes up first). In return he gains an aoe slow and a melee silence. \n\nDoes that really sound like a reliability buff to you?
