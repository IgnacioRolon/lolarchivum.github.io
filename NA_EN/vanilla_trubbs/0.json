Stuff like that falls under the zero-tolerance policy and leads to an escalation to a 2-week ban as you shouldn't need a warning to know that it's unacceptable. If you didn't resort to the insults then this game wouldn't be considered punish worthy. Next time if someone is acting up just mute/ignore them, report them and move on rather than get into an argument with them or attempt to egg them on with poor behavior of your own.\n\nAlso to answer your OPs question Riot tried perma-mutes in the past and they didn't work since most people simply resorted to gameplay altering means of harassing other players when they couldn't do so in chat. From [Riot Tantram:](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000) \n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this &#x27;large restriction&#x27; category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\nUltimately though it's not Riot's job to control your behavior for you: that honor falls to you and you alone. You can seek out help in learning to control your behavior, but you can't expect others to do it for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Trubbs","date":"2018-08-18T13:59:30.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"Next time if someone is acting up just mute/ignore them, report them and move on rather than get into an argument with them or attempt to egg them on with poor behavior of your own.\"\n\nSpread those cheeks, grin, and bear it.

Fighting fire with fire is **NOT** handling the situation in a mature fashion. If you must rage then just do so at the screen instead of in the chat, as that way you can vent your frustrations without compromising your teams chances of success. Also, context doesn't matter here since ultimately you are responsible for your own behavior, and even if it did under what circumstances is calling someone a racial slur acceptable? Answer: none.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mtothe6thpower","date":"2018-08-18T00:43:16.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best toggle is you learning self control.

Your use of adrenaline is *not* this - you are using adrenaline the **hormone** to attempt to justify your actions.\n\n----\nNow that the science is laid out, I'd like to point out that you not once have said that you are responsible for changing your attitude and control yourself. As you admit, you're asking for a feature that would bandaid your problem, instead of going to the hospital. I'm not saying you're a bad person - I've never once said that here - however I **am** saying that it appears you refuse to control yourself and are thus asking others to help you.\n\nRiot is under no obligation to help you control yourself - that's your job as a player. In fact, there are many legitimate reasons they **haven't** implemented any \"chat removal\" style features other than chat restrictions. The largest one being that if you can toggle this on and off, it won't help jack shit - you'll just toggle it back on when you want to flame someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Trubbs","date":"2018-08-18T20:03:34.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I went ahead and looked up the definition of adrenergic:\n\n\"relating to or denoting nerve cells in which epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), or a similar substance acts as a neurotransmitter.\"\n\n\"acts as a neurotransmitter.\"\n\nSo your scientific explanation is clear as mud.\n\nDid you look at my chat log?  I didn't flame anyone, someone taunted me at the end of the match and I called them out on being the %%%%%% that they were being.  This fixation on the words people choose to use is childish and ridiculous.  Adrenaline is my understanding of what causes me to be far more impulsive during and shortly after playing a game like this than I am normally.  I can feel my heart rate increase tremendously during matches and it seems perfectly reasonable to conclude that influences my judgement.  My bad if I'm not using the correct scientific jargon.\n\nI'm not \"taking responsibility\" only because I don't think I did anything wrong.  The wrong behavior is being an asshole.
