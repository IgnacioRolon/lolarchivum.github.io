And we ofc have our own tag. But after the club bug that the clubs did shutdown i have gone offline in the club. And when i go to ''View your Clubs and Chat rooms'' It says ''Create a club''. But i already own a club and my friends can go in the chat and have the tag, but i cant. So i want to see if someone of you have this problem and maybe know how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T23:11:44.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no fix at the moment, but we're looking into a solution,  as this issue popped up after the clubs re-enable.\n\nHit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can better track this until a solution is deployed.
