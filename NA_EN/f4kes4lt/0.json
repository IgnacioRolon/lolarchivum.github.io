Illaoi tells you how to beat her when she uses Q. She yells &quot;Move!&quot; at you. The same goes for fighting her when your jungle ganks. If you two stand still and don&#039;t have cc one of you is most likely going to either use a summoner or die. \r\nIn my opinion Illaoi has one of the best quotes in the game. &quot;We learn from action. Move, or die.&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t want you to worship. I want you to learn.&quot; &quot;I value truth - and barbecue.&quot; just a few examples.\r\nI just love how Illaoi can be aggressive and can encourage you: &quot;Don&#039;t stop!&quot; &quot;Ha! Well done.&quot; &quot;You will be destroyed.&quot; \r\nIllaoi is not a broken champion by herself. Its the players both playing as Illaoi and playing against Illaoi. Well some people might have different opinions on her or everyone. I just like how Illaoi is designed and I hope Riot will keep on delivering on new champs and their lore and personality.\r\n{{champion:420}}{{sticker:sg-jinx}} {{champion:420}}","replies":[]}
