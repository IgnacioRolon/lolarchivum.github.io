It now shows the progress bar as you scroll through the story on the left-hand side.  It also shows the \"cover\" image and the title when you first open the page; these then disappear once you scroll down to the story itself.  It may have changed within the past few days, but I've had a tab open with a story for about a week now meaning to read it.  So it'd definitely pretty recent.\n\nI also noticed that in certain bios/stories with 4 \"related champions\" listed at the bottom, the circles are cut off for some reason.  Check the bottom of Kindred's bio for an example.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Biomarker","date":"2019-01-15T09:01:35.307+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, we did indeed update the story reader recently!

Since it's not \"her\" story, I can see why it wouldn't be on her page, but I think someone who is interested in Lux would be interested in that story, for example.\nI think there should be some kind of separation between stories that are \"about\" that character and stories where they play a small role, although you then have to decide where to draw the line, which is difficult.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Biomarker","date":"2019-01-16T21:39:01.910+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks again for the feedback.
