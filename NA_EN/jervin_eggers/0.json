Can anything be done? Its incredibly frustrating after finally getting to play, getting to promotions, only to be knocked down again when it was a clear and obvious win.

I've personally done this for years, and now its just like putting on a seatbelt in a car, i turn my pc on, and i check for and install if applicable, any windows updates. and i've never had a forced restart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T16:26:04.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you were gone long enough to get marked as a leaver, which the [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats equally because of the negative experiences it causes others.  Even if we wanted to, there's no way to adjust game stats or competitive advantages that could abuse the system.  It's definitely a frustrating circumstance to get an unexpected windows update, but I have hope you'll get through promos!
