When you close/background the app the connection is closed and the app should essentially sleep. If you can check Android's battery graph in settings you should be able to see what has been using more of your batter life. If it does happen to show the League Friends app as using a large percentage, please post a screenshot and we can look into it more.\n\nThanks for contacting us!","replies":[]}]}
