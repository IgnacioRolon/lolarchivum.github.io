Made it to the promos. Once I made it to the promos, Olaf's divine strength in the heavens, was like, you know what Bruh, we're going to make this ultimately harder for you. \n\nOlaf spawns trolls in que. Desired Position or Feed troll. Then out of nowhere, he uses another troll: 25 second champ pick waiter. One who waits to the last moment to pick a champ, and does not communicate it in chat. This is the ultimate troll of all. Now we have 2 people with the same position. Person #2 graciously waited in hopes that person #1 would pick a champ. Rather than risk causing an argument of the Pick Order vs Pref issue that could start a team fight before we hit the rift.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, Olaf, The Devil in Sheeps Clothing, decides, Hey, you know what? and I'm like what Olaf? He's like guess what. As if I am not surprised enough at what is happened 3 picks into the champ select. You won't know this, but your ADC, is about to pick a champ they are 100% unprepared to play with. They actually just bought this champ prior to Queueing up. But I won't tell you this until they're 0/11. Feeling pumped to get on the Rift yet? \n\nThen there is me. I'm not complaining, I'm not commenting, I am just here to play the game. Rally the troops against this War Path Promo from Hell God Olaf. I pick Brand Mind. (Zombie) to be exact! And I am doing my thing, have 145 farm at 20 Min, decent build, I am shoving lane, and rotating, helping the jungler out, and it is just not working out for me. \n\nI realize after 2 team fights this is going to be a tough one. So I battle cry, and rally the troops for a baron! We take it, uncontested. Feeling good yet? Yes! Pumped! about to push lane and take a turret! Right? Wrong. \n\nThe crashing sound of Olaf's hammer is enough to kill me. He tells me that our jungle, just decided to go Back and buy, but never really comes back to the game. The silent disconnect of death. I'm already demoralized from Olaf earlier, and with all my sanity I put everything I had into a team fight, we lost. The counter attacked, and Olaf laughed hysterically. \n\nNeedless to say, it was hard fought, 4v5 but after that loss, I snowballed out of control and made it all the way back to Silver 5 where I tried to climb Sunday and Monday with little to no success.\n\nGood news, I have made it to Silver after being in Bronze for 1 season.\n\nThat's improvement right?{{champion:2}} {{item:3022}} {{summoner:3}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2014-11-11T14:51:02.295+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> so I call up my friend to duo with me so I have at least 2 people in the game who won't be silly.\n\nThis was your mistake!!!\n\nDuoing sets the MMR of your remaining teammates lower than the MMR of the other team.

I know that you deal with baddies in a lot of games (trust me, I know), but you have to learn how to play with them and how to take charge of the game so you can lead your team to victory. I started at bronze 5 this season and made it to plat 4.  On my smurf I got to silver 1 in provisionals and got to gold 8 games later. The best thing for you to do is to watch the pros play and look at their playing style. My suggestion to you is to start playing carry lanes. One of the easiest ways to carry is going jungle in my opinion. You can get every lane fed and then you can make all the decisions about objectives easier seeing as the jungler usually leads the game. Sorry you didn't make it though dude.
