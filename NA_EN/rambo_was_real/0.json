But now the game keeps the high ping and Suddenly Attempting to reconnect. I lost 5 games for that issue.. My point here is that i play on Euw server and i am from Cyprus. Servers are too far away and in our country our internet speed isnt that good enought. I have like 1Mb/s connection. \r\n\r\nWe need a server to connect closer to us.. Other players play with 3 ms or 40ms ..i play with 200ms sometimes and in good days i play with 100ms .. Pls do something. You have billions but u cant open a server closer to us so we cant enjoy the game ?.. Please :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T22:44:32.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the issues that prevent us from opening more servers stem from cost vs efficiency as well as trying to find a physical location to host the server itself. We can still run a few troubleshooting steps to see if we can get you a stronger connection though! Run through this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) paying extra attention to the steps on port forwarding and let me know if that helps at all.","replies":[]}]}
