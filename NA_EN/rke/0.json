Someone dodges or a game isn't accepted and I reset the queue.\nBut I shouldn't have to.\n\nAs for how you don't believe it. During my time with draft pick, jungle was the second least contested role (in some cases supp was more contested). And was also the role many were least comfortable with filling if support vs jg were their options.\nAt that point annie, morgana, fiddle, nid and zyra were pickable hyper carry supports so many didn't really object to it.\nAs they'd simply \"support\" if you catch my drift.\n\nAs for complaining about playing support. I don't mind support at all. I just prefer to do it from the jungle. Only my support jg champ pool is less than ideal atm due to the current jungle state/overall meta.\nIf I had to choose a position to never play, it'd be adc followed by mid/sup/top/jg (sup and top r basically equal).\n\n\nI'm instead voicing for the games in which people r autofilled way out of their comfort zone. If you're autofilled from jg to top/sup there are plenty of champs that have similar styles and spells to help last hit.\nBut chuck a supp/jg into adc against an adc main and you're in for a world of hurt.\n\nAdd to that the cases where players are filled into someone elses pref and vice versa and you have a broken system. (I have indeed had a top filled to adc and an adc filled to top in the same game and on the same team)\n\n\nWhen draft was around I could play every role decently. But everyone had to be able to play every role decently, not just me. That was the expectation.\nNow you expect to main 2 roles and after a year without 3 other roles I adjusted as such.\nIt simply isn't time efficient to work at being effective in every position just in case you get auto filled.\n\n\nIf I were to remake the system I'd make it complex with 6 possible preferences one of which being fill. You could opt out of one role only if you chose to fill.\nWith 4-5 prefences it raises the bar on everyone to play and potentially decreases queue times as there'd be no such thing as auto fill.\nIf 5 people had supp last pref it would stick someone there based on winrate when placed there (they'd be most comfortable there theoretically)","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-04-10T15:01:35.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KrakenKnight,realm=OCE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=BAbNPzFM,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2017-04-10T06:58:30.024+0000)\n>\n> When draft was around I could play every role decently.

Placing people into roles based on winrate is a really bad idea and creates bizarre ways to game the system (i.e. throwing every time you get support so the game never puts you there) and destroys MMR integrity in a way that hurts people willing to fill as a support the most.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anraton","date":"2017-04-10T07:54:56.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> With 4-5 prefences it raises the bar on everyone to play and potentially decreases queue times as there&#x27;d be no such thing as auto fill.\n> If 5 people had supp last pref it would stick someone there based on winrate when placed there (they&#x27;d be most comfortable there theoretically)\n\nResulting in support trying to see another lane to be autofilled to support again? :-D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
