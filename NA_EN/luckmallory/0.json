Marksmen are next. The game is evolving and I think it is great. \r\n\r\nImagine if Riot didn&#039;t implement champions with a ton of mobility, loaded kits, or unique abilities. Heimer would be pick or ban because no one would be able to touch him. Ashe would be the best ADC in the game right now. The list goes on. \r\n\r\nMy only beef with Riot is that they do all these awesome updates and put out these great champs but dont update the old champs to kee pthem fresh and viable as the game switches pace and direction.\r\n\r\nIf riot kept up on that the game would be amazing and balanced but as it is right now, new champions/reworked champions get these insane kits while they never update old champion&#039;s kits like Anivia or Pantheon. Can you win with those champions? yeah sure you can. Is it harder? yeah it is. Why pick Anivia when you can pick Azir whos kit is way more overloaded then Anivia does Anivia&#039;s zoning job better, and has mobility?\r\n\r\nMy point is that I think everyone is getting mad over the Juggernauts because they throw the game into a completely new direction and people want to hold onto the old Champions and the old way of the game. \r\n\r\nPeople need to accept that a game evolves and is normally for the better\r\n\r\nRiot needs to accept that if they change a game this heavily they need to be prepared to update the old things in the game","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-09-03T17:11:41.186+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Riot needs to accept that if they change a game this heavily they need to be prepared to update the old things in the game\n\nWe totally agree with you on this. The unfortunate fact of the matter is there is a lot of \"old\" stuff in the game to update, and it really does take a good share of time to get to them all. I know the player base doesn't always agree with some of the champions we choose for updates, but we do try to choose ones that we think are in the most need. As to champions like Anivia or Pantheon, these are characters that commonly come up in \"who should we update next\" meetings, so they're definitely not off the radar.\n\nAs to Juggernauts and player sentiment around them, my personal opinion is that we probably still have some fine tuning follow-up to do to them in the upcoming patches, and then hopefully they'll be in a good long term spot. The goal of big changes like the Juggernaut changes is definitely to find these somewhat antiquated characters a new niche/home in the game, and we are pretty fully aware we won't hit the mark on all of them, especially on the first try. I'm personally pretty excited for pre-season, because as a designer on champions, it means I have a lot more freedom to explore ideas for champions without them being such a huge risk to game balance down the stretch.","replies":[{"poster":"luckmallory","date":"2015-09-03T17:36:46.846+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"I appreciate the response and I do agree most times with your direction.

Go through the RedTracker and have a gander at all of the stupid questions getting answered every day, or inflammatory posts with dozens or hundreds of upvotes. You got those comments because \"Am I the only one who likes the thing a lot of people obviously like!?!\" posts are low-effort clickbait. Something like this will always appeal to the lowest common denominator, inspiring reactions of \"but I like the thing too!\" responses.\n\nAnd yet again, you don't address the point, instead waving your e-peen and pretending that's rebuttal enough.","replies":[{"poster":"luckmallory","date":"2015-09-03T22:38:20.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Literally the past week all the forums were were people bashing Riot about how broken the juggernauts were and how shitty Riot is for doing this and making broken champions with helping older champions.
