So what do they do? give it to a rework. \r\nI can hear you saying, &quot;But you need to wait a few seconds to make it count!&quot; A 65% slow is still very strong, especially when paired with a point a click gap closer post 6 that automatically procs it when she uses her e. \r\nPre 6, she is garbage. she suffers from the same things that jungle nasus suffers from: no real gap closer. without it, she is reliant on her laner to set up for her.\r\nShe also has no stealth pre 6, which means no early pressure. before, when evelynn was strong, you had to be careful pushing up, because she might suddenly show up behind you and pop you. That&#039;s gone now, and with it, it feels like a core piece of her identity is gone.\r\n\r\nAn important thing is that with invisibility and a gap closer, she can burst you down before you even realize she&#039;s there. Sound familiar? {{champion:29}} \r\nOld eve&#039;s lack of a gap closer kept her ganks balanced around the fact that she would have to walk so close you would see her.\r\nHer new q is good though. adds more counterplay and burst potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAm I biased? Probably. But the new evelynn feels like its going to be like renekton. back and forth from too weak to too strong, with no middle ground.","replies":[]}
