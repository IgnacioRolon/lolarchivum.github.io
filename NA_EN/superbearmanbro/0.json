Whereas a few problems I've read on the subject has been mostly on the launcher, my problem is what happens after I press \"play\", or rather, what isn't happening. I have uninstalled LoL from my mac, twice. I have tried repairing it multiple times, switched regions, languages, all with no progress. I had just played last night before the patch update and now I cant even get to the login screen. Has anyone received any word from riot as of yet? And if not, anyone having better luck than I am? I have the day off, the girlfriend is away for the day, and the weather is as crappy as it gets. If there was ever a day where League was my plans, TODAY WAS THAT DAY!

Good news was after the first time and restarting everything worked fine.
