Why do you only get worked up over my mistake?\r\n\r\nBut lately I've found myself tired, playing ranked or any 5v5 gamemode, normal, normal draft , ranked draft, because of people trolling intentionally because they don't get the lane(or whatever reason) they want and after having that in so many games, \r\nI will not deny I was straight up toxic to people, to the troll and to innocent players  in future games, because i was scared of someone trolling. In fact this is why I decided to quit league.\r\nIt feels like I've gotten more toxic and toxic over these 2.5 years and I don't like it, so I am quitting.\r\n\r\nLeague has been a fun experience, from just playing for fun in the beginning to when i watched TSM(as of then) Xpecials stream around Early season 3 and discovered e-sports, I was psyched, e-sports was the coolest thing to me and I will watch season 5 NA&amp;EU LCS because I find it fun and interesting, I might come back to play future gamemodes as I loved snowdown,shurima and urf as they were the one I was actually having fun with lately, the opposite of what I felt in ranked as I was scared of troll pickers, intentional feeders etc \r\n it was putting me on edge.\r\n\r\nI Want to thank the League community for having me and I apologize for ruining someones experience in games.\r\nI Also hope Riot makes it a better community as of late I think they are going in the right direction but it's far from good still.\r\nGood bye and merry christmas in advance.\r\n\r\nBest Wishes  \r\nNekotipcat NA \r\nNekotipcat EUW \r\nNekotipcat EUNE","replies":[]}
