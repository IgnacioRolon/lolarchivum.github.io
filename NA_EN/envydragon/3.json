But J4 has much stronger weaknesses and counters.\n\nRight now I don't agree with any number changes or statistics being changed on Lee. I don't feel that will help his problem. I feel that more than anything else, Lee needs an identity. Currently he's a jungler that can fit in any comp, and do literally everything required for the team. He can assassinate, tank, peel, and split. Because of all of these capabilites you can't really identify the type of role Lee plays in a game because he can do them all WELL. This is honestly the biggest problem. The fact that lee can do all of those things so well is extremely unhealthy for the game. It wouldn't be too bad if he played one or two roles decently since that is normal generally, however the fact that he can play any role the team requires, too fit a gap in the teams comp is very bad for the game and greatly reduces counterplay. \n\nWhereas champions are generally puzzle pieces that can fit together to form a team comp, good or bad, lee is a puzzle piece that can fit universally into any comp. Pick Lee in a game, top or jungle, and you automatically have an option to play tanky, be an assassin, bruiser or in case of having a high damage support with low peel (annie etc.) play a somewhat supporting role. Lee has too much in his kit that allows him to fulfill all roles. burst, utility, dps, hard cc, soft cc, and poke. He has strong engage and strong disengage and perhaps more than anything else he has the ability to adapt to almost any situation. So until an identity is defined for Lee I feel that he won't really ever be balanced","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-01-26T21:42:36.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no problem with there being champions that fit into most comps. As long as they are not the best at that roll. \n\nA champion that fits many rolls would be one  you would pick early in your comp so the enemy doesn't know how to counter you right away. \n\nLee does already fit this to a point. But he excels at two things. Mobility and early game. How many champs can compete with him in the early game? How many can have as strong of ganks as he can? \n\nJ4 comes close, but has no where near the safety and his mobility is much more situational. \n\nXin probably as as strong of ganks. But like J4, he is much more limited in how he can do things. And is even less safe in almost every regard. \n\nAs long as Lee gets to be so much safer than these two, he will always be that much stronger. Xin and J4 can land their gank easier. But they are punished so much more for it. Reduce this safety of Lee's and I think he'd become much more balanced as a champion. \n\nThis range reduction also gives players more time to avoid his Q when he does gank. This still leaves ward hopping to start the gank an option as well. It's not the end of his ability to gank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2015-01-27T05:00:04.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jarvans damage on ult is single target.
