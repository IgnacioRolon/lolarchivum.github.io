Nobody fucking listens.\n\nKalista&#039;s problem is _her kit._ She needs a rework. With a HACKSAW. Changing her numbers won&#039;t do shit when she gets free skillshot dodges every autoattack and her E stacks indefinitely (making it literally just a better Twitch E).\n\nEkko _has buffs on PBE_. The \"utility assassin\" who can still burst people risk-free is getting buffed despite a top-tier ban rate. Why? Good fucking question. If only we could talk to the reds about it.\n\nThe Magus Enchant (which was useable by the one AP jungler out there) got replaced by the Runeglaive enchant (which was useable by Mid Ezreal), allowing an exploit and solving nothing.\n\nThe Zeke&#039;s rework is going to ruin bot lane in favor of kill lanes. There&#039;s no counterplay. You just get 50% crit for free.\n\nA lot of the champions and backstory are really cool, but we aren&#039;t allowed to see any of it except for in the week leading up to a new champion release.\n\nBack in S2/S3, you used to be able to go on the forums and see reds responding frequently to player issues. If a champ was OP, or an item was OP, we could get someone in to say what was happening to fix it or why the changes were happening the way they were. And above all, the reds _listened._ If a change was unpopular, it would be reverted. Remember Slay Belle Katarina? People complained about her poledance recall. _So they changed it._\n\nI&#039;m not being super coherent here, and I know that. I just... fuck. I&#039;m sick of seeing a Kalista on the enemy team and knowing my bot lane is lost. I&#039;m sick of champion releases meaning every game is a mirror match, with the new champ having 1000% more impact than any other player. I&#039;m sick of seeing problems that every single fucking player agrees on, and seeing them go completely unaddressed.\n\nWhere are replays?\n\nWhere is Ranked Dominion?\n\nWhen are you fixing Quinn&#039;s autoattack animation? (I know, this one&#039;s a little less oft-seen. Most people played her, realized she was shit, and didn&#039;t think on why.)\n\nWhen are we getting lore?\n\nWhen is Tribunal coming back?\n\nWhen are we getting feedback to know that a player has been punished for our reports?\n\nWhen can I finally play League again without the certainty that my 45-minute game is going to be ruined by one player, on my team or the other team, either through their behavior or their champion picks?\n\nFour years is too long to be asking some of these questions. And the things that kept me satisfied with a lack of an answer are starting to fade away.\n\nI&#039;m gonna go play Heroes of the Storm, I think. It&#039;s kinda sad when Blizzard has more community interaction now than Riot does.\n\nEDIT FOR SURPRISING AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK: Wow, I actually kind of expected this to die off... Only reason I posted was to vent.\n\nTo the people saying \"recent news posts have mentioned their plans for the tribunal\", I just went through the news feed and the most recent post that even mentions the PB&J team is [this one](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/new-player-reform-system-heads-testing), which predates Ekko.\n\nYes, we've been told there are plans for the Tribunal, but - and correct me here if I'm wrong - we don't actually have an ETA. Keep in mind that \"soon, pending tech work\" is exactly the same thing we were told about expanded lore... when the Shurima update went live last September.\n\nLeague is the only game I've ever stuck with for more than a year or two, and I stuck with it because the game always felt like it was expanding and getting better. Old problems were being erased, new issues were being addressed and tweaked. Now old problems get ignored (or set aside for literally months on end until they can be redone from the ground up), new problems are getting progressively WORSE, and sweeping changes are made without warning and ignorant of critical feedback.\n\nEvery player seems to recognize this. No one in a position to change things seems to care.","replies":[{"poster":"Brahmsauce","date":"2015-07-15T05:35:27.340+0000","up_votes":181,"down_votes":7,"body":"\" It's kinda sad when Blizzard has more community interaction now than Riot does.\"\n\nOuch.{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-07-15T19:36:08.449+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":30,"body":"Blizzard entertainment, established 1991 with a long list of games under their belt.\n\nRiot games, operating since 2006 with a single game to their name.\n\nYeah, Blizzard is a bit better with communication, they've been around long enough and are big enough that dedicating a department to community interaction is nothing to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Epilogue of Life","date":"2015-07-15T19:57:12.544+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":3,"body":"You'd think managing the feedbacks of a single game would be easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Gilded Blade","date":"2015-07-16T04:29:18.713+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quick someone get me a mic, I need to drop something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-07-15T21:01:18.111+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blizzard isn't Blizzard anymore, it's Activision (since 2008).

Their business relies on keeping us as community happy, yes. However their business is made up of people, and presumably those people have feelings and preferences of their own. Presumably they're not soul-less machines who exist to either screw us over or bend to our every whim. They have feelings, they have limits, and I'd imagine their jobs can get rather stressful at times. Maybe not often since it's not a handful of guys working out of one of their basements or anything, but still. I'd imagine there's some pretty significant challenges now and again. But I'm rambling...\n\nMy point is...perhaps they're not communicating because they've found that no matter what they say, the community is going to whine/complain/ask for something else/be angry at them?\n\nSince Blizzard was mentioned, let's look at Ghostcrawler.\n\nGreg seems like a cool guy for the most part. yes, yes, wah wah ruined mages ruined wow wah wah cry whine complain wah. Possibly poor decisions doesn't change the fact that the guy seems cool, and during my years on WoW I remember him being one of the most active blizzard employees in terms of interacting with the community. Which, needless to say, was whiny and assinine to him at just about every turn. PARTICULARLY when he had to deliver or justify bad news such as nerfs or other major changes.\n\nI remember when I first started reading his posts, he was really very reasonable. He was polite, tried to respond to everyone he could, tried to address valid concerns, etc. But over the years I noticed he....changed. The language of his posts got more blunt, a little sharper. It was a slow progression, really. A creeping little change. It wasn't like he just woke up one day and decided to be colder towards the community, I think. To me it felt like he just....got worn down.\n\nHe got worn down by the constant, never-ending, bitching, moaning, crying, raging, stupid questions, unrealistic demands, snide remarks. You want flying, now you don't, you want harder dungeons, now you don't, you want attunements back and rep-grinding to be less tedious and new zones and bgs to be balanced because ROGUES ARE BULLSHIT! but next week it'll be warlocks and the week after that it's hunters because it's ALWAYS hunters and every change needs to be NOW NOW NOW all at the same time...\n\nGiven attitudes like that, I felt like it was no surprise the tone of his posts had changed. Given that League's community has people with similar attitudes, it would be of no surprise to me that Rioters don't feel comfortable posting much if at all anymore. At least as themselves.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI understand where the OP is coming from. It seems like Riot doesn't care to interact with us much anymore and that's one hell of a shame. A lot of promises have in fact been left undelivered. But for years we've been doing the whole 'gnash our teeth, cry and rage, threaten to quit' dance over stuff and where has it led us to? What has it gotten us? What was the price we paid?\n\nSure, we may have gotten some things we as a community really wanted or felt the game needed, but it appears to be at the cost of interaction with developers. They're either so busy or we're so hostile as a community that they're driven away. They may also not care, I'm perfectly willing to concede that as a possibility. If they don't, I think it's also somewhat understandable. A community this size, with everyone yelling for something different constantly? It would be no surprise to me if we're....'background noise' so to speak by now.\n\nI suppose my point is that perhaps part of the reason they don't interact with us is because of our attitudes. Perhaps we need to find a better way to express ourselves and how we feel towards things. Perhaps we should prioritize better, push for the right things that give us long-term benefit such as a better client, better servers (which we're getting by the way), and more transparency in the development process. (the latter could possibly be used to help understand why we're seeing more Red posts or why we're NOT seeing more Red posts, or when is a good time to address certain issues.)\n\nSaying \"This game has tons of problems! I QUIT!\" Is valid, and it's an understandable thing to do. But if that's all we're going to ever do, is it any surprise they don't talk to us?","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2015-07-16T16:41:44.437+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":13,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSince you guys are talking about me by name, I figured I would jump in here.\n\nFirst, there appears to be some misperception that players somehow chased me away from communicating.

This entire thread would have been better off if you had said nothing, because when i read your wall of text that's exactly what i was able to take away from it.. nothing. The fact the player base can't even ask you on the companies official forum you work for is appalling to say the least. You say an angry forum rant doesn't hurt your feelings, yet here you are responding to the one, single, only person who called you specifically out. \n\nUsing the forums search feature after typing in \"Ghostcrawler\" and checking the \"has rioters comments\" box, we can see that in the past year alone, you not once a single time ever posted in any thread that did not specifcally call you out. The fact is, you only comment on threads when they make you look shitty which in turn, makes you look even more shitty. \n\nRiven was recently disabled and the player base has never been more exited about a champion being disabled. with the exception of zed, Ive never actually had seen more than one trending post about somebodys glee about any champion being disabled and here we are with (from my anecdotal evidence) the total likes from each thread totaling atleast to 1k with people commenting \"So glad im going to play ranked now\". And yet there isnt a single rioter post in any of them. What are you silently contemplating when you read that? better buff ekko?\n\nBack to my original point and the original posters, aka the ones that matter, Is that riot is failing to communicate to its playerbase, and when it does, it's oftentimes vague or downright not truthful. I don't know how common human decency is something that needs to be worked on for a company as a whole, but, if you don't know how long lol replays are going to take, if you can't figure out that the community doesn't like champions with overstuffed kits, if you are going to delete lore with almost no intention on ever replacing it, then just tell us. Don't ask me to \"hit you up on twitter\" for answers to things that pertain to this game. Whats wrong with the boards here? Don't say your a hardened developer that's immune to forum rants because that's a lie. \n\nA good start to changing around the negative \"misconception\" that's somehow plaguing you, or any rioter for that matter, would to be to answer ANY of the ops post without vague bullshit. You could for instance, give us an actual time window on LoL replays by saying next  november with a possibility its dropping early december, or by telling us that the guy that types lore will have his first actual paragraph (re: not 2 lines of shit) done by the end of this month.

That's just unrealistic to expect that. Yeah, they've made some mistakes, any other game company has, and will continue till they close their doors to said respective companies. Thing is though...gaming communities have changed over the years, and it's hard for most game companies to keep up with the mindset of each community. What kinds of changes you ask? \n\n1. Shorter tempered players that expect results without understanding the costs to achieve those results, although not to say Riot can't improve on some areas regardless. I do think they should push some priorities around and get things fixed up, but there are some people that are just being overly hostile about it all.\n\n2. Younger player-base on average;higher likelihood for ragers, afkers, flamers, etc... you know what to expect in a competitive environment by now. Many of the younger players believe in zero consequences for their actions, and get away with whatever they can given the chance. Hopefully Tribunal finishes up soon to fix this issue.\n\n3. An ever changing game that is expected to stay almost completely balanced. There ARE people that expect exactly just that, nigh-perfect balance. I won't deny there's design and balance oversights that have been made, but on the whole, the game's a lot more balanced than most give it credit for. Back in the days of early DotA(man...that makes me feel old now... D: )there were all kinds of silly imbalances. With time comes experience and such, but still...iteration takes experimentation and trial/error.\n\n4. Changing with the times. Not only league, but other games as well have had to adapt to different factors. Sometimes mistakes were made, but I think Riot's done well on the most part. DotA 2 is going along well quite nicely, too. Both aren't without their hiccups though. \n\nIf anyone hear is truly unhappy with what they are experiencing, I'm sorry that you feel that way, its a horrible feeling for sure. Spend your time in a place that you feel is valuable, even if its not here. Speak out on topics that you feel you can make a difference in, just think how you want to portray your feelings and thoughts. For the others that just want to sit and be angry...sorry. Raging at a game company isn't just going to make things magically change and become some perfect product because you said so. Speaking out about real issues(and there always are going to be some)is good, just whining about them is a whole different story. I guarantee that most companies do take what's said to heart. How they apply it is the real question and challenge.\n\nIn the end, not everyone is going to be happy. There's always going to be some absolutely unsatisfied person that screams injustice, same as that one guy that swears their favorite game knows no wrongs. As a player of many games over my whole youth, I know the feelings both sides have. I want to see Riot step up their game, shock people, and just blow them away with new and well-made content. Same goes for Blizzard, Nintendo, Microsoft and even Sony games. Because I'm a gamer, through and through. That means that I have a healthy respect AND understanding of the games I've lived and grew up with over my life. I have expectations, but also an understanding of the realities of the gaming world as a whole. I have faith that Riot will improve in the areas that they need to, and will give us solid reasoning as to why. It's part of being a real gamer, taking the good with the bad, and sticking through with the companies you care about in video games!\n\nDon't let us down Riot, we're here for a reason!

Their business relies on keeping us as community happy, yes. However their business is made up of people, and presumably those people have feelings and preferences of their own. Presumably they're not soul-less machines who exist to either screw us over or bend to our every whim. They have feelings, they have limits, and I'd imagine their jobs can get rather stressful at times. Maybe not often since it's not a handful of guys working out of one of their basements or anything, but still. I'd imagine there's some pretty significant challenges now and again. But I'm rambling...\n> \n> My point is...perhaps they're not communicating because they've found that no matter what they say, the community is going to whine/complain/ask for something else/be angry at them?\n> \n> Since Blizzard was mentioned, let's look at Ghostcrawler.\n> \n> Greg seems like a cool guy for the most part. yes, yes, wah wah ruined mages ruined wow wah wah cry whine complain wah. Possibly poor decisions doesn't change the fact that the guy seems cool, and during my years on WoW I remember him being one of the most active blizzard employees in terms of interacting with the community. Which, needless to say, was whiny and assinine to him at just about every turn. PARTICULARLY when he had to deliver or justify bad news such as nerfs or other major changes.\n> \n> I remember when I first started reading his posts, he was really very reasonable. He was polite, tried to respond to everyone he could, tried to address valid concerns, etc. But over the years I noticed he....changed. The language of his posts got more blunt, a little sharper. It was a slow progression, really. A creeping little change. It wasn't like he just woke up one day and decided to be colder towards the community, I think. To me it felt like he just....got worn down.\n> \n> He got worn down by the constant, never-ending, bitching, moaning, crying, raging, stupid questions, unrealistic demands, snide remarks. You want flying, now you don't, you want harder dungeons, now you don't, you want attunements back and rep-grinding to be less tedious and new zones and bgs to be balanced because ROGUES ARE BULLSHIT! but next week it'll be warlocks and the week after that it's hunters because it's ALWAYS hunters and every change needs to be NOW NOW NOW all at the same time...\n> \n> Given attitudes like that, I felt like it was no surprise the tone of his posts had changed. Given that League's community has people with similar attitudes, it would be of no surprise to me that Rioters don't feel comfortable posting much if at all anymore. At least as themselves.\n> \n> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> \n> I understand where the OP is coming from. It seems like Riot doesn't care to interact with us much anymore and that's one hell of a shame. A lot of promises have in fact been left undelivered. But for years we've been doing the whole 'gnash our teeth, cry and rage, threaten to quit' dance over stuff and where has it led us to? What has it gotten us? What was the price we paid?\n> \n> Sure, we may have gotten some things we as a community really wanted or felt the game needed, but it appears to be at the cost of interaction with developers. They're either so busy or we're so hostile as a community that they're driven away. They may also not care, I'm perfectly willing to concede that as a possibility. If they don't, I think it's also somewhat understandable. A community this size, with everyone yelling for something different constantly? It would be no surprise to me if we're....'background noise' so to speak by now.\n> \n> I suppose my point is that perhaps part of the reason they don't interact with us is because of our attitudes. Perhaps we need to find a better way to express ourselves and how we feel towards things. Perhaps we should prioritize better, push for the right things that give us long-term benefit such as a better client, better servers (which we're getting by the way), and more transparency in the development process. (the latter could possibly be used to help understand why we're seeing more Red posts or why we're NOT seeing more Red posts, or when is a good time to address certain issues.)\n> \n> Saying \"This game has tons of problems! I QUIT!\" Is valid, and it's an understandable thing to do. But if that's all we're going to ever do, is it any surprise they don't talk to us?\n\nHey, genius, they should get another job if they can't take criticism.

I don't look for a thank you, I don't expect a pat on the back. I'm a grown up, I do my job VERY WELL, and I do it professionally and consistently. WTF is their HR doing hiring people who can't handle criticism?\n\nThis...seems excessively hostile. I agree with you that handling criticism is a good thing. It's needed. My point was that for most of us, I think for all of us really, it wears on us. Being treated unkindly, being unappreciated and undervalued in something that takes up a ton of our days and is our livelihood.\n\ncriticism is different from never-ending, constant demands from people who don't know any better yet dictate your work. (I think, as a worker in tech support, you're probably all too familiar with that.)  I'm a critic to say that Runeglaive is very unfun to play against when applied to Mid Ezreal. I'm demanding when I say \"OMG! RUNEGLAIVE EZ TOO OP! STUPID RITO! DISABLE THIS SHIT UNTIL YOU CAN GUT IT! NOW! DO SOMETHING RIGHT FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIVES!\"\n\nCriticism doesn't mean yelling, flailing, whining, and throwing temper-tantrums. Criticism means bringing up what you dislike. Criticism can be harsh, yes. Sometimes it needs to be. But harshness loses it's effect when constantly applied. People become inoculated to it. To me it would be no surprise if a Rioter were to point out that it's confusing to figure out what the community really wants because they seem really loud about everything in every direction.\n\nThus, like any of us, they are left to their own devices and have to sift through the constant stream of anger, looking for things that they can only guess are truly high priority for the community. Everyone wants something, everything's an emergency, disaster, and the worst thing in the world. You're terrible, you're incompetent, you're a money-grubbing loafer who does NOTHING to earn his paycheck. I'm sure you've been in that kind of a situation....and I think, maybe, at some point, even if you didn't realize it consciously, you found it wearing. It's insult to injury if nothing else. Already there's a constant stream of demands, reasonable or unreasonable, and on top of that your performance is NEVER up to par because you're not Omnipotent and can't wave a magic wand and fix anything in a moment. is it really so hard to think that, after five seasons of this, some Rioters might be getting a little tired of it?\n\nYou say you get people yelling at you and being rude in the worst way imaginable. Stop and ask yourself for a moment: if someone was kind, patient, and understanding with their problem...wouldn't you prefer to fix theirs first? Wouldn't you be slightly more attentive to their clumsy explanations than someone who just gives you the usual 'IT'S BROKEN! FIX IT!' line? Naturally, in both cases the job would get done. That's what you're being paid for and I think Riot is no different. Their job is to run League of Legends, and League does in fact run. (well, most of the time.) But in the end, even if we don't realize it, I think we do just a little bit better for the person who treats us better.\n\nMy point with the post was that getting angry seems only to drive Riot away from us. I think it's understandable that it does and I think that if we really want to get some communication going again, and we want them addressing problems outside of an automated response, we need to re-think how we act so we get the results we want without the price of silence from the Reds due to hostility or, possibly, work-overload because we're constantly crying for everything all at once.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-07-15T06:11:02.901+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":4,"body":"I hope Riot looks at this and rethink some of their issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Nielarken","date":"2015-07-15T15:51:38.035+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah most of the Rioters just lurk around fan art and dank meme post","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatAutofillSupp","date":"2015-07-15T14:57:33.425+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Too bad most rioters prefer to just lurk the boards out of fear they're going to anger their own community","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-07-15T22:23:16.809+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Miss Fortune,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cqhTdXnM,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-15T06:11:02.901+0000)\n>\n> I hope Riot looks at this and rethink some of their issues.\n\ni hope people will find other stuff to occupy their time and the amount of played games and rp bought will drasticaly fall down \n\nthen rito will feel the heat \n\n\n\nprove me wrong (it will make me happy) but riot does no longer expand the game ... their efforts are mostly driven towards stuff that yields direct income ... the rest is jusst done to be done and make an illusion of the actual progress\nthey won the market once ... and they just ride the wave to get into our pockets\n\n\n\nnew skinns ... bundless \nchromas ... nobody was realy happy with the quality of simple recolors ... yet riot couldnt pass any oipportunity to make some cash \nevents and new game modes ... usualy a pretext to push out a crap ton of new sumoner icons ... some new skinns ... some new crap thatsbought for rp .. battle boos or what was it called \n\n\n\nmeanwhile our reworks ... rarely solve problems champions had ... barely update them .... they just refresh them  \nballance changes ... random number shuffling ... their explanations for changes usualy dont match with the changes themselves (we want azir to be weaker early so we nerf his late game)\n\nupdates to important and core aspects happen once a year \njungle still sucks .... junglers need items that make some laners go op to simply clear \n\ncrit is still random \n\nbasicaly what the op noted \nbut one thing to add \nriot's departments that work on rp bought content are growing bigger etter and stronger ... while the actual game gets no attention","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-07-15T14:56:11.053+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"I get that you're sick of shit, and that really is completely understandable and a very fair way to feel and I sympathize with your complaints, but don't go throwing around Riot's past like it's something to be proud of. They were even worse back in seasons 2 and 3. A lot of this  really strikes me as being major rose-tinted glasses. I remember season 2 and season 3, and I remember a lot less communication from Rioters. I remember patch notes that just came out without any kind of context or explanation for the changes, and there was plenty of stuff in those patch notes that needed explanation. I remember champions getting literally destroyed with no communication for many patches afterwards. I remember people bitching about champion designs and being completely ignored. I remember waiting a year for announced reworks that drew tons of criticism and were so hated they needed additional reworks months later. I remember people begging for Nautilus buffs, being ignored forever, then being told that buffs wouldn't be good because \"what if we buff tanks later and that makes Nautilus OP?\", even though he was the worst tank at the time and ended up getting the buffs a season and a half later anyway. Season 2 was the exact point when lore died in League. There has barely been any significant non-backstory lore development since season 1, when the Journal of Justice ended.\n\nThere are so many terrible things you're forgetting about from seasons 2/3. Riot hasn't suddenly become terrible. They communicate more than they used to. It's not good enough, but this isn't a problem of them getting worse. Our expectations for their behavior are higher, so it's more annoying when they don't live up to those expectations.\n\nAside from that, a lot of these complaints are things that Riot HAS communicated about in the past.\n\n>Where are replays?\n\nAccording to what Riot most recently said, they'll be coming around when the server migration and upgrades come, which has been stated to be within the next 6 months. A lack of server capacity is supposedly what it causing the problems with replays. We'll see if they live up to that timeline, but at least they have given some answer that isn't just \"soon\".\n\n>Where is Ranked Dominion?\n\nNot coming. They've said that this was cancelled.\n\n>When are we getting lore?\n\nAccording to Jareden (or however you spell his name), sometime within the next month. He's been on a major apology spree for the lack of lore for the past 3 months. It's probably more discussion from the lore team than there has been in the last 3 years combined. I doubt it will amount to anything major, but that would just be fitting the trend from the last 3 years.\n\n>The Zeke's rework is going to ruin bot lane in favor of kill lanes. There's no counterplay. You just get 50% crit for free.\n\nNo it won't. I've been on the PBE. It just won't. You're not going to get a force multiplier item that early, and even if you do, it can be dealt with because it advertises exactly when it is going to give a power spike. This is not going to throw kill lanes into the mix. It will likely lead to an increase in mage supports, and it will make AD carries even stronger in the midgame and lategame but that's it.\n\nI really, really understand being pissed with Riot. I get it. Just don't go on like they had some amazing past that they should be trying to reclaim. They spent all of seasons 2 and 3 fucking up communication, and as bad as shit is now, it used to be even worse.\n\nFinal statement: If you're going to heroes of the storm for good balance and community interaction, prepare for disappointment. ETC, Diablo and Brightwing are all feeling the pains of the \"rework\" hammer. Kael laughs atop his throne. Major changes come with the most placid assurances that \"they'll be ok, we promise\". They have patch previews that somehow completely ignore the largest changes in the patches. Hell, their matchmaking is still randomly assigning new players to high-level games. I'm a rank 1 player, I shouldn't be getting quick match games with or against someone who only has 15 games under their belt.\n\nI'm really salty about HoTS. I've been playing it since the beta and Blizzard has managed to screw up a lot more than I thought they would in even that short period. I'm only back here because the recent patch screwed up so much that I just got sick of it. Every balance change just seems like \"let's take turns at being OP\". A hero gets their time being stupidly strong, they get nerfed to a 44% winrate, and then get left there until everyone else gets nerfed down too. It's like someone read only about Olafing and decided to make that their entire balance policy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2015-07-16T01:20:39.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Things take TIME.

And they're difficult to master, which makes playing them a challenge, so even more fun.","replies":[{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2015-07-16T04:06:11.341+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfun in that case was referring to playing against them, and frequently playing on the same team as them. And I was mostly thinking about Kalista.\n\nUntil maybe a year or two ago, Riot's champion design philosophy focused heavily on how it feels to play AGAINST them. That was why I played League instead of Dota - it feels like shit to learn Dota because everything is arranged to make you feel terrible when you don't know what's going on. Now Riot's breaking that philosophy in an attempt to break new ground and pioneer new mechanics... Not cool, and it doesn't make it NOT suck when Kalista dodges your skillshots for free.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2015-07-15T10:08:06.902+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"The one thing keeping me away from heroes of the storm is that fact that it doesn't properly work on my Nvidia graphic card.

Personally, i was just irritated that i never got a red post on that saying \"hey FlashnFuse! Don't worry about your account getting banned like this person said might happen! Thanks for finding the bug!\" Or a thank you in the patch notes.
