Almost everyone can just be assumed to have:\n2000 HP\n1000 Mana\n110 AD\n1 AS\n75 armor\n30 or 52 MR (ranged/melee)\n325~355 MS\n\n--------------\n\nWhat tends to make 1 champion tankier than another with more tank items is Abilities. \nLeona isn't a solid tank in the support roll because bases, it's because Eclipse gives her a major 3,000 gold-value in tank stats allowing her to be an item behind. \n\nAlso, it's important to note Runes and Masteries look like base stats in game but they aren't. They're essentially item bonuses in game when all you'd have is base stats prior.","replies":[{"poster":"Magus Polaris","date":"2015-03-21T08:43:30.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What 67Chrome is saying here.\n\nYou can go tank Ashe if you want.  Warden's Mail gives the same 45 armor to Ashe as it would give to Wukong and the armor per level only goes from about 3-4 on most every champion.  Wukong's passive only gives a few points of armor for most of the game, laning phase.  The difference is that Wukong gets to use his mobility to pick trades and get out of them with Decoy so he would come out more effectively durable than an Ashe who would only really only have the slow.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-03-21T08:52:00.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lolwut this is ridiculous. Why should Draven naturally be tankier than Riven (which he is)? What reason is there to ever pick melees over ranged if melees have the same base stats all game and a ranged champ with high base damage and CC can be built full tank and still be far better than melees?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-21T08:12:23.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wut. It's been like that since... forever... Some champions are tankier than others for good reason. Melees are almost always inherently tankier since they're melee and have to be in some one's face compared to a ranged champion who can usually kite and/or poke. 0.o Items have... almost never been what made the champion. They accentuated the champions kit and playstyle.","replies":[]}]}
