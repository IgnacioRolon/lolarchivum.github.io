I ping him to fall back but my jungler goes in anyway and dies. My *whole* team proceeds to spam ping and talk shit to me. \n\nAfter the game, both teams called me useless.\n\n\"Oh, you lost lane to Cait?\" - I won lane. I was ahead in CS and I took tower first.\n\n\"You made us lose\" - I took the most towers, had the best K/D and I didn't throw early game.\n\n\"You needed jungler to win lane\" My jungler hated me after the first death and stole my lane CS at every opportunity\n\n\"You sucked Nasus lol\" - The enemy team\n\n\"Everyone report this idiot\"\n\nI've never been one to take shit from others so I told them off. \n\n5 minutes later I receive a message telling me that my account has been suspended and that I need to restart the client.  \n\nI got a 14 day suspension for retaliating. \n\nThe game: https://blitz.gg/lol/match/na1/Tried%20But%20Failed/3007475609\n\nI'm not here to complain though. \n\nI just want to know at what risk am I to be perma-banned? Will the next chat-ban level offense be a perma-banned? \n\nIf I'm at a high-risk for being banned, I'm just going to '/fullmute all' every game and play for fun.
