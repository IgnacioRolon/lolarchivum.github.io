I submitted a report about it, but no word back yet... \r\nI keep getting the low priority queue for leaving... and the message that says &quot;Leaving a game can have consequences&quot; blah blah...\r\n\r\nBut IM NOT LEAVING GAMES...  I play from beginning to end, leave after the victory screen has been up for a bit...\r\n\r\nI just started playing, about to hit level 10, and I&#039;m worried its gonna force me into losses over and over and cause me not to be able to queue once I get to start playing with players... Anyone having this issue? Or know if its on my end?","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2016-10-07T12:26:41.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want the following question doesn't come across as condescending, but I'll ask it since you're new and low level:\n\nDo you spend lots of time idling in base, possibly to think about what to buy or because you don't know where to go? The game expects you to be actively participating in farming lanes/jungle, fighting, and pushing objectives all the time. I know a newbie that was flagged as a leaver when he never literally AFK'd, simply because he was so confused by the layout of the map that he kept getting lost or exploring when he was expected to be laning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-10-07T12:23:19.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Leaving\" doesn't only entail disconnecting from the game.
