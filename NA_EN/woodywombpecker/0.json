However, if you'd like me to, I can. \r\n\r\nLike the title says, I click the \"Accept\" button to get into a match. I hear it load in, and the countdown going through for bans. However, I am still looking at the accept match screen and the timer locked at the time I was sitting at upon accepting the match. Although the match is proceeding per usual, I am not able to do anything. \r\nIs this a known issue? Any suggestions on a fix? \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-02T16:16:48.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a good idea to wait and work on resolving this, otherwise the timer could escalate.  This issue you're having can happen if your connection is unstable and can't transition you from matchmaking services to champion select.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this, and testing it in a custom game.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
