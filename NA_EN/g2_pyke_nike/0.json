From this moment my mouse buttons 4 and 5 stopped working in LoL. I'm playing this game for 2 years and i always had my trinket on MB5 and never had this problem. The bizarre thing is, that in the Hotkey settings through the client, i am able to assign actions to my MB4 and MB5 buttons, however in the actual game if I am to attempt the exact same thing through the Hotkey settings, the buttons are not recognized at all, and pressing MB4 or MB5, even though they have actions assigned to them makes nothing happe. \r\nIt's surely not the mouse issue because in other games those 2 keys are working.\r\nI have tried to disable the HID compliant mouse, to install new drivers for my mouse and it's still not working, so if you guys have any ideas i would appreciate if you could share them with me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-01T23:08:00.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been an ongoing issue with the Creator update causing this.
