In addition to owning the champion and not having already received one with it, a player in your own premade has to receive an S.

If you were solo and not premade, then there's nothing wrong. Random teammates getting an S- or better will not grant you chests. You need to be in a premade party with them.\n\n2.) If someone in your premade gets an S- or better to get you a chest, you get a chest for the champion YOU are playing, not the one they are playing. So even if that teammate was in a premade with you, you weren't the one playing Darius, they were, so it doesn't matter if you haven't earned a chest for Darius yet. What would matter (if you were in a premade) is if you had earned a chest for the champion you were playing at the time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2016-10-22T02:00:49.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could mean that you already got a Hextech chest for that champion.
