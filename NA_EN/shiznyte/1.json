We want her to go back to not being fun to play.\"  I've always played healer type champs in games (e.g. holy priests in World of Warcraft).  This season was the first time we had a character who was a genuine combat medic (as opposed to say Nami or Sona whose heals are mostly about lane sustain).  I love looking at the stat screen after a game and seeing my healing numbers matching up well with the damage dealt to champs by other characters.  That's not broken.  That's a new and fun way to play the game.  Meanwhile, Soraka is squishy enough, lacks hard cc (unless the E manages to proc), and has to get close enough to her targets that she can be vulnerable to assassins or other characters who want to get at her.  Why reintroduce a mechanic that can completely shut her down with the purchase of one already good item?  (Morellonomicon and/or Mortal Reminder).  You might as well just kiss Soraka goodbye.  Right now, enemies have to take a risk to try to get at Soraka using tactics.  Reintroducing GW as you're suggesting means that a team just needs one AOE heavy mage with Morellonomicon and Soraka can be efffectively shut down from a safe distance with no way available for her to counter it.","replies":[]}]}]}
