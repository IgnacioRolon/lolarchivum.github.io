Its only there to serve a somewhat small safe space for lanes that are gonna lose trades or poked down. Towers won't save you because its not their job to cancel any dives that go well such as if you feed your lane and then can't play well enough to stop dying under tower. Games are one sided because if you can't play well enough or have a good mentality to come back into a game then the winning team deserves the win and the losing team deserves their loss. Solo impact is up to the player and how well you decide to use your lead to help other lanes. Amount of cs does matter because it lets you take a passive route and lets you be able to farm and get items at a slower rate than others and hopefully let your team carry you and help you throughout the game. And if you lose 1v1 to a \"non-fed enemy\" its because you either suck, enemy is 10x better than you, or you're just behind. If you still haven't found a rune to compliment your play style, then you should probably learn how to play a new a champion that does because there is a wide variety of champions that take different runes. So either take the time and effort to learn how to play the game as it was made and stop complaining because life isn't fair and people don't get what they want all the time, because the fact riot was able to even come out with a game that's free to play and allows everyone to play with people in the same community as you to help you figure out what you're doing wrong, shows how toxic and how much of a spoiled brat you are to not take the time to learn the game.
