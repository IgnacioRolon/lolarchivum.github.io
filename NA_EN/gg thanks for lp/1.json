You get a whopping 11.9 cs/m 25 minutes into the game. You have 4 kills, 1 deaths, 6 assists. Now look at this, the enemy ekko has 11 kills, 6 deaths, 8 assists, and 5.6 cs/m. But when it comes time for you to team fight, your team already loses those fights because Ekko roamed and killed non-stop. He pushes wave, roams, goes back to lane, repeat. So now your 4 team mates are behind because Ekko roamed and got all this free kills on them, denying them cs/exp. At this point its you 1v5 until late game where it doesnt even matter how much cs you have. Laning phase isnt even about farming anymore, its about killing, roaming, cheesing. Its actually disgusting how far Riot has made us put up with this.","replies":[{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2018-10-16T21:28:47.002+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"the ekko roamed helping other lanes putting your other teammates behind while getting objective gold by helping his teammates push towers and you afk farmed.","replies":[{"poster":"GG Thanks For LP","date":"2018-10-17T02:06:55.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The point is an ekko roams, doesnt have to farm, is behind 2 levels but still is able to pick up kills in other lanes because everyone does damage. Im also not saying the ekko is your enemy laner, he could be mid lane while youre top, but your mid laner doesnt followup or know how to counter play. Roaming > Farming. Kills > CS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-10-16T20:57:10.210+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"So an Ekko who roams and gets himself 11 kills should be equal to someone who sits in lane and farms?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-10-16T21:22:25.756+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because the community forced them to? This shit is getting crazy lol. Reduce gold from CS and give us more passive generation. This is an anti snowball feature. Being zoned off of farm by stronger enemies and/or missing farm from being dead isn't as large of a deficit. This exact board told them to do it. ***Forced them*** to do it practically. Now the same board is upvoting a thread as to why they introduced this anti-snowball feature. SO. MANY. W0TS.\n\n> Laning phase isnt even about farming anymore, its about killing, roaming, cheesing.\n\nGame has pretty much always been about pushing and roaming. You're acting like this is something new when its literally always been the case","replies":[]},{"poster":"Onandaga","date":"2018-10-16T21:13:19.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It feels like Riot is trying to turn the game into a straight fighting game at this point. Lane management, CSing, counterpicking, team synergy, vision, and strategy in general all seem to matter far less then in the past. The game now feels centered almost entirely on winning the first set of trades and snowballing from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2018-10-16T20:53:27.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Only minion that matters is cannon, since all your golds in that one now, and riot is pushing the lcs down everyones throat, its rather disgusting tbh and the main reason i stopped putting money into this game, hoping the lcs starts losing them money so they start balancing the game around the 99.9%, rather then the 0.1%","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2018-10-16T21:56:17.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game is too much about which team snowballs and not about which team has the better strategy even though mobas typically fall under the strategy category","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-16T20:50:26.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its like Fizz, Zed, or any other assasin who roams, especially against an oppressive or a stale mid lane.

Back then you wanted to be good at the game, learn all the mechanics, macro, gameplay, what to do, freezing waves, pushing waves, when to take objectives. This season its, hide on brush, kill enemy in .7 seconds, kill baron in 4 seconds.
