I really like the style and wanted more references for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Saiyaka","date":"2016-02-03T20:26:20.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiii! I'm so glad you enjoyed the artwork for this year's Lunar Revel. [Suke](https://www.artstation.com/artist/sukeart) is an amazing illustrator, so definitely let him know you appreciate his work :)\n\nWhile we were exploring different potential art styles we were really inspired by Chinese folklore and traditional paintings because they had this way of showing epic stories and visualizing history in a really elegant way. [This article](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/editorial/light-over-dark-creating-lunar-revels-triptych) goes into some more detail of the process and inspiration of this piece with Suke (artist) and Matthew (writer). \n\nOur muted color palette was inspired by traditional paintings instead of going with a more vibrant red and gold theme. I was reminded a lot of Yoshitaka Amano's work and his elegant style. Our goal was to infuse a tiny bit of narrative into the Lunar Revel characters in a way that felt inspired by Chinese mythology but unique to League of Legends. Hopefully we were all able to create something that felt respectful and meaningful during this season of fresh starts and brighter futures :3","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Falcon","date":"2016-02-06T18:40:55.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I will look into all of it, Thank you for your reply :D","replies":[]}]}]}
