What part of my post wasnt clear enough for you. The part where I said ANYONE is OP if you play them good enough or the part where I said it takes skills to be good at Karthus? Or maybe it was the part where I said people who need nerfs are the champs that can 1 shot you and have no way to counter play. \n\nPlease tell me in what planet Karthus can play every role? Can he JG? I mean even at adc you better be damn good or else you're just trolling the bot lane. And I'll name you champs that can do all roles... Yasuo.. Twitch... Neeko... Kindred... Teemo.. list goes on... Karthus is NOT one of them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"michaelchan","date":"2019-01-17T08:02:57.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In top lane, you gank him until he cries that his ult does no damage.

Then there is still the fact that he scales harder then most champs","replies":[{"poster":"michaelchan","date":"2019-01-17T08:48:30.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
