I think we should make them super good at objective control and less on team fight potential since keystones are sticking around pretty strongly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rax Reformed","date":"2017-01-29T00:41:13.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really does. It's not just the current pool of meta champs either. It's how the game flows overall this season. Games seem to be decided by the 10-12 minute mark, and recovering from a bad early-game is all but impossible. It's too easy to establish a huge gold lead over the team that falls behind. The Jungle now forces a specific playstyle due to longer respawn times on the camps, as well. Bot lane now, more than ever, is pretty much decided based on how oppressive the support is. Top is just as boring and uneventful as ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Clout G0d","date":"2017-01-29T01:17:52.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i feel that i just want to see different champs in competitive play im tired of seeing just varus ashe zyra and malz","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BIackfox","date":"2017-01-29T00:59:55.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will only be good once they play EVERY champ or at least 100","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-29T00:34:13.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rip season 3 94 lcs picks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Haihefa","date":"2017-01-29T00:32:54.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"theres always gonna a tier list.
