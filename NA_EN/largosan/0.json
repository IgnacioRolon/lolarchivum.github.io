But, I honestly think in ranked at least if you&#039;re selected for a certain role only the champions made for that role should be available for selection. I am sick of getting ADC only to be supported by for example my last game which I rage quit,  (I know!) because I was being &quot;supported&quot; by Vel&#039;Koz... VEL&#039;KOZ! Who every time we engaged got flattened as he is squishy which meant I was in a 2 v 1 fight and therefore died a lot. \n\nI understand people want to mess around with certain champions, but that place is normal games, not ranked in my opinion. If you&#039;re selected as support, you should be restricted to only being able to select support champions. Same for ADC, top ect. \n\nI&#039;ll wait for the flaming to start now...","replies":[{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2017-06-25T08:13:23.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm, by your deffinition Zyra should not be a Support/Morgana should not be a support/ Sion should not be a support/Annie/brand/vel'koz. Kill lanes should be outlawed by your version of champ select.\n\nI mean looking at your score 30 minutes and 51 CS as ADC the support was not the only problem. Even if you raged quit. It had to be before what say you miss 1 CS out of ever wave. So that would mean every wave you will get 5 minions and 6 in a cannon wave.  Every wave I believe 30 second respawn what what 10 seconds to the lane(Not counting singed lanes) that would mean you would of had to Rage quit the game around 8-9 minutes into the game. That is only if you miss only 1 minion per wave and from the way I see your CS and saying you rage quit it had to be a little before the 10 minute mark. But added Deaths I am not too sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Y4SO","date":"2017-06-25T08:18:57.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another simple solution to his problem: find a support duo that's good with the champs you want to play with.\n\nBut the \"get good\" argument works too^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-25T08:19:39.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dang i remember when ziggs adc was a thing. like a couple months ago or so...

Thank god you don't make the rules of this game for Riot otherwise this game would've died years ago.  Innovation has helped this game grow over the years.  Picking different champs that can bring something new to a role like support isn't cheating.  If it was cheating, why didn't you win with the Vel'Koz support?  \n\nIn the end, wins or losses are based on the skill of the players using the champions, not the champions themselves.  If it was based more on champions then the strongest champs in the meta would have 90%+ win rates and not be capped at like 56%.  Skill determines wins, not champs.  Off-meta or off-role picks aren't cheating, your just salty because you had a garbage support who picked a non-meta champ.  Thank Riot for ignoring suggestions from players like yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"LargoSan","date":"2017-06-25T09:32:20.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually do you know what, I kinda agree with you.

League isn't as simple as \"this champ was made to be a support originally, so he must be a better support than champs that weren't built for the role.\"  It isn't that black & white.  Sion has the highest support win rate right now, and he wasn't built to be a support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
