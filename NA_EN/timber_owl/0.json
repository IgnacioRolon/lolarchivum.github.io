The sustained portion draws on your own HP to prolong the heal. This fits with the theme of self-sacrifice in Soraka's lore, too. \r\n\r\nFor balance, engaging the sustained healing effect puts Soraka in a channeling state, so it allows for enemy interaction and the total healing done is more subject to gameplay. Also, it keeps her from spamming Q or silencing while the channel is engaged. \r\n\r\nAnother idea: What if this sustained heal, in establishing a link between her and her target, grants her the armor buff while it's active, as well? This way she isn't rapidly erased, while draining her own HP to heal her ally ADC, by the enemy ADC. It gives her time to react. And it kind of makes sense with the nature of the ability, anyway.\r\n\r\nTo me, the thought of holding W down for a sustained heal at the expense of your HP has a certain sense of commitment and sacrifice to it, because you are continually deciding to give your strength away for the sake of another, while watching your HP dwindle down.

In solo lanes, it'd be absolutely worthless.\n\n**Worst idea ever.**\n\nPlus in PvP even if you had an infuse healer you also had a crapton of other healing and self healing options as well as a second monk with defensive spells.  Totally different context because GW1 was an 8v8 pvp game.\n\nHere's how I think I'd fix Astral blessing right now:\n\n1.  Give it a small AoE heal passive that triggers whenever you use another spell.\n2.  Change the active heal to give your target AR/MR/Health per second for 3 seconds. \n3.  Overload it for enemy cast.  Maybe make it a life leech or mana leech skill.  Maybe make it a few seconds of AP/AD debuff.  Maybe have it deal damage and GW to the foe.  Or if her E is a silence her W can be a root or a stun.\n\nOverloading the W for enemy cast might give her more interactions and pressure her not to be a full on healer.","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-04-23T23:56:48.419+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think that's a pretty absolutionist look at it.

It's definitely an option.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-04-24T02:13:16.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beating the healer is one thing, the healer having to weaken themselves by losing a big chunk of life is something else.\n\nAgain, going back to GW1 infuse was one skill of 8 on your bar.  You didn't have to take it. You also had 7 slots to fill with things for healing yourself back up or defend yourself with.  Ideally, your monk would be in the back line to use this, not in the middle of things like you want an active Soraka to be.\n\nI have to be pretty absolutionist for this idea because frankly these are 2 different games.  An 8v8 furball is a little different than 5v5 split up over the map.\n\nSoraka has no escape, no CC, and without her W (on which would be CD) no defense.  It's not like she'd have 7 other skills to fall back on.  I'm not even sure how you'd implement it to keep the people who like taking her into a solo lane happy.  I'm one of those people who like taking her solo.\n\nAnd let's be honest, in a team fight where you've got 5 enemy champs with pokes, and CCs, and engages, and nidalee spears, and flashes, you can't have a champ that loses a massive chunk of health, and healing power by extention.  She's only have one heal.  \n\nTBH if you did this, Nidalee (and maybe a few other champs) would instantly be a hard counter to Soraka which goes directly against riot's prinicples.  I started a CB thread (or was it GD) awhile ago on how you can't just do that.  So if you nerf soraka's healing to be a lose X amount of life, you have to nerf nidalee's spear the same patch.  I know a lot of people want nidalee's spear to be changed, but still...\n\nThat's a huge amount of rage you are setting yourself up for in just one patch.\n\n*Here's the most important reason not to do this.  Soraka is a sustained submission fighter.  She wins battles by trying to draw them out as long as possible where she gets the advantage (stacking MR shred).  A change like this would completely destroy how she fights.*\n\n*It basically would put her into a fight with only 3 usable skills (Q,E,R) while other champs have 4.  The more she'd use her W with this suggestion, the more of a liability she becomes.  This is completely against how she plays and how she needs to play in order to win a fight.*\n\nPros might be able to use this effectively, but sub gold she'd be either A. Trash or B. uber passive which we don't want her to be.\n\nQing is hard enough bot because some ADCs hate it when you push the lane.  Or take their minions.  It's also her best offensive skill for bot, and I love it as is and don't want starcall, infuse, or wish changed.  And now you want her healing to be a liability as well?  Even if it was only 10% that's going to lead to a lot more deaths or back than before.\n\nThat's not a whole lot of room for Soraka players to actually play the game.  Over in GD fearless is asking Sona players how to make her more rewarding.  If you do this change, 6 months from now either him, Vesh, or Rickless is going to be coming into the forums and asking the same thing about soraka.  \n\n\nWhile I'm thinking about it, you do realize that part of Riot's problem with healing is you aren't give players any tools to interact with them right?  What options do other players have in LOL?  We don't have domination mesmers, that's for sure.  We don't have any champ who can sap X of your mana/energy and do damage to you based on how much you lost.  We certainly don't have a lot of viable options for keeping grievous wounds to stick to a champ.\n\nPart of me thinks you guys are trying to fix Soraka the wrong way.  When you should be adding levels for more interaction, you are simply pulling the one you have and wonder why people are angry the only real healer is getting nerfed again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-04-24T00:52:10.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that's the case, you're going to have to A) make her much tankier and B) make her completely useless in solo lanes.

Creating more viable game-play options for Soraka is good and desperately needed. I get screamed at in normals when I choose her during Champ Select about 7/10 times I choose her... Changes to her should be geared towards making her more useful to her team. The OP's idea would be a great start and is a likely needed change.\n\nIt would be fairly easy to counter this channeling skill mainly by focusing Soraka or her healee.\n\nThe ratio of heal done to health consumed would have to be decently high otherwise it makes her look weaker if she consumes health to heal in this manner.\n\nHer current heal is important and I hope it would stay and not just be replaced by this new heal. I would probably use her current heal more than this proposed ability because its less risky to use. But I would use it as it would have important uses for various situations.\n\n\nHowever, I can imagine accidentally holding down the button too long...\n\n\nNow here's a slight modification:\n\nChannel Heal\n\nIts a burst heal that heals allot at first (about the same as it does now), then heals a progressively lower amount over time while the ability is active, and drains her mana instead of her health. It now won't be as confusing or risky to use but still punishes her by draining her mana. \n\nIt works similarly to her current heal, but consumes mana the longer its pressed. She would most likely drain her mana with this, and thereby rendering her useless for further healing, CC, or damage in team fights. She would need to be punished for fully draining her mana supply to heal someone for the sake of balance. So her aggressive E and Q would need some changes to their base mana cost (for E, about 5% of her max mana to cast; not sure about Q right now).\n\n\nMath Suggestion:\n\nIt's kind of like a logarithmic decay curve with health healed over time. Whereby the health healed starts high and decays over time and maybe drains her mana on a linear formula based on percents or raw value. This would mathematically create an optimal value which can be built upon, manipulated, and balanced. This should help provide the developers a starting formula to work with.\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, a more general idea is to have at least one new champion, ability, or item create a Heal Over Time that scales with Level and Ability Power, etc, that could never heal more than Soraka's primary heal when maxed out. \n\nMaybe even have an ability drain gold or even their life for a teammate...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blaine Tog","date":"2014-04-24T04:26:21.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Infuse healing worked in GW because of how jumpy health bars are there: it's extremely common for someone to drop from 100 to 10, then leap back up to 100 before dropping to 50 and back up to 90.  Infuse healing allowed the Monk to quickly turn the tide if one of their allies was being spiked, but then switch to another heal ability to restore him or herself before the enemy managed to switch towards them.\n\nLoL, conversely, is much more about attrition.  You have to be pretty far ahead to 100-0 someone before anyone on their team has a chance to cast a spell (or be a mid-lategame Fizz or LeBlanc ;) ), and once someone's dropped to 10% health, it's going to take them a while to get back to 100%.\n\nIt would be a lot harder to make Infuse healing work in a MOBA paradigm precisely because you would have to give the character another heal to allow them to then save themself.

It's a really neat idea, but in practice I think it would simply be very frustrating to play against and, more importantly, take Soraka back into the territory of being a \"life and mana battery\" instead of someone with combat casting presence.\n\nAllowing her to heal significantly more than she currently does (regardless of her Q strength, which I think is in a good place as a support) will make her optimal play shift more towards building tremendous amounts of hp and mana regen. Currently, a Soraka support has decent heal and infuse numbers, but used on an ally they are low enough that she must always do the dance of \"do I sit back and heal - or do I poke and fight?\". \n\nPlaying Soraka, you're always forced to make awkward choices if you want to play passively - wasting the armor buff on W, asking yourself if you should try to poke with Q so you can reduce your W cooldown, choosing to use E on an ally or enemy - and that's *good*. S2 super-passive Soraka was undoubtedly really strong, but also bad for gameplay as a whole (and honestly just made her unsatisfying to play).\n\nSo creating the choice between a \"combat Soraka who trades off stats for other stats\" and \"passive Soraka who sits back and pumps allies full of power juice\" is definitely a good direction, which is why I like your idea :). My argument is just that when players are faced with this choice, regardless of power, I think that 90% of the time higher level players are going to go with the passive option simply because of how strong it is to give HP to allies. Lost a trade and at 200 hp while Soraka was at fountain? She'll show up and donate a bunch of it back to you so you're good to go.\n\nSuggestion: Maybe add on a requirement to this \"infusion\" heal where she must be in combat? Engaged in combat in the last X seconds, have at least one Starcall stack, be in proximity of an enemy champion? I know these aren't the best solutions, but adding some kind of combat requirement for this channneled heal will help prevent it from being abused.\n\n**TL;DR** Soraka's heal/infuse are low enough that she is forced to be a combat mage in lane, buffing her ability to heal will make spamming regen and playing super passively a \"better\" way to play her (which makes her boring).
