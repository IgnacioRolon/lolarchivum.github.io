Riot is proving they don't care at all about the game, and only care about putting in 'the next shiny thing that keeps people playing' \n\nWheres all the bug fixes to a MASSIVE amount of game breakers? (I.E. fucking invisable nunu) Why is there still balance favoritism because of skins or a whiny player base? Why are you only balancing it around pro play and screwing over everyone else? Why does the report system not actually ban trolls/inters WHEN THEY ARE BLATANTLY DOING IT I MIGHT ADD, and just go for people that said bad words because 'muh feelings'? Why is the client as buggy as the actual game? Why does autofill still exist determining games based on if the player knows the role or not?\n\n\n If you actually just think bringing something new and shiny will magically make season 10 good while completely ignoring the game itself, then the dev team is off its rocker in their own world right now. I fail to see how they are this oblivious to all these glaring problems besides them purposely being ignorant to them, and i really don't want to think that, but it seems that's the only possibility. \n\nMaybe greed has corrupted them too much and they are just trying to make one last ditch effort to siphon money out of us before we realise its the same shit.\n\nYour thoughts? What should happen in season 10 besides just a coat of paint?

They're buffing literally everything else while nerfing bot lane. The support items are shiny looking on the surface, but I still really don't see the justification in making AD support items when their attempts at an AD support have created monsters. Notwithstanding the literal problem everyone has with Pyke is that he under-performs but ends up getting stupidly far ahead because of his gold passive...so the answer is...give him an AD support item to make him better in the early game while doubling down on the problem..?\n\nLike...the best thing we had in support that related to an AD support was Jarvan, and they *power nerfed* that with all the changes that made burst damage so overwhelmingly the master race of the game. Sure, they built him more tanky, but he was the fairest example of our first AD Bruiser support, and he was actually a pretty damn well received one.\n\nBut to give them their fair credit, I actually like a lot of the things they're *attempting* to do with their buffs to the other roles. Mind you, I dont have PBE, so this is all still on paper for me...but from the look of it, they're trying to make tanks feel relevant again, and they're trying to make a push to bring back junglers that focus more on clear times and counterjungling to be just as viable as the \"i gank every lane twice by 6 minutes\" types. This means Shyvanna might actually see *proper* play again, and not just be a sub-standard AP cannon top laner. They're also trying to slightly weaken the jungle camps to encourage some more off-meta jungle picks without destabilizing the game...which means my \"troll\" rakan jungle pick may not be so troll in season 10. (I mean...his ganks are incredible...xD)\n\nThey're trying to open up the game to feel more diverse again, and I think it'll be pretty refreshing if they can manage to accomplish that and open up so many of both the old playstyles, and some newer ones, to shake up the meta slaves a bit and remind them that creativity is also an aspect of good gaming experiences. It's enough to make me want to at least *TRY* to play season 10, even though I really dislike *almost* everything they're doing to my lane of choice.\n\nIn regards to the bugs and the trolls...those are going to exist in every game. Riot's tried to fix their bugs, including the invisible Nunu bug...they've fixed a lot of them, but there are a few they just simply dont understand how they work. In fairness, they've pushed the Nunu bug to the point that you now have to do it in a *pretty specific way* that you're not likely going to accomplish on accident.\n\nTalking about the trolls will be a huge can of worms...so I'll simply leave it at this: they can certainly do better. But if they *do* do better (dammit, I said do-do...) then they're going to threaten the sanctity of certain people that are *not* actually intentionally ruining games. They can certainly do better at hitting those who admit it, by proccing a manual review if 6+ people report the player in question. If 2/3 the game is reporting you, then its probably worth someone actually skimming through to determine severity, and more than likely (since at least 2 are enemies) you said something horrific in all chat that outs you on its own. There are also certain other parameters I've attempted to explore (about 5 or 6 months ago me and a couple others opened a discussion concerning the invisible time-to-deaths ratio at which someone would *have* to be exerting actual effort to feed, as opposed to just having a horrifyingly terrible game...it was met overall with a lot of closed-minded, white knighting people who dislike statistics, as you can likely guess. I can't blame them, cause my catchphrase is that \"literally 90% of statistics are made up\", but the avenue was explored in the forums, and my goal was accomplished) that I would like to see them at least *address*, but they're not doing nearly as bad as it feels like they are. It's just that...there are far more assholes than Riot has ability to police.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeyphel","date":"2019-11-18T22:18:09.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think season 10 will be a fun and refreshing season.
