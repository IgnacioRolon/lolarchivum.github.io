He wasn&#039;t in high demand for one and champions who have outdated game play and models don&#039;t sell skins that well compared to modern champions.\r\n\r\nHe has the most outdated and ugly model in the game. Looking like a mixture of barney the dinosaur and the hulk that has overdosed on every single drug in existence 1000x above he human safety limit. His new skin really just shows how outdated his model really is.\r\n\r\nIf its one thing Ive learned about skin releases is that it means it delays a champions VGU by years when looking at the history of skin release dates and champions who got VGU&#039;s.\r\n\r\nDid riot decide that he was too difficult to update and postpone him for a couple of years? VGU&#039;s are always years away from skin releases dates and this has me worried.","replies":[{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2018-11-20T01:19:54.803+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> He has the most outdated and ugly model in the game\n\n\nUhm.. {{champion:82}} {{champion:38}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-20T01:20:49.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warmanreaper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bMEdG37G,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-20T01:19:54.803+0000)\n>\n> Uhm.. {{champion:82}} {{champion:38}}\n\nkass doesnt look that bad tbh replace kass with {{champion:54}} and {{champion:31}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2018-11-20T01:22:00.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bMEdG37G,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T01:20:49.748+0000)\n>\n> kass doesnt look that bad tbh replace kass with {{champion:54}} and {{champion:31}}\n\nBoth of those aren't even old.. both have recieved VGU's already.. mordekaiser needs bleach to play cause he's a walking scrap potato.. kassadin has more pixels in his abilities then he does in his base skin, kass aint too old but he looks garbo.. morde on the other hand.. hes top priority.. hes terrible","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-20T01:30:23.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warmanreaper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bMEdG37G,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T01:22:00.049+0000)\n>\n> Both of those aren&#x27;t even old.. both have recieved VGU&#x27;s already.. mordekaiser needs bleach to play cause he&#x27;s a walking scrap potato.. kassadin has more pixels in his abilities then he does in his base skin, kass aint too old but he looks garbo.. morde on the other hand.. hes top priority.. hes terrible\n\num just gonna leave these here....\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/25/Cho%27Gath_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20150312220309\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/1b/Malphite_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20140807130216","replies":[{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2018-11-20T04:10:30.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bMEdG37G,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T01:30:23.198+0000)\n>\n> um just gonna leave these here....\n> https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/25/Cho%27Gath_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20150312220309\n> https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/1b/Malphite_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20140807130216\n\nOkay. Post mordekaisers in comparison and look at his model compared to either. Malphite isn't that bad, specially because you can actually see his body, chogath is kinda hard hes a creature of the void, but yes he could use one. I still stand by mordekaiser needing one because he's so bad... hes literally like 180p texture and it looks like someone made a metal snowman and it started to melt.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-11-20T01:28:50.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about {{champion:80}}?","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-20T01:31:27.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bMEdG37G,comment-id=000000000002,timestamp=2018-11-20T01:28:50.887+0000)\n>\n> What about {{champion:80}}?\n\nyeah he needs one, idk if hes as bad off as some of the other champs though","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-11-20T01:36:49.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at his feet and spear.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-20T01:38:44.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bMEdG37G,comment-id=00000000000200000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T01:36:49.517+0000)\n>\n> Look at his feet and spear.\n\nhes pretty gross ik","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-11-20T01:40:37.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heâ€™s old Taric feet gross.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-11-20T01:24:34.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bMEdG37G,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T01:20:49.748+0000)\n>\n> kass doesnt look that bad tbh replace kass with {{champion:54}} and {{champion:31}}\n\nAnd rip Udyr's visual update require $30.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nomercyforyall","date":"2018-11-20T01:36:44.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand Panth and Morde.
