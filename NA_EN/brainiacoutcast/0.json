This allows him to W, smite, or whatever he pleases at the target location before he's targetable, and before it makes intuitive sense for him to be there.\r\n\r\nExperienced players know that Pantheon actually arrives before he arrives, but most players who don't see a lot of Pantheon don't, and his capability to do things before even landing is a large amount of hidden power in his ultimate. I'd like to see this be fixed before direct nerfs to the range of his ultimate are considered.","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-03-20T20:33:38.180+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":13,"body":"Hey, if this is PBE feedback it should go on the [PBE Forums](http://community.pbe.leagueoflegends.com).","replies":[{"poster":"ShinRaigeki","date":"2014-03-20T20:48:10.077+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"You imply everyone has a PBE account...

This seems like the best place for a regular player to post about (something related to) the balance changes currently on the PBE. The current PBE Pantheon has a nerfed ult range compared to live, and I'm suggesting that the balance team instead tries taking off his ability to act before he lands, and then consider range nerfs if he's still too strong.\n\nIf you see this reply, something to consider would be a PBE feedback section for the open areas of the Community Beta, or allowing account signups to the PBE Forums while still limiting who can actually play on the PBE server.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonBlader24","date":"2014-03-21T00:18:37.700+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about smite, but his W doesn't go off before he arrives.

And since the OP and a lot of others in the thread don't have PBE access, they have no way of testing it to find out or really any motivation to constantly check the PBE forums. Not trying to be overly critical, I definitely question how Moobeat and the fellows at S@20 missed how the channel changed, maybe just an oversight or something of that nature?","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-03-21T02:21:03.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's the way they pull information.

You could almost argue that given the longer duration for the enemy to react there's no reason for the range to be lowered at all but if you have to lower it I wouldn't lower it to any lower than 3500 range at all ranks. It's semi cross map range is an important factor that needs to be preserved imo and at 3500 range jungle Panth would still need to be somewhere in the middle of the lower or upper jungle to drop into the respective lanes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-03-20T23:54:18.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they nerf the range, they'll need to do something to balance it out, otherwise you take away one of the main uses of his ult, his travel distance.

I don't play Pantheon myself (I think I did once or twice when he was on a free week, but have no intentions of buying him right now), however I LOVE to play against Pantheon. The fact that he can literally drop on me out of nowhere makes it so fun to try and outplay him. Nerfing his Grand Skyfall range this much makes it feel like he's losing a lot of what made him a fun character, since he'll almost always been in vision range when Ulting (except when bush stealthing).\n\nI love all the (near-)Global ultimates in this game, it makes it super interesting, and gives me a lot of those \"Oh man, it sucks I died, but that was an AWESOME hit!\" feelings. Taking away one more just makes it feel like this game is on its way to removing ALL of those kinds of abilities...","replies":[]},{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-03-20T23:05:14.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"His ult does need a minor rework/some touchups, it works really weird and is really frustrating to both use and play against.\n\nHaving said that I have little doubt the range changes was some kind of mistake.
