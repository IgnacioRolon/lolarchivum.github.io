Lagging HARD. And it keeps on happening and i had no idea how to fix it. Before i had problems with the new client and not being able to download the client, and, now that that is fixed, i now can't even play the game because it lags out for no reason constantly and i can't/don't know how to stop it. It also only seems to be happening on the new client, so i have no idea if this problem is on my side or riot's side. (As an added note, a few days before this started happening i downloaded warframe off of steam, so i don't know if that ties into the problem) If i can't fix this, i'll say f*** it and stop playing. Unless riot can fix this, i'm done. Some feedback will be nice, and if you want more details, please ask for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-17T01:56:42.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can provide more details around what you experience when these issues happen, it will help me understand what's actually going on. \"Lag\" is used to describe a lot of different issues, so if you could be super detailed about the symptoms you're seeing, it will help me to help you. ^.^","replies":[]}]}
