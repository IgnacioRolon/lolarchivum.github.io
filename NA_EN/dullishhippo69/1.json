I would love if this could be patched soon, or something, thanks for taking the time to read through this :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-22T17:36:00.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report! We'll take a look! \n\nAre you referring to him glowing green, or sometimes the souls you were collecting would be green?","replies":[{"poster":"Tourian","date":"2015-01-22T20:56:27.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed it too. When you collect a soul the green \"flickering sheen\" that goes across thresh's model will be green and not red.","replies":[{"poster":"dullishhippo69","date":"2015-02-16T22:00:28.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, so sorry, but i don't check the boards often. :'(\nThis is what I mean.
