Last year, we disabled all older skin codes, due to people selling them, and scamming people into buying a skin code that didn't work. Going forward, skins that are given out at events expire shortly after the event to prevent this issue from occurring in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Pachanisu","date":"2016-06-01T22:41:29.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any way that you could make it available again soon ?

Silver Kayle falls into this category, making it a limited skin, as opposed to legacy.

They have disabled all codes and from future skin codes they are only available for about 2-3 weeks after the event! I mean it's kinda good they finally did that because people were using programs to get these codes hence why it seems like they had an endless supply! It's just also they were selling them at a high price as well, which doesn't make sense why riot would care. If they cared that much they should have just released it to everyone, or have all codes available through pax all year round instead of having one skin per year! But I believe also the means of how they give out the codes is a bit \"scam\"ish. I'm not sure how it is but I guess riot was trying to help gamers not lose or have their account taken away!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Piantissimo","date":"2015-03-23T15:42:55.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think they disabled all the codes for the older ones because you used to be able to get it from websites","replies":[]},{"poster":"HR Department","date":"2015-07-31T01:55:59.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kind of sucks though, friend is a big TF main, has every skin but Pax, I wanted to get it for him for his birthday but can't anymore :(","replies":[]}]}
