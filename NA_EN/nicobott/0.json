Aside from that there just may be general maintenance required, like making sure your drivers are updated, to get things running smoothly again.  I recommend running through the steps in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to make sure your PC is tuned up.
