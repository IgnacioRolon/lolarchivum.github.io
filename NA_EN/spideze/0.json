His kit is THAT good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2016-01-26T03:05:07.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is the one who sets up plays.\nHe is the one with clutch saves.  \nHe wants to steal your soul. \n\nHonestly my favorite support! Can set up so many plays it's rediculous. flay then hook is denying any escape. \nIn extreme running instances in jungle use hook on camps to escape.\n\nAnd always remember, you don't have to press Q twice. these are signs of either YOUR WINNING or YOUR GETTING THIRSTY FOR THEM SOULS.\n\nsadly late game you have no means of killing anyone, only your carry can if you  go a tanky thresh... sword of the occcult was nasty on him and I only used it if we were rediculously ahead.\n\nAlso you can adc with him... it's hard, and only fun if you have a blitzcrank support duoing with you. ( and a Nautilus in the jungle for hookamageddon!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fat Bastard GOD","date":"2016-01-26T02:48:31.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he is pretty strong right now, especially with 45% CDR. His CC becomes unreal, I fought against one and holy crap he wrecked. He could QEQ...\nMight be worth trying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2016-01-26T02:17:52.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I despite him with every fiber of my support main body, because I can't comprehend how any champion from any role is allowed to remain at the top of the pack for so long, but then again it has been so long I've actually accepted that he is immune to significant nerfs because he's Riot's favourite child among the support class.\n\nI, myself, have never and will never play him, not because I don't think he's strong, but because I don't enjoy the kind of playstyle he offers. I prefer poking games and kite/disengage to waiting for the enemy to misstep to land a \"lol u die\" skillshot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-01-26T02:06:26.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like playing him every once in a while, definitely not my favorite support, though. Personally, he's played so much that I get bored of seeing him (especially at lower elos where players honestly aren't good enough at him. You still see cool stuff every now and again, clutch flash predictions are always cool). He's sort of a rite-of-passage for support players, especially for high elo players, since he's just so versatile.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-26T01:56:45.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to his utility based kit, he is eternally relevant in all metas and seasons. Master him and you will go places. Check out pro streams such as [Aphromoo](http://www.twitch.tv/aphromoo) or watch the [LCS](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/) when they are playing him to learn all his best tricks.","replies":[]}]}
