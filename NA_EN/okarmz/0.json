Well as soon as the game started up I got this error, as well as a leaverbuster, and my personal opinion is that I shouldnt have gotten leaverbuster for something like that, but whatever. Now that I have restarted my computer and launched the league client again it is scanning and is taking a while. My thought is that it was in the middle of trying to do this or got bugged or something when I tried to join a game. Im just upset at the fact that I got leaverbustered for this, and am wondering if there is any fix for this.\n\nEDIT: Now after it scanned it is working completely yet I still got leaverbustered for this.","replies":[{"poster":"oKarmz","date":"2017-10-05T02:33:19.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly I have gotten a 20 minute leaverbuster, and the last time I had gotten leaverbuster was because my Wife was doing something with my ISP and the wifi got cut off, so I have gotten screwed twice, and not happy lol......","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T01:32:04.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this was the very first game that was left, you wouldn't have gotten a leaverbuster so it's likely that this was just the last chance before actually getting this slight LPQ. I'm glad you were able to get the DirectX Issue working again, and it looks like you've only got about 5 games left on that LPQ.","replies":[]}]}
