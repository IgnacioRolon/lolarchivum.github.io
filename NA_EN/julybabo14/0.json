Other times it can tell what a champ was in the world of League or what they are now, say Human Ryze, Tyrant Swain, Captain Gangplank, and Captain Fortune.\n\n2. they can have visually appealing themes to them/they look cool - pretty simple to me. I see Gentleman Cho'Gath, I see it might be a fun skin. I see Battlecast Cho'Gath, I think it has a badass theme to it along with the other champs in the series. Candy Ivern - playful colorful theme, Dragonslayer - kick-ass theme, etc. \n\n3. It breaks up having the same base skin all the time - I'm not usually a person who likes playing a champ with the same look every single time, especially when they're one of the other champs/models. Skins just help the champ look better with FX, looks, and possibly new lines/animations depending on the quality lvl of it (legendary/ult/epic).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2017-10-02T15:53:53.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause they make me want to play a champion more, which makes me better at the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2017-10-02T13:19:09.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mostly buy them because i wanna see my fav characters in thier different outfits, see their taste what they wearing... lore related stuff... pretty lame i know :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hovering Hentai","date":"2017-10-02T11:40:41.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They show my champions in other ways some of which I like better.\n\nArclight Vel'Koz - Literal God\n\nProgram Lissandra - Hive mind Queen of a future technological race\n\nJusticar Syndra - A take on what Syndra could have been if she hadn't turned against Ionia\n\nBlood Moon/ Lunar Goddess Diana - Demon possessed lunar warrior/ Moon Goddess Selene type character","replies":[]}]}
