It's pretty strange that you had to wait that long, as Poro King is a pretty happening place right now, most people get their queues in less than a minute. If you happened to grab a screenshot of that absurdly long queue timer, shoot that my way and I might be able to help out.","replies":[{"poster":"3Bies","date":"2017-07-08T02:58:05.852+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"It suddenly quit on me when it reached 80 minutes, didn't have time to screenshot ;( hoping if you guys record the queue timer on each account...","replies":[]}]}]}
