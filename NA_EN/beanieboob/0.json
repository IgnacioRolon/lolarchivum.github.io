He also keeps the volume up, keeps the light on, and is very inconsiderate of us, his rooommates. So what are some good ways to mess him up (ex. get his account banned, change his league password, etc.) because we are really getting fed up! In game, he is also a very toxic player even to us, his friends, and rage-quits all the time when its his fault he sucks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T23:36:01.973+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd joke about banning him for an hour, but it sounds like he's well on his way if this keeps up.

I don't really want to completely mess him up, but would very much like to teach him a lesson. Is there a way to mess him up temporarily like a prank or something? Thanks, Rito. Oh, and if you tell us to just straight up talk to him, we will do that, but AFTER teaching him a lesson. Thank you.","replies":[]}]}
