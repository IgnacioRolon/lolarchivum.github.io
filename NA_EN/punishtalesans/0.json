The initial error at 50% may be due to a connection issue, where the patcher is failing to connect to the patching server to download files.  For this, I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get that fixed.\n\nReceiving an error during file scanning can caused by a security setting with your OS that's blocking the patcher from scanning your game files for corruption.  You can use our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to restore access and make sure that the patcher has permission.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
