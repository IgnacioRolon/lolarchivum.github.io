Not A- or A+ just A. I went from getting an S nearly every game with him, unlocked mastery 6, now i can only get an A.

Since mastery scores are based on percentages, there aren't any set requirements for getting a high score. Your scores just need to be in the top percentage. Be sure to give yourself a refresher if you're not sure how the [**mastery system**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284) works.","replies":[{"poster":"xMr Babadook","date":"2018-01-16T03:49:58.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do understand this, however it is strictly an A every single time. Not only am i becoming fed in these games, i'm taking every dragon/baron and placing wards constantly throughout the games where i'm performing very well. I did get four rankings in the category in the S area in a row, going from mastery 5-6 in two games, an continuing multiple S's on games after. Nearly every game i had been playing was an S when taking him. Suddenly, it's as though it is frozen on strictly an A. This is specifically on Rengar. I'm wondering if there's a restriction on the amount of S's you can receive within a certain amount of time.","replies":[]}]}]}
