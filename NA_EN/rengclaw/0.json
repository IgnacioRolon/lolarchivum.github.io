I'm sure there's a reason the skin is however much RP, and selling it for anything less is saying that it's not really worth what you posted it for.","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos von Faneli","date":"2016-09-08T23:11:27.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear what you're saying and you aren't entirely wrong, but the big thing hear is that unlike real world currency rp can only be obtained in set amounts, so the difference of a few cents in real life become 5 dollars, and Riot's not looking to be like that to their customers and so from what I've seen will generally give players who put in support tickets for things like this the extra few rp they need to obtain them. Yes, there may be implications as you put it having to do with devaluing their product but honestly that's a very overcritical view of what is simply a player asking for a little help. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RengClaw","date":"2016-09-08T22:57:51.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i made the ticket =)","replies":[]}]}
