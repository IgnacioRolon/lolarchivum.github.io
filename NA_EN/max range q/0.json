You also fail to do anything about AFK players. You could easily refund LP for these things your shit client causes but you fail to. Shows you dont give a fuck about your fans. Shame. \r\n\r\nYour client failed to let me load into a game in game 1 of promos and then i got the pleasure of having someone rage quit 4 minutes into another game. I didnt even get a chance to play promos. Now at 62 LP. It will take me 5 more games to win placements when i didnt even get to play them. I am not the only player this happens to.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-09T08:22:56.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know Riot should fix this, but you can get around it in the interim by killing the client in the task manager then reloading it.","replies":[]}]}
