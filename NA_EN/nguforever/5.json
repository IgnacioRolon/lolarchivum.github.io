I remember looking at Mordekaiser when he was considered one of the worst champions in the game and saying, \"I'm gonna make him my hyper-carry,\" and actually winning. This season has been no different. However, having gone the ranked route as well, it's just not as fun of an experience for me. Sure, it's taught me a lot about TFT, but I can't really see climbing past gold for the end of season reward. If you try to get cheeky in ranked, you just end up losing LP which can be frustrating. I might be the only one who thinks this, but I'm happy to just get my end of season reward, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"NeonPanda","date":"2020-02-13T03:54:16.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's fair.  Although there is quite a bit of variation in the meta- you can do well with a lot of comps.","replies":[{"poster":"nguforever","date":"2020-02-13T06:19:22.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I will say this was the first season I learned about hyperolling, which I never found I needed to do in Season 1. I am really tired of the Kindred meta right now though. Every top challenger player just runs poison or Kindred comps.","replies":[]}]}]}
