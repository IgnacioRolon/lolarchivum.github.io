This is taken directly from Silence for the Damned speaking of Volibear:\n\n\"In the forest behind Najak, the great black-leaf trees cracked and shook. Taller than a mammoth, it stepped out of the woods. Walls of muscle, each limb larger than a man, propelled the beast forward. Its broken, ancient armor of dark, metal plates was caked brown by the dried gore of a hundreds of battles. Broken weapons, rusted with age, jutted from its back and shoulders. One half of its face had been stripped of flesh, revealing oily bone, teeth, and horns. From its mouth, an unnatural, black blood dripped. Its four eyes, impossibly ancient, alien, and pitiless, looked over Sejuani and Udyr.\"\n\nThat doesn't sound like a regular polar bear.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gentleman Yasuo","date":"2019-05-10T00:10:09.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you read how he's described in the update with Ornn.
