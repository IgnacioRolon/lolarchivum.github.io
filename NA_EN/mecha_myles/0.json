However, it is possible to skip tiers if Riot deems your behavior severe enough. This is generally done with things like death threats, racist/homophobic slurs, telling others to commit suicide, etc.\n\nYou had already gone through the 2 sets of chat restrictions, so normally your next punishment (this one) would be a 14 day ban.
