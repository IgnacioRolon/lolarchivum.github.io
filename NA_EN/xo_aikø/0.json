It's ruined the incentive to do well and SR is now basically a huge aram/urf. You've ruined your game and this post means nothing but is a good prediction of what will happen once S10 starts. Revert and come up with more clever ways to improve the game. These new changes are so useless and take minimal skill to win now. There's also no room for coming back on a losing team. Game's completely screwed.","replies":[]}
