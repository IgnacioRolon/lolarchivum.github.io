I'd like to run some changes by the community to the ban systems for Solo/Duo queue, Normal Draft, and Flex pick queues.\n\nCurrently, the ban system is good for most levels of play, but sometimes bans can feel like a waste with overlapping bans. This leaves a feeling of \"I could/should've banned someone else\", and it's not a good feeling. That's also not to say that the current ban system is bad, because it isn't. It is a streamlined draft for the current era of League, but we can do better.\n\nChange 1 - Make all bans between both teams visible \n\nThis is a simple fix. Currently, you and your team can see bans as you lock in to ban champions. This should be changed so both teams can see all bans the same way; If someone locks in a ban, it pops up for everyone.\n\nChange 2 - Remove the ability to overlap bans\n\nThis just goes in tandem with Change 1, preventing overlap bans even if by accident.\n\nChange 3 - Ban hovers are visible to teammates, but invisible to enemy team\n\nThis change prevents trolling basically, while also making you able to communicate or coordinate with your team.\n\nEDIT: While this isn't a change and is the same as the current ban phase, this is something important that should be noted that would stay.\n\nChange 4 - Remove \"No Ban\" option\n\nThere are too many champions to not ban something. This is just plain silly, otherwise, why are you even playing draft. \n\nAnd that's about it. Keep in mind this while this may be something that I put a lot of thought into, it really is just my opinion. I really am putting this out there to see if anyone else feels the same, or even disagrees with me and why.\n\nLet me know what you all think!\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-11-20T23:35:05.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with all of this post ^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kara ZorEl","date":"2019-11-20T22:50:15.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess the intended tradeoff here is to have more champions banned per game vs time in champ select, but i'm not sure it would fully get what you're looking for.\n\nFirst off, if you remove the option to not ban anything, what happens if you run the time out?\n\nSecond, it would incentivize banning as late in the timer as possible, as it might allow you to get an extra ban if the other team bans what you would've blindly banned.\n\nAnd then to combine the two with the no-dups clause: if two people are looking to ban the same champion but holding out for the other team to ban until last second, the time will run out for one of them\n\nMy speculation would be that it would always make the ban phase take the full time (it does that somewhat regularly already, so idk how big a change that'd be in practice), and my guess would be it wouldn't average too many more champs banned per game anyways.  But would only know for sure by trying it.","replies":[{"poster":"Glacial Inferno","date":"2019-11-20T22:57:57.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm. I suppose Change 4 doesn't necessarily need to be implemented. If it were to be, though, not banning a champ would probably revert to dodging the lobby, just like before way back when.\n\nI agree with your second point, but as you said, ban phases tend to run to the full time already anyway, so it might not be that bad.\n\nMaybe Riot Games already tried this when they were looking to change the ban system to what it is now, and it didn't work. All of this is just speculation, and only rito knows for sure how this can be tested.\n\nThanks for your feedback! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garen is adopted","date":"2019-11-20T19:27:23.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seeing what enemy ban would directly give you advatange both for your pick or your ban, anyone will a little amount of brain will hold their ban until last moment to try and damage enemy team before picks even start.","replies":[{"poster":"Glacial Inferno","date":"2019-11-20T22:17:23.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Care to elaborate a little more?
