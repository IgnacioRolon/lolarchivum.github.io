A shotgun's such a distinctive weapon in games that it feels like we're wasting some cool gameplay space by not playing up the differences between Graves's auto attacks and other marksmens's more. Would also help separate Graves from other somewhat similar champions, he and Lucian in particular are too similar at present, which makes it difficult to have both be appealing, rather than one outshining the other.","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-08-16T03:46:15.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well he lost his gun in the lore.
