If it is so, would you mind telling us clearly? No hate intended, but you stopped pushing out chromas (chromae? chroma?) last summer and just went silent. This is one of the typical Riot behaviors that bugs players so much. I would prefer to be told clearly that I shouldn't expect any chromas to come out soon, rather than just have to guess. \nSomething like: \"So we tried this chroma thing. We liked the reception, but think we can make something even more awesome with them. While we figure out, we decided not to release any more chromas (sorry Zed!). We will communicate when new chromas will start to be released again.\" Or even \"We tried chromas. It wasn't worth the effort, so they are scrapepd/iceboxed for now.\"\n\nBut just going silent and misterious does not do good to your image as a company (and that makes me sad, I hate the hate posts, but I hate even more when they are right :()","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-23T19:09:45.545+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You've likely seen/received a survey regarding chromas, like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3vvaef/riot_looking_to_add_skin_painters_for_players_to/).\n\nhttp://imgur.com/EKtA5zN\n\nhttp://imgur.com/UaO7KvD\n\nWe want to make sure we're making the right call with chromas, and want to make sure it's awesome content that players like, rather than just pushing out random chroma packs just because. \n\nWhile I can't talk about the future holds for chromas, I can say we are talking about them, and asking for feedback, as noted above!","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2016-02-23T21:16:06.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was aware of the pre-chroma blucian surveys, but I must admit these are new to me.\n\nI'm sorry for forcing you to expose yourself about these topics; as said before I don't mean these posts as whine or attacks (and I'm sorry if my bad english something makes me sound harsher than intended), but I think it is healthier for the communication between Riot and us players to say it clearly if you put chomas (or any other feature) on hold, even temporarily.

When we let that feature die it's usually because it didn't do what we theorized it would do. We go back to the drawing board and take another stab at solving that problem.\n>\n>For instance, when creating Chromas we were trying to solve the problem that we didn't have any personalization content that was between 750 skins and ward skins/icons. We were hoping Chromas would be easy to make content that would fill that gap and give players who wanted cheaper skins some content that would make them happy. What we found was that they weren't that easy to make due to our outdated pipelines and players weren't satisfied with their quality level. With a little more effort we could make 750 skins that players liked more. So we made more 750 skins for now and back to the drawing board to solve the actual problem. Chromas may come back one day, but we need to solve the pipeline problems first.\n>\n>We like to experiment and try things and sometimes it fails, which leads to dead projects laying around. We realized this isn't ideal and a waste of time so we've been working on creating smaller experiments to test our hypotheses and learn quickly without shipping features we have to support forever. An example of this is the surveys you guys see going out. We're trying to get better at learn as much as possible before committing to an idea.\n>\n>Long story short, Chromas were one of Riot's numerous experiments that they tried on the players, but found that the amount of work needed for each set didn't match the price they were asking for.  So, rather than say or do anything to fix the issue, they let it linger and let player's suffer through their \"rethinking\" process.\n\nIn other words, Chromas were a Riot experiment to try and deliver on adding palette swaps for cheap players, but they discovered that players were more than willing to buy standalone skins at a slightly higher 750 RP price point.\n\nSo, no purple ninja for you unless Riot decides to make it a unique, singular skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2016-02-21T21:08:19.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said they're halting the chroma stuff until they can figure out a better system of delivery than just \"Buy them for a few bucks on the store!!!\"\n\nOr something along those lines.
