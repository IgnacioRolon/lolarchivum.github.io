Please explain to me how this is even fair in any sense. This Yasuo player had a cry about not getting 2 of his positions so comes into my lane and starts taking all the cs, essentially stealing in. I at least stay in lane to get xp and buy items and start roaming around the map. But apparently i get banned after the game and get put on leaverbuster. Please fix this so i dont have to play with toxic players. Im almost at the point where im going to stop playing this game due to all the problems regarding players being unsportsmanlike and toxic when things dont go their way. Please fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-06-16T03:22:02.497+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were probably banned for your name.

It's a well known fact that Riot purposely bans bots and scripters in waves so that they can put less effort into identifying hacking software which results in known bots and scripters continued to be allowed to play for weeks or even a month after being identified.","replies":[{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2017-06-16T06:33:07.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha, and what is the easy fix for the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Dehitay","date":"2017-06-16T12:14:38.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bettnachleger,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HfEmOvQi,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2017-06-16T06:33:07.653+0000)\n>\n> Aha, and what is the easy fix for the problem?\n\nReintroduction of the tribunal that's actually given resources to succeed instead of being neglected, video recording options for reports, valid incentives for judging cases in the tribunal, and acquiring a decent amount of staff to do final reviews on cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2017-06-16T13:37:35.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is \"a decent amount of staff\" in your opinion?\nAnd should they review every case?
