Who statistically only grades near the top in damage taken and in not dying. Who now is put at significant risk when using ally devour, thanks to Riot removing the MS boost he had when running away. Whose &quot;second health bar&quot; decays faster now. Continue to let stronger, higher priority picks slip through because of your deep-seated hatred.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll gladly settle for someone like Poppy, and laugh even harder when I see you pick a team full of dashes into me. Or practically any other support, at this point. Tahm has been my favorite champion since release, and it&#039;s never had anything to do with how &quot;OP&quot; he supposedly is. If it did, I would&#039;ve stopped playing him after the most recent nerfs.\r\n\r\nBut, as per usual, lower levels are woefully behind on the times. Just like they were with Ekko, who continued to see a wealth of hatred and bans after he was nerfed even harder than Tahm. It&#039;s amusing and saddening, since I really do want to play my favorite champion, at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2016-02-05T01:08:58.034+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you can't ban who you hate playing against?\nEven though that's the main reason you have bans?\n\nIf tahm makes a teammate want to afk, banning him isn't a waste.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-02-05T01:15:46.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Banning based on strength will always be better than banning based on personal biases. And the main reason you have bans, as evidenced by the highest level of play, is to keep power picks away from your enemy, not keep your personal pet peeve champions away from them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2016-02-05T01:24:09.155+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the downvote man. really helping your argument.\n\nIf you struggle against a certain champ, but not against the statistically better one, I'm pretty sure you're better off banning that certain champ. Personal bias or not, you're actually playing this game, not everyone else that contributed to that statistic. You'd be better off using your personal records against certain champs anyways.\n\nBesides, power picks at pro play aren't necessarily determined by stats, but by who they're good at. It's kind of silly to not even consider banning to benefit your team comp and only ban because statistics.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-02-05T01:38:38.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except I rarely hear someone express that they actually struggle against Tahm. All I hear is that he's an annoyance.\n\nIn terms of banning champs you struggle against, I'd sooner ban a champion people in general struggle against (ex. Mundo) than one I in particular struggle against because it benefits my entire team, rather than just me.\n\nFor instance, say I wind up going mid. I can never seem to do well against Xerath, no matter who I pick. Does that make him worthy of a ban over Mundo, Graves, etc.? No. Not in my opinion.\n\nLastly, many champions are 100% pick/ban in LCS solely because they're so strong. Obviously they're also able to target ban as well, but champs such as Lulu aren't banned so often because this or that player is a Lulu God. Pros recognize how strong, flexible, and full of utility she is and don't want anyone getting her, regardless of how good they are with her. And many bans fall into that same category.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2016-02-05T01:49:55.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really? I find that tons of people still hate him because of devour. People also ban soraka because she's annoying, so tahm is probably still annoying enough to justify a ban.\n\nWell you do need to gamble that the other team doesn't play the champ you hate, but it's probably worth it if the champ is popular. I usually wager that the other team will ban them for me or leave enough powerful picks open to get more than the other team.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-02-05T02:04:55.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"if tahm makes a teammate want to afk,...\"\nyup thats why i bann him. but not because the enemys are so op with him. because my mates usually troll with him or just fail lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2016-02-05T01:06:49.695+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Now I know to ban Tahm even more just because it incites rage from the mains.

I'm amused, more than anything. Amused that somehow people still find him worthy of a ban, amused that I know I can still punish people when they let him through ban phase when I'm on the other team (despite him being notably weaker), amused that so many ban champions not because they're actually that strong but because they just have a deep-seated hatred for them.\n\nThe only negative emotion this inspires in me is disappointment that I only get to play him about 1/4th the time. Like I said, though, I'll gladly beat you with someone else and make you regret banning Tahm.","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2016-02-05T01:12:55.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a deal to me!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Bad Mystic","date":"2016-02-05T01:42:45.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hes permaban for me because im sick and fucking tired of his bullshit.
