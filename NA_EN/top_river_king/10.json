Like I&#039;ve seen people say, it&#039;s more of an ultimate than her actual ultimate. And due in large part to it, laning against her is the least fun I&#039;ve _ever_ had playing League of Legends. If she gets that E on you, you pretty much don&#039;t get to play League of Legends again until you destroy 3 tentacles.\r\n\r\nI also think her Q&#039;s hitbox is a bit too forgiving, as it even extends outside the animation, and that she&#039;s too oppressive when ahead, as her tentacles make turret hugging its own challenge. But dial back her E and suddenly those things don&#039;t seem like that big a deal, because the bulk of her power is tied up in that one ability.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2015-11-28T06:40:31.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with you on the part of her Q hitting outside of its shown range, but as to the rest...meh. I just think she's poorly designed in the success vs failure cases.\n\nProbably going to have to do some power shuffling in her kit. (e.g. Nerf the hell out of her R's cooldown, give her W more base damage/range)","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Scott Free ","date":"2015-11-28T06:36:57.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem with her E is that if you break the tether you become a vessel, if you get your soul popped you become a vessel if you are melee and try to fight her and she ults your soul counts as another champ which means it's an extra tentacle. Some of the power here has to go away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2015-11-28T06:32:28.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree'd.

Add Grasp of the undying and basic attack her off your soul so you get your 3% max HP back every 4 seconds and she just becomes an extra gold source from killing the tentacles...","replies":[]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-11-28T02:48:56.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They just need to rework illaoi she's at a 45% win rate cause she lacks CC, gap clsoers, mobility or even a basic speed boost\n\nThey need to just make her a magic damage champ who scales off base AD and AP but reduce her scaling numbers a bit\n\nShe would be more consistent (ATM She's only good vs bad melee champs at top and clusterf- teamfights otherwise she's weak unless you let her land her skills, srsly think of a blitz hook and DODGE)","replies":[]}]}
