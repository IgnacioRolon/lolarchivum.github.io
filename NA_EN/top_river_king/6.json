They went, in order, 20m, 31m, 41m, 34m, 41m, 26m. The 6 prior? 20m, 42m, 36m, 50m, 21m, 30m. The former averages out to 32 minutes, and the latter 33. So, on average, my match length went down... 1 minute. That&#039;s even with a relative anomaly, the 50m match (had only 3 go 50+ in 2 weeks), upping the pre-patch average.\r\n\r\nTo top it all off, nearly all of my matches have been closely contested for the majority of the match with no more snowballing than normal. Each match felt completely winnable. Needless to say, I&#039;m a bit thrown off by all the posts about matches not going as long and being &quot;over in 10 minutes&quot; stomps. Does anyone else share my confusion, or am I alone in this?","replies":[{"poster":"Talkrr","date":"2015-11-13T15:43:22.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, towers go down faster.\n\nI think teamfights just go on and on, thats what makes it longer imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-11-13T15:52:41.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Towers do go down faster.

With more gold coming in and the items aren't that much more expensive than they were. I'm noticing at least 1-10 min shorter games. I don't think you will see that epic 50 min game as much anymore.
