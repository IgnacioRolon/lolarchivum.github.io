I can't think of anything off the top of my head that angers me more than someone giving up a couple early kills to someone, then not modifying their game plan one bit. They continue pushing (without wards), fighting their fed and ahead lane opponent, and building straight damage. Then, when they continue to get kills, you hear cries of \"OP\" or \"broken.\"\r\n\r\nLike last match. Our Darius fed Illaoi to the point that he was a lost cause very early on. Then our Rengar kept ganking her, rather than helping our bot lane, or me mid, when we had an ADC with connection issues. At one point, our Brand support went up with him when I was trying to defend a turret by myself versus Swain and Lux. They all ended up dying, which is no surprise considering Illaoi's damage only goes up when there are more people around.\r\n\r\nBut all I heard was how broken and OP she is. When I pointed out her awful win rate (43.7% ATM), one of my teammates said people that have played her 15-50 times have an 80% win rate with them. I just looked it up, and it's 76.44%... and that's 0.44% of her playerbase. AKA, it doesn't mean a damned thing because the sample size is way too small.\r\n\r\nShe's too new to really make any value judgments yet. I'll admit her E is a bit too powerful, and that I'm not a fan of her tentacles spawning at your turret (and not being targeted by said turret) if she's bullied you up to it... but overall, she's by no means \"broken,\" at least not in my opinion. People don't know how to play against or as her yet, so all her stats are a bit of a crapshoot right now. And neither the stats for 0.44% of her playerbase, nor a match where you played right into her hand the entire time, is proof of anything.\r\n\r\nExcept I see this all the time, where people are incapable of adjusting in-match, or of viewing what happens in that match in context. I've had numerous matches where I couldn't even be in sight of my lane opponent without getting killed in seconds because they'd gotten that far ahead, but I managed to find ways to not just let them pile up kills and to at least slow the bleeding. Very few people in this game seem to know how to do that, however, and it drives me mad.","replies":[{"poster":"Shonjl","date":"2015-11-30T23:35:51.642+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats even better is when you deprive your laner all game, and they go roaming and get fed off other lanes and your team blames you for it.\n\nI have had a game recently as GP against Illaoi top where she couldn't kill me when she was going pure damage since I was passive and just farmed, she ended up going out of lane and getting our jng or mid laner several times even when I warned the best I could and ended up pushing top hard everytime. Only for my team to say I threw the game since they ignored my pings and even I couldn't fight her or hold her back anymore when she came back to lane with 2-3 more kills each time.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-12-01T18:10:32.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't know how many times I've had that happen.

As a result, their method of dealing with her was making her seem far more \"OP\" and \"broken\" than she really is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Josheheh","date":"2015-11-30T18:42:15.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on the champion/role.

But even ADCs have ways to build semi-defensively while still getting the damage they're after. Well, it's pretty much limited to lifesteal, but still. It's something.\n\nIn fact, everyone has options that give them both offensive and defensive stats. For example, I was {{champion:117}} top vs. {{champion:17}} last match. With how much he was hurting, I built {{item:3001}} for both the MR and the enemy MR reduction. After that, he was only a minor nuisance, and my damage output increased enough for me to be able to solo him. What most randoms I see would  probably do in that situation is go for something like a {{item:3089}}, which is pricey and straight damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2015-11-30T21:20:02.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What elo do they build a deathcap as one of their first items?

That's the reason fed ADCs get GA/Banshees far earlier than when they are not fed.\n\nFor example, i play Vel'Koz mid into Brand. \nIf i get 0/2, i build MORE damage, because i can't face him in the open, so my chance is to catch him off-guard. If i do that i want to punish him hard and completely destroy him with single combo if possible. If i built defensive item, i wouldn't have enough damage to burst him down and he could kill me despite me having defensive item.\nNow, if i get ahead, let's say 3/0, i build big defensive item. If he tries to go toe to toe with me he'll just die because he's behind, and if i make a mistake/get jumped on i have far better chance for surviving and fighting back.\n\nIf Zed can easily kill me without even using his R, why would i even bother to get zhonya's? Instead, i can get few good wards, catch him with CC and nuke him down before he has chance to retaliate.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-12-01T17:47:39.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But there's the difference: you apparently know how to modify your play style when behind. As I said in the first paragraph of the OP, I'm talking about the people who start 0/2, rush some expensive damage item, die a couple more times because they keep making stupid mistakes (i.e., pushing too hard, not warding, trying to pick fights, etc.), and continue to feed until things are so out of hand that (at best) it takes our entire team to kill the monster he created.\n\nI'm talking about situations where they can barely be in the same lane as their opponent and yet they do nothing to itemize against it. I've been in situations myself where that's the case, and building at least somewhat defensively is sometimes the only way you can prevent the snowball, which is huge in a meta that's based almost entirely around snowballing at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-12-01T18:04:33.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To put it more succinctly, I love when my lane opponent builds offensively when I'm ahead and fed.\n\nIt's why, back when I played almost nothing but Garen, Teemo was by far my favorite lane opponent.
