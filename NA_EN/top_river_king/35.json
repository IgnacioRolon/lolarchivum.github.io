I assumed Gangplank ADC, as I'd seen it before, back before his rework when he was sorta like a male version of Miss Fortune. And I was honestly concerned about having to face Swain top as {{champion:223}} (since I was betting on Syndra mid). But it actually ended up being Syndra, of all champions. Even stranger, they found a way to make it kinda work. Part of that was on one of the 4 friends I was playing with, however, as he went 1/7/7 with Blitzcrank before leaving the match.\n\nWe ended up winning the match somehow at the hour mark, despite it being 4v5 for about the last third of the match, surviving two barons, and sealing the victory with a baron of our own. It was one of the oddest matches I've ever been a part of...\n\n(http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1995916103/228789219?tab=overview)","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-11-01T16:52:27.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:35}} and {{champion:53}} was the hardest bot I have ever faced. We literally couldn't do anything to them in lane. They would just sit in the bot lane bush with a pink ward so we couldn't ward it and see what they were doing. The shaco would drop 3 boxes and the blitz would pull us in. You got knocked up, feared, and killed without being able to do anything at all. Plus they would take turns backing and we wouldn't know. \n\nOur whole team tried ganking them and they all died.

Even though our mid laner ended up ragequitting in the middle of the game we were still able to get so ridiculously ahead in the game that it didn't matter that we didn't have an ADC because every time we had a teamfight we'd get at least 3-5 kills in exchange for less than 1-2 of our own. Eventually the enemy team surrendered in what was otherwise a super dominant game.\n\nMore recently I played against a team with a {{champion:133}} {{champion:11}} bot lane (with Yi being the support).

In other words: teambuilder, premades, or maybe normal draft if everyone is ok with it and understands how it works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-11-01T16:37:15.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Judging by your gold difference, you guys have been winning until that fight where you lost 3 people and 3 turrets in 1 go, and picked up again because you guys got the Baron buff, as well as ace'ing them at Dragon shortly afterwards.\n\nBut really though, their comp doesn't favour late game due to the lack of reliable sustained damage.

One, I saved teammates so often that the other team could do nothing but QQ about Tahm Kench after the match. Two, my friend, the Blitzcrank, was probably more use to our team AFK. He's always a liability, feeding ~10 kills nearly every match, win or loss. That was especially true this match; my other friend, the Caitlyn, described a moment where he flashed into a group of minions for a hook that obviously failed due to minion blocking. Another time, we'd all died up near their blue, and rather than booking it... he hooks Alistar at him... then stays to fight even with the rest of them coming for him, resulting in an ace. Three, I had at least 3-4 levels on their entire team at all times and was full (tank) build quite early on. This is how I limited myself to 4 deaths, despite sticking my neck out time and time again to try and save teammates. All 4 deaths were a direct result of these attempts. And four, we wouldn't have gotten the majority of the turrets we did had it not been for my Banner of Command. Our team had next to no pushing power. That first inhibitor turret we got? Barely got it thanks to a Kha'Zix split push with one of my Banner minions while we kept their entire team pre-occupied.\n\n**EDIT: **Didn't even notice Brand did over 100K in damage. Holy mother of god. He wouldn't have even survived to deal most of that damage had I not been prioritizing saving him over Kha'Zix, our only other damage threat.","replies":[]}]}]}
