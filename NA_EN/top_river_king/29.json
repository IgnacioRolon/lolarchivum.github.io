I wanna say it was patch 6.12 or 6.13 that this first started occurring. If you want, I can go through all my other replays and pull up dozens of occurrences of this same bug for research purposes. I thought 3 times in one 20 minute match should suffice, though.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-08-13T19:24:47.254+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, I filed a Pbe bug report on the issue for you and cited your name and I \nlinked this thread to it.\nHopefully with your very clear repro info they will be able to solve this rather quickly.\nI hope you don't mind.^^\n\n-LostFr0st","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-08-13T19:26:53.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

The Q damage isn't even supposed to apply if you combo it with a W to devour minions from afar. It's just meant to be a ranged version of using W by itself on a minion. Though that could possibly be the source of the bug, since they buffed the damage on Q with the changes in patch 6.13, and since the minions do seem to be especially low each time it occurs.","replies":[{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2016-08-13T18:56:45.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, i know how the Q+W combo works. used to play a bunch of tahm.

I think Technolians might be on the right track, since that is the only constant I can see. It looks like, for some reason, the Devour might be working on minions the same way it works on enemy champions, dealing damage to them prior to spitting them out, meaning those low HP minions die before they can be spit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MarTayTay","date":"2016-08-13T19:04:31.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tested it out a bit in a bot game, and it seems that if you Q+W a minion when it is low, it does that bug.

If you pay close attention to the last example, the caster minion's attack continues traveling to the minion even as it's inside Tahm's belly. The minion must not be getting made untargetable quickly enough for it to become invulnerable to minion aggro before it dies when it's low enough to die to it prior to the devour. So it dies to the minion aggro while inside Tahm's belly, thus leaving him with nothing to spit out.","replies":[]}]}
