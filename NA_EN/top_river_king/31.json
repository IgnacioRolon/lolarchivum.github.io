My last team builder, I faced two Platinum IIs.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand making things a little easier on people new to the champions they're playing, the \"matchmaking adjustments\" simply fail in practice because maybe 1 out of every 4 matches looks reasonably balanced, and a similar amount of the matches end up woefully lopsided, with one team or the other getting embarrassed.\r\n\r\nI'm okay with matches like the one I played yesterday where the teams looked like this: Silver IV, Silver IV, Silver V, Bronze I, Unranked vs. Gold V, Gold V, Silver III, Bronze I, Unranked. At worst, I at least get to test myself against (presumably) higher-skilled opponents. However, Silvers should not be facing Platinums, even with \"matchmaking adjustments.\" That's taking things too far.\r\n\r\nOn top of all that, when I do actually get \"matchmaking adjustments\" that don't pit me against two Platinums, I find that my teammates (and sometimes opponents) are so beneath me that the in-game experience is just a frustrating waste of time.\r\n\r\nSo I'm with the user who suggested not too long ago that we be given the choice of turning \"matchmaking adjustments\" off, since I'm through with its shenanigans.

I just think that if someone has a Plat ranked MMR and a Bronze/Silver normal MMR from never playing it, artificially raising the Plat players normal MMR to be  some weighted average of the two MMRs would be in the best interest of all players for more balanced games.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-10-15T20:46:52.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was actually thinking of a solution exactly like this, since I know normal MMR being its own separate entity also plays a major factor. Just as a crazy hypothetical, a Challenger player could never play normals and have the Silver MMR everyone starts with, meaning any normal with them is destined to be a rout in their favor. These sort of discrepancies need to be ironed out somehow.\n\nSome of the Gold+ players I've been matched with did have MMR in line with their ranked MMR, though, going based off the MMR of their other normal matches, and matchmaking adjustments played a bigger part in those cases.\n\nI never check OP.GG prior to a match, since the information does more harm than good during the match, but always check after out of curiosity. And when I see a Plat, I always check them out on OP.GG to see if they're new to the champion, and they almost always are.\n\nSo it's a little bit of both, the normal/ranked MMR discrepancies comboed with matchmaking adjustments. But it wouldn't be anywhere near as bad if Riot could use ranked MMR in the matchmaking formula somehow, so people aren't getting placed against people two full ranks below them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-10-15T18:01:57.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TahmumuhaT,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=NslWKUF3,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-15T14:23:15.675+0000)\n>\n> And &quot;matchmaking adjustments&quot; are to blame.

My last team builder, I faced two Platinum IIs.\n\nI don't think matchmaking adjustments have anything to do with your issue, here. Presumably, if their Normals/TeamBuilder MMR is actually relevant to their skill, even if they have Matchmaking Adjustments active, it shouldn't drop them low enough to be matched with you - especially if you've got the same Adjustment active.\n\nSeems to me that the issue relates more to the disconnect between Normals MMR and Ranked MMR - where they're matching lower than they should because they don't play Team Builder often enough for their MMR to be where it should. That's definitely a cause for concern, but doesn't really have anything to do with the Matchmaking Adjustments.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-10-15T20:52:17.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I mentioned in a reply to another user, I suspect it's an MMR discrepancy combined with matchmaking adjustments. So one or the other needs fixed somehow. I like the other user's suggestion of averaging ranked and normal MMR for players with huge discrepancies between the two.\n\nP.S. On the bright side, I can say I held my own mid lane against a Plat Twisted Fate one match when I was testing out Nautilus mid. He had himself a pretty good match, but we ended up winning, and I even managed a surprise triple kill. Feels good, man.\n\nStill not worth all the times I've been steamrolled by Golds and Plats thanks to our team being all Silvers and below, but nice just the same.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Bad Mystic","date":"2015-10-15T17:53:57.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they could have the system take into account their highest mr (ranked or unranked) as a base for the adjustments then drop them 2 or three ranks if theyre new to the champ.
