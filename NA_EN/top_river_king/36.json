Last match, for example, I had a Platinum 2 on my team (of randoms; no pre-made) and a Diamond 5 on the other team. A small part of me does like the challenge, like when I made a Diamond 5 Nasus look foolish as Tahm top. I also understand that normal MMR and ranked MMR are not the same, and that there are matchmaking adjustments and pre-mades to take into account.\n\nHowever, can we not come up with a solution to prevent Silvers, Bronzes, and Unranked players from facing players in Platinum and above? We could treat it like duo queuing and disallow such large discrepancies. We could average normal and ranked MMR in the event that they vary greatly for a particular player. We could tone down the matchmaking adjustment or remove it entirely. Heck, we could even create an option where you say you specifically want to face tougher competition than normal, since trial by fire is one of the best ways to improve at this game, I&#039;d say. But only if you&#039;re actually prepared for it.\n\nAt this point, I&#039;d take anything. I just want matchmaking to have some semblance of balance in team builder. Who&#039;s with me?","replies":[]}
