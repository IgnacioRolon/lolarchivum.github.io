With rune pages, we can buy more... but with mastery pages we can never surpass 20. For most, 20's sufficient. I, however, like to be prepared for all eventualities. It's why I created item sets for every champion I might find myself playing, and for every role they can play. If it weren't a crazy IP sink, I'd probably have rune pages in the double digits to give myself flexibility (since you can't edit runes in champ select). You can edit your masteries in champ select, but I'm no good at doing that sort of stuff on the fly. Why can't mastery pages just be unlimited like item sets?\r\n\r\nWhile we're at it, why not be able to pick and choose which champions you want those mastery pages (and perhaps rune pages as well) to show up for, like with item sets. That way you don't run the risk of entering a match with the wrong masteries/runes, and you can find the ones you want without difficulty. People are often asking for the ability to organize their mastery/rune pages without having to delete and remake them. This could do the organization for us, as item sets automatically alphabetize. Why can't the same be done for masteries and runes?\r\n\r\nAnyway, just some thoughts I had.","replies":[{"poster":"Eastrid","date":"2015-10-09T02:38:25.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish they would give us 5 rune pages at lease for free for each role.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-10-09T16:27:29.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they did that, and put more runes on discount, I'd be more than happy and probably would have nothing negative left to say about the whole rune system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zzman73051","date":"2015-10-09T16:30:22.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While im not saying ur wrong about the mastery page limits, I feel that once you hit 20 mastery pages that at least ONE of those twenty would work for a champion you want to play","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-10-09T16:42:29.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know. I just prefer to have one tailored completely to my chosen champion. I'd be the same way with runes, having pages tailored to virtually every champ, if they didn't cost so much. The differences between the \"ideal\" masteries and ones that are \"close enough\" aren't the most significant, but I worry that not having, say, Dangerous Game or Swiftness on a champion that needs it might make just enough of a difference to screw things up. Even having 1 crit mark can change a game completely, and I look at masteries the same way.","replies":[]}]}]}
