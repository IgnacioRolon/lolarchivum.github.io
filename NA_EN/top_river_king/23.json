At this point, I just want some people to play and improve with. My real life friend, who got me into the game, barely plays anymore and trashes the game even as he's playing it. Additionally, he's become a shell of his former self in terms of his play and, despite his talk about wanting things to be fun again, his attitude kills any fun we might have.\r\n\r\nWhat made me come to love this game was seeing myself get better and getting to have some fun while doing it. But when you seem to be the only one with the right attitude, that's not really in the cards.\r\n\r\nAll I ask of any hopefuls is that the following things apply to you:\r\n\r\n1.) You're focused upon improving, as well as helping others improve.\r\n2.) You're not toxic.\r\n3.) You take the game seriously.\r\n4.) You're available to play after 8pm EST.\r\n\r\nThose four things are pretty much all that matter. I'd like to use voice chat, obviously, but which program is up to whatever everyone wants. I don't really have a preference one way or another. And, as far as positions are concerned, I'm a support main, but can also go top if necessary as it's what I used to main.\r\n\r\nSo, if you're interested, you can post here with some information about yourself, or friend me in game. It doesn't really matter which. Whenever I'm available, we'll play, see how things go, and I'll decide whether you make the team or not based on that. As #4 suggests, that tends to be after 8pm EST, as I get off work between 8-11 most nights and play for at least a couple hours.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and interest!","replies":[{"poster":"Jeyy Felix","date":"2015-12-05T20:16:08.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: IamJuex\nRole: Jungle/Top\nActive since season 2 - 3 ish \nHighest rank: Gold 5\nPlayed with a team very casually for fun maybe 2 seasons back\nAny communication program works for me\nAvailable later nights\n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suave TÃ­o","date":"2015-12-05T18:23:12.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long But It has all the Info and more+\n\nROLE:Adc/Mid/Jungler\nAge:17\nMade the Account in 2011, But started playing Last Year On my account.\nHighest Rank: Sliver I\nRANK:Sliver 3 Heading towards Gold :3\nTeam experience:I played with a Gold and plat team during season 4.Play CS:GO LE Rank.
