When I picked him back up this week, I was surprised by how weak he felt. I was out of practice, sure, but it was really rough.\r\n\r\nI looked up his win rate in plat+ and it&#039;s ~45% for top, mid, and jungle, with his win rate only surpassing 50% for those who have played him top or mid 125+ times, and even then just barely.\r\n\r\nYet his popularity and ban rate remain high. In fact, they&#039;re the only things he&#039;s anywhere near the top in. Clearly people still enjoy playing him, probably due to his grab bag of a kit. And people probably hate and ban him for precisely the same reason.\r\n\r\nHe&#039;s near the bottom in every other category, though, and I know this won&#039;t make me popular... but couldn&#039;t he stand to receive buffs of some sort? Or does everyone want him to stay as is, only seeing success in the most experienced hands, and even then not much?","replies":[{"poster":"Player of Games","date":"2015-11-27T03:23:57.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone with an 80% winrate in ranked with Ekko and one of the main champions I got the diamond with, Riot has to be very careful about how they go in terms of buffing him. He has a naturally very overloaded kit and the only way I can see them buffing his numbers is if they shift levels of power in between his kit. As it stands a good Ekko has an answer for almost everything, you can't chase him, he can chase you, he has a dashing targeted blink-strike which can traverse walls, a gamechanging timesplitter ult, and a ridiculous stun if it's landed properly. Also one of the only champions in game with a very heavy movespeed sap.\n\nI personally feel like he's on the weaker side, because he can definitely be exploited, but there are huge outplay opportunities for him within his kit which feel unbelievably satisfying when executed right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsStout","date":"2015-11-27T21:40:26.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think he's near perfect balence- he's difficult to play and use, sure, but he definately doesnt feel bad to play.

The best thing to do is get them to some decent state and just leave them there; leave them until their kit gets worked on.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsStout","date":"2015-11-27T21:41:24.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broken...?\n\nUuuhhh... are we all talking about the same champ?","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-11-28T06:08:57.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Echo, right?

His combo is a little easy to mess up but hard hitting when you manage to. He can towerdive with ease and he can usually 1v2, 1v3 with his ult up.
