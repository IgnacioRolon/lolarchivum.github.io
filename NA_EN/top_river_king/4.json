Oh, and they spam laugh as they do this. But because it's bots people act like I'm not allowed to be the least bit frustrated. Do I maybe overreact a little in some instances of this sort of stuff? Sure. Except for people to go so far as to say they're reporting _me_ for simply pointing out and taking issue with this troll-ish behavior, as has happened a time or two, is absurd.\r\n\r\nI play bot matches for an easy FWOTD, and to just have some leisurely fun killing easy competition. I play them to avoid the toxicity and pressure of normal matches. So sorry if I don't take kindly to people going out of their way to ruin that fun with blatantly obvious attempts at trolling me in-game. I don't think that's too unreasonable of me.

No matter the match-type, friend or foe, I'm reporting you for that. Likewise, I've had some obvious intentional feeders in bot matches, ones who made winning the bot match an actual challenge, and I didn't hesitate to report them either. People like to forgive people because \"it's just bots\" or \"it's just a normal game,\" but I'm of the opinion that no exceptions are to be made. Aside from obvious ones like knowing your friend's internet went out and that he has no way of rejoining. You can't always stop your teammates (or opponents) from reporting them, but if I know being AFK is completely out of someone's control I'm not going to report them. That's one of the only exceptions I can think of that I'd ever make, though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2015-12-25T05:25:35.259+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree in the sense that actively trolling is bad no matter what.\n\nThe qualifier is that things like duo or triple mid are NOT trolling in bot games. They are actually a super effective way to end the match asap for your first win bonus. All I'm saying is that too many times I get complainers whining about the meta when the meta doesn't exist in bot games. Bots are too stupid for a meta to exist. You can literally so anything you want in a bot game and you will win.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-25T05:32:31.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played mostly bot games leveling, and I do a bot game for my First Win bonus.

I've sat at base for a moment here and there in frustration, but this time I stayed in the fountain for a couple minutes just to put us out of our misery. My teammates had already fed the bots beyond the point of no return, and I didn't have time to play the rest of the match (which we'd lost any chance of winning) out, and so I thought I'd accelerate our demise. I needed to get to work.\n\nThe other was a 5v5 where my teammates flamed me the entire match for daring to suggest I used bot matches to practice _anything_. I got too caught up in arguing with them, and they got too caught up in arguing with me, and we were too distracted to stop the bots from winning. Not my finest hour.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-12-25T05:34:51.253+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"If everyone is on the same page, sure. But if you have one person mid, and one or two others just randomly go mid without saying a word, and refuse to leave or even respond when the person who was mid repeatedly asks them to leave, I do view _that_ as trolling. For example, I've had it happen tons of times where I call mid specifically to have a 1v1 match-up where I can focus primarily on my last hitting and 1v1 trades, since even supports in bot matches can't resist the urge to steal kills and/or CS, only for someone to just randomly waltz down my lane and say \"duo mid.\" And I've had them refuse to leave even when I kindly, and repeatedly, try to explain why I absolutely don't want that. That's the sort of behavior I take issue with.\n\nI've had other bot matches where we had two junglers, and they each just kept to the jungle on one side of the map and both of them were perfectly okay with that. You can do stuff like that in bots, but to just force anything unexpectedly upon someone (and harass them for not going right along with it) is never acceptable behavior, in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-12-26T04:16:09.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's weird that people have a concept that there should be a required support or jungle in easy bots. You get fwotd in easy bots (although I switched to dominion bc you can do it in 7-10 min instead of 10-15) and can literally play anything you want and win, plus there is no pick order bc it is simultaneous blind pick so it's not like someone is last pick and filling a role. Generally you just go to where doesn't have people in the lane (then again I just proxy farm mid and kill champs in their base past 10 min usually until my team pushes down inhibs).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2015-12-25T15:46:26.163+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TahmumuhaT,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=pBmEUhRE,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-12-25T05:34:51.253+0000)\n>\n> If everyone is on the same page, sure.

You have no right to enforce your view on anyone in a match made game. I feel your frustration because it is annoying, but at the same time it's a bit arrogant to think you can \"call\" something in a bot match and get it. 9 times out of 10 if someone actually calls something, I go duo with them teach them the error of their ways.  You can ask, you can't call.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2015-12-26T08:03:49.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's what bot games are for.

It's annoying but it's just like eh, you're being annoying, go get me fwotd while I dance, ty. Even if Tahm or Kalista was moving you there are 3 other people who are pushing and will win the game pretty easy, and the troll will probably get bored and go mess w/ someone else so then you can go to a lane they aren't in and push it.\n\nIt's entirely reasonable for you to be annoyed and frustrated someone is being a jerk, but this is also assuming you aren't being up tight about taking it super serious like it's a real game. I've had people get mad bc I \"KS\" in a bots game and I laughed super hard. They got upset when I killed something a second time (I think we were in the same lane) and I said they were too up tight about me getting kills when I wasn't trying to just snipe them, and then proceeded to show them the difference of what it looks like to try and snipe them. We were like 2/0/2 each in lane or something and I think I ended like 30 or 40 kills w/ a death or two and less than 10 assists while they had less than 10 kills and at least 20 assists (at one point I started farming the bots as they walked off the fountain and the team was only able to get assists on about half the kills). It's all a balance between not being that jerk who is bothering someone who hasn't done anything and is asking you to stop trolling them, and being the guy who is so set on playing bots like it's ranked that they insist you're trolling if you aren't playing strictly meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchpadExpert","date":"2015-12-25T22:27:21.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play bots regularly. I've lost about 10 in my career and have about 2300+ wins. I've seen it all and have even done some of it too. Like if an ally is teleporting I will pillar them to interrupt their teleport. But I only do that if I am 100% confident in my team.\n\nAs far as how to deal with arrogance and poor manners, I am usually better at playing the game than the majority of those player.s If you show them up half a dozen times they tend to leave you alone. If they still talk smack I just point out the stats for that game and go about my business. If they are better than me I just give them a gj or two hoping they shut up. Otherwise I just ignore them.\nToxicity I try to put the bullseye on my back in hopes that they leave my teammates alone. You can do this easily by mildly taunting the toxic player or by downplaying their decisions. I've been told that I am \"no fun\" to troll and know how to waste a troll's time. If Tahm eats you just press b. He cannot eat an ally who is backing. If Trundle is pillaring you while you are backing just sit still and bad as soon as he initiates a pillar. By the time it comes off cool down you will be back at base. Same with anivia walls. Kalista ults you can actually use to direct when and where you go. Launch yourself behind them and leave them for dead. Bard ults are too infrequent to have a legitimate strategy to combat it.\n\nWhen they build troll build I will ask why they are building that. I treat them like an afk/feeder until they prove otherwise. I suggest an item to them. They usually ignore me but I try. Sometimes you can suggest some troll items for them that at least have a useful active on it. Like randuins omen on Quinn or frost queen on Tryndamere. Sometimes that works if you word it like so \"Quinn please don't tell me you are planning on building a randuin's omen.\" They usually try to rush it to spite me but in reality its doing what I want them to do.\n\nKill stealers don't bother me because I simply don't care but if they bother you just ignore killing the enemy for a little while. Free farm. Don't even bother harassing the enemy. Waste the other guys time. Don't bother with buffs as he will just try to snipe it. If you do try to take one take it when an ally is going for a kill or dragon. Make the kill stealer have to choose between taking your buff or an ally's kill. These players are only annoying early on as the kill gold values decrease the more they get killed without getting a kill. Sometimes I will make small talk with them, let them know they really don't bother me. Sometimes I make it into a friendly competition and we take turns kill stealing one another and recognize when he beats me out. Personally these are the easiest toxic behavior to manage as they don't do anything to make you lose the game, just to steal the spotlight from you a few times. Not the end of the world. Don't let this bother you.","replies":[]}]}
