Or are you a more eclectic sort of League player?\r\n\r\nFor me, it occurred to me yesterday that I can't help but love walking balls of \"nope.\" By that I mean champions centered around denying others in some fashion.\r\n\r\n{{champion:78}}  and {{champion:223}} , my two favorite champions to play right now, are the perfect example of this. Poppy's kit is centered around disengage and stopping engages, and Tahm's is centered around an ability that gives allies what amounts to a moving {{item:3157}}. Nothing is more satisfying for me than, say, interrupting {{champion:89}}'s Zenith Blade to my ADC with Heroic Charge.\r\n\r\nBut that quality isn't limited to those two. The following would also qualify as big (or little) balls of \"nope,\" I'd say: {{champion:432}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:111}} . Just to name a few.","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 MID LANE","date":"2016-01-26T16:26:32.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite champions all suck, but that's because I play them.\n\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:103}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Billy VoHagen","date":"2016-01-26T16:49:32.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only champs I have Level 5 master on are {{champion:131}}  {{champion:91}} {{champion:18}} and {{champion:72}} (pre- second rework)\n\nSo....

Everytime I play them I'm put into a situation where I just say fuck it and get the rewards or the losses, hence why I'm a jungler.

I'm more the guy who always ends up with the fewest deaths on my team unless I have to constantly sacrifice myself for my teammates, given I play so many tanks. My positioning, decision making, and mechanics just aren't good enough to perform consistently with squishier, riskier champs. I need that margin for error being tanky gives me, which is why I've only ever hard carried with champs like Ekko and Wukong who have survivability to go along with their damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Talkrr","date":"2016-01-26T17:13:46.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's your style. I want to have the least deaths but I play so many off-meta builds like reksai devourer for example it's just like, she's so squishy but I'm so used to her kit that I can out maneuver so many people.Bard Jungle is another thing I do, same with Bard Mid. I wouldn't call them troll picks because more than likely I'll not carry but I'll support my team, set up ganks while making the big plays.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-01-26T19:57:20.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know people like Faker and Forgiven will skip defensive runes entirely and make it work, but I'll never be one of them. Heh. I build almost everyone, minus ADCs, like an off tank. It's why I'm afraid to do stuff like Vel'Koz support: to make it work, a full damage setup is required. So one wrong move and you're gone. That's why I admire people who can successfully and consistently do those sorts of things.\n\nI have totally thought about trying Bard jungle before, though. Get all the chimes and wreck everyone. Sounds like an awesome idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Talkrr","date":"2016-01-26T21:16:51.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vel Koz Support is fuuuuucking crazy!

Urgot's about as tanky as a marksman gets, aside from Graves. Volibear (volt ear or volume bear, if I let autocorrect have its way) has his crazy passive. Illaoi is tanky to begin with, and helped by her tentacle lifesteal. Those 3 are also all pretty immobile and have key abilities based around inserting themselves into the middle of a fight (Urgot and Illaoi's ults and, well, Voli's entire kit).\n\nTalon, though, is a definite outlier, which I think we all have.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohob","date":"2016-01-26T18:41:27.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing about {{champion:6}} is, i don't view him as a tankier marksman, i view him as something like an AD xerath, and use the shield only offensively for the slow","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-01-26T19:51:26.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you seem to be one of the eclectics!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Taric the Gay","date":"2016-01-26T16:55:04.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite champions are all gay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-01-26T16:35:55.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:133}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:55}} \n\nI'm not really sure.
