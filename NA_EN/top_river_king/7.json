Which, though, would get your vote for dumbest?\r\n\r\nFor me, it's Ryze... **by far**. He initiates with his ult as if it were his old ult, just teleporting random places with it. He'll do the bronziest of tower dives on you for no apparent reason. No matter how far behind he is, he'll try and all-in you. He could be one auto away from dying, but still walk right into your range for some stupid reason. He can't combo worth a damn. It's like picking on a mentally deficient pre-schooler.\r\n\r\nWho else do you think is worthy of consideration for the award?","replies":[{"poster":"Curious Kat","date":"2016-09-18T15:04:03.082+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka is exceptionally special and silly, just auto banana's you while you kill her, doesn't run away as long as you keep in range, it's so funny.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darth StepVader","date":"2016-09-18T19:44:00.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:33}} :he dives in your tower if he happens to start chasing you with powerball\n{{champion:105}} :doesnt use any of its abilities unless allied bots are nearby\n{{champion:41}} : .......\n{{champion:75}} : 20 mins in...3 stacks","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-09-18T20:04:35.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GP knows when and where to ult, at least.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StainlessTweedle","date":"2016-09-18T15:25:21.768+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze.

I'll be recalling under my turret with no mana and half HP and he'll tower dive me, maybe getting one auto on me, take a turret shot or two, walk away with a sliver of HP, and then get easily finished off by me. You can shepherd all of the bots away from lane to kill them when they become too scared to fight you anymore, but Ryze borderline intentionally feeds players, doing all the work for you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-09-18T15:03:30.530+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Orianna bot just randomly ults for no reason in lane.
