At least in concept. Everyone gets a role they&#039;re comfortable with, doing away with the pre-match bickering about who goes where. Pick intent helps even further by making it easier to build a decent team comp, and gives you an easy way to tell your teammates &quot;don&#039;t ban (blank).&quot; Even as a support main, getting support is too much of a guarantee if you have fill or support as either your primary or secondary. Likewise, the more popular roles, mid in particular, are so impossible to get that people are choosing mid as their secondary just to guarantee they get their primary. But I&#039;m willing to put up with the drawbacks for now, especially since I know Riot&#039;s trying to fix things.\n\nThat all being said, I honestly see no reason to do away with teambuilder aside from it being an obvious ploy to get everyone to use new champ select. Teambuilder was the go to for anyone looking to practice a particular champion in a particular role. Now that&#039;s pretty much impossible unless you&#039;re practicing a support. Like I&#039;ve been one win away from level 5 with Malphite. Tried top primary, mid secondary. Got top, but Malphite was banned. Tried it again. Got mid. Tried it a third time. Got mid again and dodged. Tried top/support. Got top and Malphite, but the enemy Quinn went berserk, factoring in on 18 kills and not dying a single time (in 25 minutes). Top/support again, and got top... but someone dodged. Then top/support yet again... and support. Going Malphite support just for the hell of it because I give up. EDIT: And I lost that too because, outside of his ult, support Malphite is the equivalent of a roaming minion.\n\nAll I want is to be able to spam champions to practice them outside of ranked, Riot! Is that so much to ask?","replies":[]}
