It's just a matter of keeping things in perspective.\n\nFor example, my skillshots used to be so poor that I'd avoid skillshot-reliant champs entirely. Anytime I would play Blitzcrank, I practically triggered PTSD-style flashbacks for my friends. Wanting desperately to improve, I started spamming Blitzcrank in bot matches.\n\nBut bots are easy to hook, I can hear you saying. Precisely, which is why they were such a natural starting place. If I can't hook bots, then what chance do I have against an actual opponent? Baby steps, people. Moreover, their predictability also allowed me, in a way, to practice the important part I was forgetting, that skillshots are just as much about prediction as they are about aim. Again, it was all about baby steps. With both bots and humans, you need to read their tendencies and exploit them. Against bots, I laid the foundation, learning the concept, then in normals I built upon it.\n\nEver since then, I've noticed my skillshots as a whole have improved since bots ingrained in me the basic principle that governs someone's ability to land them. Now all I have left to suss out regarding skillshots is their timing and hitboxes. This isn't to say I land every skillshot, but that I have confidence now in my ability to land skillshots when I need to, so long as I know those two things about the skillshot in particular.\n\nIn short, though you'll always learn more from facing real people, bots can be great for laying valuable groundwork if you go at them the right way. You can work on CSing, test out jungle paths/clears, get a basic feel for matchups, try out new things, practice combos, learn the ins and outs of a champion (their power spikes, limitations, etc.), etc. For me, this makes things a heck of a lot easier once I finally make the leap to normals or ranked because everything's easier once the basics are second nature.","replies":[{"poster":"HayRoss","date":"2015-10-20T13:17:40.886+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Want to really practice skillshots?

But in the few times I do get dragged into PvP I've been able to use that basic foundation of skill to have some serious fun at the other team's expense.  There are some good concepts you can learn from them, if you look.\n\n- Bots are hyper-aggressive in lane.  Playing against them is a fair way to learn why this is a bad thing for you to do and how to punish people who do it.  I've fought gold-ranked Riven mains to a standstill in lane simply because I'm so used to bots being lane bullies and I know how to capitalize on it.\n\n- Intermediate bots dodge most skillshots like they were Plat-Diamond tier.  If you can reliably land Thresh hooks on the bots at range you're amazing, because they can and will dodge a pixel out of its hitbox at a 90-degree angle every time.  This makes bots great for practicing skillshots against.\n\n- Bots also aim their own skillshots very well and are actually pretty good at predicting your movement.  One of my biggest laughs was in a custom game with a few friends testing builds, watching Ashe Bot become a reliable source of kill assistance due to her uncanny ability to land her Crystal Arrow across enormous distances on enemies, including players, I just knew would get away.  And Lux Bot will quite happily snipe you at max range with her laser if she has line of sight.\n\n- Bots chain CC and execute wombo combos with inhuman speed and precision.  You can very quickly learn how to abuse timing gaps and avoid the wombo when you're fighting them, especially when the bot mid is someone like Annie, Veigar, or Brand.  This makes player wombos and CC chains easier to get out of.\n\nSure there's a lot you don't learn (there's no need to ward, bot aggression makes learning to CS difficult, there's never an enemy jungler, etc) but it's not a worthless game mode like some people think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpartenA7991","date":"2015-10-20T04:46:00.174+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots help team you the basics and for practice.

You know why I got to be so successful with Garen on my other account? I played him so damned much, whether it be bots or ranked or 3v3, that I could be facing a Teemo or down 0/3 in lane and my experience and familiarity with him would be enough to best whatever I went up against. Because of him, my approach with any champion I'm taking seriously is to spam the heck out of, match type be damned, from bots to ranked. Thanks to this approach, I've improved immensely as a player. It used to be that I would write off certain champions entirely as not for me, but now no champion seems insurmountable because I've laid so much groundwork.\n\nBots isn't the final lesson. It's the introductory material without which you'd be lost. Take Thresh's hook, for example. Thresh used to be one of the most daunting champions in the game for me. But then I learned Blitz's hook, starting out small by practicing it against bots, then graduating to real opponents. From there, it just became a matter of getting a feel for its unique delay and hitbox.\n\nThis is how I learn the game. I start simple with things that can be practiced against bots, like CSing or certain combos (ex. the Shurima Shuffle), and then work my way up from there, bit by bit, until a champion like Orianna, who I'd written off without even trying, somehow feels familiar despite having never played her because I can find the parallels between her and Lulu.\n\nAnd there's a **huge** difference between what I'm advocating and your silly \"ADC Soraka\" example. What I'm talking about is using it as a testing ground for things that would serve as a barrier for me if I were to try it first in a normal match. Had I not played a bot match with Shaco before I tried him that one time in team builder, I would've probably done poorly enough for my team to report me for unskilled and/or intentionally feeding. Because, for the majority of that bot match, I was clueless and, well... confused. I'd do things without really knowing how I did them or what exactly was going on. But, since they were bots, I wasn't spending most of the match dead as a result of this, and by the end of the match I had a basic idea of how Shaco worked. In short, I learned more from that one bot match than I would've learned from hopping into a normal and spending half the match dead. I doubt I would've had anywhere near enough time to pass that \"what is going on!?\" stage, and I would've had people raging at me the whole time.\n\nIn bots, there are no stakes, especially since it can be 60-20 in their favor and you can still win just by split pushing (I've done it; my teammates were horrific), and so it's rare that you see someone raging at a teammate for doing poorly. Sure, a bot is a different beast than a human opponent, but sometimes you're better off working things out against a bot first.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Clint Orris","date":"2015-10-20T05:20:51.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is that people don't behave anything like bots.

However, no one tends to call that learning bc being able to mechanically beat bronze IV isn't nearly as difficult as being able to deal w/ the lack of team work and high amount of rage that exists in such low elo (plus bronze is the bottom 30% of the server, so intermediate bots preps you MAYBE to beat the bottom 10% (low bronze) of the server in terms of difficulty)\n\n2) Intermediate bots isn't a place to practice something you can play, but it's a great place to practice something you have no idea how to play. If I buy a new champ I usually play a game of intermediate bots before I go pvp so I'm not looking at my skills to figure out if CD goes down for each one when I rank it up, or what each one does for scaling etc. Yeah I could do that same thing by reading the wiki or something, but I wouldn't get a feel for the hit box of skills or range of the skill (I play on smart cast so getting a feel for the range is important). I have the bad habit of only playing ranked for the most part, so bots are an important mode bc I can learn a hit box or range for a new champ picking up first win of the day when I don't have time for a real game and then I will at least know a little before I play the champ in ranked.\n\nBasically you can learn stuff, but the things you learn are so basic they are what you would use sandbox mode for. You don't learn anything in terms of strategy/game knowledge, but you can learn mechanics stuff just fine. The issue is that everything you can learn in bots could probably be learned in sand box mode more easily (IE no cd on blitz pull and 3-5 champions just set to walk around in lane and not fight would teach you those same basics but faster bc that's all you focus on and there's no cd), so bots isn't a place to learn so much as it is the only option currently. If you bring out sand box mode there will be a better place to learn then bots and bots goes back to just being for fun when you want an easy 150 IP and to play ADC Annie.","replies":[{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2015-10-20T17:04:01.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, intermediate bots may have Bronze 4 like strategy, but they dodge shill shots _WAY_ better tan even a lot of gold tier players I've seen.","replies":[{"poster":"Yormaughm","date":"2015-10-20T19:59:36.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They also pull off insane last second escapes.

That´s a really difficult thing to get right though and needs a lot of experience.\n\nFor CSing on the other hand botgames work incredible well - as intermediate bots really don´t care about CS, they instead try to go aggressive on you...so it´s a very good environment to learn keeping up CS while being under pressure.\n\nSo like you said, it´s very good for learning the basics (mechanics + CSing), but for getting a deeper understanding of the makro game it´s really not helping all that much (though if you play 1v5 you´ll learn a lot of the importance of wave-pushing and sidelane pressure)...which is pretty much alright.

The roommate who introduced me to the game taught his GF at one point and I think she made it to level 10 on her account before she learned how to tell when she started tanking tower. Hell for the first few levels she just died a bunch to towers every game bc she walked too far forward and couldn't figure out why she was dying. For ranked though no one is learning stuff like that anymore.\n\nI think learning the basics is definitely a good use for bots bc we don't have sand box, but (and maybe this is just bc I don't adapt it well) I think things like power spikes are harder to learn in bots than they are in ranked. I can't tell you how much damage I'm going to take based on my armor, and I can't tell you the exact number on what my damage will be, but I generally have a good feel for it relative to my opponents. That last part is important. Shyv damage has a huge spike when you finish botrk and get sated, but if you do that at 12-15 minutes (which shouldn't be too hard vs bots) compared to 20-25 minutes (a game where you get behind, which won't happen in bots) that spike looks really different. Add in that the spike looks different again if you get the early items but one opponent on the enemy team gets fed and has damage + a finished defensive item, and it starts getting more variables to a power spike really fast. For me, I don't find enough use out of memorizing the exact numbers of how much damage I do w/ x, y, and z items, as I do in learning relative strength of \"if I'm fed early I can do X, but if the enemy gets big then I can only do Y.\" It's an important distinction bc being able to solo dragon is important, but if you can't survive a hit or two from the enemy should they show up and you need to run, then you had better make sure you weren't seen and have a really safe escape route just in case.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-10-20T17:29:25.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As with everything else, I'm not saying your knowledge of any of these things will become perfect through playing bot games.

Sure the don't flash out of the way, but bots tend to be able to read when you attempt a skillshot faster than a human and without the miscalculation that most human players suffer from when dodging.

Them not punishing fuckups becomes an advantage since you'll still know you messed up (IE Blitz hook missed) but you'll also be able to try again without too much risk.\n\nI'd say I learnt my skillshots mostly from AI, dodging mostly from ARAM and awareness mostly from SR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FDru","date":"2015-10-21T14:48:53.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that you can't learn anything in bot matches, it's that you can't get better at PvP in bot matches, so they aren't a good place to \"practice\".

You can learn a lot about a champion in bots and set yourself up for more success than if you'd just jumped to PvP right away.\n\nThat's what I use bots for, and people still act like I'm crazy when I mention it in match. For example, on multiple occasions lately I wanted to do a simple 1v1 mid, called mid first... only to have some idiot on my team say \"we'll go duo mid,\" then insult me when I point out that, no, I want to go solo mid to practice.\n\nThat by having a 2v1 in bots they were further reducing what I could learn. It made it almost impossible to get a feel for CSing, with them trying to CS as well. And, while I can get somewhat of a feel for a match-up when I'm going 1v1, figuring out what advantages I or my opponent would probably have in a real match (due solely to the match-up) based on how the bot and I interact, a 2v1 offers even fewer opportunities to suss such things out.\n\nI even lost a 5v5 bot match for the first time ever because, one match, I ended up arguing with a couple people on my team all match about the worth of bot matches. These idiots went so far as to spend half the time critiquing my grammar... in a game where people generally type in lower-case and forgo proper grammar so as not to waste more time than necessary. I have never seen two people spend so much time nitpicking someone, and I can't believe I let them get under my skin so much... but I did. And we ended up losing because the 3 of us were too busy typing to out-do the bots when it comes to finishing a game. I even got my first ever warning, saying I'd been reported for negative attitude, I believe it was.\n\nSo **that** is why I'm so fed up and felt the need to make this thread. I wanted to prove to myself that I'm not alone in thinking like this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pykel","date":"2015-10-21T05:25:00.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you ever faced brand bot? that dudes broken :) never misses skillshots {{champion:63}}","replies":[]}]}
