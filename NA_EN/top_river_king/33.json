People stopped complaining about it, but it hasn&#039;t really gotten any better. About half the time it seems to just assemble teams at random, ignoring everyone&#039;s ranks. Like one match, my team was Unranked (S6 Silver), Bronze 1 (S6 Silver), Silver 2 (S6 Plat), Unranked (S6 Silver), and (me) Bronze 1 (S6 Silver) vs. Unranked (S6 Plat), Bronze 1 (S6 Gold), Silver 5 (S6 Gold), Diamond 5 (S6 Plat), and Unranked (S6 Silver). The match prior to this, it was Silver 5 (S6 Silver), Unranked (S6 Gold), Unranked (S6 Gold), Unranked (S6 Gold), and (me) Bronze 1 (S6 Silver) vs. Gold 4 (S6 Plat), Silver 5 (S6 Gold), Unranked (S6 Silver), Unranked (S6 Gold), Plat 5 (S6 Plat).\r\n\r\nWhether you&#039;re going based off this season&#039;s ranks or last season&#039;s, neither of these make sense. If we&#039;re looking at last season&#039;s ranks, you have 4 Silvers and 1 Plat vs. 2 Plats, 2 Golds, and 1 Silver in that first match, then 3 Golds and 2 Silvers vs. 2 Plats, 2 Golds, and 1 Silver in the second match. If we&#039;re looking at everyone&#039;s current ranks, it&#039;s 1 Silver, 2 Bronzes, and 2 Unrankeds vs. 1 Diamond, 1 Silver, 1 Bronze, and 2 Unrankeds in the first match, then 1 Silver, 1 Bronze, and 3 Unrankeds vs. 1 Plat, 1 Gold, 1 Silver, and 2 Unrankeds in the second match.\r\n\r\nI get that matchmaking is based on MMR, an invisible number, but it normally aligns with ranks to some degree, and so this just strikes me as complete nonsense. Anyone else have similar experiences with flex queue?","replies":[{"poster":"death by techno","date":"2017-01-21T07:51:35.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a similar experience. I am currently Gold I in flex and unranked in solo/duo (last season Plat III) My last few matches have had players from Silver V to Diamond II and it seems to be entirely random. The game I just  finished takes the cake though... I was matched against an Ahri who was Master tier in solo/duo and was Diamond III in flex. Ofc that makes total sense and is completely fair for both sides :)))","replies":[]}]}
