Almost every skin for Renekton, and three skins for Sona.\nI don't enjoy playing any of those champs (except Poppy, and I use Blacksmith) :P","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-10-12T18:45:59.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The quadruple chance for legendary (and eSports) skins yesterday inspired me to mystery gift myself one... and I got TPA Orianna.
