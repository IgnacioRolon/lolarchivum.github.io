Yi is a melee adc. just think about it 10-15 min into the game as a jg you usually give up your red buff to your adc sometimes blue as well if mid doesnt need it. thats funneling shit to your adc if possible you also try to give your adc kills.. and bot lane fiestas are to funnel your adc... stop them from funneling their adc and get drag","replies":[{"poster":"Jng Account","date":"2020-02-27T17:32:38.121+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last time I checked, adc wasnt taking resourses from 2 lanes from the start of the match...\n\nLearn the difference ppl, you are another dude I encountered on Boards who thinks that Yi/Taric is same thing as bot lane.

Yi has his own issues in that he can scale to his potential a bit to quickly if he gets any lead but i am fine with the strat.. it has counters and b4 you point out the taric making him invuln for 2.5 seconds. CC is pretty good universally against things that wanna kill you.. if you blow all your teams CC on him b4 he Qs and he dodges it all with a Q thats your fault.. if you force him to Q then throw out your CC you can lock him down.. if your team doesnt have any CC or not enough.. likely you would of lost to any carry with a taric ult.\n\nedited b/c i dont use these boards often and this was the only way i knew how to double quote","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WTBeGirl100EUhr","date":"2020-02-27T17:47:44.676+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not what funnelling is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2020-02-27T16:37:24.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it is cool when they are different ways to win, as long as there are ways to counter it and make it difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2020-02-27T18:21:24.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and therein lies the problem with funneling; the only way to counter it is by coordinating with your team to shut down the enemy early","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2020-02-27T19:04:58.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though Riot has gone away from macro, if the game actually played like a team game, and strategy brought success than this would not be such a wild concept.","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2020-02-27T19:09:27.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed\n\nin a perfect LoL, funneling would not be a toxic strategy... but this is not a perfect LoL","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2020-02-27T22:04:22.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if the goal is to have players strong with strategy to be good, they could design champs and balance the meta around that end.
