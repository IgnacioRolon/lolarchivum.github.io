Sure you can have a rune page for each general matchup, but getting armor runes instead of hp runes don't help you that much. The only thing i would buy extra rune pages for are for tanks (i don't play them), and cdr, which is why i just bought 2 more rune pages last week.\n\nfyi, I got to gold 2 with 2 rune pages.

My IP income was also faster than the rate I was leveling up, so I was gradually able to fill up the last slots of my first page and start on the second.
