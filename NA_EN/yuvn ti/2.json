This leads to him building tanky earlier on. His old build used to be black cleaver because he needed that damage. He had to go phage first. Now they don&#039;t have to because he already has that damage. Furthermore, phage stacked with his Q is a little broken as well. It isn&#039;t fair to go versus him unless your pick completely counters his. And that is very rare. It&#039;s even at a point where a teemo does not stand any chance. That&#039;s just stupid.\r\n\r\nNerf the champion please.
