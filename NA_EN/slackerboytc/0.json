He's able to bully many laners there, and he can push really hard. The shorter lane also means more farm for stacking his W passive. He can also effectively roam early on using his ult, or all in his opponent very well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edbwn","date":"2015-01-21T01:51:20.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude I think he's pretty fun! And mid-late game just from farming and kills/assists you can get like 500 extra health on his W passive. He's super tanky, I do suck with his ultimate though, but yeah I really like him. Just start flask, spam q and e, not w, and have fun in lane :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-01-21T00:04:13.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is the hardest to play and learn, but most rewarding Top Lane ever.
