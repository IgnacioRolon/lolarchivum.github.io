My passive was up, and when I tried to cast one of the spells to set it off, I accidentally activated my trinket (red) and it cast the trinket. I immediately died, and my passive did not fire off.  I have not tried to recreate it yet.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-11T19:39:06.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meowdolph Kitler -\n\nThanks for the report!

It extends to all trinkets, however, I tried to see if it would work with any items that have actives (i.e. locket, frost queens, banner, ohm wrecker) and it does NOT. Also does not work with sight stone.","replies":[]}]}
