So it got me thinking...\r\n\r\nWhen was the last honor system improvement? And, are the honor rewards even enticing? \r\n\r\nHonestly, the skill based rewards are way more enticing than the honor system rewards. Streamers who are good are usually pretty toxic. Streamers who are good are looked up to by people who want to get good since they study those streamers to get better. In turn more people will pick up toxic behavior trying to achieve the skill based rewards. The honor rewards are far and few in between, yet skill based rewards are more accessible (checkpoints vs loot boxes and champion capsules). Now I do realize you need to get honors for key fragments, but lets be honest that is not hard to achieve at all (I have 18 unused finished keys). But, lets also look at the end of year rewards. You get a bas ass skin for being in high ELO and you get a ward skin for being high honor. I can confidently say almost everyone would choose the champion skin over the ward skin.\r\n\r\nSo can we get more incentive to be honorable in League of Legends?","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2020-02-28T18:06:26.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a cool ward, cool emote, 2 cool skins, and 2 cool chromas by being honorable.

The rewards are absolute freebies for playing. I have no extra respect for those with honor 5 and have no assumptions for those with no honor. The honors tags may as well be invisible.\n\nThere are those who do pursue it and wear it as a badge. So my case is potentially not the majority. By my approximation based on limited information, about 5-8% of players have been banned, and purely guessing that about 30%-50% of players have been punished, not counting LeaverBuster. Any of those players have certainly had to earn honor 5, as it is proof of reformed behavior. For the rest, I suppose silent players might have a bit of a hard time earning honors, which again leaves me to guess that you and I are among 20%-40% of players who basically get Honor 5 for free just by playing a handful of games a month. So, it does improve behavior, most notably those who have had to make effort for it.\n\nI've also been saying that honors need some serious revamping. Currently, it is incentive to not break the rules. I believe it needs to actually promote behavior that positively strengthens the identity of a League player. At the same time, I don't think we need to abandon the current system, but perhaps acknowledge it for what it is... more like Karma points. Be a good role model, earn Honor, be rule-abiding, earn Karma. However, that is a dream.\n\nIf you really want to hear my thoughts and dreams on that...","replies":[]}]}
