Type as little as possible: if you are at risk of demotion, chances are something negative might skip out. Try to type as little as possible, even if it&#039;s you trying to help. \n\n2. Use pings wisely: Be informative with what your next objective should be, where you&#039;re going, missing enemies, and when to back off. Do all this without spamming your pings. At most, three consecutive pings will do the job. \n\n3. Everyone makes mistakes: everyone whiffs an ult or skill shot, everyone has a bad flash, everyone gets caught out, etc. If you rage your teammate, they will not get better. If you just move on, they will probably learn from their mistakes and still have the confidence and level-headed attitude to get better. If they&#039;re repeat offenders and you want to Constructively help them, make sure you do it with tact. Before you say something, think about how you would react if you were them. If they take your criticism poorly, Don&#039;t Type Anymore. Leave it alone and let it die out.\n\n4. Everyone tilts: chances are, someone on your team is tilted. They might try to rage you. If you respond, you might be the one who gets reported. It doesn&#039;t matter if you were on defense, you were still wrong and reportable. So Use Your Mute Button. It&#039;s on the score board. Use it to save you from tilting, and potentially getting reported\n\n5. 1 report is as good as 9: It only takes 1 report from a single game to start the review of this person&#039;s reportable actions in this game. If you ask other people to report someone it is considered harassment. The number of reports a person received in a single game doesn&#039;t matter, it&#039;s the number of games the person gets reported in that matters. So report them silently. Otherwise, you could be reported for harassment.\n\n6. Focus on the positives: if you see a teammate make a good call or good play, give them a compliment. Positive comments will help you drop a punishment tier faster. Just remember to type less! Some examples: If a team fight goes well, tell your team good job. If someone's position was impeccable, tell them. Thank your support for shields and heals. \n\n7. Take a break: tilt can be from bad games and good games. If you're on a win streak, you may get too confident and start over extending and making mistakes. If you're on a losing streak, it probably won't get better because you will get tilted remembering your past mistakes and teammates. Either way, tensions will build from game to game so it may be best to take a break and reset after a few games. Otherwise you may be more inclined to rage when tensions are high or defeat comes your way.\n\nI&#039;ll update the list as more suggestions come in.\n\nTLDR\nPut yourself in their shoes before you say something to them.\nType less, mute, don&#039;t spam pings, don&#039;t be a douche.\nCompliment your team, take breaks.\nTwo wrongs don't make a right. Two wrongs make two bans.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-19T01:36:58.456+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, also I'd like to add that it helps a lot to ease a player's anxiety over their poor performance. And to build up their confidence for their good performance. For this I have two suggestions:\n\n---\n\n# One - Instead of flaming after mis-plays, support them:\n\nIf a player mis-plays and something goes wrong, you can cut the tilt in the bud if you just say something like, \"no worries mate, shit happens. We'll do better next time\"\n\nPlayers are much more able to focus and make smart plays if they aren't afraid to make a play at all out of fear of you harping on them the instant something goes wrong.\n\n---\n\n# Two - Build their confidence after good plays:\n\nCompliment them whenever a good play happens, bonus points if you identify what they did to bring about the good play.\n\nBy making them feel like you are watching them (in a good way) and ready to reward their good plays with compliments, they will feel more confident and may try harder to play well. They also will be less susceptible to tilt if something does go badly.\n\nAnd by identifying for them what it was that they did to make the play go well, they will be more likely to learn from it and focus on doing that again. People are very goal oriented, if they die during a gank, but your team gets the kill... \"great job farming under tower and keeping the lane frozen so we were able to gank\" (or its future tense version if proposing a future strategy) or \"good job baiting them out so we could kill them\" is a lot more helpful and a lot easier to understand than \"don't feed, scrublord noob\"","replies":[{"poster":"FuzzyLumps","date":"2017-12-19T03:40:57.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna bump this up because it's a great way to increase your chances of winning.

And I'm sorry, I forgot this was a thread about not getting banned.\n\nWith regards to that it helps because teammates won't feel like reporting you if you've been supportive, and they will feel like reporting you if you've berated them every time they made mistakes all game. No report = no risk of punishment. Even more mature or more inappropriate jokes will be taken more lightly and in good humor by people who think well of you, unlike people who dislike you.","replies":[{"poster":"FuzzyLumps","date":"2017-12-19T20:09:15.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You and one other guy convinced me.

If someone is going to report you for lack of communication, they are most likely flaming you. This is someone you should have already muted and will be able to report after the game. If you flame them back, you are reportable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2017-12-19T01:20:51.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. ❌ I disagree with this one.

We can argue this, but I wont respond to it. So then you'll be left responding to yourself, looking crazy, which hey usually sets in and makes people stop. <- This was sarcasm somewhat, but the gist of it is the same. There's almost nothing that you could type that can't be said with a ping in connection to the game. Seriously, I started an account in another country and though the ping is god awful, I have had to learn to communicate with a 100% language barrier, know what's not barrier'd?  Pings . . . Okay before I lose my audience let's actually get to a concrete point. \n\nIn my most recent games before my ban: \n- Every lose streak, and I mean every, proceeded with either a bad game on my part or my teammates, Probably 2 or 3 games down the line I start inting hard, and Im sure my reports start around there. \n\n-Every win streak, and I mean every, I was in those games, typing Gj almost every time my team did something good. Every time they did something that was even miniscule, I typed Gj. I even remember a thresh coming to my lane, literally missing everything, I still got the kill and I typed, GJ thanks for distracting him. If my team did something bad, I said All good, we still got this. Know what happened? My team tried to win, in almost every game we still tried until the very end. \n\nI notice, my positivity only stops when I let it. Being a sore loser is never going to help you improve. Naturally I am a sore loser, irl too. As much as I wanna cry to Riot about how there needs to be something to be done about these trolls or feeders, it's not their job, they've given me all the tools I need. I can mute text, and I can mute pings. If I wanna play Solo 1 v 9 by double muting everyone I can, but that's my choice to take on that danger, and I can only be mad at me for my choices. Just like flaming, It's your choice to flame, and when those punishments come you can only blame you for flaming and raging. \n\nKey to this game is attention, awareness, take deep breaths, dont let your body temperature get too high from frustration, drink lots of water during the game and through the day, masturbate, and try to be happy for what you could accomplish win or loss. Even if you got carried, appreciate that 12 Wards at 6 minutes you got. Appreciate that 76 CS at 10 minutes bro, you're probably better than 55% of the community on that. Be proud of that 1 dragon, because hell you could have given the enemy all 4. \n\nHowever on the flipside, you need to stay humble. Dont ever think your job of being positive is over. It's tiring sometimes, but it's always easier to flame and be toxic. It takes much more grit to suck that toxicity back in  and say something nice.","replies":[{"poster":"FuzzyLumps","date":"2017-12-19T20:54:19.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perfectly put man.

I might be banned right now, but Im not perfect, I can admit that, and I can also say I do a lot to really change myself, so this will be the last time Imma be in trouble and next time the Tribunal brings up struggle Jones it will be to ask  him if he wants to come on board","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2017-12-19T16:58:08.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this for people who has already been punished but  not permanently?\n\nIf so, while I totally agree less typing in game is good advice.

I would assume proper pinging and the use of the newer none chat options would do the same.\n\nGetting in a habit of saying a legit gj or positive statement would help with less negativity being thrown at that player.
