Jax once jumped over a boulder as high as the stars and he didn't feel scared when he was falling down. He swings his weapons so quick you'll get split in half by watching him. He only shows a very small bit of his talents in League, but hides it all away. This is because he is cool in the inside, not in the outside like many people are today, sadly. Jax can run so fast that everyone in the world dies. Jax treats others as he would like to be treated. He only eats half a cake and leaves the other half without a second thought, and all the other people gasp and open their mouths in awe, but Jax walks off as cool as you please. Then he trains for 100 hours in ten minutes and fights of the Gaurdian of the World after a long and tiring fight in which both fighters did their best and are heavily wounded and are full of grudging respect towards one another but Jax eventually wins, with difficulty even though Jax could have won anytime no sweat.
