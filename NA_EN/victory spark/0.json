And even *that* is old lore!  So tbh it's likely that Ekko and Jinx have never had a conversation before.  Taliyah and Ekko haven't either, actually.  Taliyah would only have a crush on Ekko if they *did* happen to meet, but that hasn't happened yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2018-02-17T02:48:12.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing with ships.
