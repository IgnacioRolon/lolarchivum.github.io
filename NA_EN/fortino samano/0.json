I've done competitive sports for 15-odd years, and, although I *do* put up with shit-talk, I much prefer environments where it doesn't happen. It's simply rude and unnecessary. Think of how many people, for example, would find a new coffee shop or bar if one of those venues allowed people to go around telling other patrons how worthless they are.\n\nRiot wants a friendly, approachable community where you're comfortable relaxing and playing a few games for fun. Weirdly, most people don't WANT to be abused or insulted during their leisure time.\n\nIf that's not to your liking that's fine, and I encourage you to find another game better suited to your desired behaviors.","replies":[{"poster":"Fortino Samano","date":"2017-11-08T00:24:34.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Imo some trash talk even make the game more passionate and intense,which is an experience desirable by many.And as i said,UP TO A POINT.To call some ugly words \"abuse\" expresses exactly the riot's point of view in this matter.Oversensitivity.Which ends up to be funny like in my case i think.\"Abuse\" is a very big word,i have been abused in school (bullied).This not abuse.People are playing,People sometimes are getting a bit hard.C 'est la vie.I accept my punishment,but i have to criticise that kind of thought.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-11-08T00:30:24.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dêxter,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WmZR9t1l,comment-id=000100000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-08T00:24:34.092+0000)\n>Imo some trash talk even make the game more passionate and intense,which is an experience desirable by many.\n\nGoing forward, I would suggest you take some time to find other ways to do this. There is definitely trash talk that is friendly, yet still passionate. There are ways to trash-talk in a constructive manner, and it does not involve insulting other players. If you continue to act in the manner displayed here that restriction will very quickly escalate to a permanent ban, which is what I'd like to help you avoid.\n\nUltimately my opinion and yours do not matter -- we are, ultimately, bound by what the community feels is inappropriate as learned (and enforced) by the IFS. This behavior isn't tolerated, no matter what either of us may say.","replies":[{"poster":"Fortino Samano","date":"2017-11-08T00:37:38.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are right,i wont say anything else(downvote raid) .I'll stick to dota I guess :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bansheenoir","date":"2017-11-08T04:11:35.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Welp, NO SEASON REWARD FOR YOU!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ra1uga","date":"2017-11-07T23:49:27.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The report system doesn't work that way.\nThe system checks for one or more reports, not amount of reports. 1 report=9 reports in this system.\nCould you post your chat logs?","replies":[{"poster":"Fortino Samano","date":"2017-11-07T23:57:53.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Got a little bit out of hand in games 2,3(tilted xD)game 1 is a joke to get reported cause of this :P\nGame 1\nDêxter: you banned yasuo :*\nDêxter: you trolled\nDêxter: you banned what i wanted to pick\nDêxter: punishment time\nDêxter: hhigly doubt that\nDêxter: and u ll report me for?\nDêxter: taking minions?\nDêxter: did NONE of these\nDêxter: offensive words?!!!!!
