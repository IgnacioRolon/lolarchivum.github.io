Honestly I don&#039;t really see the big deal. 80% cool down - wooh?! The rest of the stats are practically identical just made larger which grants percentage buff. I don&#039;t see the point. Can someone shed some light on my confusion? I enjoy the rapid fire evelynn and Vladimir and sona, but attack speed champs and defensive based champs seem to be lacking in purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"ShippoTail","date":"2016-04-25T22:03:13.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are double(or 1.5 for melee) attack speed, +25crit chance, 35% base tanacity, and a few other things like extra gold per 5 early game.

I wound up around 1800 MMR (at least thats what lolnexus was saying) and I think it was fun all the way through (well besides the 300% uptime on spin to win garen)\n\nwell... in reguards to the OP, those are things that typically help out ADC or attack speed based champions.\n\nOh and I did play pure tank bard, but if you want something scary look at {{champion:39}}  or {{champion:36}} 's tanacity (after they build MR boots as well) you can't ever CC them","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-04-30T10:06:56.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's the percentages that are pushed through the roof or is the tenacity the same for everyone?","replies":[{"poster":"ShippoTail","date":"2016-04-30T13:54:36.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said those to in specific because they have extra tenacity built into their kits (irelias passive, and Mundo's W).\n\nBut everyone gets all the buffs from URF, some make better use of some of the stats, like mages don't really care for crit...
