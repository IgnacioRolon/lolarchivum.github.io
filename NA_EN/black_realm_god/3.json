That&rsquo;s unfortunate because it results in:\n> &gt; \n> &gt;     Long matchmaking queues (not enough support players to go around).\n> &gt;     Players having to play a role they&rsquo;d prefer not to (getting autofilled to support to partially address the above problem).\n> &gt;     Players having to play a role more often than they&rsquo;d prefer (if they want to queue as support secondary or fill).\n> &gt; \n> &gt; We&rsquo;d therefore like to make support attractive to more players, without taking away what makes it appealing to existing support players.

It is purely a double jungle strategy. Comparing this to bard is just wrong, does Bard not even enter bot lane until level 9?\n\nIf you are complaining that the current system does not support alternate strategies, like double jungle, than that is something you can do. But he was queueing up as support, then refusing to fulfill what that role means within League regardless of his teams objections.\n\nI am willing to bet if he was actually bot lane there would be no issues, but he is playing in a way that is simply not supported in the current system unless you are also queuing up with others who are ok with your strategies.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-11-14T22:35:16.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"im sorry what? do you even bother to pay attention to any of his builds or his actual games? the video shows his name. clearly states it in the video. that singed players name when i searched it up shows a singed player with 2m points that is gold in solo/duo and silver in flex. it shows that the person the video is referring to DOES build income items DOES build support items and DOES have assists. in fact he has more assists than anyone on his team. he might not ward, but he does support. \n\nHE LITERALLY SUPPORTS BETTER THAN MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY BUYS SIGHT STONE.","replies":[{"poster":"Narsicus","date":"2016-11-15T00:09:25.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did look up his games, he spends so little time in lane that many sites often list him as a jungler, even when there is the obvious REAL person who was given the jungle role in game (they are a traditional jungle champion w/ smite and jungle items and that team lacks a traditional support champion with support items). These sites seem to know what a lot of people are overlooking, that what this Singed is doing is called JUNGLING.\n\nYour argument is basically 'he has assists, therefore he is a support' which is confirmed later when you say he \"supports better\" which of course you have no idea or metric of outside of assists.\n\nThis is just wrong, if I play Zac jungle and build full initiator/tank I will naturally get a lot of assists and relatively few kills. Does that make me a support? If I play support Annie or Brand and end up with less assists than the enemy Janna does that make me a 'bad' support?\n\nSupporting is a very specific role in League. It does not just mean 'support the team in their chances of victory' because that literally applies to every possible strategy. Queueing up as a support than NOT doing that role is what people are pissed about, and in my opinion rightfully so.\n\nOf course this comment is going to come under fire from people proposing that this 'enforces the meta' and 'stifles creativity' and truth be told, it does. But that is the sacrifice for creating 5v5 competitive matches made of 10 people who know nothing about each other. In an ideal world each game would start with some strategizing and off the wall ideas would be experimented with in that conversation, any person who has actually played ranked knows that this does not happen. People want a framework for what they are doing, the success of the new queue where you start off by picking a role shows this off well, that queue obviously 'enforced the meta' but the player base was overwhelmingly supportive of it.\n\nPlaying in a way that is supported by none of the traditional roles is a problem in a pick up group type queue, especially if you continue despite what everyone else wants. If you want to break the mold that is fine, just find people that want to do it with you.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-11-15T11:15:37.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"do you not understand how asinine that statement is?\n\nif you play annie or brand support you're getting reported by me from this day forward and i encourage anyone else who plays league to do the same. neither brand nor annie are listed as a support and if singed cant support while getting assists then you sure as hell cant play a non-support as support and not get assists.\n\nthe act of supporting automatically has a direct relationship to the amount of assists you get. period.\n\n{{item:2045}}{{item:2303}} {{item:2302}} {{item:2301}} {{item:2049}}  - does not automatically make you a support.\n\nwe're talking about a player who builds\n\n{{item:3401}} {{item:3109}} {{item:3050}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3110}} in varying forms  on his _**SINGED**_\n\nand buys\n\n{{item:2055}} {{item:2055}} {{item:2055}} constantly\n\nand brings\n\n{{summoner:6}} {{summoner:3}} {{summoner:12}} {{summoner:11}}  in varying amounts\n\nand uses\n\n{{item:3364}} every game.\n\nhe does the same thing on {{champion:106}} and no one says a word.\n\nannie and brand players buy\n\n{{item:3027}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} and no one says a word.\n\ndouble standard? i think so.\n\n\nit's funny looking back on that tyler 1 video now where tyler 1 bans phreaks zyra. back then zyra wasnt considered a support because she hadnt recieved her rework. had phreak not been playing with his friends tyler would have (according to what happened to singed) been in the right to report phreak for not communicating and not cooperating.\n\npersonally i dont think what tyler 1 did to phreak back then was right and i dont think what has been done to this singed is right. it's the same thing. if this injustice stands then the toxic community wins.","replies":[{"poster":"Narsicus","date":"2016-11-15T17:17:08.345+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to have completely ignored my point, which I find disheartening but not surprising.\n\nThe problem here IS NOT that he picked 'Singed support' the problem IS ENTIRELY that he picked Singed support then literally did what no one considers to be things associated with the support role.
