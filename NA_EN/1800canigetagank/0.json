URF mode has general buffs that augments every champion's ability (no resource costs, 80% CDR, AS/Crit buffs) which cover the entire champion pool and thanks to champion diversity - some champions are too good and some bad.\n\nAttempting to balance the outliers will just flesh out the different roster.
