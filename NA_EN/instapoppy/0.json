I did the minion minigame twice because i wasen't sure if it had worked. Each time i got 500 minions and tried to redeem the icon it wanted me to sign in again so i just assumed it worked. Is there a way to still get the icon? :(","replies":[{"poster":"InstaPoppy","date":"2016-11-27T20:12:24.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do!
