If so, ask him to make sure it is updated to Service Pack 2.  Otherwise, there might be other issues with his OS or hardware that's causing this problem.

For windows 7, ask him to make sure that the[ OS is updated](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49540) to the most current version to ensure he has all necessary products to install league.  If he continues to have issues, then there may be a hardware issue, but I rather rule out other possibilities first.
