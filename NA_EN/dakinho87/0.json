Since patch 7.13, my FPS is between 40-50. \r\nThe worst is that in teamfight, FPS falls to 20-30, and it's really frustrating. I can't play at such small FPS, because on the same setting a couple days ago, I had 120 FPS. \r\nThumb up to support can see my problem. Ty. \r\n\r\nSorry for bad English.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T22:48:28.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes after patches you might need to make a few other updates to your pc as well to make sure everything interacts properly.
