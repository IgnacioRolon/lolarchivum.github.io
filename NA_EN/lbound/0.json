Let's talk about how shitty riot support is. Tell us your stories here :3. If ever something comes up, like somoene close of mine gets hacked, or worse, loses their account password completely, and doesn't know how to retreave it, I highly doubt they'd help him/her, and wouldnt refer him/her to riot support Ever. What a fail Riot support is.\n\nOne thing on the other hand they can improve is firing every single riot support employee, and recruiting better ones at that.

Just to end it with that way we can give you an answer not a solution.. they won't fix whats wrong they will just say sorry we can't do this..

You realize that buying things isn't the same as renting or borrowing, right? They don't have to give you refunds, yet they still give everyone a certain amount because they're nice like that. It's nobody's fault but your own if you use more than that, or that you even need it in the first place. You can't just buy shit with Riot points by accident. \nAs for getting hit by LeaverBuster, saying it's not your fault? It's not Riot's fault either that your internet craps out. You've screwed the game for the four other people on your team, and the fact that you're even getting hit by a penalty for disconnected, means that you've been doing it frequently enough to get flagged by the system. If you're connection is that shaky, that's entirely on you. Not Riot. Get it fixed rather than bitching at them. \n> One thing on the other hand they can improve is firing every single riot support employee, and recruiting better ones at that. Who tells me that they can't handle a simple refund. The fuck?\nWhy should they handle people just because you're having issued caused by problems on your end? Seriously, you give the impression of being one of those customers that constantly yell and demand to see a manager, despite being at fault. By the sound of things, they're telling you they can't handle a refund because you've been asking for far, far too many. Stop buying shit you don't want, man. It's not a hard concept to grasp. People don't get fired just because you can't comprehend how things work. Fortunately. \n\nI've had to deal with Riot support a few times myself, and never have I felt like that they've been incompetent, or have had issues comprehending the problem I've had. And they've -always- provided a solution, even if they've had to bring in people from oher departments to do it. They've been polite, and provided information every step of the way. I mean hell, I've never even gotten the impression that I've been sent a copy-paste reply, and that says quite a bit in this day and age. \nThe -only- thing I could mention that's been even slightly negative, is the waiting period between replies. And I don't blame them for that, I know they have a lot of things to deal with, and the matters I've brought up haven't been super pressing. Seeing this thread, and the shit you've posted? Well, suffice it to say that I now understand why they can be a bit slow, if people flood them with dumbass requests such as those. \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Professor Thresh","date":"2016-06-21T05:56:08.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im i the only one that wants to know why he is buying champs with RP in the first place?
