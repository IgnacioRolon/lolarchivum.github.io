Far from a smooth client which was why I was so reluctant to install it during testing. Now I'm not sure if I'm just salty about the poo client but I am now linking the client to my problems that I am currently facing when trying to load in a game. I haven't done too much googling but I understand this is a recurring problems but I have yet to find a concrete fix.\r\n\r\nEVERYTIME I try to play a game, I ALWAYS dc for whatever reason and have to reconnect via client. As soon as the loading screen pops up, I am able to see champ splash arts and everything normal but I have yet to play a game without having disconnecting midway through loading screen (usually before I connect or can see my splash art). I always get the disconnected popup even tho I usually have a youtube video still playing in the bg and so my internet isn't an issue. I also recently uninstalled my antivirus/firewall so thats not the issue either. SO, right now I'm only looking at the thing that has given me problems since install; the client. Unless I'm wrong, please correct me and help me resolve this issue before you guys hit me with the leaver buster on top of the poor client. I've already gotten two leaves because of the issue that your game has given me along with a handful of late starts to my ranked games. Not that you guys care or anything but so close to unistalling altogether and saying goodbye to this downhill sloping game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ironics","date":"2017-05-17T20:51:25.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey it's me again,\n\nProblem fixed with the 7.10 patch.\n\nPost Closed.

I tried to cut my firewall from the Antivirus (Bitdefender), the Windows firewall, nothing changed. \n\nI tried using two different connections, one with my box from the ISP (Bouygues Telecom on Ethernet), and another one from the LTE (4G in Europe) by using USB. \n\nI tried to full repair my game, running it in admin mode. Nothing neither. \n\nThe bug first appeared after 8 min in ARAM Mode, then I kept disconnecting. I could see the game (even if it was laggy) but I couldn't do anything. My ping reached 28000+ then I was disconnected and reconnected with 300ms until it goes up to 28000+ again until the game was over.\n\nI tried another ARAM game after full repairing, same problem. Then I went to custom on SR alone to see if it was me, the first 20 seconds were very laggy, but then I had no more connection problem. I thought it was fixed so I went to ARAM again, and the problem was still there, I was crashing whole game stuck at the shop.\n\ni tried then to go to the Twisted Treeline because in this mode the remake is possible so it would be less annoying for my mates, the game went well until the 3rd minute when I crashed and the problem appeared again.\n\nI went to custom again in SR, the game went well until the 3rd minute, and it was disconnecting again.\n\nI'm currently out of solutions to try, I'm pretty sure it doesn't come from my connection since I used two different ones (which are totally different) and the problems remained the same. \nI have no oppotunities to try on another computer at the moment.\n\nI don't want to try any ranked at the moment. Waiting for solutions\n\nI hoped my details helped some.\n\nMy apologies if I made typos, have a nice day.

In this case, it sounds like your network is having problems reaching the game server, and leaving you behind.  Keep in mind even if you can have Youtube or anything else up, it doesn't make you immune from issues reaching specific services.  I know that you're feeling a bit frustrating with this, but we do care and want to help.  In fact, I'm really sorry if anything gave you the perception that we didn't.\n\nTo get this fixed up and get back in-game, you'll want to go over every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to both rule out possibilities and tune up how your network gets to us.
