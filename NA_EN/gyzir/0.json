This has been happening on and off for a few days now and it seems im finally stuck and haven't been able to log in for the past 36 hours. I know riot saw a spike in these errors about a week ago that seemed related to the east coast and eventually was declared resolved but now its happening to me! I have attempted following the support page on a number of possible fixes, including the hextech repair tool, but nothing seems to work!\r\nplease help\r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T01:52:39.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're currently doing a [**bit of maintenance**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-incident-breakdown-na/FcZeEbwc-109-players-unable-to-login) to try and finally squash this issue.
