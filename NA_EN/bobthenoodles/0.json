If I get upset at you its my fault because you are clearly lacking in the ability to think. \"If you're miserable playing a team game, don't play a team game.\" Do you not understand the circumstance that is 3vs5? And there are tons of players that would be upset with a 3vs5. All of those players shouldn't be playing LoL if they afk a 3vs5. Did you know dominion and twisted tree line closed because there isn't enough players. \n\nI would welcome players who leave a 4vs5 when there is no chance because it quickens surrender. \n\n\"you do not get to be selfish just because someone else broke the rules first\"  You know what selfish means right? It means thinking about yourself and doing things for yourself. Why does that matter in this context? Explain how I ruined someone's game in this circumstances and how I wouldn't have ruined it by playing. From the other side, would Ekko also be selfish for making me play an almost unwinnable game? For denying me and singed the ability to join another game? \n\nRules are everything to you because you can't think.

People learn the best when they are practicing closest to the real deal. That means I learn to play 5vs5 better when I play 5vs5. This is more likely to be true. Can you also imagine the feedback loop? You put more effort into dodging skill shots and find times to last hit but lose anyway because its a 3vs5. Its a punishing way to learn.

We ARE talking about your character in your PERSONAL example. Were it someone else's example, we'd be talking about THEIR character. (facepalm)\n\nThe whole not quitting thing, it's not just a rule, it's good form- that if your allies don't want to surrender, you don't give up. You're calling that toxic entitlement, which I shall explain why it's wrong in as easy-to-understand, relatable methods I can. \n\nI recall cases where players were much more literally held hostage in a game, where the enemy refused to end, and allies refused to let it end. THAT is unfair. Yeah, a 3v5 is a far cry from a good game, but isn't automatically a wretched horrible experience. Your negative experience, I believe, was in large part your own doing.\n\nI am going to say it is bad to derail a player who is still trying to win- specifically when there are two at least of them on your team. As mentioned before, by playing League, you are agreeing by the terms of service to respect that. We all accept that. To turn around and say that's a toxic rule, that's foul. How many times did I say reform or get out? This is a team game and you shouldn't leave people behind. Most of us are honoring that agreement, though there are dissenters. The rules try to oust them- *harsh glare*. Be glad it doesn't require a unanimous vote to surrender.\n\nThe surrender vote is quite fair when it takes at least two people to say \"I still want to play\" to do so. We've already covered, to your agreement, that your response to that was toxic in your example. How would you like it if were the reverse, that it only took 2 people to declare a surrender? Can you imagine the frustration that would cause?\n\nYou're calling it punishment to play a losing game, but if that's to be accepted, then we should always immediately cease playing games where we're losing. Slippery slope, you see. The only time you get to give up is when majority of of your allies and you (post 20) agree to give up- or all your allies and not you.\n\nI have boldly stated that the rules are absolutely NOT guidelines for good morality, but that does not mean they are devoid of it. Being sportsmanlike means not giving up until your team is ready to surrender, and some of the rules were based on that belief. It not even need be over victory, it could simply be in enjoying the game. It should be quite a natural conclusion - to be allowed to play the game, you must play unto the conclusion of the game, come what may. \n\nFor whatever reason, your example, they didn't quit. As previously stated, they really don't care about you. It is really Quite Childish to assume they wanted You to suffer, even if they said that is what they were doing. As stated, they ARE entitled to the game, and you ARE expected to give that to them. If you are not enjoying yourself and not getting along with them, of course... leave the game, if that's what you want.\n\nBut please don't come back. You've demonstrated again and again that its all about how much You enjoy the game and don't really care about others. Even if you don't like them, the expectation is the same.\n\nHell, they even made a Terms of Service, an agreement that has some legal weight, that says you'll honor that expectation, a fair and sportsmanlike one.
