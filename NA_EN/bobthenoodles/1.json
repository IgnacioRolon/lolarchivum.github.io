Whats the culture?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game started with a 4vs5. Draven was level 1 and have never bought any items and was at fountain the entire time. He connected to the game so we couldn't remake. Singed raged quit then I afk. 15 minutes passed this Ekko who said he wanted to practice jungle said I was wasting his time and refused to surrender. I think Ekko is one who was wasting other peoples' time. The game cannot be won. If he wanted practice that wasn't an ideal condition for practicing because there would only be two lanes for ganking and even if he tried to gank the enemy lane would have likely to be too strong. Aside from his point of view. The game was a waste of time for me. It was miserable to 2 vs 1 against a Catilyn and bard as Ashe. \n\nHe said he denied surrender to waste my time.  Caitlyn and Ekko said they would report me for afking a 3vs5. That is obviously bad behavior. There isn't even a category for reporting this. Either they are crazy or I dont understand LoL culture. My understanding is that a game is for having fun. That is why balance is important. Playing a 3vs5 is extremely unfair for the 3 player team. In most cases a 3 player team against a 5 player team would feel bad about having to face more enemies. So why is this unfairness and misery encouraged?","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2020-02-28T03:04:33.685+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible for all parties to be in the wrong.

If I play an unwinnable game I make myself miserable. I know it is a stupid agreement by Riot but how is it practically useful or good in this situation? I don't think having to be miserable just because of that agreement is a good reason. The game has a system to remake the game if Draven had dc. He was the same as being DC because he didn't do anything the entire time. By Riot's intention the game should have been remade. Ekko said he wanted to waste my time by denying surrender. He said the game was a waste of his game before I afk. He wasn't doing it because he wanted to play. He did it because he wanted to troll me.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-02-28T04:41:21.260+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because AFKing isn't okay. Period. Your \"time\" (which it isn't even because when the game is going on you can't join another game) isn't somehow more important than the other players' right to have a game.\n\nNo, the intention of remake is not for this case - the intention of remake is for those who **never connect in the first place**, not for \"intentional\" actions like this. That would be abused.","replies":[{"poster":"BobTheNoodles","date":"2020-02-28T04:55:18.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Because Afking isn't okay period.\" Looks like you didn't think about it. Why is not communicating via mute in a team game okay? Because it causes more problems to not have mute. There are reasons behind things especially if its decided by a team of humans.\n\nWell you didn't substantiate your belief. Dunno what to do there you are just not thinking i guess. I shouldn't even be arguing with people who don't think. \nWhy is Ekko's time more important than mine and Singed then? We can't join other games BECAUSE EKKO WANTS TO KEEP LOSING. Why should I be miserable so Ekko can 3vs5 instead of 2vs5? What would I be doing for Ekko by staying? You think I wouldn't feed like him if I 2vs1 at bot with no escape? \n\nThe intention of the remake is not to remake games that are 4vs5? How would my suggestion be abused? The current system is already being abused by people who connect and afk just like this case. You aren't thinking.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-28T07:02:04.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, you entered a contract by agreeing to play League, that you would not willingly leave games. There is no further thought required. You violated the contract, and Riot's prerogative is to punish you for it.\n\nYet they're lenient. They'll permit a violation here and there- they know there are valid reasons to violate the contract. It remains that AFK is a violation. Your time is worth something to Riot, and they expect you to give that time to see the game through by playing the game. Nothing is truly free.\n\nWith this, other's behavior is entirely irrelevant. Context does not matter. The majority of 'reasons' don't matter (only extreme cases do).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
