I've tested this with friends on level 10 smurfs. You can literally report someone who played the game without saying a word or preforming any kind of minor in-game toxicity (ping spamming, feeding, roaming when shouldn't be, etc) and they will be punished by chat restriction.\r\n-Now let's look at the beauty of chat restriction. What a nice system. It really shows the summoner what they've done wrong. ANOTHER SIKE. If anything - it makes the person even MORE toxic. Playing ranked and not being able to effectively communicate with your team (cmon Riot, let's be real, the amount of messages you get DOES NOT SUFFICE) makes one frustrated and angry = more toxicity.","replies":[]}
