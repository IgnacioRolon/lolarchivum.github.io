In a ticket, my friend requested the skins back but was denied, so currently is asking for Riot to refund RP my friend had used on gifts for his friend..fair request is it not?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll update you guys on Riot&#039;s reply to this request. But I think the fact they took away the skins in the first place is stupid, and greedy of this piece of crap company.","replies":[]}
