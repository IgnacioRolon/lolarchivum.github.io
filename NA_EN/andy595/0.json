Not quite sure what points you're referring too, but with a few more details I might be able to give you the answer you're looking for.\n\nAre you talking about points in Hextech, or maybe points for a certain event or in Ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"andy595","date":"2017-05-28T12:27:09.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And i would also ask as you just reminded me about hextech uprading champion level (tokens for champions), for know two times happened to me i didn't got a mastery token 7 for rammus (once last year and this week) but in both cases i got a chest, because i didn't yet have it for him. Does that mean its a bug or if you get a chest then you dont get a token?\nThank you for your time {{champion:33}} {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-29T04:34:38.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not 100% sure about the possibility of there being another special ward skin for this season, since the 2017 Season Rewards haven't been announced just yet. You can make sure to stay updated by checking the [**rewards section**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/tag/rewards) of our news page. \n\nAs for that mastery token, in order to get the Mastery 7 tokens you need to score an S, or S+. This is a little different than Mastery 6 tokens which you could get with S-'s.","replies":[{"poster":"andy595","date":"2017-05-29T13:27:33.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you, but for the token i knew you need s or higher but i didnt get it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"andy595","date":"2017-05-28T12:15:00.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every season at the end you can get a ward skin based on points or wins (20/45/75 i think) you got in 3v3 or as i read yesterday 5v5 flex is also included.
