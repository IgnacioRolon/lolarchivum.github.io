Those are some nice sketches, I especially like the Draven one, but I remember tossing you some Gift Art RP only about a month ago. Rp art is something we love getting, but the RP Gift is only meant to be a little boost towards your next purchase every once and awhile. I won't be able to give it out again this time, so hold onto that art for sometime down the down!","replies":[]}]}
