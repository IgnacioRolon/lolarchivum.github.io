Especially with riot continously shaving off interesting aspects of ez's kit due to short term power spikes. (season 1's W had it's heal removed due to it causing players to be unable to use it \"optimally\" and it caused AP ez to be a default build when the heal was decent. Season 2/3's W had it's atkspd slow removed due to players figuring out that maxing W in lane vs other adc's made him win any and every trade and riot want to force players to max Q first) Personally, I really loved the kiss/curse nature of his old W. So why did that interesting theme have to disappear, but the 'all skill shot' theme for his E can't be bent to help him out when he's clearly on the weaker end of the spectrum atm?\n\nPS: Please don't majorly change Ezreal into some dull adc this pre-season. tbh, I really wish you guys would put more emphasis on his ***magelyness*** as a ***magic*** caster and make his home in the mid lane instead of the bot lane.
