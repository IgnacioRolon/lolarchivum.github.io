Got it.\n\n- No more voidling blocking, one of the last remaining Malz mechanics that actually required skill and creativity. It was completely balanced in solo lane because it came at the cost of lane pressure.\n- Voidling spawn delay, screwing up with the very tight 3-second window Malz has to grow his army and, you know, have any lane pressure at all.\n- 1 second cooldown inbetween voidling casts, which coupled with the change above, will pretty much destroy his combo. So we have a ramp champion that can&#039;t ramp anymore because the opponent has now a looooong window to run away from him now.\n\nYou would think that nerfs to Malz support would have some compensation buffs for solo lane Malz. Maybe having his voidlings have less base damage and more scaling damage, so that, you know, mid laners who actually have gold and buy damage would make proper use of them, while supports who can instant kill at level 2 wouldn&#039;t be able to do so anymore? But nope.\n\nThe official patch notes literally said: &quot;hey guys, we know those things are important to mid laners, but we only care about balancing him as a supporter now&quot;.\n\nAnd I know that Malz isn&#039;t the virst victim of this balance &quot;philosophy&quot;, but simply one more champion to add to the list of mid laner mages that are stuck at bot lane now.","replies":[{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2017-02-07T21:31:08.144+0000","up_votes":87,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"We really fucked up a balanced champion with a dedicated fanbase, so we're here to bench him until everyone forgets about him so we can, at some point in the far future, completely gut everything he's supposed to be even further and come out with a new champion named malzahar while speaking of balance but upon release will be able to get 1v5 pentas again\" ~ rito","replies":[{"poster":"NodirjonSattarov","date":"2017-02-07T22:35:19.951+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:96}} seems like they're targetting Void beings only","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skyroar","date":"2017-02-07T21:33:51.747+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=T3H UB3RN07,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8OL5mmHx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-07T21:31:08.144+0000)\n>\n> &quot;We really fucked up a balanced champion with a dedicated fanbase, so we&#x27;re here to bench him until everyone forgets about him so we can, at some point in the far future, completely gut everything he&#x27;s supposed to be even further and come out with a new champion named malzahar while speaking of balance but upon release will be able to get 1v5 pentas again&quot; ~ rito\n\nI actually enjoy his rework, as long as I can (could) play it as the carry mage he's meant to be and not as a high-damage support.
