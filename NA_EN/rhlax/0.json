Is this really the best solution to better balance out the regions?  Just take good players from other regions and shuffle them around?  Wouldn't it be better to just work to bring the quality of actual NA players (at least at the pro level) up to the same level as in Korea?\n\nIf, theoretically, NA was able to actually take the fight to Korea next year and give them a real challenge, but was only able to do it because they have korean players themselves, isn't that still just the same as if Korea was continuing to dominate the whole scene on their own?","replies":[{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2014-11-04T00:20:54.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">If, theoretically, NA was able to actually take the fight to Korea next year and give them a real challenge, but was only able to do it because they have korean players themselves, isn't that still just the same as if Korea was continuing to dominate the whole scene on their own?\n\n\nHere are my thoughts: \n\n1) [There is now a limit of 2 foreign players on a team ](http://na.lolesports.com/articles/interregional-movement-policy-official-rule)\n\n2) As much as we cheer for the team in sports, **we cheer for the players**.

I say who cares let 'em play.  If korea dominates they dominate.  If there's enough money and pride in it, i'm sure ppl will attempt to get better.  That's like while USA dominates mens basketball we'd force LeBron to play for uganda to even things out.\n\nI mostly play/follow dota2 and China pretty regularly dominates that scene, but there has been no movement or outcry to shuffle team nationality.  Tho EG reps for US pretty hard and Navi is always a Euro fav.  Those players mad their own switches in hopes to capture a title and a 5million dollar pay day (if TI5 will be that big this year)","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunk is my life","date":"2014-11-03T18:07:07.466+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"i got 3 reason not to be excited\n\n1: no east coast server\n\n2: biased balance towards ap and female champ **(fighter project never forget)**\n\n3: Bigger lc$ = more greed from riot","replies":[{"poster":"Circuit Bear","date":"2014-11-03T23:42:52.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kinda in the same boat. Thought for me its.\n\n1) Regions being defined by how many korean players does not make it more balanced. Just means we are judging teams not by regional skill but by how many koreans they have.\n\n2) Everytime claims are made for better, more diverse strategy. Lee Sin is still god tier, old characters are now bad, and most top tiers are all the most expensive and recent characters in the game, with few exceptions that are quickly fixed. \n\n3) No replay mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2014-11-04T00:29:31.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
