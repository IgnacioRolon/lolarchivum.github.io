Do you want to always watch the same 10 team (or 8 or whatever region you fancy).\n\nAlso, why the hell does there need to be a \"Storyline\" for competitive eSports? Sit back, watch the games (if that is your scene) and enjoy.\n\nIEM provides the setting and the access. They do not provide all of the production gear, stages, casters etc. So quality is not really on ESL, entirely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Blue Rooster","date":"2015-03-14T18:05:56.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never, and will never understand why people want a god damn \"storyline\" in their sports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-03-14T15:59:36.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not league-centric, so they're a little more...spread out.
