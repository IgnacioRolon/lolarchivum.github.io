When it comes to Olympics though it is always B01. \r\n\r\nThe problem of having BO5 played in one day is tilting, as explained in DL/Piglet&#039;s promo video. In a high pressure situation, the team winning game 1 is relieved from some of the pressure. Since we tend perform optimally in medium pressure situations, the winner has a better chance to perform better in 2nd game, and if win again, the 3rd game and so forth. It is kind of a snowball effect, mentally speaking. \r\n\r\nThe other case for a multiple day playoff series, is that it benefits the(some?) spectators. First having upwards to 5 games played in one day, is too much for some people like myself. The average NFL and NBA games have a lot of breaks and is much shorter. Another reason is that it gives teams more time to pull off difficult strategies. In CLG vs TL&#039;s game 1, CLG&#039;s TF 1/3/1 tri-push strategy was clever against a team with poor communication. With time off and a clear head, it can give teams time to prepare for cool strategies that is hard to pull off.","replies":[{"poster":"TheNameIsJohnny","date":"2015-04-05T01:31:29.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cost too much and viewers will decrease for RIOT.

Even a Series of 2 (LPL) are more beneficial than a single game.\n\n>Time is the factor. Riot has this deadset mentality that fans have to watch EU **AND** NA and LPL and LCK. So they scheduled them (at least EU/NA) around each other. Which really just crushes the ability for those two regions to play more.\n\n>Think about this. 4 days for NA/EU LCS Starting Thursday and going to Sunday. Same days as EU/NA LCS are doing now. Teams still have two matches to play against teams, but the matches are best of 3. Now here is the twist, both EU LCS and NA LCS go on at the same time!!! 4 days for EU and 4 days for NA (times of course would vary).\n\n>The most obvious issue with this is teams losing out on practice time, but if the teams matches were only on two days. The teams would still have 5 days of practice, it may require that teams get more scrim partners (as if they constantly scrim the same teams, those teams may not be available in this format).\n\n>I think it would over all improve skill/experience for NA/EU.

That's also not taking into account physical exertion, possible player injuries, the weather and things like that there really. Since LoL is usually played indoors and on the computer, players don't have to worry about many of the things that players of regular physical sports like hocky, baseball and football there for example have to go through day after day, so there's that at least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-04-05T23:49:22.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree. I think seeing the opposing team's strategy, keeping your cool, and adjusting your strategy to deal with it, is an important part of BO5's. If we made BO5's over multiple days, teams would have time to go home and prepare something specifically against that team's new strat. This would make innovating with things like [insert UOL pick here] much less rewarding for the team doing the innovation, and that's not something I want to encourage.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-04-08T00:23:13.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This would make innovating with things like [insert UOL pick here] much less rewarding for the team doing the innovation\n\nYou know, the team can just ban that pick(s) the next game?

Gambit didn't have time to go home and scrim against an udyr and counterpick it instead, or to get their adc to practice not eating bindings -- they were forced to ban those champs away, instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-04-08T03:54:07.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't you find the first 2 games exciting and the 2 after rather boring?
