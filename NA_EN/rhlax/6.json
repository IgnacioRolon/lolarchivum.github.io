Once in a blue moon you see something like the TP/Smite thread.\r\n\r\nI think it comes to down to that people just aren&#039;t interested. For example in Game 1 of TIP vs TSM, it was the most strategic win ever. TIP had 3 people counter jungling at start, and got 5 stack dragon in 30 minutes.  \r\n\r\nBut from a spectator&#039;s perspective that was a freaking bore fest because it was so one sided!! \r\n\r\nThe best sport games are ones that a back and force. Chicago vs Boston(NBA)&#039;s playoff series from a years ago is a good example. The games were down to the wire every game, and as a spectator you just couldn&#039;t tell who was going to win! \r\n\r\nThis is case for in UoL vs SK game 5. A single mistake could cost you the game, a single good play can make you the hero. Heroes aren&#039;t born having a lot of cs, they are born making those winning plays, in those tense moments. \r\n\r\nI have previously thought that strategy would make the game more entertaining but after watching what is happening on reddit with regarding to Hai, it made me realize - people love mystery. The fact we don&#039;t know if the information is real or troll, made it more suspenseful.\r\n\r\nAlso, now that people have settled in patch 5.7, the champion select stagnation is showing once again. The patch bought in new champions to the meta, but kicked some old ones out. Now that it has settled, the lack of unpredictability in champ select remains.","replies":[{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2015-04-23T03:54:03.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The team that takes Baron first wins in esports - the buff is too strong for taking towers and inhibitors","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-04-23T04:42:28.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MLDzXnRRR,realm=EUNE,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=v6IJygI1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-23T03:54:03.572+0000)\n>\n> The team that takes Baron first wins in esports - the buff is too strong for taking towers and inhibitors\n\nNo this is rarely the case.

A Baseball field can only do so much.  Same to Soccer/Football.\n\n\nLoL is a Video Game... not a Sport.  It is a complex one that requires intelligence, not physical ability, to engage.  Although such \"emotional elements\" have their affects:  LoL is nothing without strategy.\n\n\nAnd nor is most anything in life is either.  What LoL *doesn't* need is \"dumbification\" that you are suggesting to appeal to \"the casuals\".  Casual gamers or otherwise will *never* understand WTF they are watching, and will *never* stick around long term even if you go all drama-queen mode with LCS.  Not to mention you will just /nuke viewership of \"true LCS fans\" of course at the same time.\n\n\nPeople who have a brain and don't want to live in Bronze forever will care about strategy.  FOr the casuals who don't and then {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}  about being Bronze... well I didn't say people who play LoL aren't retarded after all...","replies":[{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-04-23T03:59:31.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League should have enough strategy for the analysts to keep their jobs, but not too much such that games can be decided by them.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-04-23T04:41:45.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rhlax,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=v6IJygI1,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-04-23T03:59:31.509+0000)\n>\n> League should have enough strategy for the analysts to keep their jobs, but not too much such that games can be decided by them.\n\nLoL a game that isn't decided by strategy... rather by randomness and emotion... is a waste of human endeavor.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-04-23T05:50:04.394+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Randomness can lead to situational strategy!

Everyone said he was bad, So he left TSM.\nTilt, well that's easy enough to find, TL vs C9 in the playoffs.\n\nGame 3 you could see they were going to Jugger'Maw with Corki. C9 took corki, noticeably shaken they take a week Jugger'Maw and it ripples through the remaining games.\n\nUoL's Playoff run is full of such randomness, but I think the best one is their game with SK where Kikis plays Jungle Gnar. That pick is crap, it has slow clear times and extreme weaknesses. SK failed adapted to it and lost the game (Obviously it isn't the only reason they lost, but it contributed).","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-04-23T18:50:53.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vixanys,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=v6IJygI1,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-23T13:27:40.670+0000)\n>\n> The Emotion in League is whether a player can stand up to the pressures of negative criticism on social media and tilt in game.\n> \n> The randomness is applied and if a team can counter that with shotcalling/strategy the win.
