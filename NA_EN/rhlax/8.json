Perhaps an enemy dropped one as they were running away with low health. Or maybe removing the ward at that particular moment would result in receiving enemy attacks. Or perhaps simply, a method of revealing the ward isn't available because the lens was used recently and is still on cooldown.\n\nAdditionally, there can be advantages to leaving an enemy ward up, and sneaking around it for a gank from a direction an enemy thought was safe.\n\nHaving a method to indicate wards would be really nice, as not everyone uses voice chat, people may have chat restrictions, and/or standing around to type in to chat about enemy ward locations is not always opportune.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2014-11-04T13:45:40.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that'd be really cool.
