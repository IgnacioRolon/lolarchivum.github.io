The Q is programmed so that it goes through walls easily (similar to wards) So the Q quickly goes to the other side of the farthest wall and because they changed his E functionality it will carry him with it. You need to get the timing down to be able to do this, theres only a small window of time you can cast Q during your flight and have it so that you dont actually catch up to the soldier before the Q ends.","replies":[{"poster":"Owatatsumi Kami","date":"2014-11-08T01:30:00.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, love your name! xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeemoHunter1337","date":"2014-11-06T16:30:42.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"so you press W for a soldier. u press E to go to ur soldier . and while you are in flight. you press  Q to make yourself go further before you actually reach your soldier.\n\neasy stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2014-11-08T05:28:04.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> so you press W for a soldier. u press E to go to ur soldier . and while you are in flight. you press  Q to make yourself go further before you actually reach your soldier.\n> \n> easy stuff.\n\nBut the Q range is dependent on where Azir is, so you have to wait until the very last moment on a few of those to make it work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fisheyed","date":"2014-11-06T13:04:53.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bravo","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeFMUDE","date":"2014-11-06T08:11:20.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is some awesome shit!\n\nGonna make for some wicked gank-paths!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tarreb","date":"2014-11-06T07:56:34.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually pretty cool.
