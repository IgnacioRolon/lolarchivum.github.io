I also want there to be a system where people can dodge a game without getting punished for leaving.  I really hate having to queue with troll players. Often times when this occurs is when people don&#039;t actually get their desired role, they just threaten to lose a game for the entire team by playing troll champions. I believe having this kind of system would help players a lot in ranked games. As they won&#039;t feel frustrated when being paired with a troll and having to lose lp for leaving or for playing with them and losing.","replies":[{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-03T00:09:48.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I support this idea, but you have it in the wrong board, this should go in the concept board since it's a new idea, one I'm sure the community will support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2016-09-02T23:51:40.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as it working something like the aram reroll I would be fine with it. Letting you dodge 2 out of say 25ish games wouldn't effect que times too badly and if you feel the need to dodge more than that then you are probably toxic.","replies":[]}]}
