Qued up like usual and when we where about to DL into game. it just shut down. I tried to restart like usual but it never came back up. The logo would just pop up for a sec the disappear. So I was like w/e, and went to uninstall so I could just reinstall league. did the usual control board > find league > right click > uninstall/change. But it never finished uninstalling. I hit cancel to make a second attempt but the program isn't there to re-unistall.  I went looking for the riot folder in program files, it's still there but won't let me delete it because league is running some where else in my comp. apparently. Any help would be completely appreciated. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T05:45:36.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend restarting your computer, as *Call me JAS* mentioned, and then reinstall League specifically following [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).\n\nMake sure to test any changes to League inside a custom match to avoid Leaverbuster penalties and negatively impacting other players.
