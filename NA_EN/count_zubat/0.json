You have never (and will never, it's too big an undertaking) balanced champions on whether or not their damage comes from auto attacks or from abilities. Shyvana does EVERYTHING on auto attacks, and therefore tends to be a bit crazy when on-hit items are strong, and tends to be weak when they're weak. Renekton does all his damage based on total AD, and therefore tends to be strong when AD items are strong or at the least other items are not stronger than tank items. \n\nSo you add Hydra but your lamentation is that it only appears to be good on Shyvana. My only response is... duh. All the auto attack bruisers have been balanced against BotRK, with new releases getting fucking %HP true damage for AD just to ensure they don't go with the low AD trinity/BotRK route (Fiora.) Jax will never be competitive again so lets just forget him. \n\nThe second item is Sterak's Gage or something like that. Another bargin bin discount item that bruisers didn't need, didn't ask for, and got anyway. Why is it only bruisers get mid 2000 gold items as essential parts of their kit? You can pretty much separate mid and late game bruisers by whether or not they can go BotRK, and therefore whether or not they can actually add large amounts of gold to their kit before they item cap. \n\nBUT lets look at Irelia. Titanic doesn't need you to have high damage already to be viable like Hydra does. THE PROBLEM, and I'm going to tell you the solution, is you've made it's active a 20 second CD. What's worse is the active is an auto attack reset instead of an animation cancel nuke. That means champions like Renekton and Olaf who are already hard hit to land auto attacks between their abilities yet like Hydra actually would do WORSE with this item. Worse yet is the 20 second CD means you get it once per fight. So you look at champions like Irelia and the question becomes \"will this item help me win fights more than other items.\" Well it'll proc on her Q which is nice, but the proc on her Q is going to do maybe 10 or 15 more damage than hydra would. Then the active is double the CD of hydra's but might supply a good 100 more damage then the Hydra proc would.\n\nNow ask yourself, do these numbers justify going 3300 gold out of your way for an item you wouldn't have built anyway? Not to mention that the strongest part of Hydra is the AoE lifesteal so you can autowin the laning phase, something that Titanic gives up. Want the solution? How do you make an item that isn't too OP for auto attackers, and isn't too OP for ability users, yet still powerful for tanks? Make it almost entirely activate dependent. \n\nMake it something like, 50 damage, regular cleave for 60% damage, and then the active is a 10 second CD that goes down by 1 second for each auto attack, 2 seconds for each ability use/1 on multihit abilities. Same 10% HP damage. Now THERE'S an item that starts to look better for all champions. Ability bruisers that went BC for the 20% CDR go \"well I can use more abilities so that's a lot of synergy with Titanic!\" auto attack users go \"wwell it doesn't help my auto attacks so much, but I can land a lot more of those procs!\" Irelia would like it, Shyvana would like it, Gnar would like it, Renekton would like it, Olaf would like it. And change it's effect back to an animation cancelling nuke.\n\nSo it would read something like: 3300 gold. 50 damage. 100% health regen. 60% cleave on autos. Active: Does 100% AD + 10% HP in an AoE around you. This active is reduced by 1 second for each auto attack, 2 seconds for each ability use/1 second for multi hit abilities. \n\nThat allows auto attacks to spam it, but by late game doing maybe 150-200 damage (their auto attacks) and another ~300-350 damage so lets say 500 physical damage isn't really THAT big of a stretch. I mean, trinity adds 30 damage to each auto, at LEAST 200+ per proc, as well as the 15 other effects it does. So auto attacks get to spam the active more, but it would do less damage. Champions like Renekton would get to spam it less, but they'd do a little more damage on it. Without using the active it's a horribly stat inefficient item by like 1000 gold. With the active it starts to look a little better. Maybe a bit too weak? But at the least it would help to merge auto attack bruisers and non-auto attack bruisers in to a single item. Rather than your current idea which is... well a bit whacky. (Also ability bruisers would have BC, which would help.)\n\nI know you don't have enough time on PBE, but just throw it out there anyway. Lord knows you never had any issue with Luden's and Athene's and BT and the entire AD rework and BC and Trinity and etc. So if it really is broken hard then you can go \"welp, we tried.\" If it isn't  then you have an item that bruisers would actually like. It would also be another little trick to lower the winrate of bruisers at low ELO where they thrive because you're adding another skill to their rotations that they have to manage, which low ELO tends to suck at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustBoneBrook","date":"2015-08-15T08:47:14.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Axes,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s2cW5jF0,comment-id=000700010001,timestamp=2015-08-14T18:57:11.011+0000)\n>\n> The bigger problem is that Atma's rewards you with raw AD for health, which half the roster uses well.
