My team did /remake and now i have to wait 20 minutes before 5 game. i do not think I should be put in low priority queue because i did not purposely taint the experience for my fellow teammates also they remade so it didn't even affect them{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Night Hawk55","date":"2016-11-27T03:52:43.145+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that the remake system needs some work. The people who do not connect to the game are not toxic or negatively affecting their teammates in any way so it doesn't make any sense that they have to be punished for having an unstable league client.\n\nThe low priority wait punishment is something that I really think is too harsh for the mild inconvenience that the person caused especially due to the fact that they were probably trying to fix the problem they were having the entire time but couldn't because of a quick remake from the team that didn't have any faith that they'd reconnect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jergyyy","date":"2016-11-27T03:40:19.386+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maybe you should invest in a toaster of finer quality!{{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T04:17:41.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of intent, disconnecting from a match *negatively impacts* everyone in the match. This is a big reason why all disconnections are treated equally by the system and why we cannot remove penalties for any reason. Additionally, it's not possible to receive a 5-game penalty for a *single disconnection*, as it takes a trend of disconnections to occur before you see such a penalty.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
