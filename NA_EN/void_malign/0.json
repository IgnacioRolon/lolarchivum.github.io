I checked my purchase history and it seemed fine too. The purchases I made were there. Just too be clear, I had 104-105k after the purchases I see on my purchase history. I was wondering if someone can look into this. If I thought wrong I'm sorry my mistake. I know it's only Blue essence, and I can get more, but just seems like a lot to loose.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-12T03:04:32.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It took a little digging, but I was able to figure out where that essence went! It looks like someone went into your hextech crafting and used the mastery tokens you had for Kindred and Ivern to upgrade their mastery ranks. Those upgrades also needed 3900 BE each, which seems to add up with how much you're missing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Void Malign","date":"2018-01-12T03:30:12.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would be me. and i forgot. thank you.
