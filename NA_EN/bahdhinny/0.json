For example if I&#039;m playing Garen and hit someone with 4 spins to shred 25% of their armor, shred 30% of their armor with Black Cleaver passive, and then buy LDR or Mortal Reminder to get an additional 45% armor penetration to add up to &quot;100%&quot; armor shred, how would this work? Say I did this to a person with 100 armor, how much armor would it shred? And since lethality shreds a flat amount, is it possible to shred 100% of someone&#039;s armor?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"l DÃ¡rius l","date":"2017-01-22T09:35:13.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is possible to have enough armor pen to go through all of someones armor but it is not possible to have 100% armor pen","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-01-22T08:40:22.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The shred don't stack that way. Say someone has 100 Armor and you get your E to shred their armor, they are now at 75 armor. Black cleaver will then check the 75 armor and shred that.\n\nAnd {{item:3033}} {{item:3036}} only check bonus armor.

With enough armor reduction/penetration+lethality, it is possible to completely ignore an opponent's armor and effectively deal true damage. If the opponent's armor is low enough, it can actually be reduced to 0 or even go into the negatives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-01-22T06:26:39.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The math is far more complicated than I care to be doing in the middle of the night but I can point some things out for you to look into.
