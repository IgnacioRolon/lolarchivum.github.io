His win rate is around 50% and I don't agree with the idea that he's too strong. He's annoying, but like a lot of other champions it's who matches up against him and the focus that determines how useful he'll be that game. IMO Vik nerf > Azir nerf","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bodast","date":"2016-07-05T03:49:26.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all it has not been the entire season.
