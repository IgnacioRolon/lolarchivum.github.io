However, all I got in response was a Blitzcrank bot response telling me to try the Hextech repair tool, which I've already tried. I tried to ask for human help, but the button doesn't work. Can I please get some help trying to deal with this lag so i can play the game again. \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T21:31:19.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to go ahead and get your ticket through to a tech agent, hit that request a human button and then make sure you submit some type of reply. One of the tech agents should be able to respond relatively quickly after that. \n\nOther than that, we can go ahead and try a couple troubleshooting steps here if you'd like. Sometimes lag spikes can mean that your connection is having a hard time reaching our servers, or it could be a sign of packet loss.

Check out this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) paying extra attention to the steps on Port Forwarding and DNS settings. Test those changes in a custom or practice match and let me know if that helps or not.","replies":[]}]}
