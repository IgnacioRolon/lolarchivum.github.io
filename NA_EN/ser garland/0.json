I know it's not as flashy or thematic as  smashing someone in the face with a well timed axe, or his iconic shield ability. But as far as abilities go, and as far as facing a human opponent goes, none of those two abilities are particularly reliable, especially in the top lane no matter how low their costs are.\n\nHis Q can be side stepped  or even interrupted and -then- side stepped when he gets it back. His W can be bursted quite quickly before it can be detonated (especially by Riven, and before you say anything like \"but then she just wasted her combo\" no. Riven just wasted Sion's combo by bursting his shield and dodging his Q, and in the end riven wins out by not needing mana for that trade.)\n\nHis hilarious minion shout poke was the reliable bread and butter to his laneing phase. It's not like it's skilless either, it requires precise positioning and a landed skill shot. When he was released he could do this move all day because the cost was so low, so it was understandably nerfed by increasing its mana cost by a flat amount. Ok, Ok, I get it. I'll just be aware of my mana pool and use it sparingly, still gonna level it up first though.\n\nNow you make it the most expensive spell in his repertoire if you choose to level it up?? Seriously?\n\nIf you want me to stop using his E to poke, then make his other abilities look more appealing, and I don't mean lowering the mana costs by a measly ten.\n\nAnd if your whole stance these days is about making abilities and champions have a niche so that they are situationally good and not constantly good, what about match ups against Gnars or Nidalee's? That E on Sion was downright necessary so that he isn't destroyed in lane.\n\nPlease reconsider.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-02-24T23:04:42.488+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Sion top main, I guess I'm still okay with the mana costs.

Lategame your mana is nearly irrelevant, and in the laning i guess you can live with only 3 levels on E.\n\nI usually max my W though, so it's just better for me.\n\nIf you want to have a good laning phase with Sion, allow me to shed some light on something:\n\n**Currently Sion can easily survive and outpoke anyone in 1v1 situations, and after the laning phase, he just gets stronger and stronger mostly because of the hp stacking, the cc and the roaming possibilities.**\n\nRiot had to tone down a bit on his laning without a doubt.
