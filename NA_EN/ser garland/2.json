But I almost never see a complaint thread about Vayne.\n\nIve seen this chick in all levels of play. She is -the- snowball late game hyper carry Adc. That is her identity, that she is simply the best DPS ranged champion in the game. Even in an age of massive brutes she gets by with her health shred per three autos, and for everyone else, they can be dead before her third bolt hits them.\n\nHer weakness is a weak early game, but her kit knows this. In fact her entire kit is a massive safety net of self peel and mobility to make sure she keeps dealing out her auto attack based damage. It&#039;s really easy for a vayne to play safe with a lane partner and farm to the late game; where she can start going ham on everyone imaginable.\n\nShe has around the same range as Quinn; another \"hyper carry\" with self peel. But Quinn has so many more margins of error than Vayne, and her rewards are not much different. I play a lot of Quinn, and aside from a few bug fixes, I think her design&#039;s pretty balanced. \n\nVayne on the other hand, is so ridiculously streamlined for her role. You&#039;d think an ADC with a blind, specifically built to deal with auto based champions would naturally destroy Vayne, you&#039;d be mistaken.\n\nVayne&#039;s kit is so flexible she can tumble out of a Jarvan ult. She can out maneuver a caitlyn.\n\nShe&#039;s a lot like Riven, she has the tools to deal with everything, but also bring a lot of damage to the table.

Vayne is _not_ that good at running from people. She, like most other ADC's, has one \"oh fuck\" escape button, her E. Q isn't that great for escaping, as it is for potentially dodging around skillshots.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-06-21T10:00:46.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played this matchup {{champion:11}}  vs {{champion:67}}  many times in your elo, as well as against Sivir and Jinx as well. I've never had as much trouble with assassinating ADCs as a sustained damage melee, as I do against Vayne.\n\nPlayed optimally, Yi is at a huge disadvantage, especially late game.\n\nMid game, Yi destroys Vayne because his base stats and maybe 1 early tank item are too much for her still relatively low AS and AD to handle, while he deals way too much mixed damage with BoRK, devourer and wuju style. Late game when everyone is 6 slotted, assuming Yi has not snowballed out of control and ended the game early, Vayne shits on Yi even 1v1. Yi has to run at Vayne to not have to Q onto her and thus leaving himself open to E, but Vayne in that time can land 2-3 free shots on Yi, which chunks him for at least 40% his HP if he built bruiser or 80% if he built full glass. Then all she needs is to land 2-3 more autos to kill him which isn't hard, since even late game Yi can't 1 shot Vayne and needs at least 3-4 autos, assuming he could afford to build crit. Most of the time Yi on a jungler budget can't afford to build crit without snowballing hard.\n\nAlso, Vayne destroys Riven because she needs to spend 2 gapcloser to get to Vayne, while Vayne can cancel her 3rd Q with E and get free hits. Each free hit, of course, chunks Riven because she is extremely squishy all game.","replies":[{"poster":"diamondlight","date":"2015-06-21T16:16:15.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are just describing what an ADC does at late game. You are saying, when an ADC has full build they destroy everyone. You think Jinx with full AD/AS/Crit can't wipe Yi or Riven or whomever. She will DESTROY THEM. All ADC  all squishy, with no additional hp, armor, nor mr. If they get caught they die.\n\nVayne has one escape from a gap closer, and it's not a physical movement escape meaning she doesn't move, she knocks THEM and on ONE champ only (Trist Ult actually will knock a whole group and then she can Jump away, try catching a Trist). If Maokai locks her down, she's done if there is any follow up. A flash-stun-tibbers from Annie, and who is Vayne gonna knockback? Tibbers? If there is follow-up, she's done. Trundle Pillar behind her? where is Vayne gonna go? What about Vi ult? Ok after Vi ult, Vayne uses E, guess what, Vi just charges up a Q and is right back in her face, and now what will Vayne do? What about a Morg Q? What does Vayne E do for that? Guess what, Black Shield, well shit, now the E doesn't even work. How about Sivir Spellshielding Vayne E, not only does save her vs the 3rd bolt, but also no knockback. Amumu Q into Amumu Ult? Fiddlesticks Fear and Silence, oops now you can't cast E for like 8 seconds? Ok, Nocturne Ult into Fear-Flash. Ok, how about Nautilus ult, followed by a Naut Q and auto-attack?  \n\nWhile any ADC will definitely take out a single target caught out, 1 v 1, pretty much almost any target at this point in the game (late game full build like you are saying). They cannot take out the whole team without a ton of protection by their own team, because while they are trying to take out one enemy, they are vulnerable to the others. Vayne is just as susceptible as all the rest.\n\nIf you watch LCS or Master/Challenger games, you'll see the immense focus on locking down the ADC. If they kill the ADC mid to late game, they typically can win the game, or at least get a major objective. This is the whole strategy of the game, but it's not that simple or easy of course. It's what separates the best teams from the average, AT THE PRO LEVEL, and no different at any other level.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-06-21T16:46:34.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx doesn't have anywhere near the self peel of Vayne.
