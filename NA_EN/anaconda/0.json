Either he's useless and gets 150 stacks by 45 minute mark, or he goes on a rampage and carries his team with 600 stacks and four thousand plus health to boot. This rant is partially influenced by last game, where I was Darius and facing Nasus top. I kill Nasus at the 3 minute mark, but our Khazix decides to give him a kill by towerdiving when my bleed was going to kill him. I kill Nasus once again after we reach our lane, and he only has 66 stacks at 15 minutes. All of a sudden when we hit 11 or so Nasus ults (he's 1/4/0 btw) and destroys me when I have a sunfire cape and ravenous hydra, while he only has 100 stacks and no damage items. From then on, he's able to heal back 1/10 of his health with his SS every 4 seconds and his ult is up literally every 40-50 seconds. I gradually lost farm and levels to him, and at the 35 minute mark he was able to kill me easily with 4/5 of his health intact and 500+ stacks. The really frustrating thing is, I shut him down extremely early in the game and denied him farm for about 25 minutes straight, and yet Nasus was able to easily surge back and gain farm rapidly after my team ignores top lane for 10 minutes. Nasus really needs a rework; for some reason every time he's on MY team, he feeds and does literally nothing, while on the enemy team he snowballs and destroys us 1v3.{{champion:75}} is broken, and I don't mean overpowered. He needs a rework for his passive (it's better than most lifesteal items) and the idea that he can so easily gain stacks is annoying. 1 or 2 stacks per small minion/monster would be more appropriate.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-02-18T06:42:49.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go play Nasus.\n\nHis early game is misery, anyone who knows what his Q does will zone him to oblivion, and he has absolutely no way of defending himself. Pretty much every single champion counters him early game, and you have absolutely **NO** excuse for losing as Darius, Nasus's direct counter second only to Teemo.\n\nBeing Nasus for the first 30 minutes is miserable and makes you feel like shit. You are everyone's bitch and are no help to the team unless you are ahead of schedule on stacks, which rarely happens against an opponent who makes even the slightest effort to zone you. Then you have to spend the rest of midgame doing nothing but AFK farming, and your own team usually insults you for not helping out in teamfights.\n\nTurning out 3 levels ahead of the enemy team, being able to win a 1v3, and being capable of solopushing to the nexus is the reward for anyone with the mental fortitude to put up with being constantly reminded for 30 minutes that you are garbage.\n\nIt's even getting to me, hell i'm playing Nasus a lot right now because he is the only champ that can theoretically ensure victory regardless of how bad the rest of his teammates are (I have trust issues) and even thought many games I have won 1v4s and killed nexus in 3 hits, I feel miserable in games where someone gets fed or my team can't handle a 5v4 teamfight, because unless i'm ahead on stacks, i'm no help to the team (which my teammates remind me of constantly), and I get shit on by literally every champion on the other team.\n\nConsidering the current state of balance in League, the last champion you should be crying about is a completely immobile tank with an absolutely worthless early and mid game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrimsonRakan","date":"2014-11-12T08:00:36.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only thing he needs debuffed is his slow is the most ridiculous thing in the game and by the time its don't you have 10-5 seconds till your hit with it again thats without CD","replies":[]},{"poster":"7dTmfTn8nw","date":"2014-11-12T06:46:04.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seriously don't know how an early-game Darius {{champion:122}}  couldn't squish a Nasus {{champion:75}} .\nYou should rely on mastering Darius even more before trying to nerf Nasus, mainly because you weren't capable of laning against him.\nDon't try to ask for nerfs just because you couldn't beat the 2nd weakest early game top laner (~~Poppy coming in 1st~~) of all time with a Darius.\nI am not going to tell you how to stop Nasus from snowballing, mainly because I play Nasus main (and I don't want people to learn his weaknesses; I bet they already do), but Nasus has a crippling weakness that you should work on to keep crushing him throughout the game.\n\nOne hint: Teleport\n\nGood luck Summoner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2014-10-17T01:54:04.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though the thing is while Nasus usually get rather strong in lane from mid to late game his teamfights are rather reliant on the enemy not being able to kite him... because if he do get kited he is pretty much just a damage sponge but then again Nasus is pretty good at being a damage sponge too","replies":[]},{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2014-10-17T02:01:28.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"another funny thing is that his q can crit\nso if he has a shiv\nplus 600 stacks\nwith an ie\nthats 600 multiplied by 2.25\nwhich is 1350 damage\nand shiv adds like 200 because the magic damage thing from shiv crits if the attack itself crits\nso you are critting for about 1550 health\nand then his auto's themselves are probably going to be hitting like 600- 700 each\nso if he has 1 lifesteal item with his passive \nby the time he reaches lvl 16 is about when he gets 600 stacks right?\nsome people dont even reach 200 farm in bronze elo so that seems right\nso if he has a hydra plus the max lvl passive\nhe has about 32 percent lifesteal\nthat's just op\nthe damages are too real\nbtw im talking about teh super strike nasus build the one where you need about 4 or 5 critical chance items and then you have a crit chance of like 80% something crazy like that","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-10-17T02:30:10.974+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm going to be honest.

When you lane against melee as Darius, you have a huge advantage. It is not just enough to get 1 or 2 kills, you need to make sure that as Darius you will have enough of a gold lead to compensate for a weaker late game.\n\nI am not denying that Nasus isn't problematic. He is hard to balance, since he either does well, or not. If worst came to worst, you could have asked a ranged ally to help. Nasus can't lifesteal when he is kited.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MPendragon","date":"2014-11-12T06:56:07.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is a hard carry. \n\nTo shut him down, prevent the jungler from assisting him early on in the laning phase. Once Nasus begins to snowball, you aren't coming back.\n\nCounter using %HP damage. Elise / Liandri's / BotRK. Also counter using Blind (Teemo) preventing him from being able to Q farm.\n\nGenerally Last Whisper / Void Staff is a guaranteed must, since he will go full blown tank after Sheen is upgraded.","replies":[]}]}
