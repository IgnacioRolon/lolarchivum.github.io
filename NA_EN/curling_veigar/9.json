Basically, if you are fast enough to activate it the moment the pull catches you, it works like Sivir's or Morgana's shields, the pull just stays there for a while but it doesn't pull you.

If you try to follow him while he backs off to wait for his mana to regen, the ADC's damage will zone you off.  If you try to go in on his ADC he can still walk up to you and punch you.  You might be able to zone the enemy ADC for a bit while Blitz's hook is on CD, but Blitz zones so much harder that unless he's literally just spamming it off cooldown his team still comes out ahead.\n\nIt also can't be a matter of \"LRN 2 DODGE BRO\" because he's often picked by professionals, who are obviously much better at dodging and playing around his cooldowns than the vast majority of the playerbase.  He's apparently pretty balanced at that level of play (unless one believes LC$ BIG PLAY$ prevent nerfs), but a terror to lower-level players because of the huge impact of his hook.\n\nI have literally been zoned by Blitzcranks that aren't even in lane.  If he manages to get into a bush my team doesn't have vision of, it is suicide to try and get a ward in it.  He can back and for all I know he's just waiting for me to take half a step out from behind my minions because good Blitz players actually wait until they have a good shot before firing.\n\nSome of the Blitz QQ also probably comes from players that play at lot of blind pick or Teambuilder.  They can't ban him or counterpick him, and there's a fair chance of having bot lanes that are countered by him.  Getting hard-countered by Blitzcrank is probably less common in draft pick because the enemy support may well pick before your bot lane, giving you a chance for either your ADC or Support to pick someone to counter him or at least not completely fail against him.\n\nEDIT: On the other hand I know he's not super easy to play.  Bad Blitzcrank players remain bad.  Everyone's met that one Blitz that kept grabbing the enemy tanks or spammed Q off cool-down and went oom two minutes into laning phase.  The problem is that good Blitzcranks zone so well and seem so safe everyone forgets about the bad ones.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZenBudS","date":"2015-07-09T04:24:24.366+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol full tank leona... blitz can pull me anytime... idgaf","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-07-09T04:39:20.412+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":10,"body":"{{item:3153}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3072}} {{champion:67}} HIIIII","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-07-09T06:38:38.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{item:3153}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3026}} {{champion:67}} fite me","replies":[{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2015-07-09T11:27:42.177+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{item:3075}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3717}} {{item:3072}} {{champion:33}}  Ok","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-07-09T14:59:30.481+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"8 item Rammus confirmed new meta 2k15.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2015-07-09T15:55:19.026+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3068}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3001}}  Probably would be better","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZenBudS","date":"2015-07-09T04:42:14.308+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi, i can jump to you and stun you then lock you down with my ult.

You neglect both the autoattack damage and the first item BorK Vayne gets.  Assuming Eclipse is up during the entire nine hits, and Leona maxed it first, Leona has about 100 armor at level 7.  She's building a Sightstone and Targon's first, so she has health, but not much more than base armor + Eclipse.  Vayne, of course, maxes Silver Bolts first to do the 8% PLUS 60 bonus true damage every third hit.  They both have to be at least level 7 for maxed first skill, so Vayne's ult is available.  So, Vayne has 125 ad total, from her AD growth, ult, and BorK.\n\nVayne's autos do about 60 damage against Leona's 50% reduction from armor, so those 9 attacks net her over 500 damage.  3 of those attacks proc the 24% plus 180 bonus true damage.  Leona, at level 7 with her Sightstone and Targon's Brace, has about 1350 health, so Silver Bolts do about 325 damage from the % max health portion.  Lastly, the % current health damage of BorK, at 8% per hit, reduced by armor to about 4%, start at 54 and would decrease to less than 10, averaging about 32 per hit for 288 damage.  Over those 9 attacks, Vayne can do 95.8% of Leona's health in damage by herself.\n\nLet's not forget the scenario begins with Leona getting grabbed by Blitz, knocked up, slammed into a wall, and five of those attacks are basically free.
