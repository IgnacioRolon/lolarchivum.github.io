Everything about it is amazing. I don't notice the change to it's cooldown either.\n\nAnd after that is where things go shady.\n\nHis Event horizon is an atrocious PAIN to land. Today I went versus a competent nidalee, and it was the stupidest match up ever. Even if she was dead center in the circle of the warning particle, she wouldn't get stunned because of her pounce. But this isn't a nid thread. I played more than one match and concluded that his E is in need of some changes. One option may be to simply remove it's .5s cast time. It's really depressing because it's nigh impossible to land a stun now. Even if I use it defensively, it doesn't save me from danger.\n\nHis Dark Matter is so weird right now. I don't understand why bothering to buff it if you don't change anything about its impact delay, or maybe even the aoe. I'll only land dark matter if a target is stunned, which is not very common. \n\nHis Primordial Burst had its ratio lowered for a very unjustified reason. Yes, he gains more ap for his Q stacking. But good Veigars never played him as a passive farm champ; rather using the Q to harass people in lane. So this is sort of forcing him to be a passive mid laner which a lot of Veigar players won't like. I don't actually notice the ult doing less damage though, but in the condition of how his E is in, having a 1.2 ratio on an ULT isn't terrible.\n\nOverall I'd say I think the changes are fun, but have on serious problem. While many Reds pointed out that you'd get a LOT of ap from q now, there's one catch to it. Even someone who doesn't even play Veigar in one of my matches pointed it out.  Simply put, with the way his E and W are, what are you going to do with 100 extra AP early on? Even if you had 1000 AP at 30 minutes, you couldn't do anything with it because if you even so much as looked at any enemy champ the wrong way they'll jump on you and you'll die. My point here is that having more ability power isn't always something that can help you win a match.\n\nAlso another thing worth mentioning is his passive. I still go OOM in lane despite many of the mana cost reductions.\n\nAlso, @Meddler or whoever, DON'T HESITATE TO REVERT THE CHANGES IF YOU WANT TO. His changes looked rushed on paper anyways and if you decide to roll them back and then take more time to work on them, it'd be better because I'd rather have old Veigar than a very under performing Veigar on the live servers.\n\n\nAs it stands, me and many other Veigar mains including DaBox have concluded that Veigar is *unplayable* in a competent environment. Also, his ult kill laugh is still not working.\n\nOh and, Bad Santa Veigar's Q sound after the particle hits something is bugged. The incorrect sound file plays.\n\nSincerely, a worried Veigar main.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Zmuecat","date":"2015-02-26T04:46:45.585+0000","up_votes":105,"down_votes":3,"body":"Haha, I'm sorry.\n\nThey kept the cast time on top of the added delay?\n\nWow.

Baleful Strike\nThis genuinely has positive and negative effects, though in my experience playing him with the changes, it's significantly more negative than positive. It's now a skill shot that hits two targets, it has more range, and it has a shorter cooldown early and a higher cooldown late. There are some obvious benefits to this - you can hit people farther away, you can set up skill-shots behind you while backing off, etc. You can also hit two targets, the most significant aspect of which is that you can potentially kill two minions with one Q. As mana-hungry champion early, this can be a major boon. However, the downsides far outweigh the upsides. You no longer have reliable poke, especially against champions with good mobility. The fact that it costs so much mana limits how much Veigar can take advantage of the reduced early cooldown, while later in the game his reliable damage skill in sustained fights has a 25% longer cooldown. The highly-touted \"kill two minions\" benefit only works if there are two minions in a line that can be killed, while I found more often in lane that I had to unwillingly damage a minion I didn't want to to pick up a kill behind it or vice versa, and I missed a lot of minions I'd like to pick up because there were two or more others in the way and my lane opponent wasn't a complete moron. Furthermore, with certain minions being worth more than others in terms of AP, not being able to directly choose your targets hurts even more. Picking up two regular minions but losing a cannon minion because I couldn't get a shot at it cancels out in terms of extra AP. Later in the game, when I could one-hit minions, this was less of a big deal, but by the time that happens you're out of laning phase and are spending a lot less time farming. In teamfights, the increased range lets you play a little safer, but again you now have a skillshot that can be dodged. In particular, people who now flash away with low health after you cast at them aren't still going to be hit, which really hurts Veig's kill combo against champs tanky enough to survive a W-Ult combo.\n\n2.) Dark Matter\nIt's cheaper and has a shorter cooldown at higher levels. No complaints there.\n\n3.) Event Horizon\nIt's now cheaper at high levels, has a slightly shorter cooldown, a slightly longer range, and takes 0.75 seconds to kick in. This skill was Veigar's bread and butter, and all the minor nice changes above aside, this change absolutely cripples him. Obviously the intended plan was to get rid of Veigar's stunned from full to dead terror combo, and I'll freely agree that this is not an unreasonable thing to introduce some counterplay options to. But having played Veigar in the new patch, I have literally had people walk out of the field after I caught them in the middle. Or done any of the things the could already do if you didn't catch them right with it before - flash out, shaco-jump out, cast on you from inside it, whatever. The point is, as a glass cannon champion with a high-damage skill that takes 1.25s to hit, Veigar was completely reliant on his stun to be able to do two things - hit with Dark Matter, and safely enter cast range to use his other skills. Basically, he can't do either now. The only times I was able to hit with my stun with any kind of reliability was when casting on people who were already stunned or snared, or when casting into the confusion of a teamfight. And the latter becomes less reliable the better your opponents are.\nBut the other problem is that Veigar's stun was a powerful defensive tool. Veig has always been a pure glass cannon, and most assassins can kill him in the time it takes his new stun field to kick in, even if they don't bother to dodge it. Without being able to use it defensively and blow up assassins before they could blow him up, Veigar now has no counterplay options against assassins, especially with the nerf to his ult and the decreased reliability of his other two skills making tankier Veigar builds that are still useful unfeasible. This is actually the biggest nerf I found, because without any defensive tools, you're way too easy to kill to make being a mid-to-long-range sustained Meteor-and-skill-shot poker a viable new play option.\nAs to the increased range, I'm rarely casting stun field at full range except to either initiate a fight or catch a fleeing opponent. In either case, the 0.75s reaction time the opponents get vastly outweighs the benefits of an extra 50 range.\n\n4.) Primordial Blast\nIt's cheaper, it has a 10s reduced recharge at all ranks, and it had it's AP ratio reduced by 0.2. The cheaper bit is always nice, although with Veig's passive, mana problems later in the game usually don't happen. The 10s reduced recharge is, hands down, the thing I found to be the most beneficial. The 0.2 AP reduction, though, hurts a lot. Presumably it's to make up for all the extra AP Veigar will be getting from his new Q, but it's nowhere close to enough to offset this nerf (and as described above, while I definitely got more AP with my Q, the tons of extra AP theory doesn't quite pan out for several reasons). Most of Veig's AP still comes from his gear, and especially with DFG just being removed, nerfing the damage on his big bursty skill really, really hurts him.\n\nIn conclusion, Veigar has all but lost his only defensive tool, his only way to initiate safely, his only way to close gaps against a fleeing opponent, and his only way to reliably hit his W. His Q has gained strength in some ways, but at the cost of his ability to consistently poke, use it to kill minions he doesn't have a convenient shot on, and a huge hit to his sustained damage in fights. His R, while he can cast it a bit more often, does a lot less damage and doesn't do a whole lot by itself except against already very squishy targets (many of whom do have single-target, instant stuns that they can use to kill him now). In the opinion of someone who is not a pro league player, but is a pretty experienced Veigar player, his new kit takes out all of his strengths and gives him almost nothing to compensate.\nAs much as I love Veigar, I know better than anybody how hard it can be to counter him if he's good, and will freely admit that some additional counterplay options against him would be nice. Something like a 0.25s delay in his stun to give players some reaction time without making it unhittable might be a reasonable possibility. Or making the interior of the field slow until the stun kicks in. Or making the entire circle stun anyone who's still inside it after the delay. Or making Veigar a lot more inherently tanky. Or dumping his W in favor of a survivability-based skill and moving the damage onto a DOT inside the stun field, like Malz's pool. There's lots of options, but these changes took away pretty much all of the strengths he had without giving him any new strengths to work with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LANWhale","date":"2015-02-26T04:53:00.193+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sincere argument, nice points made, and over all a nice tune.

I have played old Veigar a fair amount too (wouldn't call him my main, but I have decent experience with the champion).\n\n* The Q: The double hit thing is cool, and I don't mind that it's a skillshot now.  Skillshots are more fun to play with and more interesting to play against.  I feel like the range is incredibly short for a skillshot, though...\n\n* The W: You pretty much hit this on the nose.  It's so hard to land this now.  The stun is difficult to land - and this ability basically requires the stun to land if you want it to do something besides waste mana.  I suppose it makes Veigar a good pick if the team can keep enemy champs locked down in an AOE really well - but once that team comp reaches magical Christmasland, it doesn't need any more help from Veigar, and other champs (Orianna) are better at getting there.\n\n* The E: I really don't want to complain about the new delay.  Everyone else is complaining already; it's clearly here to stay; and the long range, instant stun was pretty bullshit as is anyways.  But it's just so hard to deal with the crazy mobility champs everyone's playing these days now.  I can't stun (and thus, can't even really fight) a LeBlanc at any point in time.  With the addition of Q being a skillshot now too, it's harder than ever for Veigar to fight champions who can jump around - and that's all that's being played nowadays.\n\n* The R: The patch notes themselves say that they're reducing Veigar's reliability but not his damage - but then there comes a clear, straight nerf to his damage on his ult.  I don't understand this one bit.  The doubleshot Q can help farming, but not by that much - consider that it has a higher cooldown at max rank anyways.  I'm okay with the damage being nerfed if the damage needed to be nerfed, but claiming his damage isn't going to be nerfed and then nerfing it anyways is ... confusing, to say the least.\n\n* Mana issues: You talked about this briefly yourself, OP, but I'll mention it again.  It was always my biggest trouble when playing Veigar.  He starts the game with a free Chalice and he can buy a second Chalice to go with it, and even then he'll have mana issues in the laning phase.  He's a mage whose playstyle requires him to be constantly spamming spells, but his manacosts are prohibitively high.

Today I went versus a competent nidalee, and it was the stupidest match up ever. Even if she was dead center in the circle of the warning particle, she wouldn't get stunned because of her pounce. But this isn't a nid thread. I played more than one match and concluded that his E is in need of some changes. One option may be to simply remove it's .5s cast time. It's really depressing because it's nigh impossible to land a stun now. Even if I use it defensively, it doesn't save me from danger.\n\nI believe it's .75 atm, and I the only thing I would accept towards this is:\n-Less cast animation\n-slightly less delay (maybe put it at .5 or .25)\n\nInstant AoE stuns aren't fun for anyone to go against, especially with that level of cc.\n\n>His Primordial Burst had its ratio lowered for a very unjustified reason. Yes, he gains more ap for his Q stacking. But good Veigars never played him as a passive farm champ; rather using the Q to harass people in lane. So this is sort of forcing him to be a passive mid laner which a lot of Veigar players won't like. I don't actually notice the ult doing less damage though, but in the condition of how his E is in, having a 1.2 ratio on an ULT isn't terrible.\n\nI disagree with how you say he is more passive now, and imo is now more open to harass angles/farm options with the pierce, even though I know how most Veigar players harassed quite often before.\n\nAlso the ult changes are justified since it makes him mostly overkill against an AD type champ in the game with his own ridiculous ratio. That said buffing his enemy%AP ratio would be fair to increase his antimage, especially since most mages have the option of either Abyssal or Grail to counter him.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-02-26T07:45:48.383+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Instant AoE stuns aren't fun for anyone to go against, especially with that level of cc.\n\nWhat are you talking about?
