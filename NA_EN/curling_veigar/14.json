It scaled with 100% AD and 60% AP, but it also proc'ed Seastone Trident and Lich bane, giving Fizz close to 200% AP scaling and 150% AD scaling plus an 8% missing health DoT and the abilities' base damages on a single unavoidable 3 second CD attack (he always got full CDR).\n\nBut wait, it gets better. Sea Stone Trident also proc'ed grevious wounds, giving enemies no chance to recover. Fizz could literally one shot carries with his Q+W alone. Against Tankier targets, he could use DFG, W, Q, E, Zhonyas, and Q, E again. He was infamous as the assassin that did not need his ultimate to kill, and had an engage range that rivaled Talon's.\n\nFizz was literally Freelo. Despite having possibly the highest burst damage at that time, Fizz was still practically invulnerable ~40% of the time due to the low CD on his troll pole. For a while, only Fizz and Ahri could be played mid lane in solo queue due to how oppressive they where. (Ahri used to be able to cast her ultimate with near unlimited charges). \nHis only weakness is running our of mana; however, mana regeneration was very generous back then, and he could easily buy an Elixir of Brilliance if he needed the extra mana. \n\nDuring the preseason, many players tried out AD Fizz which revealed its devastating effectiveness. However, AD Fizz only came into the spot light due to the nerfs to AP Fizz. In Season 4, everyone would build him AP just because of how strong he was as an AP assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2015-07-12T05:18:38.328+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"All of that may be true.

Pre-Flask League was his Dark Ages. Though, to be fair, Flask was specifically made for champions like him who had an awful laning phase so that they had a failsafe for it. Now with the flask he can competently go toe-to-toe with almost anyone, barring champions who can absolutely abuse him in the lane. If you haven't yet, try playing him a few times in mid lane and you'll get a handle on his weaknesses and strengths and can turn it on him later when you play against him. He's not as end-all strong as the boards make him out to be, but he's certainly no pushover.\n\nNow, with that flask that was specifically made for champions like him who need help early, are you starting to see why it's problematic to give people every single tool possible to help them patch up their weak points? It leads to problems like Fizz's early game not being nearly as bad as some think it should be specifically because Riot put that flask in to help people like him.","replies":[{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-07-12T04:39:05.221+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Fizz never had a weak early game because his kit gives him trading potential early. \n\nFlask only enabled all the Fizzes that cannot play him properly to actually survive laning phase.\n\nFlask doesn't increase his trading potential and only increases his sustain. Your mid laner can take the same approach and still out trade the bad Fizzes. It's your choice to not take flask while knowing that the enemy will have more sustain than you. \n\nFizz that Max E first will take just as much mana to trade as a traditional mage does, thanks to the high (and necessary) mana cost on his E. By relegating the role of a utility spell to damage, he gives up the ability to avoid your most potent skill, and actually loses trading potential. \n\nAnd yet still, I don't understand why do people think Fizz mid-game is good. After the nerfs to his basic abilities he is mediocre mid-game, since his Q doesn't actually front load 1.0+AP ratio (using two skills and lich bane). His ult is still not reliable at 800+ range and his most unreliable skill is more important than ever, not to mention that Zhonya's and QSS easily counter it. \n\nFizz has a decent early game. That's fine. His mid-and-late game isn't that overbearing to force him to have a weak early game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aaravos","date":"2015-07-12T15:22:56.265+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well he has a weak early game, but it depends on what you call a \"weak early game\". He is not like {{champion:75}} who don't have any real trade potential on the lane and the enemy auto-win the lane without your jungler, but in his own way his laning is bad. {{champion:24}} is very similar. Everyone know {{champion:24}} has a weak early game. But why? His e is a very strong trading tool at the early levels, he has a nice as steroid, an aa reset with decent bomus damage, and a gap-closer, mobility tool. But he don't has any wave clear, poke damage, his cooldowns are long in early and the opportunity to fght back is huge, and seriously gated by his mana pool. Post 6 with some item he become a scary duelist. So {{champion:24}} not useless, but definitely weak on the lane. {{champion:105}} is very similar in terms of early power and has the same strenght and weaknesses. {{champion:105}} can't clear the wave, has a poor farm potential, he run out of mana quickly, and it's very easy to push him under the tower and harass him. If you lower your defense and walk into his range or allow him to jump on you he will win the trade because he is a skirmisher, and post 6 if you get hitted by the fish you are dead for sure. All your need to do is shove the lane and don't try to poke him at all cast if it is risky. This will force him to use his  e for wave clear and while it is on cd you can trade with him. Some jungler attention on the lane also a good idea. If you force him to be behind and you play properly the mid game can be very painful for him as he can't defend towers. Avoid duels and skirmishes with him, dodge his ultimate and you shall be fine. Also his zone control is 0 and it can pay back in dragon fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-07-12T03:15:17.751+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"There are very very very few champions in this game that can survive a fizz all inning them earlygame.
