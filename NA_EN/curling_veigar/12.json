This is like Sejuani or Gragas all over again - they built pure tank items and could literally murder whoever they wanted, and they got absolutely  smashed with nerfs on their items and kits until they were forced out of meta.\n\n**His 30+% max health damage on his W needs to be nerfed**. Combine that ability and the fact that **there's absolutely no indicator for his passive timer**, his Q can apply his passive while having the hitbox of Morgana snare and a fairly strong slow or a stun if he applied all of his stacks plus ridiculous amounts of damage, and his grey health which basically **allows him to effectively gain 50-75% extra of his HP value**, and he's completely broken.\n\nAnd please don't act like him saving the ADC makes either vulnerable. He gains a **speed boost while consuming an ally**.\n\nI even bolded what you needed to pay attention to.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-11-07T19:17:14.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Clearly you've never seen a real tank either, it's not using that cannon to slice bread you know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2015-11-09T19:19:00.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why should tanks not be able to fight?

He's given HEAPS of damage ( ranging from 150 to 300 extra damage based on heath) but also rewarded with an EXTRA tanky life bar. When you think you're about to finally kill Tahm, he creates a shield of all the damage you just dealt to him which gives him time to finish you off before you manage to peel away that one.\n\nEither the passive on his ult needs to be nerfed or the shield on his E needs to be nerfed. Honestly, these two shouldn't exist in the SAME kit due to how strongly they double dip if they're given decent ratios at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Svolski","date":"2015-11-07T17:15:44.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"300 damage on a single target ability?

It's an on-hit effect that applies to his autos and BOTH of his damaging abilities. 300 bonus damage to every way of doing damage he has is insane even before you take into account the fact that he gets access to that for building absolutely nothing in the way of damage stats.\n\nHow on Earth is a Morgana Q doing a lot of damage (with AP) comparable to Tahm Kench's autos, Q and W doing lots of damage with HP?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-11-07T18:13:46.478+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wait until the ADC rework.

And still takes a good long time to do.  During which, he has to land ONE Q to start an attack chain to kill you if you are kiting, due to it's 70% slow.  The issue is, he has such a large hp pool, that by the time you could have downed him, he has had the chance to try and start his win pattern about 5-6 times.  He has a TON of tries to get his win out, you have to play perfectly during that time.  And by perfectly, you can't even let him get 3 hits in.  And lets face it, he gets Deadman's, so one is pretty much a 100% chance if you are actually fighting him and not just running away from him, letting him zone you from the fight.\n\n\nHonestly, if I was going to nerf Tahm, I would remove his ability to flash while holding an ally, because that just gives him some broken save potential when he already has an overkill MS boost while holding an ally, as well as removing his MS boost mechanic.  Remove his ability to eat people over walls, and spit them over walls.  That, without changing his damage or anything else, would massively cut down on his overkill utility while still being a tanky monster.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
