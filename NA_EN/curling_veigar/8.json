The most logical course of action would be to nerf its cooldown, but making the AOE much larger or the delay far shorter... Those changes would make it possible for Veigar to trade like he used to be capable of (E+W+Q, R if it's ready and it can finish off the target), but without the fact that W used to be effectively undodgeable (Veigar would only use it when his E stunned you). W shouldn't be unusable without allied help, but it also shouldn't entirely rely on an instant stun that Veigar no longer has.\n\nThink: Orianna's abilities work extremely well when she attaches her ball to a tanky initiator, but they aren't useless when allies aren't around.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCabes","date":"2015-03-31T20:24:17.243+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hope he changes.

If he can actually land W without assistance, he is going to eat almost every other mid laner alive. Veigar W is like swain W. Both are massively powerful and important to the champ, but very difficult to land, often requiring the use of another (unreliable) spell.\n\n>So, we should increase the range of your Q, and reduce your mana cost.

The buffs have been focused on giving him tools to survive but not necessarily stomp lane. Maybe this just works for me because it neatly aligned with my favorite parts of the champ. \n*I love surviving a rocky laning phase to reach the promising payoff of that mid game turnaround and late game spike.

Before I could bully him out of lane and had a clear window of \"beat this guy now and win\". Now, sure I can dodge the stun, but why does that even matter anymore? He can farm from behind his turret and I can't even resort to body blocking the skillshot because it hits twice. Riot swapped out \"no counterplay insta-stun\" (which actually had plenty of counterplay) for \"I can't do *anything* to stop him farming anymore\" (which is really bad). I'm not the greatest player, but I can certainly tell that he is more broken than he used to be. Not more OP or less OP, just less healthy. Before, he scaled from weak early, good mid game, godly late game. Now he is just ok early, better than average mid game, better than average late game. I could care less about dodging the stun if he can 100-0 burst me mid game without W or E (and I know to build hourglass and MR and health into him). He farms AP too easily, but doesn't scale as well as he used to, which kind of just leaves him feeling really bleh to play against. I used to be able to say \"yeah, I got outplayed and he made it to late game, WP Veigar.\" now it is just \"yeah, this sucks, I can't deny farm, I can't really bully him, but at least late game he'll only get me down to 10% instead of *all* dead\". If I get behind now, I can catch up to Veigar. SERIOUSLY? Veigar shouldn't be getting ahead unless I misplay or he makes it to mid-late game. I shouldn't catch up to him when he is ahead either, because he is supposed to scale harder than anyone except maybe Poppy or Nasus (but the way they nerfed his ratios, I actually do now). This leaves him feeling icky to play against like his power curve is more of a power scribble than anything.\n\n**TL;DR:** Veigar's scaling is out of whack right now, his early game is too hard to shut down, but he doesn't scale hard enough late game either. It isn't just \"less extreme\" scaling, it is counterintuitive and un-fun to play against.\n\nEDIT: It certainly feels like he only has three abilities right now though, lots of Q spam, R whenever it is available, E for zoning and an occasional stun if I get body blocked by minions or another champion, and W is a total non factor. Last game I played against Veigar, he 100-0ed me several times during mid game, but he only landed his W maybe one of those times.\n\nBasically, what makes Veigar unfun to play against isn't that he can stun instantly or that he can burst, it is that if he *does* stun me, I'm helpless and the game gets spun in a 180 from me being up 2 kills and 15 CS to dying 6 times in a row while hugging turret. He is feast or famine. He has plenty of counterplay, and had plenty before, but the same issue stands: if he lands stun, you can't do a single frickin' thing. The nerf to E only made it so that Veigar famines more than he feasts, without actually solving *anything*, because if he feasts, he is still just as toxic and anti-fun as ever, and if he famines he is just as anti-fun to play as. They need to address how binary his kit is, but all they did was make it *more* binary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-04-01T23:15:41.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I like him right now.\n\nHe farms a lot, but is quite bad alone.

I played him for the first time since the nerfs the other day...and he's useless now.\n\nBefore he was incredibly bursty but had no mobility, relied on Deathfire, and was useless unless he had his spells. Now his E will never land unless the enemy team are stupid and that makes landing the W incredibly hard. The removal of deathfire with seemingly no compensation is the nail in the coffin. I think the idea of the Q was to make him get more stacks but a good Veigar would rarely miss a Q stack anyway so there's no overall gain there.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-04-01T13:42:36.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if they keep increasing the range on Veigar Q and such I guess he will become poke mage kind of... or something like that","replies":[{"poster":"BrutusTheCat","date":"2015-04-04T01:37:55.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if they increase the range of hie q some more and then extend the range of his ult to 1000-3000ish we basically have a second xerath","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2015-04-02T10:27:52.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you just want your main to be broken again stfu he doesnt need any more buffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaizeCraze","date":"2015-04-01T02:40:33.340+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"Unpopular opinion here, but I think Veigar is in a fine state right now.\n\nYes, he no longer has an insta-stun from 1025 units away.
