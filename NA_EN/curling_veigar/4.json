Issue was that he'd be jumped and die without being able to spend all that mana unless he had a significant amount of peel, which is too much of a demand. Mana pool runes might be okay on him I suppose, but I don't own those. The survival could be armor, MR, and/or movement speed, usually combined with health whenever possible.
