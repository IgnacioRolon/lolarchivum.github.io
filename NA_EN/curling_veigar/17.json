Jinx can lose lane and get a kill with her ult from across the map, do nothing and be goldly later in the game.  But it isn&#039;t impossible to beat. Just really annoying. Vayne is sort of the same, except with a safe early game and a &quot;fuck up once you&#039;re punished harshly&quot; mechanic. Now like I said, it isn&#039;t unbeatable, but the amount of time/effort it takes to keep these two down is unimaginably annoying when you have to do it so freaking often because of their popularity. On the flip side you got people playing vayne/jinx on your team thinking they&#039;re doublelift or some other ADC god and going 0/5 and blaming high ping like always.","replies":[{"poster":"BuzzinTate","date":"2015-09-08T10:36:54.978+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}}","replies":[{"poster":"HayRoss","date":"2015-09-08T13:57:26.511+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BuzzinTate,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XqRyaxJ3,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-09-08T10:36:54.978+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} \n\n\n\nFixed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-09-08T18:56:48.740+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare you forget {{champion:6}} {{champion:17}} and {{champion:29}}","replies":[{"poster":"FistOfSharkiesha","date":"2015-09-08T20:23:04.725+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:42}} ....","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-09-08T20:28:23.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought I saw him... we always forget Corki.","replies":[{"poster":"Infinite Daps","date":"2015-09-09T01:02:25.442+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-09-09T02:53:42.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then we must add {{champion:268}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:4}} and {{champion:157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Infinite Daps","date":"2015-09-09T03:21:10.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me.

Both were low on health, but Jinx lost her guns so she went to melee mode, ran right up in front of Sivir before even attacking, and died and blamed me for it \"nami why didnt you heal me\" (I was dead by the way).\n\nI also remember she decided to face check the brush by Raptors and decided to 1v4 the enemy team.
