I main Ekko so I wanted to try the skin on him first. I went into a mach and the first thing I noticed was that I could select the Ekko skin and i did. I was loading into a mach and my card had classic Ekko on it, not Project Ekko. Now that we are at this part I wanted to state that I also could not see the new card background witch I have crafted. I would like to know if I could do anything to help fix the situation. If there is a really basic answer to the situation **please don't hate!**","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-04T23:09:30.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have corrupt or missing files in your League directory that are preventing the client from loading the right skin.
