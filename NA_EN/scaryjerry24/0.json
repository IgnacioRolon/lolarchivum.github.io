The first piece is that your graphics driver may be failing or overheating.  This could be a hardware issue, but I recommend [updating your drivers](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+#wq2) in case that's the culprit.  The other may be a permissions issue blocking the game from rendering.  For this, I recommend going over our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide for a fix.  Run those steps, and you should be good!","replies":[]}]}
