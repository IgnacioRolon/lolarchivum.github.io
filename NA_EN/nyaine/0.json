I don&#039;t have a need for quotes or animations, really, so I won&#039;t comment on those beyond saying that I didn&#039;t have any issues and they seem fine. Regarding the looks, I have to say that I hate the new role icons with a passion. While they are still distinctive and get the job done, I just preferred the more round versions in the Legacy client. I&#039;m also not particularly fond of the squares in the circles. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/Jf31dkD.png\nSince those are the roles for Summoner&#039;s rift, wouldn&#039;t it make sense to make those icons based on the imagery you already have for it?\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xCzZMrT.png\n\nWhat seems to be missing is the visual representation of my position on the map. Neither in the introductory animation, nor in the later part of champion select are they present.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gFtYIhD.png vs. http://i.imgur.com/vxGdG2w.png\n\nand\n\nhttp://nynaeve.de/2016-08/LeagueClientUx_2016-08-30_18-31-47.png  vs. http://i.imgur.com/fiwvGnZ.png\n\nWhile in the first instance, I don&#039;t particularly need those icons, it makes a lot more sense to have them. For the second example, I found this to be a very welcome addition when the new champion select shipped earlier this year, as I don&#039;t have to search the list for the role I want to look at, but can find them at always the same place on that map.
