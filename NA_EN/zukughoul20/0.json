Even using OP.GG it shows that I only have one runepage linked to my account, which makes no sense. I was wondering if anyone else has this problem, and if they do how can you fix it? Because it's really aggravating losing games because of the situations where correct stats matter a whole lot.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-15T15:56:09.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're investigating these duplicate display issue with rune pages, so hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for this one.
