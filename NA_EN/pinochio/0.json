To get there you have to go to the store; in the upper right corner below your RP and IP values you should see a cog. Click the cog to go to account settings. On the left side of the screen you should see an option for purchase history. Once you go to your purchase history you should be able to refund like normal.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Masala Chai","date":"2016-05-19T23:58:14.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"on a side note, what;s the difference between a cog, or a gear, or a sprocket?","replies":[]},{"poster":"niggâ","date":"2016-05-26T22:09:58.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really getting what you mean by \" On the left side of the screen you should see an option for purchase history\" and Which cog are you talking about , is it the one that opens the preferences or something else.\n\nThanks for your time .","replies":[{"poster":"SKTHitaya","date":"2016-07-30T02:31:40.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to the left with the bar down the client then u will see a small settings icon with a persone after clicking it go to the history thats it .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-19T21:12:58.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1","replies":[]}]}]}
