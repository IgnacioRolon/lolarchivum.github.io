For instance, the lag spikes you are experiencing may be due to an unstable connection or packet loss.  We have a [Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) tool that may help you out with that.  Your game crashing may be the result of hardware or software acting up.  A fix for that could be as simple as updating your graphics driver, but we have a [Game Crash ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes)guide available with some more comprehensive steps.  \n\nMy recommendation would be to first try the Log Reader and see if that resolves your issues.  If the issue persists, please contact our tech team to assist you by[ submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
