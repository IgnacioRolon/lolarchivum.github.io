I'd consider myself to have thick skin but it pisses me off when I start having  blaming me for things I can't control and had no idea was going to happen. Seriously people need to quit being so damn petty, its one freakin game, one freakin match. It doesn't take more than 10 games on average to climb out of bronze/silver/gold to get closer to that diamond 1 elo you desire so damn much.\n\n It's like they can't consider that, oh well maybe that guy really does have some internet issues popping out of nowhere. Stop being a dick and think about the next game instead of getting pissed at the guy having a bad time, because he doesn't need your bullshit too.","replies":[]}
