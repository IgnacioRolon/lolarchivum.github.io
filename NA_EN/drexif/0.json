(about autofill)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I&#039;ve noticed that ever since autofill became a thing, dodging has become more and more of a necessity as people refuse to play their assigned roles and lock in outside their assigned roles.   it disrupts the game and forces someone on the team to dodge and get a temporary queue suspension or even lower priority queue. \r\nPrime example, earlier today the person who was assigned support refused to play it and locked in vayne AFTER our actual adc had already picked jhin.  the vayne then told me, the top trundle, to play support and let her play vayne top.  She refused to leave the team for screwing the game for everyone and I was forced to dodge instead.  This got me the 6 minute queue ban as expected, and while I&#039;m not against that at all-  I agree that its a very necessary feature-  it got me thinking.\r\nShould there be a feature where whenever you dodge a game, you submit a report to Riot explaining why you dodged and why you think it shouldn&#039;t count towards your LeaverBuster quota?  If they review the report and think the circumstances didn&#039;t call for a dodge, they can call you out on that.  If the circumstances DID necessitate a dodge, then they can edit your LeaverBuster status based on that.  If no report is submitted for the dodge, it automatically counts against you. \r\nWould a feature like that work in the near/far future of the game, or is that too much?","replies":[{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2017-01-01T04:03:12.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be abused by people who dodge just because they don't like the matchup because Riot wouldn't be able to view the chat logs/team comps for each dodge report since there's going to be a shit ton of them. I could just say that my support picked vayne when in reality I was against a Draven Blitzcrank bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Drexif","date":"2017-01-02T15:16:06.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can they see chat logs at all?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-01T05:32:18.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2017-01-01T04:13:07.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doubt they'll implement something like this due to the many made up, copypasted stories people would make.
