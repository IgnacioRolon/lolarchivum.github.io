You get 3k (or was it 5k) rp and 5 BE daily now instead on starting with 999999k of both. That ammount refreshes every 24 hours and does not stack.\n\nNow getting free RP every day sounds nice but you have to remember that items in the store are only discounted to 1 BE and remain at full RP price. With that said 3k RP is not a whole lot to work with and painfully slows down the process of getting what you need to actually do your job on the PBE.\n\nWith that said the store is not working properly. Loot is disabled for not working properly. Earning BE is disabled. Buying rune pages is disabled. Several champs are disabled, skins were disabled (i think this is at least fixed now)\n\nNow i know its the PBE and its supposed to break often but its never been broken this bad before. Just stick with the regular server.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-10-19T10:53:59.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The store is broken because 200,000 people going on buying sprees simultaneously really clogs things down. The store litteraly broke, so they had to take that measure to limit the purchase flow and keep it up so players could purchase.\n\nLoot was disabled because players were disenchanting things for lots of BE and going on buying sprees, again causing the store to break.\n\nThe PBE is fine. You can still buy skins and champs and play. Loot is the only major thing not working right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-10-19T05:35:49.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could do that... then Riot would make no money cause you can literally unlock nearly anything on the PBE for free as they give you RP everyday.
