This isn't the case all the time, but most of the time if I post something, it doesn't come up and refresh for me in the forums without a complete relog/ reopen explorer. Sometimes, I will have \"Player recruitment\" Open and I refresh and the posts will say \"4 hours ago\".  Also, pretty much all of the time my inbox for comments on my post don't refresh without a relog either.

(woe is me.. I have to do an extra 3 clicks with my finger.. whats coming to this world LOL)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BreathNrelaX","date":"2017-07-21T04:42:20.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=AX5fBO3z,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-21T04:22:45.017+0000)\n>\n> Hmmmmm that&#x27;s a little strange to be sure.

The issue must be around that maybe.. cause that is how things refresh on here... This post for example... I had to reclick \"New\" in \"Help & Support\" twice to see the post I made... it says there is a reply, I click on the post and its not there.. I had to look in \"My Updates\" on my account to direct me to see your comment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BreathNrelaX","date":"2017-07-21T04:44:29.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, had to click New twice to see my post.. it isn't even bumped to first on the list.. and right now as I type this comment, after the above comment.. it says my post has 0 comments...","replies":[]}]}
