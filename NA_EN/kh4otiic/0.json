I just recently (begining of season 5) started to push myself to farm and actually average roughly 60 farm in 10minutes which I believe is not bad. It has caused me to go from b4 to b3 I had a 4-5 game win streak today and yesterday. I mained Varus early last season then Vayne, I was actually decent with her, however my farm was terrible like I said just started improving now. 'Atm I'm mainly going as Jinx, Sivir, or Lucian. However, today I played and lost multiple matches. The problem im having is how do you play in an aggressive lane with high poke. I feel as if Im powerless and I do no damage. This affects my game mentally as well as physically, I think that I will always lose the lane if I get far behind and makes my mechanics worse. I mean I guess its fear but, I feel like it is more of me not knowing how to play against under the high poke condition.  I understand the whole \r\npoke>burst\r\nburst>sustain\r\nsustain>poke\r\nI ask the jungler to camp but even then its so difficult. Any help on becoming better as an ADC in a highly aggressive lane. Also what items should I buy in this case? I mean I rush an {{item:3031}}  then {{item:3006}} then {{item:3087}} but I feel that I need to get something else, I  just do no damage at around 13-15 mins in a highly aggressive game.\r\nAny criticsm and help is welcome I really appreciate it. Also here is a link for my game stats:\r\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Kh4oTiiC\r\nP.S. I have thoroughly examined hundreds of guides and have watched lots and lots of videos recently that is what caused me to improve my farm and positioning a little bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2015-03-09T08:34:55.384+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo!\n\nThe most important thing to be able to do as an adc is to be able to cs.  I see that you said you can get 60cs by 10 minutes, that's ok but you should try to get it as high as possible.  Take a look at [this csing guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/204xyb/learn_to_cs_like_a_challenger_with_elyndar_a/).  Once you can CS with zero problems you'll notice that games go much easier because you have more gold and more mana up for abilities.\n\nThe other half of laning as adc is to be able to trade effectively.  If the enemy laner misses one of their major spells (example: blitz missing his hook) it's a good time for you to trade.  Or alternately if your support hits their abilities, that's a great time to go in.  One important thing to note is that if you can dodge one ability early game (example jinx W) you have a much higher chance of winning the trade.  So it's often useful to forego an auto attack in order to dodge a spell and then auto a half a second later.\n\nOnce you're out of lane phase you need to pay attention to your micro positioning and macro positioning.  Macro positioning means don't be bottom alone trying to cs when your team is fighting a 4v5 in middle.  It's generally a bad sign if you are alone as adc.  Micro positioning means don't be alone or out front in a teamfight.  You want to be as far from the enemy team threats as possible while still dishing out damage.  You need to be auto attacking in team fights or else you are useless.  Staying alive lets you auto attack longer, so don't try to attack the priority targets - try to attack the targets closest to you.\n\nThe last thing to understand is matchups, but that can only really be learned through experience - good luck on the rift bro!","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2015-03-09T09:19:09.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'd like your opinion on the state of ADCs in the game currently. Here's mine.\n\nI'm personally a fan of the support gameplay, and in the past months I've seen more and more bot lanes (although i mostly play normals, and I'm only about silver ranked so maybe that's why) shift to double support, while usually throwing an AD assassin mid, and depending on comp, bruisers/tanks/mages in the jungle and top lane. I can't help but feel like the average ADC is dragging down a team unless the early game is very good, and that what's the point of having one AD carry, when you can have two burst/tank/sustain/mobility/utility/anyofthosecombined carries to win your game.\n\nWith the Sightstone actually not really worth getting anymore due to the fantastic upgrade to the trinket ward (assuming at least two people get it), and items like the jungler tank enchant (try that on a tank support with the right smites, you'll get my point), and especially things like the brand new Luden's Echo, full AP supports will be able, or just about to, one shot the average full damage ADC, forcing them to get armor/MR, and lowering their damage output while still being out-valued by supports. Or, a tank support sporting a Thornmail and the new jungle Cinderhulk enchant (potentially with a new and enhanced Gromp buff as well!) could likely butcher an ADC without too much trouble. I tend to be happier when i see the support sharing equal kills with his ADC than going 0-2-6 these days because of this.\n\nA friend and i experimented a while ago (about last November, i believe) a Karma/Sona bot lane. We got 17 straight won lanes, and had a monumental blast to boot (granted most likely to the detriment of the poor guys being exploded on the other side). Supports have grown stronger, and are still growing stronger, especially as of next patch, considering the mid-game.

I would be very surprised if this was actually a trend.\n\nThe reason why you have an adc is two-fold:\n1.) You can siege effectively late-game.  Mages can clear waves and harass but they are going to take town buildings nearly as effectively as marksmen.\n2.) You have a source of sustained DPS.  This is hugely important for not only team fights (most mages/assassins are not strong vs tanks for example), but also for neutral objectives (do you want another mage/assassin/support when you are trying to kill baron?).\n\nBecause of the above reasons I don't see marksmen going away, and I think they are important enough to have in a team, far more important than a second support or mage.\n\n> With the Sightstone actually not really worth getting anymore due to the fantastic upgrade to the trinket ward (assuming at least two people get it), and items like the jungler tank enchant (try that on a tank support with the right smites, you'll get my point), and especially things like the brand new Luden's Echo, full AP supports will be able, or just about to, one shot the average full damage ADC, forcing them to get armor/MR, and lowering their damage output while still being out-valued by supports.

The people who bought sight stone before (support, sometimes jungle) should still buy sight stone because they can get the sweeper too and give their team vision denial while providing vision as well.\n\nAs for the supports shutting down ADC argument, a mage can potentially fight a marksman late-game and a super beefy tank can distract them for awhile but both of those will still typically lack the consistent dps that a marksman offers you.  You might say that doesn't matter if you can delete someone right away, but that's a big gamble - assuming that you can immediately delete someone.\n\n> A friend and i experimented a while ago (about last November, i believe) a Karma/Sona bot lane.

Our teamfight and dive was super strong.  Certainly there are situations where this can work, but I don't think having a few scenarios like this negates marksmen's overall effectiveness.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-09T08:53:05.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Staying alive lets you auto attack longer, so don't try to attack the priority targets - try to attack the targets closest to you.\n\nTHANK YOU.\n\nPeople think you have to focus the carries in order to win a teamfight, but it really depends on positioning and whatnot. My favorite thing to do in teamfights, personally, is to play tanks or bruisers and get into the middle of the enemy team so I can shove their frontline out of position and focus the carry. While the carries focus me, my carries can pick off the distracted frontline and then move onto the already weakened (thanks to moi) enemy carries.\n\nBut really, I do thank you for pointing it out. The adc cannot always focus the enemy adc safely, and so on and so on. Best to play safely instead of risking it all to kill a carry in the back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2015-03-09T05:28:05.209+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"A few things... \n\nFirst off; lane phase is not the most important thing in the game. Knowing what to do in teamfights and where to be in the mid/late game as ADC is going to have a much bigger impact in winning or losing the game. \n\nSecond; as you've noticed sometimes, based on support picks, you'll be in an unfavorable lane matchup... That's fine, it happens often and it's basically unavoidable. Your job as an ADC main is to know how to get as much as you can in a losing lane without feeding. That's your primary objective in lane phase in an unfavorable matchup, don't feed... you or your support. If you know how to teamfight and what to do in the mid/late game then a CS difference between ADC's won't matter in the slightest, so just play smart, play safe and you'll be fine. \n\nIf you're against heavy poke buy a vamp scepter ASAP but don't build it into anything yet just go {{item:1053}} >{{item:3031}} and continue with your normal build","replies":[]},{"poster":"PepSakdoek","date":"2015-03-09T11:22:25.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> average roughly 60 farm in 10minutes which I believe is not bad\n\nThat is great! (Like high Gold level) but... People tend to overstate this number many times. Admittedly I have no clue where I am. I should look.\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Kh4oTiiC\n\nYou can click on the magnifying glass, and then see your CS at 10m.  (I'll put Doublelift's last CS behind it)\n\nLucian: 36, Sivir 73\nJinx: 48, Sivir 70\nSivir: 35, Jinx 75\nJinx 2: 54, Graves 61\nJinx 3: 41, Tristana, 73 \nSivir 2: 71 (NICE!), Kalista 58\nJinx 4: 65 (nice), Caitlyn 70\nJinx 5: 56, Grave 68\n\nAnyway, so 51 average, 68 for doublelift.  For bronze III that's amazing. You are only 25% worse than Doublelift is.\n\nIn Bronze it's really dependent on your Support, but try to hit \"free\" harass when your opponent goes for a CS.  So one trick is to not stand \"max range\" between yourself and the enemy creeps.  This way when you click to hit a creep, you champion can immediately attack, and doesn't have to first get into range.  This also enables you to poke enemies who come within range of you.\n\nUse *every* opportunity to harass your opponents (even at the cost of CS). If you've hit them 3x with spells and AA's and he hasn't hit you, he'll have to leave lane, while you can continue farming.\n\nIt seems your problem is CS after 10.  You slow down, when you should be speeding up.  Take more Krugs/Wolves/Wraiths during mid game, push your lane out before you go for drake/baron/mid towers etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wizdro","date":"2015-03-10T03:40:26.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at your history I simply suggest something I suggest to a lot of people. Die less. Sometimes \"worth it\" isn't worth it at all. You seem to be able to know how to farm and carry, so reevaluate when getting a kill is worth a death. I suspect you are playing a \"high-risk/high-reward\" playstyle which may be hurting you more than helping you. Especially as ADC, endgame is your goal. Being relevant in an endgame teamfight is more important than kills in the lane will ever be.
