I hopped on League and everything was so small. From the mouse to the minimap. So first thing was to look through all the settings and I didn't find anything to help with the scaling so I reduced the resolution by to 1920x1080 and then my monitor just displayed half of the screen zoomed in. I alt-tabbed to look for solutions and when I tried to bring league to full screen again it give me a bug splat. Please Help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T17:41:59.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no full 4K support yet in League, so pretty common issues are with the UI scaling of the mouse, minimap and chat. Sometimes 4K issues can be resolved with fresh drivers and running the game in Full Screen without *Alt+Tabbing*. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
