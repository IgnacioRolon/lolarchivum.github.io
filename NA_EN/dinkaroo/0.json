You can't get one from another set.\n\nThink of it like this: there are two sets in one pack that are entirely separate from each other (champion and cosmetic). \n\nWhat **is ** happening is the two sets are currently inseparable and can't be transferred/traded over into the other set which is kind of unfair if you consider how many more cosmetic items there are in the game than champions (684 non-default skins opposed to 130 champions, and the worth of the skins is most definitely over 2x the worth of the champions AND also not obtainable through IP). \n\nWhat **should **be happening is (at least regarding the RP hextech chests) chests should be giving you cosmetic shards only if you have all your champions because it's a little unfair to let people who've worked hard enough to own every champion to be put on the same playing field as others in terms of champion ownership.\n\n**Not to mention, using collectible cards (trading cards) is kind of a lazy example considering their purpose is to be traded.**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-29T22:41:06.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions are commons, skins are uncommons, and gems are rares...\n\nExcept you only get one per pack!","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-03-29T23:06:17.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gems are truly outrageous.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-29T23:10:30.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So outrageous that I haven't seen one yet ):","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-03-29T23:13:59.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=redniwediS,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tKqwHW1q,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-29T22:27:57.053+0000)\n>\n> It's like opening a pack of collectable cards and complaining about getting one you already have.\n> \n> The chests are random.

Still seeems like a waste to reroll them for a totally random skin and even more a waste to trade them when i don't even play those champions. So I guess I'll keep them gather dust. I will turn them into essencee but I have close to 3k which I don'r seem to be using any time soon","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-03-30T01:11:23.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Riot has already made a statement about it.
