My league was on a nonstop thing of, reverting back to old client, then it repairs and does it again nonstop. I had to uninstall league >_> And re install but now it has old client on my desktop and it is the old client everytime saying theres a new client, but it when i click launch, it goes to the new client. So my problem is that the L isnt as pretty on my desktop and theres an extra step i dont like doing -.-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T23:51:33.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I'm understanding correctly, you launch the client and then it begins the update to the new client every time? Once the client has been updated, you should be able to launch the new client without needing to update each time.\n\nYou also mentioned that the league file you launch starts a repair, but that program shouldn't actually be starting a repair unless it's reverted patches and is now trying to repatch. If it's repatching, let it finish up and you should be good to go.","replies":[]}]}
