With Recurve Bow getting that slight change it might make the gold sink less heavy. \n\n... But I do agree! I'd love some more On Hit items.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-04-13T22:30:09.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except it barely changes Runaans. Right now Runaans deals 10+50% of AD on bolts. When it changes it will deal 50% AD on bolts and have a 10 bonus damage on-hit effect. It literally only gains 10 damage on the main target... In fact its getting 100g more expensive for that 10 bonus damage.\n\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/04/413-pbe-update.html#bal1\n\nBotRK and Devourer benefit a lot more, they have a much smoother build path now.
