I'm a top lane main but I've always been under the impression Janna did.\n\nYes, he does, because his defensive play is a strong as hers, his offensive play is much stronger than hers, and his type of engage isn't really something that she can reliably do something about with Howling Gale so she'll need Monsoon which is a CD that's a BIT longer than hook + flay. He'll also most likely outrade her lane if you want to fight him, unless Janna's ally is very good at trading with her shield.\n\nJanna herself is hard to hook, but she can't really force a Thresh lane out.\n\nAll Janna truly has on Thresh is her late game team fight presence, but even that can get negated if the wrong ally gets hooked at the wrong time.\n\nDon't get me wrong; they are both top tier supports. But in terms of fighting against one another, I give the edge to Thresh.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DJ Di0","date":"2015-08-22T06:09:28.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NemeBro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nEkjb5KX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-22T02:11:49.086+0000)\n>\n> It probably has something to do with Janna being more or less the best support in the game.\n\nShe has the best disengage in the game, but Thresh is the best support overall hands down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2015-08-22T07:32:48.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because her niche is peeling, not team healing to full HP\n---\n[~Improve your Forum Experience with F.E.K.~](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/3V6I7JvK)","replies":[]},{"poster":"jjookkeerr","date":"2015-08-22T22:26:24.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"up","replies":[]},{"poster":"rG Thundrag","date":"2015-08-22T16:21:58.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna is super safe and you'd often see them with mere 1-2 deaths per game and building mejais just cause of how safe she is as a support.\n\nEven with a relatively tanky janna build she would have a sizeable amount of AP cause of mejais making her shield and heal for quite a bit.\n\nSo they opted to reduce ult efficiency which was probably the right call as its more used as peel and not the heal at times while the shield is pinnacle for her playstyle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-08-22T05:34:17.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it will hurt overall Janna in aram.

It's almost the only case where you actually use your ult to heal a team. Or build her ap.\n\nEven with just one AP item like Twin Shadow or Morellonomicon I find myself healing my teammates for a lot. You disengage with R and the enemy team re-engages while you channel, it's kind of funny seeing people commit to a fight in an AoE heal. Or you clutch save and ally and you hold it to keep him alive as he retreats through the storm. Honestly I always channel it unless 1) I am in immediate danger and my death won't bring an ace 2) an ally is in need of assistance via shield/nado. Even without AP (which I almost always do on Janna) every tick helps.\n\nI find myself outhealing Namis and Sonas with Janna. Monsoon's heal is insanely powerful. It was always powerful even back when it had a CRAPPY ratio (like .2 AP per tick) and out of nowhere they buffed it out of the ass.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-08-22T07:42:02.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks as if they're forcing us to prove Fiora's ult to be more better & usable than Janna's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sakura Mirage","date":"2015-08-22T02:14:26.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Janna is the best support I have played all of them and know doubt she takes my number 1 easily.","replies":[]}]}
