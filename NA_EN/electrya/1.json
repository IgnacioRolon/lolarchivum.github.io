As of recently I was suspended for fourteen days, and I had a few questions that i was wondering if anyone could answer with experience or Riot employee. \r\n\r\n1.) After your banned you are not eligible for the yearly Victorious Skin right? And if there a way to be eligible before the season ends? *Like being a sportsmanlike player.\r\n\r\n2.) After your first punishment/suspension will the next one result in a permanent suspension? Or does it depend on the severity? \r\n\r\n3.) Will your punishments always be on your record? Or will good sportsmanship and attitude will get rid of it?\r\n\r\nThat's all I have for now, I'll try to be a better player from now on haha thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-06T03:31:43.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any punishment that happens after 8/22 and lasts longer than 7 days will disqualify you from ranked rewards. Our punishments do typically function on a escalation path, but some things can make you skip certain levels or possibly push you straight to a perma depending on the severity. Also, punishments do stick with accounts, but good behavior can make up for that as long as you show improvement in behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternum Nocturne","date":"2017-10-06T09:02:00.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"According to OP.gg you died to the enemy jungler during the 5m and 12m marks, and ever since you died every 1-3 minutes around the enemy mid or bot tower.

It seems he already knows \"After your banned you are not eligible for the yearly Victorious Skin right?\"He also claimed that he will try to be a better player [summoner]. Why are you being passive aggressive and toxic through sarcasm? Do you think that's doing anyone any good?","replies":[]}]}]}
