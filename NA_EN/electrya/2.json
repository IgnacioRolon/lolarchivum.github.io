I was wondering if someone could assist me with swapping names on my two accounts. I did read a board post about it but I didn't full comprehend what it was saying.\r\n\r\nSo Account A is my main account, and the account I want the name to be Transferred on. Account B has the username I want, and I don't play on it anymore. \r\n\r\nAccount A is taking Account B's name, how much IP do I need to make the transaction and which account will I need the IP on? After that , do I submit a ticket or what?
