When collectively my jungler, top lane, and mid lane are 3/22/1 and they want to say no to a surrender and force me to try and carry them? Like it's just super rude at that point. Just inting and being dead weight but still wanting me to try and carry them. At this point they don't even deserve to win this game. \r\n\r\n[](https://gyazo.com/3c078011101d1c7c7137be15cd7ffdd3)","replies":[{"poster":"yay pink","date":"2019-03-09T16:11:37.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't understand why people who are AFK or don't vote at all, aren't considered an automatic YES","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandarill","date":"2019-03-09T15:42:10.207+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel like individual players should get an lp loss forgiveness whenever their boosted bonobo teammates feed like the dirty degenerates.

If someone's K/D or A/D isn't positive, they should not get to vote. But it goes both ways:\n\n* Lower ELO players who don't understand the concept of late-game champs (like Yi, Jax, Kayle, etc.) won't be able to win a surrender when their team has a champion performing well that could easily turn things around. \n* And players who are performing adequately won't be able to _lose_ a surrender, if they see that their team doesn't have any late scaling. \n\nThere is the issue of players who don't understand late-game champs _winning_ a surrender when their late-game hypercarry is behind, though. So the idea wouldn't work.","replies":[]}]}
