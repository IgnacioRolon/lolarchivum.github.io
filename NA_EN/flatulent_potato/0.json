So you didn't miss out on anything when you were leveling from 1-30—you got rewarded in IP.\n\nFolks who level from 1-30 after preseason will mostly just be getting champ shards in capsules which can be turned into blue essence (which the same as IP). They'll get this INSTEAD of the IP you got when you leveled from 1-30.\n\nSo, no, it wouldn't make sense to give players capsules for levels they've already gained—because y'all already got rewarded (in the form of IP) for that.\" -Riot cactopus.","replies":[]}
