Is it broken?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have rank 5 on both {{champion:17}}  and {{champion:115}}, so i should be able to get champion mastery shards on them. Yet, even though i got an s- on {{champion:115}} for 1 game and an s+ for  {{champion:17}} in another game, i didn't get any mastery shards for for either of them despite getting the s- and the s+. I don't think its the game-mode, i am playing the Poro King, because it says that everything is suppose to be available, just like summoners rift and aram,  so i am just confused why i didn't get them. I am just wondering if anyone else has had the same issues come up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-15T18:36:25.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, it looks like you've already received mastery chests for Ziggs and Teemo.

Champ Mastery tokens are only available from classic Summoner's Rift games. You can't even earn them in ARAM or ranked Treeline. It's counter-intuitive, illogical, and only mentioned in the [support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284), but that's unfortunately how it is unless enough people bug Riot to change things.","replies":[{"poster":"gandarien","date":"2017-12-16T03:24:31.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Minarde,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=meupi2oU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-12-15T21:37:02.312+0000)\n>\n> It *is* the game mode.
