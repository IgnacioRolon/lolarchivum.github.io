As far as Jungle Fiddle is concerned, this would give fiddle another tool he can use in his early clears. \n\n~Mid or Support~ \nThis could help out his ability to waveclear as this is _imo_ one of Middlesticks key weaknesses. Also while not as strong as Dark Wind's current incarnation, this passive will still allow fiddle to harass his opponents via Minion Waves (Reduced Damage & Lack of Silence)\n-------------------\nTerrify: This ability in it's current state is one of the things that makes Fiddle unfun to play against. Perhaps making it an AoE skill shot like Taric's Dazzle or tying his fear durarion to a special mechanic similar to Ryze's Rune Prision **Root** might be interesting.\n---------------\nDrain: One of Fiddlesticks signature attacks & quite honestly one of the only abilities besides Crowstorm I like as is. \n---------------\nDark Wind: Dark Wind in it's current state is another thing about Fiddle alot of people hate.\n\n~Support/Mid~\nWith your version, Fiddle would actually have to put himself in harms way in order to get his Silence & Bonus damage off. In the supporting role, Fiddle won't be able to rely on the minions to harass you as much as he might not get the bonuses his E gives him. Same thing can be said about his midlane as well.\n\n~Jungle~\nI don't see Fiddle being affected all that much in the Jungle as his E-AA would basically function the same way his current E works.\n------------------\nCrowstorm: Another Ability that I would rather see go unchanged. There's nothing wrong with it currently & is the other thing Fiddlesticks is best known for.\n------------------\n\nIn conclusion, I like the idea if moving his E to his passive. However his Terrify does need some changes.\n\nI'd give it a 4/5","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-12-02T05:42:39.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This new keystone + hexflash puts a mini Fid R on everyone haha.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-12-02T01:34:07.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaaaand lane Fiddle got 5x more cancerous.\n\nYou can't leave his point and click fear and point and click drain and fucking **massive** AoE damage in there completely untouched and then just fucking move his E to his passive.\n\nFiddle's rework needs to either remove him from lanes forever or remove his E.
