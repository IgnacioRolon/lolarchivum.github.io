I can not move or  use \"G\" to command that I am in the game. I can not even  buy items. The only thing i can really do is press ALT.TAB.DELETE to close the browser. I tried playing a custom game and the problem still happens there. I just got a new Red Dragon mouse on amazon. Would that matter?\r\nPlease i need help. Ive been reported and now have been on a five game twenty minute que :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T01:49:14.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap that would really ruin a match pretty quickly for sure =( . It almost sounds like your keybinds were either completely missing or totally messed up altogether so let's try giving those a manual reset to be sure that's not the problem first.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
