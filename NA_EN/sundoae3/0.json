Whenever I would get up from my laptop and leave my account signed in I would come back to see a notification telling me that my account had been signed in elsewhere and that I need to sign in again to access it. I never really found anything wrong with it because nothing would happen. I would still have all my ip and rp and no games that I hadn't played would show up in my history so I thought nothing of it. But today the same issue happened again and when I logged in again it said I was in a game and when I would try to reconnect it would give me a notification telling me that my client had crashed and that I should disconnect and try again. This obviously struck me as weird but I took a look at my friends list and noticed a new player that I've literally never seen before. I don't tend to add people unless I know them personally and it didn't appear to be any friend that just changed their name because I would be able to tell. I just wanna know what's up with this so I can solve the issue and just enjoy my account again. I've sunk a lot of money on this account and I would hate to have to start over","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T21:00:17.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like someone else is accessing your account. I strongly recommend changing both your password for your League account as well as the email associated with your account. Additionally, for extra security, you can enable 2-step verification if your email provider offers it.\n\nThe links *Hyperion3182* provided are some good steps to take as well.

First of all, if you share your account with someone, just don't do it ever again.
