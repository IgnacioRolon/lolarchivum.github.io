At first, I thought it was because I had lost most of the games, but even during the games I do win I&#039;m not getting credit. Is anyone else having this issue? It would be very hard to believe that I&#039;ve won 2 games yet didn&#039;t spend any Krakens...","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2015-07-31T03:32:21.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Schnei~ \n\nYou cannot earn the rewards at the same time. You have to win 2 games, and then in your  third (or next game after winning 2), it will count spending krakens. \n\nGiven that info, are you still having issues having your krakens counted?","replies":[{"poster":"schnei yo","date":"2015-07-31T23:06:49.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO,  It's all good now.

The Kraken isn't being counted. I understand that you can't complete more than 1 objective per game but I've had 4 games and not a single one has recorded me spending Kraken and I've won 3 games already","replies":[]}]}
