We looked into one such case of this issue with the Koodo carrier last night and it seems our SMS provider claims the number in question was not a mobile or prepaid line and won't verify it.  I understand how frustrating this is, especially with limited information provided in the error message.  We will be taking a look at how to improve this error messaging to be more informative and I would also encourage you to submit support tickets if you feel you are being prevented from SMS verification in error.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bøhr","date":"2018-11-01T02:50:34.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same story here.
