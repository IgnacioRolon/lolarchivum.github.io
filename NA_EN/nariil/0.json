I can't really pinpoint a pattern in it or anything, but when I had this problem all the time at the beginning of the year I got in the habit of always making sure it was selected, and usually un-selecting and re-selecting, but that doesn't seem to be 100% working now. (It's possible I'm just un-selecting and forgetting to re-select, but I do know for a fact it's happened once in the last couple days when I didn't even un-select, when trying to use Forecast Janna, which I use constantly.) EDIT: And it's always been team builder on SR.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-13T20:09:12.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, okay. Team Builder is finicky when it comes to selecting skins.

Thank you so much for responding! Aaaand it just happened again, in an ARAM, on Nautilus this time. So I guess it's not just SR for me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
