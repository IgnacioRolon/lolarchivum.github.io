Here's the thought process around each piece of advice:\n\n0. Don't type in chat to flame others - I wasn't flaming. All I said was that my team is bronze trash and their mothers are hyenas. Those are just likely facts based on evidence. It's science. Riot can't ban me for science.\n\n0. Learn to mute other players - I need to defend myself! It's my right! If I get mugged, should I just try not to listen to my attacker?\n\n0. Don't play Ranked, it will work you up - The other modes are boring and meant for the children of hyenas (see above).\n\n0. Play a champion that can hard carry games (e.g. Yi or Jax) if the problem isn't you but your \"trashy\" team - People say my champ can't hard carry but she totally can. The problem is my trashy team. My teammates are literally bonobos at a zoo. Literally. Every time. And that one time where I won with a score of 2/9 while the rest of my team had positive K/D? I carried that.\n\n0. If the problem is with you (most likely it is), get better - The problem isn't me. I keep getting grouped with trolls, inters, AFKers, and bonobo hyenas.\n\n0. Learn to play champions with CC instead of asking to nerf \"Broken\" champions (e.g. Jax, Zed, Twitch, Zoe), turns out that these \"Broken\" champions die hard to CC - It's not my fault that Rito James keeps making broken OP champs that counter what I play. I was playing Leona jungle and even at 6 with my full root and stun combo I couldn't stop the enemy jungler AT ALL. He just turned red and kept hitting me. Nerf Olaf and unban me.\n\n0. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO DODGE IF YOU ARE PLAYING RANKED! (Better to lose 3 LP and 15 minutes than lose 20 LP and 30 minutes) - Why should I eat a dodge? My hyena bonobo troll inter teammates should dodge. I'm not dodging.\n\nThese players get permabanned because this advice that has been given to them many times before just isn't getting through and probably never will. It's not simple ignorance that can be fixed by giving them a few tips. And then of course even if they do understand that their behavior is problematic, they still think they shouldn't be banned for it. People should get thicker skins, behavior bans are stupid, I wouldn't ban myself for this, I don't like these rules... it's a lost cause, which is exactly why they are permabanned.","replies":[{"poster":"Fatesight","date":"2018-12-30T00:58:42.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"I wonder, are you really arguing that the current rules are flawless and any criticism of them can only come from a place of ignorance and lack of self-awareness?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-30T01:15:53.610+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fatesight,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=8y3eTJBx,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2018-12-30T00:58:42.919+0000)\n>\n> I wonder, are you really arguing that the current rules are flawless and any criticism of them can only come from a place of ignorance and lack of self-awareness?\n\nWhat do the former have to do with the latter?

You don't have to take super long breaks (I've taken an especially long one to wind down after a last-day Ranked crunch), but taking breaks is a good way to keep yourself in a winning mood - especially if at the end of the third game you've managed to sum up a three-loss streak.\n\nJust a small break, 1-4 hours, is good enough to destress and get past the tilt matches can cause. And I don't see how small to medium length breaks (a few hours, maybe a day) can accrue enough rust to count for anything.\n\nWhereas, if you just try to grind out game after game after game - sure, you may be in the motion of playing League, but continually doing much of the same thing can wear you down. And at that point, you're not playing in your prime for another reason - fatigue at the very least, and _tilt_ and fatigue at the worst.\n\nBut, still, my advice is best taken with a grain of salt. What works for me may not work for the next guy. I do better if I have frequent breaks in my play-sessions, whereas someone else may do better once they pick up momentum. At the end of the day, you can't _totally_ discount my advice, just take it as it is.","replies":[{"poster":"TLF brubie","date":"2018-12-30T01:19:31.524+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even just going to the kitchen for 10 minutes and grabbing a sandwich works wonders","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"World peace plz","date":"2018-12-29T20:55:55.798+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akaśhí,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=8y3eTJBx,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-12-29T20:53:27.256+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t listen to this guy, when you play a few games you warm up and you will play better each other game whereas If you take a break you kinda &quot;forget&quot; to play or you just don&#x27;t play in your prime...\n\n\nHes talking about tilt.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Götterdämmerung","date":"2018-12-29T21:07:10.534+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Done, good one!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellmaximus1","date":"2018-12-30T03:31:44.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"LMAO, what the fuck is that tag on regent for.\n\nTaking a break is the most generic response that doesn't even work.\n\nA better solution is to disable the enter key while in game into such time you feel like your teammates words in chat don't flare up your anger.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-30T03:59:25.558+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Taking a break is the most generic response that doesn't even work.\n\nIt may not work for you, but it will work for some people.
