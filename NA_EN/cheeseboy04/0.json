Cuz I&#039;m not what I would call and experienced player and last game I did bad, and this jinx and lux became cyber bullies even though they weren&#039;t doing good either! I reported lux but jinx was mean at the end after I gave her a thumbs up cuz she was nice in game (kind of). I know riot isn&#039;t gonna do anything because I&#039;ve reported lots of people for doing that and nothing happens. Also, why do y&#039;all bleep out words like cancer but not the d word that beavers build . Cuz people come up with a way too cuss without getting caught all the time. Please do something to the people I played with last game. Jinx and lux.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-03T19:20:34.238+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you find \"damn\" offensive, you should not be on the internet.\n\nJust report and move on (the system will handle them if they keep doing it), sounds like you are way too young or reactionary to be playing pvp games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-05-03T19:12:44.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">not the d word that beavers build\n\nLeague is rated 13+, and simply cursing isn't a punishable offense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"howareyouthisbad","date":"2017-05-03T19:40:17.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol stop crying and mute them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-05-03T19:11:03.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"submit a ticket it helps trust me I had someone be friendly and they added me and as soon as I added them they went off on me and I sent a screenshot to riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-05-03T19:10:05.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=cheeseboy04,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=thkNjhpa,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-03T19:05:24.098+0000)I know riot isn't gonna do anything because I've reported lots of people for doing that and nothing happens.\n\nRiot actually punishes pretty aggressively. You just usually don't get the heads-up, since you only get that alert if your report is the FINAL ONE needed to trigger the punishment.\n\nJust report them, clear your head, and move on to the next game -- chances are good they'll get what's coming to them pretty soon if they keep that behavior up.\n\n---------------\n\nAs for why Riot doesn't block certain words? There are so many that COULD use used that they can't do the entire list. \"Damn\" gets through even the profanity filter (I believe) since it's widely regarded as one of the least offensive curse words, and sometimes it isn't even considered a curse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-03T19:08:18.037+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"damn if only there was a mute button and did u just say cyber bullying what are you 10:edit don't u love when u get downvoted because little kids cant accept the facts and cry about it on boards","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-03T19:21:33.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Basically this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"howareyouthisbad","date":"2017-05-03T19:39:45.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lol stop crying and mute them","replies":[]}]}
