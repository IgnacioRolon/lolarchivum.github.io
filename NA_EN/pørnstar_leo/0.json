We should be able to resolve this by resetting that file that's saved server-side. The steps below will assist you in doing this:\n\n*Log into League* then hop into your config folder, which should be in this directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, jump into a custom match to confirm all your settings were set to default. You can then make any hotkey or Video changes you need to. Let me know if this resolved your issue!","replies":[]}]}
