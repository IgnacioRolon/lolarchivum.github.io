It simply refuse to go off, this happens even without CC and in range I have witnessed myself many times now spam exhausting a target up to 10 times over 2 seconds where it just refuse to go off. Often resulting in free kills for the enemy. This is incredibly frustrating, I compete in tournaments and this really really bothers me.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would be eternally grateful for a response - just a \"Now we know\" would be awesome. I know this place gets a lot more attention than EUW(I don&#039;t blame them, they are simply few and fairly inactive).\n\nI apologize for reporting 3 in one thread.\n\nSincerely,\n\nArm&Agrave;-EUW","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-16T00:47:47.203+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nI left a comment on the DJ Sona post. I'm on the skins team, so I can take a look into those on Monday. As for the other issues, I can pass them on to the proper teams to take a look at as well. \n\nI can update this thread once we've looked into these issues. ^-^\n\nThanks for the report!","replies":[{"poster":"Àrma","date":"2015-08-16T13:10:18.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow thank you so much that means a lot to me, take care and please feel free to update <3","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-18T01:05:04.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update time! \n\nI've gone ahead and responded to the DJ Sona thread with additional info regarding the bugs. In some cases, I was unable to repro the issue, and more information would be helpful in getting to the bottom of the issue! \n\nRegarding the exhaust issue, I was unable to repro it. Any specific steps to recreate the bug would be much appreciated. \n\nThanks for bringing the Pickpocket buff counter to our attention - we're looking into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Armà","date":"2015-08-18T16:51:46.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I honestly don't know exactly what triggers the exhaust bug. I just know it happens frequently when I play Sona(And others judging by the replies). It is likely that it has something to do with powerchord and her spells to do, but it doesn't happen all the time, Ill try to figure it out.\n\nThis time it happened when Jayce went on to me, I had 2 charges and was going for powerchord exhaust. Except the exhaust refused to go off again. It certainly doesn't happen every time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf30780411","date":"2015-08-15T23:50:13.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Àrma","date":"2015-08-15T23:51:49.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-08-16T01:58:35.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do believe you are able to cast heal/barrier/smite/exhaust/clarity (given you have the range to do so) even while CC'ed of course suppression is the exception to this \nWhile obviously Teleport can't be used while CC'ed and neither can flash \n\nI believe that's how it's supposed to work anyhow","replies":[{"poster":"Àrma","date":"2015-08-16T15:26:32.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think silence stops you, that's about it.
