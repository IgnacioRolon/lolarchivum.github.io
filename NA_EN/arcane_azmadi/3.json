Pool Party ZAC skin, nice, thank you very much, now it's only Yorick who is left crying in the corner. But seriously- what's with the female champ skins?\n\nOK, I get it. You're not going to give us hot bikini girl skins like Pool Party Ahri, Pool Party Katarina or Pool Party Miss Fortune. Sure, heaps of players would love them and buy them and they'd be incredibly popular, but you don't want to deal with the backlash from straw feminists lambasting you for making your female characters into \"sex objects\" (I wonder if these people spend their spare time campaigning to have all public beaches closed unless women wear ankle-length robes when they swim?). It's more trouble than it's worth for you, I get it, even if I don't agree with it.\n\nBut why do you feel you have to troll us about it? Why rub it in our faces? You started off mildly enough- Pool Party Leona was greatly anticipated, only for her to be almost completely covered, with a loose top over the top part of her one-piece swimsuit and a wrap around her waist. It was still attractive, even if it wasn't sexy. The 2nd round (Graves, Renekton and Ziggs) had no female characters at all. But now you're giving us 2 new Pool Party skins for female characters in this round- **Lulu and Rek'Sai.**\n\n_Rek'Sai?_ For crying out loud, Riot, that's not even funny! \"Heh, you want Pool Party skins for female characters? Ta-dah, here's a Pool Party skin for a completely inhuman character with no feminine traits whatsoever, not even her _voice_, which is quite literally only female because we _say_ so!\" And the Lulu skin? Sorry Riot, it's not even cute. The stupid tentacle hat almost completely obscures her entire model and the only thing that's going to result is a lot of dirty fan art of Lulu being raped by her own animated headgear.\n\nNow look, I love boobs. I'm not ashamed to admit it. There is nothing so beautiful in this world as a well-rounded female form. I don't expect people to judge me for that as long as I don't judge them for what they like- I don't have a problem with people who like portraying Taric and Ezreal as gay (unless they're insisting that that is actually _canon_ which is quite simply _factually wrong_ and has nothing to do with judging them personally). And to be honest, it's a bit late for you to take a puritanical stance about refusing to sexualise your characters in their alternate skins after releasing \"Hello\" Nurse Akali, Stripp-uh, \"Officer\" Caitlyn and, most of all, Headmistress \"Please Mistress I've Been A Naughty, Naughty Boy\" Fiora (or hell, even _base_ Miss Fortune). You're not fooling anyone at this stage. But if you're not going to release any hot Pool Party skins (some of the concepts, like Lifeguard Sivir, are genuinely really good) then can you at least stop _taunting_ us about it?","replies":[]}
