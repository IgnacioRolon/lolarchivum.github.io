I failed to kill Veigar in that last game because he ran down behind the minimap and, despite the area he was in still being visible to my team, I was basically shooting blind.\n\nIf activating the ult already zooms you out to a fixed angle, why can&#039;t it also make the minimap transparent (so you can still see champion icons moving around, but can also see actual _champions_ running behind it) for its duration? Or at the very least, don't lock the camera after zooming up so we can scroll to see what's under the minimap, at least a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Parceval","date":"2016-04-27T16:45:14.883+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":14,"body":"Why are you playing with a fixed camera?","replies":[{"poster":"56552559_DEL","date":"2016-04-27T17:28:51.958+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"I play with a fixed camera as well.
