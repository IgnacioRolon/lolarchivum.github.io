Well don't wait til four stacks to engage then! Or people who don't know that his 5th stack cast resets cooldowns. Or people trying out experimental build / skill orders, some of which may be better than what's traditional but many of which are probably worse.\n\nBasically, because he was weak on release, few people are playing him, and that means no conventional wisdom has formed about how to play him right. So people are still out there, experimenting and flailing around trying to figure him out.\n\nRyze definitely needs buffs, but he also needs new champion specific game knowledge that isn't common yet.

Shit, I would argue you max Q last.\n\nAND DON'T BUY FROZEN HEART.\n\nThat Item is awful on him post rework. It is outclassed, and is mostly a waste of stats.\n\nStop building him as a bruiser. Sorry, but having rod as your only AP item is not cutting it anymore.\n\n\"What are you talking about, I know how to play ryze stfu\"\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Ryze\n\nHis most frequent core build is trash. Look at that.\n\nMaxing Q is bad because all it offers the least out of all of your spells until lategame. E is a better spell if only one target is next to the initial, and W is better per point because the duration and damage go up. (What do you mean max E wtf its a rng spell). No, it's not. That was reworked. E will currently hit the initial target, then bounce to up to 6 targets near the initial. Now, here is where this spell gets REALLY powerful. After hitting the secondary targets, all 6 shots will bounce BACK to the initial target, dealing even more damage per shot. Meaning landing an E on an enemy in a full minion wave will ensure they take at least 250-ish damage from E alone, plus the burst from W.\n\nIf you play right, you should easily be able to out sustain and out poke lane opponents whom do not directly counter you.\n\n\nMaxing Q does not reduce the cooldown, increases the cost, and only gives 100 damage at rank 5, plus .5 mana scaling, compared to his E which gives 5X that amount if you land it in a full minion wave (which is stupid easy in lane).\n\nRyze is deceptively strong right now, and his only real problem is how bad his passive is until you get 2 points into ult.\n\nYou see the passive only lasts 3 seconds, but goes up for 1 second for every point into your ult. You ult also gives cdr, which makes your passive even more effective. The passive is being buffed to last for 6 seconds flat starting at level 1, meaning ryze will actually have a midgame compared to right now, where he HAS to farm until level 11. With this change, he should be able to start making plays at around level 8-9. \n\nNow, laning on him is really easy and safe, you have zero reason to be losing trades if you play them right. You probably won't get any kills, as ryze lacks all in kill pressure early game. Sure, if you go all in at the right time you will send them running, but you will not be getting a kill unless they get greedy or where already low. Start Sapphire, Max E, then W, then Q. Back when you have enough gold for a tear. TP back to lane. Focus on farm. Whenever it is safe to do so, poke. Simply use your W while the enemy is standing in their minion wave, then E them. Watch as half their health bar disappears and they can't do anything about it other than stay away from their minions, meaning they cant farm unless they are ranged.\n\nNow, Ryze will get shit on by champs such as irelia, because with how her kit works she can stun you when your passive procs, and then out sustain your weak damage afterwards (Her stun is 2 seconds, your passive at this point is 3. Big issue for your dps). He can also struggle against ranged champs, as catching them in a minion wave can be very hard.\n\nBut seriously, do not max Q. It is asking to get stomped in lane. His Q is a lategame spell right now. It does no damage early even when maxed, and is really just an awful lane spell in general.\n\nE offers far more damage, and W offers far more utility. So, to answer your question, yes, one of the problems is you people suck shit at reworked ryze.\n\nEDIT: I just found this forum post from a ryze main who actually repeated exactly what I just said, with some variations.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/3697c0/my_first_impressions_of_the_updated_ryze_new/\n\nEven has a video.

They got into this problem because they only tried to rework the problematic elements of the kits without trying to modify the unsatisfying parts of the kits.\n\nThere is no reason why Zilean should have kept his terrible and boring passive through a rework.

They could revert the E changes to give him some power back. They could buff his ultimate through a higher duration or lower cooldown.

Basically make Event Horizon Cripple all units within it so they can still run around inside the cage to dodge his skillshots but can't dash or flash out of it (after all, what is an Event Horizon but the edge of _a black hole?_). This way he doesn't HAVE to land an instant stun with the edge of the cage and can actually use it the way it was intended.\n\nI also suggested a fix for Zilean- rather than him only getting a double bomb detonation if he can land both bombs on a single target (which is almost impossible with the ridiculously finicky target selection mechanics the skill currently has) the 2nd bomb should detonate if it's struck by the explosion of the first one, with the stun only affecting units struck by both explosions.\n\nAs for Ryze, though, I got nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-05-24T10:59:49.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Ryze I think he just needs some number buffs. He feels as though he could be strong but is just undertuned.\n\nVeigar... I don't know... I think the more recent changes have put him into an alright state. Yes, having W hard/reallyhard/reallyreallyhard to hit isn't good, but even so, he is strong. A change to W would undoubtedly require compensation nerfs.\nFor evidence   http://champion.gg/champion/Veigar/Middle\nTake a look at the win rate against games played graphs. The old Veigar players still haven't learnt how to play him in the new way. \n\nYour Zilean idea is interesting. Do you mean \"in the explosion range\" or \"in the explosion\". If you mean \"Explosion range\" it may be a little bit strong - that explosion range isn't small! If you mean \"in the explosion\" then that needs good timing. It would give Zilean a way to show more mechanical skill with a reward.\n\nHow would you respond to just reliability buffs. Better target selection or a slightly larger bomb detection radius?","replies":[{"poster":"Arcane Azmadi","date":"2015-05-24T14:35:29.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean \"in the explosion\"- the explosion of the 1st bomb sets off the 2nd one. Of course, the 2nd one would have to have been out for at least 1 second to \"prime\" it before the 1st one goes off or it won't trigger- this is to prevent abusive cases of Zil throwing 1 bomb and Rewinding, then waiting until just before it explodes to throw the 2nd one into its blast radius for an instant stun. That way if he tags 2 different units with 2 bombs they'll both be stunned if they can't move away from each other in time, but they do _have_ time to at least react.\n\nReliability buffs would be a start, though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Raidbringer","date":"2015-05-23T17:59:05.857+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly Ryze's new state isn't bad.

He's so weak now that even when he triggers his passive, most melee champs still simply rape him. During the early game, he can't even poke with his Q because it's easy to stay behind minions. All you have are W and E that cost a shitload of mana for the damage it deals. The old Ryze used to be really good against melees (probably too good, which is why his Q got reworked) but the current ryze sucks against everything. Ryze always sucked vs low range, now he just sucks vs long range and short range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kile147","date":"2015-05-24T09:57:12.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Veigar and play him as one of my regular midlaners and I was a little (very) pissed about the rework. They took an itemization change (RIP DFG) that hurt him as an opportunity to nerf him, which felt really shitty. He was in a bad spot after that, but they did eventually get onto fixing him I am ok with where they have left him now. He's not quite the same as before and probably a little weaker, but he is a lot healthier for the game. I would love for them to give him a bit more love, but I'd still call him a successful rework.\n\nZilean needed a rework because his bombs were toxic to deal with, though I don't think they went about it the right way. A Sion level rework seems far more appropriate for him and I hope they get around to something like that someday, but until then he's at least healthier for the game. He certainly needs buffs in his current state though. I would say that Ryze was the most deserving of those three of the rework. Ryze was a late game champ who would bully melees out of lane when strong, meaning he would always scale into late game. The data says he could use buffs certainly, but given his previous state Riot is probably hesitant to do that, and they are probably going to wait a patch or two before handing him buffs.","replies":[]}]}
