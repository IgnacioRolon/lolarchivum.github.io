Does Lamb have a face under the mask, or is the mask actually her face? I know Lamb and Wolf&#039;s forms are malleable depending on how they&#039;re perceived by an observer (although the masks are described as a constant) but does THIS representation of Lamb have facial features?\r\n\r\nPersonally I don&#039;t think she should have a face. She&#039;s a spiritual being, why would she need to wear a mask to conceal something? And she&#039;s the emotionless one, an unmoving mask face suits her better.

I think it would add a lot to her character to see her take the mask off, even if only for a little while, to show that the face under the mask is not much different than the wood she removed. On the flip side of that,  although I think the masks being traded is just symbolism of how they complete each other, I think it would be kind of cool if it had a thematic purpose, if their was a reason they where reversed. Lets say if Wolf wore his mask, He would still be Violent, but he would not be inclined towards emotion, and instead would be a cold blooded psychopathy, where as lamb would be merciful and full of emotion. It would illustrate that wolf and lamb are opposites, but they are made into one via the masks.","replies":[{"poster":"MorningEspeon","date":"2016-11-01T06:58:14.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this theory. Her voice is soothing and her movements are fairly calm and delicate, and she represents a quiet, accepting death, so it would make sense that she has a very beautiful face to ease the fears of the soon departed. It wouldn't be needed for her face itself to be devoid of emotions, it would be her eyes that would be cold and without feeling, her face perhaps too, but certainly her eyes. Or perhaps the opposite of that, her face is stoic yet her eyes reflect the pain and feelings surrounding death that her mark feels. Wolf, I would imagine has very energetic eyes, brimming with wild ferocity.\nI personally can't decide, though, if I think her face is human-like which would 'clash' with her animal features, or if it is anthropomorphic akin to some Yordles but perhaps with a more pronounced muzzle (it fits under the mask because magic), or if her face is some beautiful yet unnerving place in the Uncanny Valley. No matter what Lamb looks like under the mask, I would quite like to see a skin of Kindred without the masks as a kind of 'what if' lore related skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zeta","date":"2016-06-03T05:23:00.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just picture creepy uncanny valley animal-human hybrid.

It is because Lamb wears the mask of Wolf that she realizes that life must be allotted its time, and it is because Wolf wears the mask of Lamb that he understands that the run is not forever, that it is in fact a chase. There's nothing fixed underneath the masks, because their form just reflects the expectations of those they meet. But though the form is mutable, its metaphor has meaning, and if something of incredible power, dying, were to reach out and swap those masks — life and death each run amok would bring ruin to the world.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-05-30T03:36:53.487+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's a spirit.

They're what allows this concept of death to give those who it meets a choice. To face death and die peacefully, or run and be hunted by it. If the masks were removed they would likely become unable to inhibit themselves in this way and become a pure form of death, a death without reason who would just rip apart those who met them. Wouldn't be fun for anyone.\nAs for if the masks were swapped I reckon it would break the eternal bond between Lamb and Wolf, which would probably just fuck with death and dying on a universal scale. I consider the masks to be how Lamb and Wolf, as two supposedly separate beings, remain as a single whole. The masks are the reasons why Lamb has knowledge and Wolf has wonder. The implications of a mask swap could turn Wolf entirely ravenous and just cut the strings of life from beings on a whim. It could take away Lamb's sense of duty and lead them away from their place as an entity of death. Honestly, the possibilities for the exact result here are endless but I do think it would turn the man who split himself in two, after all this time, into two actually separate beings. \nAlternatively, they could return to being that one entity that they both spawned from. I know that the man who split himself in two is a metaphorical being but I am interested to hear what riot has to say about that one entity that originated Lamb and Wolf, if there is anything to say at all. \nTl;dr - Bad things and @riot tell me if we'll ever hear more about original LambWolf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-06-03T18:36:11.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mask is the face...\nhttps://static.wixstatic.com/media/509a09_1ecbc155706544f0b0884dd247356753.png/v1/fill/w_473,h_473,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/509a09_1ecbc155706544f0b0884dd247356753.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaIIeIujah","date":"2016-05-30T06:14:20.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Baseless speculation here, but..Wolf and Lamb have been confirmed to take different aspects based on who they are appearing in front.
