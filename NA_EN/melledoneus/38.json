Some, people have no idea (Mecha Zero Sion in the 4th image) while some are more obvious (Pulsefire Caitlyn). Teasers are meant to hype you up for a skin that is coming, and you show something that is either very vague or gives you an idea as to what to expect. That&#039;s what teasers do.\r\n\r\nThis teaser, however, has many issues:\r\nhttps://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c3930b57bf1f463a44659d32753417863bf06d8014166da6da0d47e8384c49c9.jpg?w=800&amp;h=1095\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s list the issues:\r\n1: The sword has the identical shape and very similar eccentric design as Shen&#039;s &#039;spirit sword.&#039; Here is an image for reference:\r\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oUndvmK1kYA/VqaVkfJourI/AAAAAAAAK1o/6NpIYRoM408/s1600/shenpassive.jpg\r\n\r\nThe blades are similar in length and float in the exact same way. The handle-to-blade ratio is perfectly identical. There&#039;s even a ribbon on the sword leading off-screen and towards the screen (it&#039;s blurred) that looks like the would-be tether between Shen and his sword (and if you think about it, it would be kick-ass because you&#039;re standing between Shen and his sword, meaning you&#039;re in trouble). Even the shape of the hilt is very similar, and has just enough differences to warrant it being a skin. This would likely cause some confusion, but in a land of magic and people who use it, a floating sword can belong to anyone, right? Except we get to the second issue.\r\n\r\n2: The whole teaser is reminiscent of Shen&#039;s spiritual energies and how he is portrayed. Let&#039;s take a quick look at Shen&#039;s splash art:\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mHESLoV56CU/VpawP2-oZWI/AAAAAAAA2qI/fMg-ZE_tYhU/s1600/Shen_Splash_0.jpg\r\n\r\nDo you see the similarities between the bottom of his ultimate channel and the ground beneath the sword? _There are even identical energy droplets rising upward in the exact same fashion!_ Not to mention that if you look closely again at the bottom of the sword:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QVDRKR0.png\r\n\r\nThere is a circular spiral of energies, and beyond that ripples of energy. Just like you-know-who&#039;s energy rings when he ults. It&#039;s so similar that one has trouble NOT thinking it&#039;s a Shen skin. Jumping to conclusions is bad, yes, but this was baiting to a whole other level.\r\n\r\n3: The teaser looks more like Shen&#039;s blade than the actual thing.\r\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3s4adT5qjmg/Wbg7GgogMjI/AAAAAAAAuHc/hlAzaEZBe58LSS860nHxCtJuSO7cjqbJwCLcBGAs/s640/jannab.jpg\r\n\r\nYou can make the comparison for yourself.\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n&quot;So, Mell, why does this matter? Salty much?&quot;\r\n\r\nSalty? Kinda. But this does matter because, as I see it, a teaser shouldn&#039;t blatantly point you in one direction so sharply that you basically know who it is FOR SURE. It also most certainly should not do that then turn everything on your head and completely make the group of people that were excited for it feel hurt and betrayed. \r\n\r\nTeasers, I realize, are not canonical announcements and I can&#039;t say &quot;you HAVE to be more clear!&quot; But it would be nice if this never happens again with any other teaser, by any channel of media by Riot Games. I won&#039;t poo-poo the skins because they look nice, but I might have been happy to see them if this lingering bitterness wasn&#039;t overpowering the sweetness of it. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s just my two-cents on it. Thank you for reading this far.","replies":[{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2017-09-13T02:30:50.854+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":11,"body":"This teaser was only shown in China though.

Janna has never been associated with swords. Not only that but the details are extremely similar to Shen's.\n\nEven if it was only officially released in China, they can't pretend other regions finding it is a surprise, it's inevitable with things like these, and I don't think this should have been done like this. Sure some might realize that it won't be Shen, but it's so painfully clear why people would think it's Shen. This shouldn't have happened, and it's not really the playerbase's fault.","replies":[{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2017-09-13T16:11:33.182+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's only outside of China that anyone thought it was Shen though. From what I've read, inside of China (the region the teaser was meant for) they guessed characters like Yi and Fiora for the theme and even (incorrectly there) others like Taliyah, because they actually understood the teaser. If you'd like some perspective, [here's a really good post from the League subreddit that explains a bit about why Shen wouldn't fit the theme and why it wasn't surprising to anyone in the target demographic that not-Shen got skins from this teaser](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6zot15/912_pbe_update/dmx0yrs/), they explain it much better than I can.\n\nAnd obviously teasers in other regions are going to spread fast, the Internet exists. But that doesn't make this teaser in particular any less aimed specifically toward the Chinese audience, that's just a fact (as evidenced by ***China being the only region to get the teaser officially***). It's not Riot's (or whoever is responsible in China)'s fault people outside of China who happened to see it lacked the context to make an informed prediction and ended up disappointed. Anyone who thought this would be a Shen skin baited themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedric Etwahl","date":"2017-09-13T16:16:26.276+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've read all of that, I've seen it multiple places. I really don't think it was unreasonable for the majority of people to think Shen when the picture screams Shen.

While Japan's entire written language system is more or less derived from/inspired by the Chinese written language to begin with, Kanji is a case where they simply take the words and use them as they are unchanged, though with altered meanings. In other words, while Kanji ARE Chinese characters and words, it's referring to the ones used in the Japanese language system. \n\nAnd it is a form of WRITTEN language. Kanji themselves do not technically have their own sound, they are used mostly as word bundles to promote readability and to indicate technical terms/jargons in written pieces.\n\nTherefore \"kanji sounding stuff\" is not the correct way to describe it. Not to mention, \"Xian xia\" is obviously not Japanese sounding to begin with.\n\nYou should just call it \"Chinese words\".

It does not have its own designated pronunciation that is separate from the rest of the Japanese verbal/vocal language; there is only 1 Japanese verbal language, there are just a couple ways to write it out. \n\nFor instance, my ign is \"Sekai\". It's a romanised/\"Romaji\" spelling for the Japanese term for \"World\", where it's pronounced as \"Se Kai\". In Hiragana, which is I guess the 'default' written language of Japanese, it is written as \"せかい\". In Katakana it's written as \"セカイ\". And in Kanji, it's written as \"世界\".\n\nThat's 4 ways to write the same thing in Japanese, they are not pronounced differently nor do they mean different things. Though the reality is that vast majority of all writings are done in Hiragana and Kanji, as Katakana is reserved to spell terms borrowed from say the western languages and that there is little reason to use Romaji besides it being used to help foreigners learn Japanese, but this is just to show that \"Kanji sounding\" is simply an invalid use of description and makes little sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-09-13T03:54:58.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm glad I'm learning what all these kanji sounding things mean.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-09-13T03:57:24.833+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glory ln Death,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xPfbWvxF,comment-id=0002000000000002000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-13T03:54:58.413+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m learning what all these kanji sounding things mean.\n\nYeah, whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-09-13T04:40:16.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'm glad you understand.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-09-13T05:04:27.401+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glory ln Death,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xPfbWvxF,comment-id=000200000000000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-13T04:40:16.954+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m glad you understand.\n\nI was talking about your ridiculous trolling, not that the distinction and getting stuff right doesn't matter.\n\nWhat's wrong with getting things right?

It's just an umbrella term for animation produced in Japan, by Japanese artists, and those inspired by their work; though that last one is typically debated because it raises many clarity issues.\n\n\"Anime\" can be loosely used as a term to refer to the stereotypical trend and impression of anime, but it is by no means suggesting that anime means a specific artstyle.\n\nNot to mention, anime artstyles varies from era to era and from artist to artist anyway, so this categorisation is ultimately very much moot if you really want to use it seriously for whatever reason.\n\n.............\n\nThat said, anime or animation as a whole is indeed a media genre, just like live action movies are a media genre next to music, books etc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-09-13T03:09:11.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, basically...\n\nAscended Vigilante?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2017-09-13T00:58:20.557+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to me to be a case of bad cordination on riots part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZER0 2","date":"2017-09-13T15:45:45.290+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot should keep doing these teasers because they're fun and THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A GUESSING THING, not stop doing them because some people are upset that they guessed wrong.
