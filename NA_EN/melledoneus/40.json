I usually don&#039;t experience this because I&#039;m in Bronze (Hell, I&#039;m in Bronze for this reason, because of the nice people), but recently it&#039;s become a problem. And a recurring one at that. For example, one game I had...\n\n>{{champion:27}} *is AFK at the beginning of the game*\n{{champion:98}} Alright, be careful not to die.\n{{champion:98}} We might have to remake.\n{{champion:115}} stfu\n{{champion:115}} he&#039;s reconnecting\n\nIs it really warranted to be such a jerk to such a passive statement? I mean, jeez, calm down. Here&#039;s another one:\n\n>{{champion:3}} /all gg this team is fucking garbo\n{{champion:3}} /all Fuck this team\n{{champion:64}} /all Dude your jungler camped your lane and you still lost...\n{{champion:121}} /all ^\n{{champion:3}} stfu Kha your fucking useless\n\nNow, usually when I encounter people like this I just report and move on. But it&#039;s become concerning how status quo this attitude is becoming. In my past 15 games, 13 of them have had people like this. I&#039;ve seen people in other videos adopting the same mentality. This behavior is not acceptable by any standard or in any case, and there are better ways to vent frustration (my favorite is singing a song about how stupid Vayne&#039;s damage is when she three shots me as a tank). \n\nGuys, if you&#039;re somebody who is like this in-game, just stop. It&#039;s not going to make people listen to you, it&#039;s not going to make you feel better in the long run, and it sure as hell isn&#039;t going to fix that losing streak. And most of all, it isn&#039;t going to make you a better person or a better player.\n\nSo, in short:\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/10QnBCa9QbQHiE/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"MrNhbdy","date":"2016-11-18T15:13:34.184+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Toxic behavior\" comes from the \"I'm gonna be Faker( or insert pro here)\" mentality, which means they don't care about the over-all point of the game ( work together to obtain goals). This mentality is also the reason why we don't have more supports. Everyone wants to be the best, but many don't understand you still can be by being supportive ( weather you are in the support role or not). This \"I am a god, all hail me\" type of acting needs to stop, flaming does not help, it only brings down teammates and causes them to loose focus by having arguments in chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Advisor","date":"2016-11-18T15:40:55.299+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I cannot quite express just how accurate this is. And this is coming from a support main. (Or, at least, an in-training-to-be support main)\n\nBut, you are absolutely right about the \"it only brings down teammates\" part. Honestly, this is probably the most important part of why toxic players should simply stop being toxic. Their comments do nothing but distract their teammates. But then, if their teammate mutes them, they begin spamming \"mia\" pings all game. That is a problem for two reasons. One, it causes the teammate to lose focus for that moment since they'll initially believe that they are legit being warned about upcoming ganks/danger. And, two, it's just pure irritating and could tilt that player.\n\nWhat I hate the most in toxic players is the fact that when they start getting tilted, instead of changing their playstyle from aggro-to-passive (or even passive-to-aggro, if that happens to be the problem), they just start flaming their team. Not even for what is happening in their own lane, but for things that their teammates are doing. (No matter whether it's good or bad.)\n\nIf their teammate does something good, the toxic player will say something along the lines of \"Oh, finally this [insert champ name here] wants to be useful.\" Like, why even comment on someone else's 'usefulness' if you're doing poorly, yourself? You have no reason, nor right, to do so.\n\nIf their teammate does something bad, the toxic player will say something along the lines of \"Oh my god, this f-ing [insert champ name here] is so garbage. Why are you even playing [insert role here]? You suck at it.\" All the while, that toxic player is still doing terribly, and most of the time, worse because their attention is now where it shouldn't be: on their team.\n\nWhat makes all this worse is that I've been in a couple games where even the Support (during the rare times I don't get it) on my team, complains that the team isn't doing anything. Meanwhile that same support isn't warding, isn't healing (if applicable), isn't tanking properly (going in at inopportune times or just running from fights altogether), isn't shifting their kit over to anyone other than the adc at times where it'd be more beneficial for fights and such, etc. They just go to town in chat (all-chat, to be more specific) about how everyone else in the game is performing.\n\nYou mentioned the following:\n\n\"'Toxic behavior' comes from the 'I'm gonna be Faker( or insert pro here)' mentality...This \"I am a god, all hail me\" type of acting...\"\n\nThis can actually be summed up with a quote from the movie \"The Incredibles\" where Syndrome stated:\n\n\"And when everyone's super. No one will be.\"\n\nThis is actually true to League's toxic players. They all believe they are the best and completely ignore the fact that League is a team game. When they feel like they aren't the best or more \"Super\" than another player, they flame. Because they truly believe flaming will force their competition to be less \"Super\". It's almost like a very quickly spreading disease, in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"NJSP Trooper","date":"2016-11-19T03:16:57.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just happened to me in my ranked match.

I learned how to deal with those players and still help the team without them hampering my will to play support. \n\nIt's mostly just learning how to carry as a support and how to help your team that wants to cooperate to do their best. If you have 1 person on your team acting up with their God Mentality, then learn to support the other players who aren't being a jerk :P \n\nGranted, it doesn't work all the time, but it does help you mentally and helps your team respect you as a support when you learn to prioritize teammates and realize you aren't shackled to your ADC all game. \n\nAlso, I like to play supports that either provide a lot of utility to the team, or can carry on their own via damage. I don't like letting 1 person hinder me or ruin my will to play support. \n\nAnd if supporting get's too tough, people can always try to jungle :P I feel jungling is like a global support with better carrying options.

The positive side is that where there&#x27;s a problem there&#x27;s a solution as long as you can control who you play with. \n> Having played League for 7+ years now, I know the community has gotten less and less enjoyable to play with, but I also know for every 4th or 5th game that makes your hair fall out there&#x27;s also one that you get the best experience&#x27;s from which we play LoL for. It&#x27;s like shooting up heroin, you want that beautiful moment you experienced the very first time you did it so you keep coming back expecting different results than the last 4 times you did it and maybe this&#x27;ll be the time you get high again. Close to the definition of insanity.\n> Anyway, hold close to the people you enjoyed playing with, add them and find out what they enjoy playing and be willing to try new play styles. Every time you enjoyed playing with someone in solo queue or ARAM whatever it is, see if they want to queue again and soon enough you&#x27;ll have enough friends to queue up with that the possibility of a troll being in your game is reduced greatly.\n> \n> P.S. Don&#x27;t run your new friends away with your acquired taste for trolls, you are what you eat.\n\n\nStay positive! {{champion:99}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2016-11-18T21:38:54.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made an account to play with little brother who is learning, we got around level 7 and started playing some pvp and in champ select alone had 3 ragers wanting a role.\nThen everybody argued and said \"I'm a smurf I'll carry you trash\".

Is it trolling? Yes it is, and it comes to be something very serious at the end for the only reasons that at some points, the sensitive players gets touchy and start to throw trash words to the trolls. And here everything start to be bad, everyone's is flaming because I wrote something very positive in the beginning. Is their a way to avoid this? No, not when Riot is in charge, they just don't know how to contrôle that so they let a system taking care of the behaviors activities which is insanely bad for this kind of game. You can clearly see the results in most of your games and I'm dead serious.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Praelis","date":"2016-11-19T13:31:40.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just experienced flaming and griefing a couple of hours ago in normal draft and it was the worst I have experienced thus far. I was support and my adc started flaming at me because I was helping to push lane. Later on he was like, \"stupid support pushing w/o wards and taking mobs\". I only accidentally killed a minion or two once and I was warding. In fact, I was the only one warding at bot!! So entire game him and his teammate were insulting me and even sexually harassed me by asking a lot of personal questions. In addition, they acted like ranking was what determined if you were good with league or not, and kept calling me a bronze. I reported them but I still feel salty and not sure if I can even enjoy league anymore as support. This situation occurred all the way from the beginning of the game where he apparently asked me to go top instead. But I didn't notice his comment because I was focused on helping him survive and stunning opponents. I played another game as support but it wasn't the same and I kept feeling like my adc was upset over the strategies I made even when they notified me otherwise sometimes during the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LEEROY KLEDKINS","date":"2016-11-19T05:25:48.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That 2nd chat was hat a bronze match?\n\nNo one in silver and above blames their allies that much for successful camping.","replies":[]}]}
