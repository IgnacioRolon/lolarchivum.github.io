I was hoping maybe after the LCS hype dies down, can we get some buffs or QoL changes? For a quick reference, here is a quick list of issues with Shen at the moment.\r\n\r\n* Lowest scaling armor in the game without compensation\r\n* Extremely low scaling HP values for a tank that prioritizes HP\r\n* Reliability on opponent being out of position, since Q cannot be concealed from enemy\r\n* E hitbox not consistent with visual, no indicator available\r\n* W does not feel impactful and is extremely slow compared to the rest of Shen&#039;s kit\r\n* Ultimate shield does not scale into late game, role as a Warden can be compromised as a result\r\n* Q feels more like an anchor than a tool, difficult for Shen to maneuver around opponents if it&#039;s not in the right position\r\n* Q slow very unimpactful, empowered autos too slow to punish opponents who are fleeing\r\n* No way to quickly proc passive shield\r\n* First jungle clears very difficult since nerfs to base Q damage\r\n* When ulting, position of appearance not indicated to ally\r\n\r\nNot saying to fix all of these, but I was wondering if the balance team was considering any of these issues in terms of Shen&#039;s balance and perhaps some fluidity or consistency changes could bump up his winrate without impacting pro play.\r\n\r\nI was hoping we could get some news on what Riot thinks of him in his current state.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomosima","date":"2016-09-26T14:04:14.015+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":5,"body":"I loved old Shen much more","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-09-26T21:48:02.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why'd they rework him anyway?

That was a nerf significantly driven by how dominant Shen could be for organized teams, Pro play in particular. \n* Shen's now too weak in regular play. That's not a new thing for Shen unfortunately. Pre-rework Shen was also difficult to balance for different contexts. His update did improve some of his gameplay issues (e.g. laning interactivity), it hasn't addressed that conflict of trying to balance for two different environments enough though. \n\n\n**Our Plans for Shen:**\n\n* We plan on buffing Shen. What we want to avoid doing though is buffing him because he's underperforming in regular games, then nerfing him again because he's too out of line in top tier play, etc. Changes need to address some of the disconnect between his strength in those different contexts, otherwise we'll just get stuck in a buff/nerf cycle.\n* We think one of the problems is that Shen's performance has too large a gap between its highs and lows, because of some feast/famine effects on his kit. If he's able to engage in a fight and survive in the first place he gets significantly more access to his passive shield for example, pushing him further ahead. On the other hand if he's somewhat behind he loses the ability to usefully trigger that CD reduction. Since he lacks other inherent tankiness to fall back on (low base stats, no ongoing defensive mechanics) a Shen who starts having trouble can have too much trouble recovering as a result.

At best you are forced to Shadow dash past an enemy while simultaneously pressing Q to get it to pass through them and get your bonus AS and Damage. While this feels super satisfying it also cripples your combo choices as it is the only viable means to get it consistently. The slow also feels very lack luster as well and tacked on at best.\n\nAll this said I still think it is a way more useful and fun iteration then Vorpal Blade ever was but it does feel slightly unpolished.  I would also rather see his ult have a strict scaling on health as opposed to AP. Shen builds nothing with AP in it so it's basically a useless stat modifier on what is suppose to be an \"OP\" Ult. Let's also be honest his ult is really not that OP unless your team has some god like coordination in Solo games. Half the time I use it the carry disengages and takes me out of position to dash in or the oither team has enough damage to burst the shield and kill them anyways...\n\nI am just tired of champions being reworked only to be pigeon holed into certain roles or builds b/c of their abilities or lack of build paths outside of what just ends up being optimal...","replies":[{"poster":"And A Real Hiero","date":"2016-09-26T18:28:02.466+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot even admitted they failed his fantasy with this Spirit blade thing.

The compensation that Shen gets for low base armor is a shield and a AA dodge. How effective these tools are is debatable, but to say he's completely without compensation is, I feel, incorrect.","replies":[]}]}
