{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-03-16T18:54:12.381+0000","title":"Something interesting we all missed when we saw Jhin's VO.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":86,"down_votes":5,"body":"[](http://i.imgur.com/ZWS139W.jpg)\nI was reading the Q&amp;A for Jhin when a Rioter brought up something that caught my eye. He noted that there is an underlying theme to some of Jhin&#039;s lines that imply that not only does he want to keep performing until the end, but he actually WANTS to get caught. So I decided to find these quotes and share them with you all so we can all get to know the Mind of the Virtuoso a little bit better.\n___________________________________________________\n#&quot;[Until they stop me, I will keep going.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/d/d3/Jhin.move32.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20160117220030)&quot;\n\nNow that&#039;s a little strange. Amongst all the talk of not being able to stop beauty and art being perfect, we have this little tidbit. He mentions being stopped, and that he will &quot;keep going&quot; until somebody else stops him. It almost seems as if Khada Jhin feels the need to keep going forever, tirelessly, until somebody puts him out of commission.\n\n#&quot;[I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time.](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/5f/Jhin.move36.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20160117220032)&quot;\n\nThis one is much less subtle than the last. Jhin keeps promising himself &quot;this is the last one,&quot; but he can&#039;t seem to. It&#039;s almost as if he WANTS to stop, but he absolutely cannot. It&#039;s like when you&#039;re eating a bag of your favorite potato chips and you keep saying &quot;this is my last chip,&quot; fully aware you want to stop, but you grab another chip anyway. Jhin seems to be the same way, just wanting each performance to be its last.\n\n# &quot;[I am a slave to this passion.](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a8/Jhin.move37.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20160117220126)&quot;\n\nOk, ok. I know that this is a stereotypical &quot;art is part of me&quot; statement by Jhin, but what if he means it literally? What if instead of him controlling his work,** it controls him?** What if Jhin is constantly feeding an obsession that he cannot sate, but he just wants to stop? I&#039;m pretty sure he wants recognition, as he proves himself to be wanting of praise time and again, so what if he just wants to prove that he is adept to the world? Being the intelligent man he is, he would have considered other options and found them more acceptable, but cannot stop himself on this path he set himself on.\n\n# &quot;[The moment before the shot... is painful.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/87/Jhin.move61.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20160117220320)&quot;\n\nThis has to at least raise some red flags for some of you out there. The guy is literally telling us that he feels the pain of having the power to take a human life as he pulls the trigger. If this doesn&#039;t prove that Jhin wants it to stop, what does?\n\n# &quot;[My work asks questions, it never has answers.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/62/Jhin.move38.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20160117220125)&quot;\n\nThis one might be a bit of a stretch, but hear me out. Every human being, even the ones who have gone absolutely insane, strive to find something in life. For Jhin, he strives to find answers to all his questions. What do people see me as? How can the audience ever love such a hideous face as mine? How can one achieve TRUE perfection? Questions like these drive Jhin to do what he does, and as he keeps doing his performances and delves deeper into madness, he questions more and more. But this endless cycle keeps raising more questions, never answering them. It is perhaps for this reason that Jhin wants it all to stop one day. To be captured. To go out with a bang.\n______________________________________________\n\n**Tell me what you all think.

Not being an ass, honest question. What kind of credentials do you have?\n\nI'm a licensed clinical social worker (so yes, professional credentials).  Bipolar disorder is an Axis I disorder while Narcissistic Personality Disorder is Axis II.  Any Personality disorder is typically secondary to an Axis I because it is assumed that an Axis II is INHERENT to the person's personality or function.  Bipolar disorder (Both Bipolar I and Bipolar II) can be controlled with both medication and therapy to an extent where as a personality disorder really can't.  In this case, Jhin isn't just narcissistic in nature, he very clearly displays traits of Bipolar Disorder including: Self-inflated grandiosity, racing thoughts, elevated mood/euphoria, and increase in goal-directed activities.  Can we say for certain Jhin has been through a manic phase? Well no, cause he's a video game character.  But if i met him in a clinic, he would likely meet criteria for both disorders.\n\nP.S. I am aware Axis I and II aren't used with DSM 5.  It just makes this whole thing easier to explain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kisindián","date":"2016-03-17T00:48:23.000+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow this was very interesting to read, I had waited for someone who did actually deal with these kind of mentally ill people, and how do they think this character was built up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1 800 MID LANE","date":"2016-03-17T04:43:10.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I may point something out here, I would tag him as more likely having Borderline Personality Disorder rather than Bipolar.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Danzig","date":"2016-03-17T12:48:17.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BuffsOP,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=cVvxEHG8,comment-id=00140004,timestamp=2016-03-17T04:43:10.412+0000)\n>\n> If I may point something out here, I would tag him as more likely having Borderline Personality Disorder rather than Bipolar.\n\nI would refute this mainly due to the fact that we know almost nothing about Jhin's personal life.

Narcissists by definition have a deeply held belief that they are better/superior to all others.  The fact that Zed and Shen previously beat him likely left him in a state of shock and disbelief.  On the other hand, even narcissists can recognize \"near equals\" (as a client of mine once said) and beating those people becomes almost a passion in itself.  And to truly express his \"art\" he needs to both physically and mentally destroy those who stopped him the first time.  It's very much a case of \"suffering for [his] art.\"  \n\nAnd as for the hints, Jhin is manipulating Zed and Shen in the Fourth (heh) episode.  Sure he likely wants them dead but he will \"pull the string, and they dance\" first as I believe the VO line states.  He needs the gratification of winning his own game before he actually wins.","replies":[]}]}]}
