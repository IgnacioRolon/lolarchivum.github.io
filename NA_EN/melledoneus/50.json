Your allies are happily farming in bot lane, raging at each other peacefully with passive-aggressive pings about the support wanting to get relic shield procs on cannon minions when all of a sudden, the enemy jungler ganks bot. Now, you're wondering... how would they handle this since bot lane had already flashed in greed to try and get first blood? Well, fear not, my friend, since your top laner decided to play Shen instead of Fiora top. So you see your screen turn purple in the middle of your fight, Shen is coming to save the day.\n\nYou die.\n\nWhat happened? You were level 6 while the enemy was level 5, the jungler was a level 4 Master Yi. Why didn't Shen's shield save you? Well, here's the real question.\n\n**Why can an ADC/melee carry tear through a global ultimate shield in 2-3 auto attacks?**\n\n250/550/850 HP shield. While it's all nice and dandy that Shen has a global teleport, 250 HP doesn't cut it anymore. Carries deal way too much damage in this meta, and aggressive junglers even more so. I've seen a level 6 Zed shred through the shield with one E-auto and kill my ally, who still had a third of their HP. I've seen the lucky crit of an ADC make the whole shield disappear. Late game, 850 HP is 2 seconds of an attack speed carry, or an Ahri Q. The ability is powerful, don't get me wrong. But the shield doesn't do enough to keep your allies alive.\n\n#The Solution\nHere's the problem: the shield isn't enough to keep carries alive. Should we buff it? Hell yeah. Give it a good 50 HP at rank 1, ramp it up to 1k late game so that you can keep your carry alive for at least a second against that Master Yi. So... what should we nerf in particular?\nI'm going to piss off a lot of people when I say this... but AP Shen is dead. The only scalings he has are a 1% per 100 AP max hp damage on his Q and a 1.3 AP ratio on his ultimate. So, let's get rid of the AP ratio since Riot clearly doesn't like AP Shen, and just go the full mile to making him a bruiser/tank. Buff the shield values, remove the unnecessary scalings. Nobody will play AP Shen even during URF because going full tank gives him more damage on his E and more shield with his passive. \n\nNow here's a random poll for your benefit.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2016-04-16T22:58:49.484+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":3,"body":"how about you make a special case where shen's shield takes damage reduced by shen's resists instead of his target's?","replies":[{"poster":"Im Stereotypical","date":"2016-04-16T23:09:11.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Captain Aishi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0ONzXVEE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-16T22:58:49.484+0000)\n>\n> how about you make a special case where shen&#x27;s shield takes damage reduced by shen&#x27;s resists instead of his target&#x27;s?\n\nMy thoughts exactly, Like level 6 Shen ult gives some HP and your shielded ally takes a small % reduced dmg.

New Shen builds AP for situational %health magic damage. But overall DPS is still higher for an AD bruiser/juggernaut build. Bruiser builds also boast more health options than AP, which makes his passive shield stronger. AD is also better for wave clear, since AP has to keep spamming Q which will drain his energy pool. Seeing as Shen is the only energy champion that realistically has to manage that thing, this becomes an issue.\nThe only reason to spec into his AP builds is for tank shredding and his ult. If you're tank shredding, you'll need to spec into magic pen as well which takes away from better tank options. So now you're gimping yourself to buy stats that can only be situationaly used. While nobody can deny the power of Shen's ult (global map pressure OP), it has incredible down time. This is made worse if your acting as a tank with little bulk. If you're picking him for the ult, you're better off picking Soraka. At least until she gets gutted again.\n\nI like The possibility of AP Shen. I played old Shen AP most of the time (He was also my first rank 5 champion). But on current Shen, there is no practical advantage to building AP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Axis the Dragon","date":"2016-04-18T02:09:50.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might as well play Lich + Luden's into bruiser gragas and deal similar damage in one W proc.\n\nThere's not much point to ap shen mid anymore after his only range poke was removed. \n\nGetting map pressure is nice but I prefer TF's point and click stun. Shen top still hits 6 at a pretty similar time to Top, anyway, so if you want to play him ap bruiser you can play him top.\n\nPlus you have zero waveclear. IIRC the only mid Champions played with low waveclear are assassins, and even they're not that terrible at it. The only non-assassins I can think of in that situation are Urgot, who's an extremely niche counter pick, and Ezreal, who has a) stupid amounts of kite and strong poke/sustained range damage when AD or b) huge, assassin-level damage with ap\n\nMid bruisers (when built like that, anyway) tend to have some form of waveclear to not fall behind in lane in CS (Diana, Gragas, Ekko).\n\nThe only thing I can think of AP Bruiser Shen mid would be good at is for counterpicking.

In general, Shen's ultimate is very telegraphed and has one of the longest cooldowns in the game, meaning that once Shen uses it, his global presence is gone. It's an ability that's just as powerful when not used for that reason.\n\nThat being said, the new AD meta hurts Shen because armor pen and AD and abundant and a 250 health shield is just 1 more second of survival. It's disheartening to see allies disappear just as you finish channeling ult because Thunderlord's ate up half your shield. Or execution damage makes it disappear.
