I misclicked on \"Play Now\" thinking half-mindedly it would let me log in, and then this screen greeted me:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KQGFCgY.png\n\nAnd I remembered this advertising campaign:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyq844xq2yY\n\n Now, this might get a little heated, but I'm only doing this, Riot, because I love you and I care for you.\n\n##1. Calling people 'noobs' is the worst possible idea if you're trying to bring more people to the game.\nPeople generally don't like to be insulted when trying out a new game. I personally would think \"this game is too harsh for me, I don't really feel like I belong here.\" Especially when in the place they download they game you say \"WELCOME, NOOB!\" I mean, this is starting to look less like \"welcome to League of Legends\" and more like a scenario where I walk into a locker room full of bullies who are about to steal my lunch money. It's not cool, it's not attractive, and moreover it's alienating and discouraging the kinds of people who are not secure with being called noobs because for them, it's a reality. They are not good at the game if they're new (usually) and sometimes they try to forget that so they don't feel like crap. So reminding them of that all the time is really bad for their psyche, in a game where psyche is a big part of whether you will win or not. They're not experienced enough to think \"haha, yeah I am totally a noob\" and laugh about it. Because people who are experienced and secure about their playstyle will take it as a joke. People just starting out? Not so much.\n\nIt's one thing for toxic smurfs to do it. It's another for the company itself to.\n\n##2. League of Legends is usually introduced to people via recommendation/curiosity. Embrace that.\nPeople usually know League exists because of how big a game it is. Trust me, anyone I ask who is remotely into gaming (and sometimes, not even) will know what League of Legends is. So naturally, knowing a huge thing exists, a lot of people will be reluctant to join the bandwagon. Those people are usually urged on by people they know to play, because it is multiplayer and it gives them something to do together while having fun. So, instead of pretending like the advertisements are what get people into League, let's make the advertisements compliment the main methods of people getting into it: seeing or hearing about it and wanting to learn more from curiosity. Make the advertisement informative, show the cool facets of the game and what it offers, even simplifying a bit so that people who haven't learned to read the fights can follow comfortably. Show some awesome eSports highlights (Anything from Faker), show off some awesome teamwork and wombos (Malphite/Yasuo), make a close-up of some cool skin animations (Eternum Nocturne ult, Elementalist Lux combo, Project Vayne motorcycle) and the different maps (HA, TT, SR, even Ascension). \n\nPeople will want to see what the game looks like, not some angry guy knocking over an entire table because he's supposed to be like Gnar. Show off the game, let them know your accomplishments in your game-designing skills and what people have done with it. Funny advertisements are not a good way to show off a game usually, because humor does not translate well across cultures. Show off this amazing, awesome game you've created in a minute or a minute and a half, make it short and sweet. Make people think \"wow, that was freaking awesome\" and maybe even watch it again to catch some of the fast-paced awesomeness they may have missed. And please for the love of god make the ads you put on Youtube videos 15 seconds or less. Nobody gives a flying f*ck about anything longer than that. I'm actually considering personally boycotting Listerine because of how much their shitty advertisements annoyed me for the past month.\n____________________________________________________\n\n## Super TL;DR: You guys were smart enough to make one of the longest lasting multiplayer games ever. You built an empire and you've managed to keep it well. You're smarter than this, act like it and get some real ads out there instead of this demoralizing content, even if your intentions were good. Thank you.","replies":[]}
