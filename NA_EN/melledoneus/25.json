His E is not meant to blow up entire teams, it&#039;s used to slow targets to land shurikens. Sure, it does damage to help in combos, but it&#039;s just plain stupid when a Zed who can&#039;t aim to save their lives uses the fabled W-E combo and takes off half your HP, just because you were unlucky enough to be in range.\n\nShift the damage from his E elsewhere. We&#039;re all tired of taking 600+ damage (give or take) from a slow.\n\nPS: This is just an idea. Put down your pitchforks, people.\n\nEDIT: To those people who are hinged on the numbers I'm providing, it's an rough estimate. Some days I've had Zed deal 700, others he deals 100. Regardless, instead of arguing semantics and exacts, don't forget that this isn't a place for pushing your beliefs onto others or trying to defend Zed, or attack him. Guy's got bigger things to worry about than everyone fighting over him.\n\nA thoughtful player named iDarkWind came up with a possible change to the ability itself with a pretty cool mechanic.\n> SHADOW SLASH: Zed spins his blades, dealing 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 (+45% Bonus AD) physical damage to nearby enemies and reducing Living Shadow's cooldown by 2 seconds for every enemy champion hit.

The only way he's doing full damage is against an armorless ADC that's already been shredded 6 times by Cleaver\nD) Everyone has base MR, Zed has no magic penetration at any point\nE) Numbers are fun.
