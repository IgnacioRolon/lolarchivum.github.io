I don't mind them wanting to make the game popular, but it wasn't tv shows & internet streams that made the game popular in the first place. It was because it was felt fair & balanced, and when some champion was noticeably under performing or clearly abusive, they quickly brought them into line; within a couple weeks, not several months, and it was where it counted in the champion kit to prevent them from drifting into that direction again. There were a few exceptions that took longer, but the point is riot didn't play favorites & they didn't drag their feet about it. This is primarily what kept it fun, that they payed attention to the community to see what was fair; and it's how they grew up so fast to begin with.\n\nAny old time gamer here can tell you, the toxicity of the community has significantly increased as they started trying to shove the game as a televised competitive sport. The 'strategic diversity' & 'counter-play' were blatant lies to calm the masses from long outstanding frustrating gameplay; looking at the numbers through out the patch notes shows it clearly. The favoritism for abusive champions getting noticeable compensation whenever they get any nerf, yet the more fair ones only get a slight positive tweak if any. Not to mention the repeated hand-waves for the game not going downhill; despite the obvious one sided balancing act and blind eye to the venomous parts of the population (tribunal was never updated & outright replaced by an inefficient bot). \n\nIn the past few years, I've hardly played 1/10th what I used to the year it came out. Tired of the game as a concept in general? Not really, I've still got a handful of games well over a decade old I still play for having good gameplay & stories. It's clearly not the game it used to be, whether another company had a hand in it or not, I'm unsure; but I'm betting, that if they don't get their act together to start fixing it with the community, it'll fall apart in humiliation.","replies":[{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2016-07-12T12:35:15.128+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":5,"body":"RIP season 4 when there was like 20 viable mid laners throughout the season including but not limited too fucking Soraka, Kayle (it was pretty cancer but at least she was a utility mage back then), Annie (as a common counterpick to Yasuo), Ziggs (who the hell sees him anymore), Syndra (look at Ziggs), and there was that one game when Millenium won with Morde Mid.\n\nAnd pretty much none of these guys except for Kayle has been played as a mid laner since (excluding POE's Syndra)","replies":[{"poster":"JunkÎ¿","date":"2016-07-12T15:53:31.830+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Implying playing agaisnt Soraka, Kayle, Annie or Syndra was fun.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-07-12T16:10:52.524+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'd prefer to lane against Soraka, Kayle, Annie and Syndra all at the same time than Zed.

Yea, people whine about Zed ulting straight to them and beating them up, but he has a window where he's screaming to the heavens \"I'M GOING TO KILL YOUR TEAMMATE NOW\", and that gives everyone a solid second to prepare to deal with him. It isn't like Katarina or Talon who just blink to you and delete your coding from the game. Everyone's whining about QSS when they can just use their kit tools to lock down Zed before he has a chance to combo and beef up his ult damage. Same thing with Fizz in the sense that there's some sort of \"thing\" that occurs before the assassination part that slows him down from that toxic pattern of dying before you can even say \"blink\".\n\nCompare this to Sona where, if she's strong, there's nothing you can do about it. You can't counter-play a play style based around passing around numbers from a distance all game, and her ult isn't the easiest to miss unless you're doing it from a decent range away or the enemy uses mobility options or high movement speed to dodge it. Since Sona's counter-play is low, they keep her in a comparatively weaker state than her peers and say \"Use items to scale into a decent champion! :D :D :D\". Apply this logic to everyone else with the same problem: Garen, Xin Zhao, Kayle, Nunu, so on and so forth.\n\nApplying all this to Sejuani: She doesn't really *die* when she finally gets items, she does aoe damage with aoe cc, and she's kinda hard to shake off.
