For the times I have displayed that attitude, I regret it because people (myself included) often forget that there are good people hard at work to make this game enjoyable for us in a time span far longer than one in which a normal game would sputter and die out.\r\n\r\nI want to dedicate this post to Meddler, the Gameplay Designer. He has the hardest job of having to deal with the grittiest aspect of the game that changes the most, and getting feedback from occasional jerkwads and looking at stats every so often to determine what the players are doing. Not to mention those darn Koreans for finding the most broken shit and warping the game as a result.\r\n\r\nI have placed this in Gameplay, my good moderators, because I want this in the most likely spot where Meddler will see it. Please don&#039;t remove it.\r\n\r\nI certainly do not detract from the good work of the other Rioters when I say this, but thank you for your hard work, Meddler.
