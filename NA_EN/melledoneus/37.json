is a very good time to fix some mistakes and make some good judgment calls on potential changes that have not been outright announced.\n\n{{champion:113}} EDIT: Personally I find Sej's W feeling unimpactful. But Sej mains have a right to say what she could get from this update, since they pointed out to me I'm focusing on the wrong things. I want to know what you Sej mains think she could use, assuming she will get changes.\n\n{{champion:14}} Do not mess him up like you did Vel. He&#039;s fine, he could just use some minor number tweaks depending on what the rest of the cast has.\n\n{{champion:98}} Even though I am heavily biased, we can all agree Shen needs another change, despite being a Warden. He isn&#039;t fulfilling his fantasy in a healthy way and his tools are so overpowered in the right hands that they are forced to have atrociously low impact except in a perfect world. And for fuck&#039;s sake his E is still buggy and is stupidly narrow for the huge cost of just casting the damn thing. Not to mention the timing of his abilities do not match each other. Could use some outright tweaks, but outright number buffs might be dangerous.\n\n{{item:3025}} Rework or remove this item. Hardly any tanks build it and Ezreal has become the most annoying piece of shit using it.\n\n{{item:3022}} Re-emphasize this item&#039;s defensive nature and repurpose it as an item for tanks/bruisers who rely on autos and get kited. I&#039;m sick of people like Yasuo building this and becoming an uninteractive mess of tanky, lifestealing destruction.\n\n{{item:3143}} Further explore items like Randuin&#039;s and make ways to negate crit in more items without making it too stat-checky.\n\n{{item:3075}} This item is only good against and on a few champions early and heavily falls off. Thornmail needs to become impactful.\n\n{{item:3068}} is too impactful as a first purchase on most tanks. It&#039;s crowding out most itemization, may need to be looked at.\n\n{{item:1054}} Buff this item or rework it. It sucks, it doesn&#039;t feel impactful, and is better on some tanks than others, yet is built by none of them. Doran&#039;s shield sucks and is a bigger waste of gold than building Rabadon&#039;s Deathcap on Darius.\n\n{{item:3056}} A long shot, could do something with this item somehow. Turrets are kind of obsolete right now.\n\nWe also need more CDR options, more magic resist options, and possibly more defense against %HP damage. The only way for tanks to be impactful right now is their burst damage. After the update (if Riot does it right) we&#039;ll see more wet noodle fights, less tank deletion (going both ways), a better laning phase for tanks, and in general more survivability in this FPS meta where you run in, die instantly, and wait to respawn while being rude to your teammates.\n\nOh, and a tank item that inflicts grievous wounds would be nice.

It's literally going to happen unless they change her for the better.\n\nWhat you need to understand about Cinderhulk Sej is that it was an extreme circumstance. Sejuani was a pretty strong champion before Cinder, she was beginning to see increased play and was even a fringe jungler in competitive. She was a very good champ before Cinderhulk. It was very obvious that Cinderhulk was going to be a huge benifit to her.\n\nCould this happen again now? Almost definitely no. Sejuani is currently very bad champion. Even with changes to her itemisation she'd struggle to get out of line. Even if you purposefully overbuffed her items to make her out of line you'd pull up other champs like Amumu, Gragas and Rammus with her. \n\n5.5 Sejuani could only exist because of the circumstances at the time, these no longer exist so there's really no indirect change you could make to pull her back up to this level.\n\n>And they are, whether you like it or not, since she counts as a Vanguard.\n\nShe's a Vanguard, sure but are we really going to make all Vanguards the same, should that be the goal? Riot in their reworks haven't said \"what makes this champion and Assassin/Mage/ADC\" they've said \"what makes them different from others in their role\".

This is due to her Q being ground targeted while Amumu's requires an enemy target, as well as her ult's range.\n\nTake the situation where there's a tank standing about 400 units in front of his team and blocking your engage. Sejuani has the option to go around them, Q beside them and throwing her ult past.

Amumu's super linear, you Q in, you ult, you E and you activate W, there's not really any thought in it or alternate ways to execute, there's merely the player playing Amumu's execution. Sejuani can use her Q to enter from different angles, her ult is a more interesting ability because of this and she can Q flash leading to her having more options than just 'hit a bandage'.","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2017-02-01T01:25:41.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"what i  meant by that is that the only thing they are good for or known for, is their ult.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-02-01T01:39:27.052+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you actually think that you don't know very much about Sejuani/Amumu/Malphite or tanks in general really. Given how rarely you play tanks I'm really not surprised.\n\nMalphite actually brings a lot of control outside of his ult, he has a spamable slow/speed boost which allows him to stick to his targets and apply his spamable AS slow which shuts out ADC damage almost entirely. It's not traditional control in the same way as someone like Naut or Alistar but it's still a very strong method of team wide damage mitigation.\n\nSejuani and Amumu are similar because of what they bring outside of their ult. Their abilities do fairly similar things, W for damage, Q for movement and lockdown. Their Es are somewhat different and it's what generally makes Sejuani a better champion, she just does an extra thing that Amumu can't without items.\n\nIf you think Sejuani's W and Q aren't powerful abilities you're out of you're mind, E isn't the worst thing ever either. I actually think W is close to Sejuani's ult in terms of power level, I've seen it tick for 1000 damage before.

If, for example, Sejuani charges into the backline, she should deal enough damage that she's a threat that cannot be ignored, so that her enemies don't just peel off of her and go for Sejuani's allies instead.\n\nWardens, however, should mostly be disruption threats because they stick close to allies.
