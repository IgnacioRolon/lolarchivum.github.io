I&#039;m fine with that, since I would only do that since it took so damn long before. Also I think duplicated bans is kind of a flawed idea but that&#039;s about it, it&#039;s an easily fixed issue and it&#039;s not particularly game-breaking.\n\nNow, onto the real issue.\n\nI see people complaining about the bans system like there&#039;s no tomorrow, and it&#039;s not even live yet! Good god, these people complain about things that haven&#039;t been tried and true yet. And I&#039;m legit so fed up, I&#039;m calling them out right here and right now.

When a ban from the enemy team is locked in, we should be able to see the champion who was banned immediately. This is ridiculous and will only cause problems. We wanted 10 bans FOR A REASON. \n\nWell, Mr. &#039;xWaters,&#039; let me explain something to you. The way the current bans system works is that you can&#039;t see the enemy bans. The strategic value in this new banning system is to ban a set of problematic champions to your team and its members, not to go back and forth to ban the FotM champions. There are several reasons why you are not allowed to see the enemy&#039;s bans:\n1. It would encourage you to use the precious 35 seconds of banning time to look at what the enemy bans, shifting your focus from what YOUR team finds problematic to you trying to be a strategic little dinker and getting nothing done.\n2. Your enemy&#039;s bans would influence what you pick, which would have a negative impact on people who are already quite indecisive or insecure about ranked. It would create a massive disadvantage for those people and thus result in either more dodges or more &quot;no bans.&quot;\n\nFor a guy with &#039;water&#039; in his name, your argument didn&#039;t hold much.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Janna X RubicK,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2yxfIxx5,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-19T20:54:31.777+0000)\n>\n> was it too hard to make one team baning 5 champions, and then the other team baning 5 champions?\n> \n> i&amp;#039;m legit trying to contain myself right now, because in master tier+ you didn&amp;#039;t give us 10 bans\n> \n> you legit gave us 6 bans as {{champion:117}} {{champion:427}}  will take 4 slots already in 100% of our games\n\nAlright, Janna X RubicK, our good master tier friend. You&#039;re wondering why the system isn&#039;t &quot;one team bans 5, the other team bans 5 champs.&quot; Well, let me tell you something that might put you at ease: \n#THAT&#039;S EXACTLY WHAT THE 10 BAN PHASE SYSTEM IS, EXCEPT THEY BAN AT THE SAME TIME.\n\nRiot gave you 10 bans, not 6. 2 champions don&#039;t take up 4 slots, because clearly 10-2= 8. Additionally, your problem champions, including Ivern, Lulu, Yasuo, Graves, Lucian, and BoRK itself have or are getting nerfs, so your ban slots are going to most likely get freed up. So stop complaining about non-existent problems.\n\nIf you can&#039;t read something as short as how the ban phase works, I don&#039;t recommend playing Yasuo or Jhin, seeing as how their passive tooltips are pretty long and might lose your interest.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=magewick,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1KsTEAv5,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-19T17:47:20.539+0000)\n>\n> With the new system, however, it is highly unlikely that all 10 must ban champions will get banned every game. There is no reason to change the way that bans work, just let both teams ban 1 champion at a time and decrease time per ban.\n\nAlright, magewick, my friend, I&#039;ve already explained this but allow me to go over it one more time. To reduce the whole &quot;permaban&quot; problem, Riot has nerfed some of the most powerful champions in the game to reduce that as much as possible. Also, I like the new collective ban system because it allows you to ban and get it out of the way. Usually teams already have a ban in mind and don&#039;t really communicate it much with one another unless they are duo. This allows ban phase to finish up quickly so your team can pick, because before it was a sluggish process that took for-f*cking-ever.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nWell, that pretty much wraps up my gripes. I know I&#039;ll get some flak for this, but whatever. I&#039;m tired of trash like this littering the front boards when half the crap is incorrect or just plain misleading uninformed garbage.

First of all lets assume that we have 3 people who are willing to play and competent at those 3 champs.  Now we can leave them up.  However if the enemy team bans two of them then suddenly they get one OP champ and we get none.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nReminder that I personally am not affected by these things and am neutral on the matter.

I just said she's not banned every single game, so Lulu will most of the time (unless you're exceptionally high ranked which the vast majority of the players aren't) not be double banned. It will happen more often than Urgot is double banned, but still not in every game like some people believe.
