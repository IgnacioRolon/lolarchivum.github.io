She reminded me of Samus, where she didn't feel the need to show off her body because her armor was proof enough that she was who she was. She reminded me of Riza Hawkeye from FMA:B, as she was a strong character in her own way without it feeling forced or corny. It's a nice touch, as many female characters in games are walking checklists rather than actually written to be actual people. Kayle was a great example of \"whoa, what a badass\" without so much of the emphasis on the \"ass\" portion, if you get what I'm saying here.\n\n#Bottom line: Don't pretend to be pro-women if you can't reflect that in your character design, RIOT!","replies":[]}
