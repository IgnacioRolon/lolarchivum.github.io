Shen, right? Nice to meet you!\n{{champion:98}} Congrats on the rework. \n{{champion:3}} Thanks!\n{{champion:98}} If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what&#039;d they give you? Anything you like?\n{{champion:3}} Yeah, they gave me really cool stuff. Like I can charge up a damage reduction shield and then have this ** huge AoE taunt**. And get this, it scales with my resistances!\n{{champion:98}} Oh. Sounds... neat.\n{{champion:3}} And they gave me this dash with this **huge hitbox that can&#039;t be interrupted by CC**, and it knocks up the person I hit!\n{{champion:98}} Oh, that&#039;s...cool...\n{{champion:3}} And I have a huge range dash to an ally that&#039;s so fast it might as well be a teleport! And I give them a huge damage reduction buff, and I knock up enemies in a huge radius and everything. And the best part is **it can&#039;t be interrupted by CC!**\n{{champion:98}} Wow, the cooldown on that must be huge.\n{{champion:3}} Yeah, it&#039;s a whole 160 seconds.  At least** it isn't the full 3 minutes**, right? Haha. Pretty long for an ultimate, though.\n{{champion:98}} ...\n{{champion:3}} So... uh... what are you here for?\n{{champion:98}} I&#039;m... uh... updating my stats.
