Thus, as a proponent of a formulation of our thoughts and a coagulated viewpoint surrounding said aspect, and not based around or directly associated with fact, an opinion cannot be concluded as correct or incorrect. When an opinion is stated to be correct or incorrect, it is impossible to see a statement like this as fact, since opinions are augmented and processed observations passed through a personal filter, thus making any statement surrounding opinions being wrong or right also opinions.\r\n\r\nShould an opinion that is &#039;unpopular,&#039; as a result become heavily supported by an audience, the unpopularity of said opinion is not seen as disproved, but merely perceived through a different personal lens. Therefore, if the 99% majority supports an opinion, said opinion can still be considered unpopular through opinionated observation, should popularity standards be set between 99 and 100. By setting alpha in this range, we can determine that, although quite slim, the opinion can still be considered popular, but must surpass that alpha value at the end of the curve.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you have deliberately squandered your time reading this elaborately constructed and overly convoluted labyrinth of text and hidden word meanings.

So if I say \"I like math because 1+1=3\", others have can not say about my opinion on liking or dislike something is wrong or right, but they can tell me that 1+1=2 and not 3.\n\nAlso, opinions can also be wrong if your opinion is expressed in the form of a statement, and if it directly contradicts proven truth. So if you say \"I believe 1+1=3\", then that opinion is definitely wrong, because 1+1=2 (though I must confess that \"1+1=2\" is not \"truth\" but rather it is a mathematically expression that outlines the fundamental of arithmetic addition; but for most people, it can be treated as a \"truth\").\n\nA lot of people just use \"opinions can't be wrong\" as an excuse to be as intellectually lazy or dishonest as possible, while hiding behind the supposed all-encompassing idea that 'because I can label anything I said as opinion, therefore I can't be wrong somewhere in any way'.","replies":[{"poster":"Pandeonor","date":"2018-08-06T10:25:07.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=jrcy694g,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-08-06T07:26:26.003+0000)\n> A lot of people just use &quot;opinions can&#x27;t be wrong&quot; as an excuse to be as intellectually lazy or dishonest as possible, while hiding behind the supposed all-encompassing idea that &#x27;because I can label anything I said as opinion, therefore I can&#x27;t be wrong somewhere in any way&#x27;.\n\n\nI think most _believe_ in something. For example here in League: \"My team is holding me back, that´s why I am Bronze\". More or less are opinions=believings.\n\nIt is really difficult or often impossible to disprove believings because the particular believing is related to the specific \"reality\" wich belongs to the owner of the believing. In his world is that what he believes _true_.\n\nSome may call this \"alternative facts\". Even many prefere to claim that there are no facts at all. If there are no facts all is really clear: everything wich can be believed can be true and therefore cannot be proven wrong.\n\n\nCalculated. Just discuss some things in macro-economy or perhaps politics. Always about believings, very rarely facts.

It told us that we have a xy kids per wife/couple. The method measureing it was to count babys born by women aged let´s  say 20-30, extrapolate it to all women and compare. As the women in 70´s and following years decided to get their babys later then before the base number (not the number in the end) wich was extrapolated was extremely shrinking. Biased. \n\nIn the Czech Republic the TFR was growing from 2000-2012 from 1.2 to 1.5 childs per woman (after it dropped before extremely; the \"way back\").\n\nThis is an \"opinion\" as usual happens in minds. You find the data wich supports this \"opinion\".\n\nThe \"better opinion\" can be read under the TFRp wich is a time and parity adjusted TFR wich trys to exclude the bias before. TFRp shows for 2000-2012 a dropping amount of babys per women by 1.9 (instead of 1.2 in year 2000) to 1.6 (2012). About 1 decade (or western 3 decades) the people were told falling or growing fertility rates wich were wrong. Opinions. Supported and spread by politicians, professors, media. Disprooved by sites as https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/vid/data/demographic-data-sheets/eureopean-demographic-data-sheet-2016/ or https://www.humanfertility.org/cgi-bin/country.php?country=DEUTNP&amp;tab=si  but never corrected.\n\n\nLeague is dying. TFR. Sky is red, green, yellow, universe is a nutshell.\n\nOpinions. \n\nAs long as someone calls his personal sight of anything and others follow him because they want to (or/and too ?).... well..... \n\nOpinions are mostly _decisions_ about how someone _wants_ to see the reality. Not totally surreal, but sometimes. Not wrong for sure, but sometimes.\n\nYou can see this in every of the \"League is dying\" discussions. It is impossible to pull any of the discussions to the edge of available data. That is the same for most economic discussions. It´s  just because as long as you don´t have really hard data you can have every possible opinion. In many cases you have none ex ante so you only can claim ex post \"told you so before\".... and you will be called an idiot by the ones wich were wrong.\n\nThe way life works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-08-06T07:27:29.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If unpopular opinion were right ww wouls not have the zero tolerance words.","replies":[]}]}
