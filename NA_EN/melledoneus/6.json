He's like a lot of champions, when the proper meta comes for him, he rises. But if you nerf him and if the meta changes, he'll disappear, like always","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-08-24T10:11:23.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lcs.\n\nTanks.\n\nThere can be only one.","replies":[]}]}
