I can&#039;t get over how badass, beastly, and overall powerful his roar sounds. When we get to updating champions like Volibear in a few years, I can&#039;t wait to see what they&#039;ll do with that beast.\r\n\r\nGreat job, SFX team!","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-01-28T00:17:30.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It shall forever trigger me that \"Primal Howl\" is a roar, and not a howl.
