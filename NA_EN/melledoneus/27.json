Shen&#039;s spirit sword is his only weapon. He&#039;s an idiot and leaves it lying around. Stand between Shen and the sword before going in to body block it, preventing Shen from using it. Do this every time and you are guaranteed success.\r\n\r\n2. When Shen is fighting you and a blue zone appears and he&#039;s inside it, use your empowered autos at that moment if you have any. Like any true video game boss, Shen will occasionally show a brief moment of weakness to attacks, and this is Shen&#039;s. Only auto attacks work, so do that and you will beat this unbalanced champion.\r\n\r\n3. When you push Shen to his turret, you have him on the ropes! You will be able to hit him hardest here. Dive him under his turret and make sure to waste no time walking anywhere but directly towards him. This ensures maximum efficiency when attacking him under turret, as you get to beat him. Limit your damage to auto attacks for maximum damage.\r\n\r\n4. Shen has tricky AI. Sometimes he will break the game and teleport to another place on the map. Do not waste time. When you see him teleporting, run to the place he is teleporting. If you react quick enough, you can catch the cowardly bastard and kill him.\r\n\r\n5. Shen has goons that he summons to fight you all across the map. Ignore these and focus on him, since they will despawn if Shen is defeated.\r\n\r\n6. When you are on a different part of the map, Shen will occasionally give one of his goons a shield. This means he&#039;s coming, so stick around the goon until he appears, then destroy him using steps 1-3.\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\nThaks for reading my guide to beating Shen.

You just need to open the right window, which is disguised. Do the following steps:\n\n1- Press Esc\n2- Press Leave Game\n\nNow this is important. Riot doesn't want you to open the console command, so they hide it and make you not want to use it with fake messages like \"your teammates need you\" \"you might be penalized\" and putting a wait timer. IGNORE ALL THAT. It's just there to prevent regular players from using it, while making it easy for their developers to do so.\n\n3- Click on leave the game once the timer runs out\n4- There will be a reconect button. Do not click that. The console commands only work once this has turned grey.\n\nSide notes:\nIt usually takes 10-30 minutes to be able to open the console command menu. Don't worry. Like in Borderlands, your progress is automatically saved once you leave.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-11-07T20:35:37.736+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried this, but I only was able to get infinite mana.
