(Rather lengthy post, you were warned)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":90,"down_votes":22,"body":"[](https://static.lolwallpapers.net/2016/01/Warlord-Shen.jpg)\nMany people have been asking me why Shen is much weaker than before. I didn&#039;t know what they were talking about before I binge played him like I usually do, and I realized the issues he has with his kit that make him feel like he possesses much less strength than before. He&#039;s not underpowered, he actually has very good potential to be a god tier top laner with his new mechanics, but the actual execution of these tools is extremely awkward.\n____________________________________\n#**1. Shen&#039;s spirit blade feels more like an anchor than a tool for battle.**\n___________________________________\nThis is because the positioning of the sword is impossible to control without using your Q or your ultimate. The tether distance is way too far to be smooth, and actually is counter-intuitive to its purpose of positioning it right. Shen players like to have the advantage of being able to utilize their E however they wish, because it&#039;s basic and easy to use. A linear skillshot that can move through units and walls. But the addition of another element makes it a bit foreign, and changes up the play style quite a bit. \n\nNot only is the tether range too far, but the speed of the sword is too slow to be utilized efficiently. Opponents see that you used your Q the moment you press the button, but the sword itself can take up to 3 seconds just to get to you. Not to mention that the buff on your Q doesn&#039;t occur until your sword hits your model, opponents can easily back off and wait out your failed engage before retaliating and punishing you for trying. \n\n#**Possible solutions**\n\nIt&#039;s a matter of utility and speed. **Either decrease the tether range dramatically, or sharply increase the missile speed of the spirit blade. ** This will decrease the arrival time of a distant spirit blade, making it a threat even from so far away. It also reduces the &quot;delayed utility&quot; feeling you get when playing Shen, as his blade will be more reliable in lane and during trades. There is currently no utility or counterplay associated with Shen having his blade be far away from himself. Your opponent would not know what is in the fog of war, how close your blade is, and there is no strategic value to have a blade be a Nocturne ult&#039;s worth of distance away from your lane. It&#039;s just a mechanic that makes spamming his Q all the more viable, which is not something a strategic dueling tank like Shen should do. He is meant to pick his fights carefully, positioning and pulling off risky engages in order to gain the upper hand on his opponents. Good players would counter this by relying on side stepping his E (which is relatively easy to do), and watching Shen&#039;s movements to watch for any behavioral cues.\n\nAnother possible solution, a rather radical one in itself, is to **allow Shen to reposition his sword at will without utilizing his Q**. This would clear up any inconsistencies and clunkiness associated with his sword&#039;s distance, but would come at the price of clarity and simplicity. This idea has been entertained by many, but while it seems logical it would make Shen feel too much like Orianna, in my opinion.\n____________________________________\n#**2. Twilight Assault (Q) feels extremely clunky and unrewarding for a skirmishing and trading tool.**\n______________________________________\nThis is attributed to two things. First, Shen&#039;s Q auto attack buff doesn&#039;t start until the moment his blade reaches him. Second: the auto attacks themselves take too long to proc and are easy to retreat from. When playing Shen in the top lane, you usually don&#039;t have the tools to fight some of the more powerful top laners like {{champion:41}} or {{champion:62}}. Both can easily retreat should they suspect something, and can punish heavily for walking away from a failed engage. Shen theoretically has the tools to counter this, but they are not very reliable.\n\nMany a time, Shen players have engaged while pulling in the blade through their opponent. However, by the time the blade has reached them, the opponent is already ahead of the Shen player and/or out of the taunt duration. While I do agree that Shen needs to be melee in order to give him ways to be countered, I feel like the slow on his Q isn&#039;t as punishing as it should, given the qualifications needed to actually pull it off. It takes careful positioning, planning, and outright reaction time in order to get a good engage with the Q, but it only takes a simple side step from your opponent or a 50 unit retreat in order to negate all that effort.\n\n#**Possible Solutions**\nThe best way to make Shen&#039;s Q feel less clunky and more rewarding lies in the reward for landing the Q on an opponent and the actual method of using it. **Either increase the slow&#039;s duration and/or strength for pulling a spirit blade through an opponent or let the auto attack buffs prematurely activate.** Increasing the duration of the slow could help deal with the slew of utility and escape tools top laners can have, inhibiting their movement further or for longer gives Shen a bigger window to force a fight to be in his favor, to reward good play and careful planning. This will separate the success rates between good Shens and great Shens. Should the latter be implemented, the actual blade&#039;s positioning could be used as a complimentary slow in exchange for the extra damage. For example, the tooltip could be read as follows:\n>Should the Spirit blade not reach Shen within .75 seconds, Shen&#039;s next three attacks are empowered anyway.\n\nThis would not only create some breathing room for Shen players, but give them options to actually think about. &quot;Should I wait for my blade to pass through for extra damage or should I use my attacks now in order to avoid the risk of my opponent getting away unscathed?&quot; This is the buff that could make Shen enter competitive play as a top laner again, as his versatility and strengths are exclusive against immobile, auto-attack oriented top laners. This could broaden the spectrum a bit, making Shen less of a super niche pick and more of a champion that can be played to complement his team&#039;s strengths while utilizing his own. Against champions like {{champion:92}}  and {{champion:58}}, who can simply CC Shen and walk away once they realize he&#039;s going in, Shen can actually have the tools to hold his own against lanes with good disengage. Albeit they will be just as difficult as ever, but not impossible.\n____________________________________\n#**3. Spirit&#039;s Refuge (W) is extremely powerful on its own, but nearly impossible to utilize correctly.**\n____________________________________\nThis ties back to Shen&#039;s spirit blade feeling more like an anchor than an actual pillar of strength. The positioning on Shen&#039;s W is extremely awkward, as the blade is almost always stationary when not being dragged around with Shen&#039;s Q. However, it also is attributed to the fact that using it punishes Shen very hard, even if he does use it at a very crucial moment. The massive cooldown of 18 seconds (12 when maxed out) is a good way to inhibit Shen&#039;s ability to spam it (inb4 URF mode Shen becoming Jax during the dodge era), but for a defensive tool it is extremely taxing to use. You lose 40 energy, which doesn&#039;t seem like much by itself, but when considering that the cooldown itself doesn&#039;t go down by much makes you think that the effect would last longer than 1.75 seconds when maxed out. The cooldown is too high, the energy cost isn&#039;t necessary because it&#039;s already inhibited by the cooldown, and for what it takes to position it right in the heat of battle, it doesn&#039;t offer much.\n\n#**Possible Solutions**\nShen&#039;s problems with his W lie in the lackluster reward for what is given in return. There is no reason to level up Spirit Refuge (W) at the moment because max level only gives you a cooldown reduction of 6 seconds. It doesn&#039;t feel like there is a reason to level it up even in the most defensive playstyle. **Remove the unnecessary energy cost, lower its cooldown, or increase the protective zone duration per ability level.** Removing the energy cost would only make sense, since as mentioned before, the cooldown is enough to gate it. An energy cost is a joke and serves no real purpose but to make awkward situations where you&#039;re 40 energy short for an ability. Should the energy cost stay, the cooldown of the actual ability should be reduced per level, perhaps at a decent 8 seconds when maxed out. This would make his W actually feel involved, and less like an ability to use then forget about. Additionally, the energy cost would actually make sense. The final of the three would be, in my opinion, the most logical. The protective zone, even at max rank, feels like a poor excuse of a defensive ability, since it doesn&#039;t feel like a tide-turning ability late game as it is. Increasing the duration to something reasonable late game, say to a decent 2.5-3 seconds (Ok, 3 seconds seems a bit excessive, but you get my point) would be better.)\n\nAnother solution that seems a bit more farfetched could be to **add a health shield to the protective zone exclusively for allies.** The original issue I found with this was that Shen would abuse the crap out of the extra health shield in lane, and be unkillable. The solution is to give it only to allies. This way, for the measly 1.75 second dodge zone, you can protect your team from AoE abilities and spells while inside the zone as well. It&#039;d feel more like a &quot;Spirit&#039;s Refuge&quot; rather than a &quot;Spirit&#039;s Bullet Time Zone.&quot; However, this change might actually break Shen, so we never know.\n\n______________________________\n\n**_Thank you for reading. I know this post was a little on the lengthy side, but I just wanted to express my views on the new Shen rework and possible suggestions that could be implemented to make his gameplay feel better.

The point where Shen is likely to get the most mileage out of it is during a 3-5 person taunt (in terms of most damage dodged).\n\nBut, his W is based on his Q location. \"Okay, so Shen needs to taunt, then pull the sword with his Q, and *then* he can use his W.\" But this, then, forces him into a situation where he's heavily combo reliant. In turn, this makes it difficult to use his tools individually. Say you're losing a fight, running from the enemy team. \"Oh, I want to protect my carry. I'll use W. OH WAIT I have to Q first to move it over to me.\" And that's assuming that you're sticking with your carry and not trying to, you know, peel. Which is what you're supposed to do.\n\nHe spams his Q for any amount of damage output, plus moving his sword; but I don't know how many times I was in a fight and Yi or Jax or Riven jumps into the fight and I hit W... and nothing happened.... because my Q was on CD and it didn't move the W to me. part of that is just getting used to the kit, but overall his kit is less reactive than before.\n\nAnd again, the AoE dodge makes him feel like he should be protecting his carries, but his Taunt wants to go peel/CC priority targets.\n\nNot to mention the number of times an enemy has barely gotten away because I no longer have any range... I'm willing to part with that, though if the rest of his kit actually felt cohesive.\n\n\nAs for your suggestions; instead of speeding up his Q speed, I'd rather it have a flat \"time to Shen.\" i.e, Shen summons his spirit blade, traveling to him over 1.5 seconds\" or something. The issue I would see with speeding it up is, honestly, at short range (mostly in laning phase) I find it pretty easy to hit with it because of how fast it already is. This would slow it down at short ranges, but again I don't have much problem with hitting it as it is. But if it were far away, it'd move faster in order to get to him in the same amount of time. it would also make the \"time to Shen\" standardized which would let him (and his opponent) try to time and feel out the delay. I admit this would make it easier to walk away, so I'd suggest upping the Slow speed in this case.","replies":[{"poster":"Drathel","date":"2016-02-06T20:03:11.785+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> As for your suggestions; instead of speeding up his Q speed, I'd rather it have a flat \"time to Shen.\" i.e, Shen summons his spirit blade, traveling to him over 1.5 seconds\" or something. \n\nInstead of it having a set travel time, it could be \"Spirit Blade returns to Shen within 1.5 seconds\" so if it is closer, you wouldn't have to wait 1.5 sec but if its far away, it will travel faster to make it there in time.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-02-06T20:13:41.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very good suggestion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SnackieCakes","date":"2016-02-06T18:37:58.170+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Shen's new abilities and passive, but I don't like the sword at all.

While being a relative cheap item to rush, complain about Shen outtrading you while you rush AD. While Shen rushes a Sunfire Cape, boosting his damage/sustain/tankyness, and then wonder why you lost. I agree that the ability was too easy to use, but be mindful of its extremely short range and that its use for poking will only work in lane.

The slow is too insignificant for the difficulty of actually landing the blade on a enemy champ, it should slow them regardless with a smaller slow so you can at least use it to retreat. I like the enhanced damage for Twilight Assault, but I wish the final strike had a small range increase. The thing that bothers me the most about this skill is, that is not on demand like his passive. Does not reset auto attacks, has a ap scaling while Shen can't build ap. I'm not suggesting that it should scale with health or armor, that would break it. Shen needs something that makes him stick long enough to champs to do his auto attacks, so I suggest moving the slow to his auto attacks if the blade is pulled through an enemy and greatly enhancing it.\n_\n\n\n\n\n**Feint\tCOST: 50 ENERGY CD: 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5**\n\t\nACTIVE: Shen shields himself for up to 3 seconds.\nSHIELD: 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 60% AP)\n\n_Simple on demand shield, boring but effective._\n\n**Spirit's Refuge\tCOST: 40 ENERGY CD: 18 / 16.5 / 15 / 13.5 / 12**\n\nACTIVE: Shen primes his Spirit Blade for 2 seconds, causing it to project a protective zone around it for 1.75 seconds if he or an allied champion move nearby, granting allies in the zone 100% dodge chance.\n\n_I like it, but also hate it. Its very hard to keep track of the blade location in a teamfight, and I feel it is only good against auto reliant champs like Yi (duh). The cost is super low, and the CD is super high. Effectively removing another short cooldown ability on Shen, while giving him a minuscule window of opportunity against certain champs. I'd rather the cost and CD were changed a bit, so his ability costs more but has less CD because of it. Maybe allies could also benefit from Ki Barriers shield while inside the field, so AOE is mitigated a little (since it won't help against autos)._\n\n\n\n\n\n**Shadow Dash RANGE: 600 COST: 100 / 95 / 90 / 85 / 80 ENERGY CD: 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 / 8**\n\nACTIVE: Shen dashes in the target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemy champions he hits, Taunt icon taunting them for 1.5 seconds and restoring 40 energy per target hit.\n\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 50% AP)\n\nTaunted opponents deal half damage to Shen with their basic attacks.\n\n_The only bad thing about this ability was the AP scaling, yet that was only a minor gripe._\n\n**Shadow Dash \tRANGE: 600 COST: 180 ENERGY CD: 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 / 10**\n\nPASSIVE: Shadow Dash's and Twilight Assault's damage recovers 30 / 35 / 40 energy.\n\nACTIVE: Shen dashes in the target direction, dealing physical damage to all enemy champions he hits and Taunt icon taunting them for 1.5 seconds.\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 12% bonus health)\n\n_Lets compare the two. _\n\nOld dash costs 50% to 40% energy to cast but replenishes 20% energy per champ hit. \nOld dash dealt a small amount of magic damage.\nOld dash halves damage taken from auto's.\nOld dash scales with ap.\n\nNew dash costs 45% energy across the board and replenishes 10% energy at max rank.\nNew dash deals physical damage.\nNew dash scales with hp dealing up to 240 extra aoe damage if you have 2000 bonus health.\nNew dash has a longer CD.\n\nConclusion:\nIts nerfed, hard. Shen's taunt was never about dealing damage, I always felt guilty stealing a kill when all I meant to do was taunt that champ for my team. It replenishes only half the energy the old taunt did, though that doesn't bother me as much. The cost increase hurts especially when you miss it more so than old Shen, simply because double energy pool = not double energy regen. So why, why is his signature taunt nerfed in cooldown while he is full melee now. Extra damage does not make up for the fact that it does nothing to enhance his tanking, mobility and utility. Damage is the last stat that Shadow Dash needs, if anything it should be removed and his CD should be reduced. Allowing a good Shen to taunt multiple times and a bad Shen to run out of energy in a heartbeat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Stand United\tRANGE: Global CD: 180 / 160 / 120**\n\nACTIVE: Shen channels for 3 seconds, granting the target allied champion a  shield that lasts up to 5 seconds.\n\nSHIELD: 250 / 550 / 850 (+ 135% AP)\n\nIf the channel completes successfully, Shen blinks to his target, placing himself between them and the nearest visible enemy champion.\n\n_Always fellt weak at level 1, I was hoping a cooldown reduction if the target is killed before the channel ends. It has a really strong ap scaling, while Shen can't build ap._\n\n**Stand United\tRANGE: Global CD: 180 / 150 / 120**\n\nACTIVE: Shen channels for 3 seconds, granting the target allied champion an absorption shield that lasts up to 5 seconds.\n\nSHIELD: 250 / 550 / 850 (+ 130% AP)\n\nUpon completing the channel, Shen and his Spirit Blade Stand United Shield blink to the ally's location.\n\n_They nerfed the ap scaling, lol. Though I'd rather see it go for a halved cooldown if the target expires before channeling ends, or the ability to activate W on the target during channeling. _\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Now in case you were wondering:**\n\n**Old Shen stats**\nHealth\t2016 at 18\t\nHP5\t        17.7 at 18\t\nEnergy\t200 at 18      \nEregen    50 at 18\t        \nAttack Range\t        125 at 18\nAttack Damage\t117.5 at 18\nAttack Speed\t        1.03 at 18\nArmor\t93.7 at 18\t\nMagic Resist\t        53.4 at 18\nMovement\t        335 at 18\n\n**New Shen stats**\nHEALTH\t                540 – 1781\t\nHEALTH REGEN\t10.0 – 22.8\t\nENERGY\t                400\t                \nENERGY REGEN\t50\t               \nMELEE\t                125\t                \nATTACK DAMAGE\t60 – 111\nATTACK SPEED [*]\t0.651 (+0% – 34.0%) (0,986 at 18)\nARMOR\t                25.0 – 69.2\nMAGIC RES.\t        32.1 – 53.4\nMOV.

Your object/stone will be pulled with you at your rope's maximum range xP\nThat's how the sword should work imo :p\n\nI also feel like the sword should be attached to shen while his Q is active.

This gives Shen some long range utility as he can slow more reliably and making E more easy to land in the process. This will help him a big deal against many matchups where he has a range disadvantage. He's a tank, not a juggernaut, so he should be able to get to his opponents with tools other than his dash. \n\nIt also solves the problem of it being an anchor for Shen.  Since the sword will no longer snap to Shen, it makes sense to give him the Q buff when he casts it. The sword won't be getting to him anyways. \n\nBeing able to move the sword to somewhere other than your position also helps with using W. You could send it toward the enemy before taunting to prep the dodge field. You can also help allies significantly easier as you don't have to get to their position with Shen. Just send the sword and press W. Boom. Carry Saved... ideally.\n\nShen maintains individuality and uniqueness as he will be the only champion in game to have a moving, detached entity the whole game.
