You actually have to work to get your real tankiness dont you think? He has to work like gnar while most of tanks have their inate tankiness and they can just build straight damage and melt your backline with a gauntlet or trinity.\n\nAlso, he never been oppressive since his rework, good news. The only reason he might become ''OP'' is his global ultimate since next patch riot want to nerf TP summ spell channeling to 4,5 sec if you didnt know already =).
