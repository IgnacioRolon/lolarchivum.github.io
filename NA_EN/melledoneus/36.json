Here&#039;s where this thread comes in: I analyzed and broke down each and every matchup and provided counterpicks and countermeasures to counter the influence of these champions. Here we go.\n________________________\n{{champion:92}} A staple of every player&#039;s complaints, Riven boasts incredibly high damage outputs, being lethal even at level 1. Her mobility, immense damage output, and low cooldowns make her a horror to face off against. But she&#039;s not invincible.\n#Counterplay \nThe main thing you have to remember when fighting Riven is that _she can and will kill you_. But that&#039;s her greatest weakness: her feast or famine playstyle. If you have any respectable damage from your top laner or jungler, utilize it to take down Riven early so that you can gain level advantages on her. Make sure to coordinate with your team to warn them about when Riven is missing, as she can snowball off of just 1 kill. If you do not have any respectable damage from your jungler or top laner, and your mid laner is pre-occupied, play the long game.\n\nWhen playing the long game, you have to be smarter than the Riven player. You can afford to last hit away from Riven as long as you have some way to hinder her mobility enough to force her to back off. Riven players generally are very aggressive, using her Q&#039;s relatively short cooldown (for what it does, anyway) to tear through everything in their path in order to get harass on you. A good way to abuse this is to bait Riven into attacking you, backing off, and she will have torn though a minion wave and pushed harder, meaning that you can easily freeze the wave and force her to lose farm or risk getting ganked.\n\nIf you had an &quot;oops&quot; moment during laning phase, taking down Riven is just like taking down Katarina: wait until she goes in, then lock her down. Focus her hard and she will be obliterated. While tanks may generally lose against Riven in lane, they prove to be the best line of defense against her later on. Make sure you don&#039;t create openings for her to go in and deal damage, and position your team defensively so that Riven cannot reach your carries without wallowing through the rest of your team.\n\n#Counterpicks\nChampions with stronger dueling such as {{champion:78}} and {{champion:266}} can really screw up a Riven if they play their lane right. Also, champions who can completely negate Riven&#039;s all-in such as {{champion:31}} and {{champion:86}} prove to be nightmares for her, as silences and CC make her absolutely useless. Paired up with this damage, Riven is sure to have difficulty with lanes like these, and may or may not rage quit. 76% of the time, they do.\n\n________________________\n\n{{champion:105}} The mid laner terror as he is, Fizz is an extremely mobile champion that deals terrifying amounts of damage even early on, and can turn 1 kill into a won lane. But even he has his flaws.\n\n#Counterplay\nDuring the laning phase, keep your distance and try to farm. If you have any ranged harass you can nail Fizz with, be sure to pressure him by using it, while managing resources. Make sure you stay away from Fizz&#039;s melee range as his W&#039;s DoT is extremely detrimental to your lane, especially if you are low health to begin with. Avoid his harass with Q by staying out of range, and if you have any mobility you can bait it, dodge his all-in, and hit back strategically, finding a way around his E. His E has a relatively high cooldown early on, so punish him hard when it&#039;s down.\n\nShould you have a jungler gank, most of the time accept the fact you won&#039;t kill Fizz. Sometimes ganks are there to expend resources of the mid laner to make the lane easier to deal with. Should your jungler put pressure on the lane, Fizz will start having to expend lots of his mana to use his E to escape. Eventually he&#039;ll be forced to back or die, and from there you can get a lead by farming up.\n\nMid-late game, keep extensive map vision a priority. A surprise ult from Fizz can disorient most teams, and destroy any squishy carry. Additionally, have your carries keep their distance so that Fizz doesn&#039;t have an opening to go in on. Should he dive the carry, fall back and eliminate him. ADCs like {{champion:51}} are nightmares for Fizz later on because her dash and long range make it nearly impossible for Fizz to reach her.\n\n#Counterpicks\nPeople that can straight up duel Fizz and mitigate his damage can deal with him easily. {{champion:131}} and {{champion:82}} are two prime candidates for those lanes where Fizz can&#039;t do much but farm and pray he doesn&#039;t die. {{champion:13}} and {{champion:84}} are examples of champions that can easily avoid Fizz&#039;s all-in and strike back harder. Once Fizz&#039;s cooldowns are used up, all he can do is walk and auto attack.\n____________________\n\n{{champion:23}} The infamous strong-armed champion that makes us all wonder what Riot was thinking, Tryndamere is a menace in lane with his critical strikes and incredible mobility, sometimes he needs more than 5 seconds to do his job.\n\n#Counterplay\nTryndamere is a strange one. He will try to auto attack minions early on, then proceed to jump onto you and crit you to death. That&#039;s never fun. However, while it is annoying to deal with, you can use it to your advantage. Similar to Riven, he will push very fast, since his passive works against him in that regard. Let the lane push out, do your best to freeze the lane, and watch him grow bored and roam. Once he does roam, coordinate with your team to take him down.\n\nShould Tryndamere be up against somebody with good dueling potential, you can bet there&#039;s a lane you can win. Don&#039;t extend your stay until 6, you need to shut down Tryndamere before he ever gets his ultimate. It&#039;s just easier that way. Juggernauts and bruisers can deal with Tryndamere&#039;s all-in with CC, heavy damaging abilities, or straight up auto attacks. You can easily keep your distance from him if you know how to position yourself behind minions and respect his E&#039;s range. Giving him free harass on you will just help him with the lane with his Q&#039;s heal.\n\nLater on in the game, Tryndamere becomes very difficult to deal with. He will split push all game, then proceed to destroy your carries by jumping onto them through your entire team. Coordinate with your team to utilize slows and other soft CC that can slow Tryndamere&#039;s advance to a crawl, then retaliate. When his E is back up, make sure to use your hard CC then in order to stop his escape. Should he advance with his team, either pressure the back line with AoE or presence, and fall back to deal with Tryndamere effectively. Hard CC is the best way to stop a raging Tryndamere.\n\n#Counterpicks\nChampions like {{champion:24}} and {{champion:75}} who can impair Tryndamere&#039;s ability to deal damage, then retaliate with immense damage themselves are valuable against him. Wither and Counter-Strike are two of Tryndamere&#039;s worst nightmares, as it affects his ability to deal damage in lane. Juggernauts like {{champion:86}} and {{champion:122}} can hold a lane against this rager, and maybe even end a fight gone wrong with a timely execute. Darius in particular has a good pressure tool on Tryndamere with his bleed, as even after Tryndamere escapes the bleed can kill him.  Champions that can make his laning phase hell like ~~Satan~~{{champion:17}} and {{champion:58}} are also very effective against him. To deal with his split pushing, people who can split push harder like {{champion:75}} or {{champion:48}} can counteract his presence.\n_________________________________________\n{{champion:238}} is a champion that many mid laners have had the misfortune to deal with. Sporting a combination of long range poke, AoE burst, and a pair of executes that synergize with each other, it's no wonder people have trouble dealing with this mobile shadow ninja. But we can shed some light on that.\n\n#Counterplay\nZed is a champion who relies on his shadows to deal heavy damage to targets. While this may not be news, it can be difficult to deal with his constant harass with his energy-based resources that are seemingly limitless. Dealing with Zed is all about windows of time and opportunity. Did Zed throw a shuriken just now? Harass him, he has no ranged projectiles. Did he just expend a full combo to clear the wave and/or try to kill you? No matter, his only pre-6 mobility is down. You have to abuse his cooldowns to their full extent, and if you dodge his poke you can deal with him by harassing him hard. \n\nZed's abilities focus mainly on him landing them. While it may seem difficult to dodge things like his W-E, you can always do what most immobile mages do to deal with him: hide behind minions. His shurikens will hurt a lot less if it went through a minion or two beforehand, and if he uses a full combo in your minion wave he'll just have pushed extremely hard, forcing him to back off or risk getting ganked. Also, if you dodge Zed's abilities, you have a good 10-15 seconds to punish him, as his energy bar is limited and runs out quickly. He is melee, but be wary of his shurikens. Moving erratically and strategically is key in this matchup. Otherwise you'll play into his strengths.\n\nLater on, Zed becomes a menace as he will not even need his ultimate to kill squishies anymore. One way to counter this is to keep the carries far into the back line, so as to force Zed to think twice before going through your team. Should he use his ultimate (this also applies in lane), aim all your skillshots on the opposite side of where he approached from. If you land any hard CC on him, or even a silence, Zed's whole assassination will have backfired. It's easy pickings from that point. Even if you don't kill him, you will force him to back off early, but be wary of this as he can still use his shadows to harass from long range with his abilities.\n\nAnother way to mitigate Zed's damage in general is to fake him out. This applies to most skillshots with a cast animation. If you see a good Zed throw out his shadow, he will try to slowroll the skillshot in order to wait for you to panic and use your mobility or play into his hands. Instead, you should walk one direction, and starting moving completely randomly. Once you see him casting his shuriken, walk in the complete opposite direction of where you were, preferably diagonally away so that you can dodge it easier.\n\n#Counterpicks\nChampions that can shut down a Zed are strong picks that can mitigate his harass and hit him back twofold. {{champion:131}} and {{champion:245}} are extremely good at this, because their array of targeted damage, mobility, and shields grant them the ability to make Zed extremely underwhelming. Ekko in particular can just press R to counter Zed's entire all-in combo. Champions that can easily duel a Zed like {{champion:105}} and {{champion:90}} can make his life difficult. Fizz can avoid Zed's harass constantly with his E (troll pole, for reference), and can avoid the detonation damage of Zed's ultimate while launching a counter attack. The anchored points of Zed's mobility also make it easy for Fizz to have a target for his ultimate, and he can easily force Zed to blow his own should he get the fish on him. Malzahar in particular can keep up even, if not stronger harass and pushing power against a Zed, and his level 6 power spike is so strong that it dwarfs Zed's level 6 strength in comparison. Zed with all his mobility cannot avoid Malzahar's Nether Grasp (R), and as squishy as he is will melt under the damage quickly.\n\nOther champions include those that can outright outsustain and tank through the laning phase and the game, such as {{champion:31}} and {{champion:39}}. Cho'gath in particular stacks so much health that Zed has trouble killing him to begin with, and his incredible sustain in lane with his passive and ultimate allow his harass to go nearly unpunished. Irelia has very decent sustain, and while not usually a mid lane pick, can prove to be an issue to the Master of Shadows throughout the game. Should Zed deal even a sliver of damage to Irelia, she can use her Equilibrium Strike (E) in order to get a heavy 2 second stun on Zed, rendering his entire window of strength useless.\n__________________________________________\n{{champion:114}} The Queen of Deleting, Fiora is a very menacing champion to deal with. Armed with an array of utility tools and true damage that bypasses even the tankiest champions&#039; defenses, Fiora is truly something difficult to deal with. But we&#039;re determined to let you know how to beat her.\n\n#Counterplay\nA link to a guide to deal with Fiora is posted here: https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-perform-a-DDoS-attack\n\nOther than that, you can find a deity to believe in, and pray to them that this Fiora be extremely bad.\n\n#Counterpicks\nA better {{champion:114}}\n\n___________________________________________\n\n\nFeel free to post your own guides down here!

So while her skills aren't updated it's a tad common sense what you are saying... so... yeah.... there's that.\n\nChampions that used to counter old Fiora are not nearly as effective now.\n\nFor example {{champion:54}} used to be a hard counter because he could just stack a lot of armor while outdueling Fiora with his attack speed slow. He can still potentially deal with the new Fiora, but building armor against her is not as effective due to her true damage. Attack speed slows do very little against her because of Fiora having lots of auto attack resets and also because a big part of her damage comes from her passive. Also, Fiora can block Malphite's ult with Riposte. \n\nOh there is also {{item:3075}}. Before, you could easily beat Fiora by just picking any tanky champion and then building this item. Fiora would kill herself if she tried to duel you and her damage would be reduced a lot due to the armor. Nowadays, don't even think of purchasing Thornmail against Fiora. Not only this item does mediocre damage now and is only worth on armor stacking tanks, but Fiora laughs at this item's armor because she has true damage.","replies":[{"poster":"MintChipHomieLix","date":"2016-01-31T23:50:45.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"So what about the other 80% of information?

Jax's E isn't anything against her Q, and she can Riposte it. Not to mention that champions that used to counter her were burly and could drag out fights to the point of her losing them, but now her passive allows her to not only fight bruisers and tanks, but assassinate them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2016-02-01T22:59:21.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Melledoneus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yJQenGUY,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-01-31T21:55:38.679+0000)\n>\n> Well, LoL counters isn't updated for Fiora.

Why list Mordekaiser and Akali as counters(Akali especially isn't), when there are actually stronger and viable option on the table like Zed, Leblanc, Orianna, Lissandra and Ahri to name a few.\n\nHow is Caitlyn actually a viable pick later on against him? She has 1 dash on average to long cooldown, he has 2, one of which makes him untargetable every 4.8s at 40%cdr. And you're telling me this champion that's specifically designed to slip past your peeling teammates to get to the back line, has a rather hard time against an immobile and burstless ADC. Viable ADCs against him, and actually quite strong as well, are Lucian, Graves, Vayne and Corki to name a few. They have self-peel, great damage/poke/steroids. A Caitlyn is a free meal for a Fizz; catch her down bot lane farming solo, and murder her ass.\n\nYou're talking about Riven, telling players they have to be smarter than her when playing against her. You are telling me, people who have trouble playing against a freaking Riven, have the knowledge to freeze and generally manipulate waves? And you're expecting that from them? I personally have no problem laning against any Riven but I can't manipulate a wave even if my life was depended on it.\n\nI could go on and on about this whole thing, but fuck that. Bye.","replies":[{"poster":"NecromanciCat","date":"2016-01-31T23:26:26.285+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"I absolutely love seeing people talk down to someone in Bronze, especially when that person is **low silver** --which, just so you know, might as well be high bronze. Get real.\n\nNow, your suggested counters to Fizz are awful, here's why:\n\n**Zed**: His ult can be negated easily by anything that makes someone invulnerable. Guess what Fizz can do.\n**Leblanc**: All of her damage can be negated by dodging her W-Q-R-E combo. Guess what Fizz can do.\n**Orianna**: She loses to high burst. Guess what Fizz can do.\n**Lissandra**: Interesting you should say that, because looking at your match history, you actually lost as Liss vs a Fizz. She's too easy to telegraph to counter Fizz.\n**Ahri**: If you dodge her charm, she can't land her Q for both ways, and she's vulnerable to high burst. Guess what Fizz can do.\n\n**Mordekaiser** is hands down the strongest counter to Fizz. Fizz wants to fight, Morde takes less damage the longer he fights. His shield negates burst, Fizz is only burst.\n\nNow, your proposed ADCs Vs Fizz, they're also wrong:\n\n**Lucian**: Low range, short-range dash, damage coming mostly from ability-weaved-autos. Lucian dashes, now he has no mobility. Fizz ults because he's close, and that's that.\n**Graves**: Abysmal range, short-range dash with slight defense buff, vision-reducing smoke screen, _all skillshots_. Why would you even suggest this? Fizz can dodge literally everything from Graves and kill him without taking a single point of damage.\n**Vayne**: Low Range, very short-ranged dash (with stealth when ulting), knock-back. I'm just gonna take a shot in the dark and say you think that Vayne's stealth is going to help her here. It doesn't. Fizz's ult grants true sight, so he can still see her when landing his ult, and her dash isn't long enough to dodge it. Awful choice here too.\n**Corki**: Moderate range, long-ranged dash (even longer with his care package, along with a knock-aside), _all skillshots_. Once again, you're selecting a champion that's skillshots are better against an opponent that's not in your face. Corki's dash is long-ranged, but it requires a slight cast time and can be cancelled by Fizz's ultimate, stopping him mid dash, and leaving him defenseless. In the short cast time, it's easy to land a close ultimate.\n\n**Caitlyn** is, once again, a decent choice. Her range is long, and if Fizz ults, she has more time to react than the other ADCs. Assuming he Playful/Tricksters over your team, he is now vulnerable. Cait's range is longer than Fizz Q range, so she should easily be able to land a net and slow him, which also gives her a free Headshot. Now, assuming, for whatever reason, Fizz is still able to get into range after a missed ult and E on CD, a decent Cait would place a trap down on and around herself so that she can be given time to run. If any Caitlyn is a \"free meal\" it's because they're not good.\n\nIf you lose to a Riven, it's because you weren't smart about engages, it's that simple. While telling low-level players to manipulate waves is a bit much, it's easy to get your lane shoved by a Riven, so there shouldn't be too much of a problem in just farming by/under tower. I also very highly doubt that you've never had trouble against a Riven. That's just way too unlikely. \n\n\n\"I could go on and on about this whole thing, but fuck that.

But yeah, it seriously annoys me when people try to act superior to someone so close in rank. I was platinum back in Season 3 and 4 before I quit S5,  and I try to never pull rank and say someone who wasn't as high ranked as myself has invalid advice compared to my own. \n\nAnyways, Fiora can be a bit tricky, but I don't generally have problems with her top lane, though as squishies she can be trouble. But there are three general things that can be applied as anyone. \n**Predict the dash**. This might sound like redundant advice because she's always in melee range (unless you play as a ranged top laner), but it's something that important. If you're able to, it cuts her DPS by a lot and the cooldown doesn't get reduced, so she can't continue to chase.\n**If she ults, run**.  This is something that should be noted as well. Assuming you're not terribly out of position or your lane is pushed, you should be able to use something to get to safety (again, this is where dodging Lunge is so important). She should only be able to get the back two vitals if you turn and run when she ults, less if you have some mobility spells. Not dying while you're ulted in team fights is big, if you die, her team gets a _huge_ heal, that could very well win them the fight. \n**Bait out her Riposte**. This is probably the most important thing to do. I assume a big problem with Fiora for players is that she has .75 seconds of _complete_ invulnerability, and players don't know how to counter it. Well, first, the easiest way to negate it is by feigning an engage, she'll likely use her Riposte, and then you're free to harass her. \n\nNow, a couple of items to get against her if you're having trouble:\n**Melee Champions**\n\n* Frozen Heart: if you're playing a champion that can utilize this, then it's great. The aura severely hurts her DPS, the armor reduces that already reduced damage, the mana and CDR are great, and the best part? It doesn't give HP, so her passive doesn't do more damage.\n\n* Thornmail: If she gets really ahead, this will give you a big chunk of armor and a passive that should deal some damage to her. NEVER RUSH THORNMAIL.\n* Sunfire Cape: Armor, some HP, and the aura you probably bought it for. Fiora wants to stay close to you, so Sunfire will prove to be the best first item for bruisers or tanks that need it. \n* Deadman's Plate: Speed, strong, on-hit slow, great armor and HP. Another mid-game choice for defense, the stats are great and the slow is extremely good. \n\n**Ranged Champions**\n\n* Guardian Angel: If you get focused and killed, she's going to sit there either getting focused, or twiddling her thumbs while you resurrect. Win/win. \n* Randuin's Omen: This is kinda hard to recommend since it's not that good in this state of the game. However, it's the passive and active that save you. If she can auto you, she gets slowed, if she gets close and _tries_ to auto, pop the active and she's a sitting duck.\n* Zhonya's Hourglass: Self-explanatory for mages.\n* Frozen Mallet: The kiting! \n\nNow, some Champions that I personally have success with vs Fiora:\n**Pantheon**: My go-to pick. I dive Fioras at level 3. Passive blocks her auto or Lunge, can poke her incredibly easy, can easily bait out her Riposte, all around strong pick. \n**Jayce**: Has strong harass from ranged, and if she tries jumping into him, he can easily knock her back and punish her. \n**Gnar**: Strong kiting with mini-Gnar, huge leap, and incredible engage with Mega-Gnar, assuming you can reliably double stun with him. \n**Lee Sin**: Not often played top, but his kit can destroy Fiora if you're capable of out-playing her. I skill up abilities like I would against Jax, in that I rush Hydra and max E second. If she engages, proper use of your passive as well as the attack speed debuff from the second cast of E should gain you the advantage. \n**Jax**: I personally don't play him, but Jax shines in prolonged fights, and Fiora tries to do just that. \n\nNot sure if I'm forgetting anything, it's 3 am and I'm pretty tired :P good luck! \n\nTl;Dr\nBait her abilities, run from ult if you can't kill her. Frozen Heart, GA, or Zhonya's. Kite her as ranged. Jax, Lee, Gnar, Jayce and Mantheon.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-02-03T18:48:54.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy crap that is a ton of information haha, thank you for replying.  \n\nI guess its because im not all that great, but dodging her Lunge seems really hard.

I guess instead of trying to reaction dodge i should learn to anticipate it?  \n\nGood, i already run from her when she ults :) good to know im doing the right thing.  \n\nBaiting out the Riposte is probably what i need to practice the most, normally i can play around it but when i am up against a way better player it just destroys me.  \n\nI should pick up Pantheon again, he use to be my go to for squishy all in fighters.

Predicting her lunge is what I meant, edited my post. But I've only bothered with her a couple of times and it's funny how many people still try and duel me when I ult. \n\nAnd yeah, better players make my \"bait riposte\" a tad harder. They know the _animations_ for CC they want to riposte, so it's incredibly hard to them to burn it. If that's the case, it's better to just not use the CC and chance getting yourself stunned and killed. \n\nJayce and Gnar are definitely not the easiest, but very few champions can reliably, and safely, whittle their opposing laner down then follow up with an engage for a kill. \n\nGood luck with your games, bud!","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-02-04T16:51:40.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your advice, if only there were more people like you on the boards this would be a very informative and enjoyable place.   \n\nGood luck to you too :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-02-01T00:01:03.983+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't have said it better, my friend.\n\n{{champion:31}} And up you go!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-01-31T22:31:31.548+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have your one stop shop for dealing with Riven.\n\n{{champion:111}} Top\n\nSeriously, it's the easiest lane of your life.

Leblanc can seem extremely lacking in counterplay if you don't know how to fight her correctly, but learning her play patterns makes her easy to deal with. \n\n**Counterplay**\nThe most important thing to note about LB are her power spikes. At level one, she's actually extremely weak; chances are good she's running her W, which isn't terribly high damage for a starting spell and is easy enough to stay out of range of. Try to poke her down as much as you can.\nAt level 2, she hits a power spike, where her Q + W combo will do a decent bit of damage (especially with thunderlord's). Be careful of her at this level, and stay out of her W range. If she over-extends, poke her down, don't try to engage. Her power tapers off at levels 3, 4 and 5, and then at level 6 she hits another power spike with her ult, though not as big as you'd expect. Most champs will actually gain more power from their ults than Leblanc. If she decides to all-in you at 6, you will be able to win if you play it right, or at the very least, shove her out of lane. Leblanc's power tapers off afterwards. She power spikes just a tad at level nine, and then tapers until she hits her biggest power spike, level 11. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, engage her at level 11-14. She is extremely powerful with the level 11, and will likely be able to kill you if you engage poorly. She gets another spike at level 16, but not as big, and by this point her power is seriously waning. Despite what most people think, LB is not terribly strong early on lane; it's around level 11 that she'll really be able to knock you around. Try to press the advantage before then. If you and LB exit the lane with similar farm and kills, you've won the lane; it's her responsibility to outfarm or outkill you, or else she's going to be gimping her team because she wasted her power spikes.\n\nMain counterplay against her: Poke. Long ranged poke wrecks her: she can't afford to use W to dodge, because if she does, you can punish the crap out of it. Leblanc levels W first in lane, and as a result, MOST of her early damage is tied to the W, which is a relatively short ranged spell, especially if you consider travel time to get to you. If she just lands Q and E on you, it'll feel like she's tickling you, because her base damages are all tied up in her W. As long as you DONT get in W range in lane, she will not be able to kill you. \n\nBeyond that, LB is not the best wave clearer. Champions who can safely farm or safely waveclear will punish her greatly, not only because she's not that good at farming under the tower, but because she can't roam without losing CS if you push out the lane. Building Abyssal is also ALWAYS a good idea, no matter how the lane is doing. A bit of magic resist and LB's burst loses its bite very quickly. Keep in mind that her Q is her only targetted spell: you should be able to avoid W by keeping at range, and E by either dodging or minions. Her W, however, is the most important one: she won't be able to kill you without it early, and defintely not late unless she's uber fed or you're low or extremely squishy. IF she burns her W, go ham: all of her damage is burst, so while you may feel afraid watching your HP go down, realize that she can't do anything beyond what she starts with. \n\n**Champions that counter her**\nZone control is LB's worst nightmare: she has to get pretty close ranged to land a W, and in landing W, she spends a second in melee range of you, and generally stands still for .5 seconds casting her spells, which is extremely easy to punish. {{champion:34}} does very well, not only because her Q can stun LB instantly when she gets in range, but because anivia's burst is actually more than a match for LB's, and because anivia's fantastic post-6 waveclear will leave LB with very few options. Not to mention, LB doesn't have the sustained damage to kill anivia's egg, so she's very hard to assassinate in lane without a junlger. {{champion:99}}  also does extremely well, because her long-ranged poke and waveclear hurt a lot, and because her shield can soak up damage pretty well, and because she can Light Binding her straight out of distortion, giving her enough time to pull her entire burst combo on LB with complete safety. {{champion:10}} Is also fantastic, because her waveclear leaves nothing to be desired, her Ult can pull the teeth out of LB's burst, and her sustained damage will usually win trades over LB, especially since Kayle's heal allows her some precious in lane sustain. These are my top picks VS lb, others include long-range pokers {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} Sustain or tank heavy champs {{champion:31}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:8}} and strong level 1-5 champs {{champion:105}} \n\nHope some of that is helpful!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-02-01T02:06:22.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who plays both {{champion:157}} and {{champion:238}} I find it frustrating that Zed is the one laner I cannot deal with as Yas.
