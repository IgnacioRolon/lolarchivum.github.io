She has been way over nerfed do to how much she's picked in competitive even though, actually terrible in lcs too now. she was played in 140 games and had a fuking 18% winrate... Pros still pick her cause they are meta slaves(and i legit think they are trying to make watching them as boring as possible) and want her \"tremor sense\", but it's gotten to the point that she is so weak as a champion that she's just a pretty much a mobile ward. Her value as a champion is almost nonexistent, which is a real shame cause she has an awesome design IMO it's just one small part of her kit that is abused in lcs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alpha Samsuni","date":"2016-12-04T04:42:14.536+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wha..What...Upvote!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-12-04T11:26:54.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's so special about 2016/2017?\n\nI know you're kidding, but I'm starting to find it annoying when people say that.
