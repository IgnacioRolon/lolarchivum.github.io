{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-04-12T18:55:58.981+0000","title":"So Riot, you actually are going to live with these Shen \"changes?\"","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":96,"down_votes":21,"body":"[](http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/pages/2016/january/shen/img/shen-wallpaper.jpg)\n...or should I say nerfs?\n\nI&#039;m going to be fair and list them all.\n\n>**Twilight Assault (Q)**: Empowered attacks now also deal 15 base damage.\nEmpowered attacks bonus damage to non champions removed - 30/50/70/90/110.\nEmpowered auto attacks for spirit blade colliding with enemy champion base damage increased from 15 to  [15/20/25/30/35/40 at levels 1/4/7/10/13/16]\n\nSo you&#039;re completely removing Shen&#039;s ability to farm for a measly 15 damage.  If this isn&#039;t a nerf, nothing is. Shen does not, and I repeat DOES NOT need more champion damage. He can half-health most top laners at level 1 if he gets three empowered Q autos off. His damage is fine against champions, he needs to be able to farm.\n\n>**Shadow Dash (E)**:\nEnergy cost lowered from 180 to 150\n[Width increased slightly*]\n\nThe Shen playerbase has been asking for this for so long, so naturally we are ecstatic to see it. Except the fact that it&#039;s being shipped with a much bigger  package of nerfs feels like Riot is trying to distract us by saying &quot;hey, you wanted this, totally worth the other changes!&quot; That being said, I&#039;ve tried this on the PBE, and it feels smooth as hell to use. I&#039;ve never had so much fun using his E since before the rework since it feels like it actually works like it should.\n\n>**Stand United (R)** :\nBase shield value lowered from 250/550/850 to 175/350/525\n[new] Shield now scales up based on missing health of target, up to 160% of base Value (280/560/840).\n[Meddler noted this value is comparable to live at 40% allied health.]\nCooldown increased from 180/150/120 to 200/180/160\n\nNow, I don&#039;t understand these changes. Yes, we get less shield for more allied health, that I am ok with. What I am not fine with is the fact that we not only get the same shield for delaying our ultimate just to hit the sweet spot for a maximum shield (which in turn increases the chances of our ally dying before we arrive) but we even get a smaller shield at level 16 even at the maximum. The least Riot could have done is make the shield bigger to balance it out, but now the ability has become counter-intuitive.\n\nAnd this:\n>Cooldown increased from 180/150/120 to 200/180/160\n\nThis was not needed. This was just wholly unnecessary and proof that there was not much thought put into balancing Shen. I won&#039;t argue that the ultimate needed changes, but nerfing the shield, the utility, and the cooldown all at once? You just destroyed the most iconic part of this champion and it makes me sad that you guys even considered this, much less implemented it.\n___________________________________________________________\n\nSo, let&#039;s go over our little journey of Riot&#039;s &quot;balancing&quot; Shen:\n>V6.15\nBase health regen reduced to 8.5 from 10.\n\nRiot legitimately stated that Shen&#039;s Vorpal blade sustain was lost, but Riot G-Mang told us this:\n&quot;[He can proc shields a lot to avoid damage and his base HP regen was buffed a lot.](https://twitter.com/G_Mang/status/687400075979571202)&quot;\n\nSo they nerfed his base health regen, but he still had his shields and his Q for lane trading and jungling. Then this happened:\n>V6.18\n**Ki Barrier**\nShield health reduced to 50 - 101 (based on level) from 52 - 120 (based on level).\n**Twilight Assault**\nMaximum health damage reduced to 2 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4% from 3 / 3.5 / 4 / 4.5 / 5%.\nEnhanced maximum health damage reduced to 4 / 4.5 / 5 / 5.5 / 6% from 5 / 5.5 / 6 / 6.5 / 7%.\n\nSo they nerfed his passive shield at early levels and nerfed his only damage ability. Because he was seeing play in the LCS. Not to mention at this point his stats were horrible (he had less scaling HP than Sona, and they&#039;ve gotten better but not like it was pre-rework), so it was obvious why he was being played in the LCS: his ultimate. Of course, Riot decided to nerf everything else regardless. And now that they&#039;re tuning his ult for the LCS, they&#039;re also taking away its practicality, its power, its uptime, and Shen&#039;s waveclear. \n\n##So, in retrospect, here&#039;s what we lost with the rework:\n-Sustain\n-Poke\n-Range\n-Taunt damage reduction\n-Shield reliability\n-Waveclear\n-Tankiness\n-Roaming power\n-Ultimate ability uptime\n\n##And here&#039;s what we gained:\n-Minor and unreliable %HP magic damage\n-A 1.75 second dodge zone on a 16 second cooldown\n-Minor health scaling on E damage\n-Relatively low scaling HP shield passive (relative to tanks)\n-A minor 35% single-directional slow for pulling an anti-skillshot through someone\n______________________________________________________________________________\nI&#039;m really getting tired of having to do this, Riot. Why can&#039;t you just do what you said you&#039;ll do? Why do you have to give compensation nerfs for already heavy nerfs? I honestly don&#039;t get it. I mean, how the hell did you manage to turn &quot;balance his ult for pro play&quot; into &quot;take away the last few things going for him as a champion?&quot;\n\nDo you want to know the reason _why_ I&#039;m playing Shen mid these days? Because soon I&#039;ll be better off going mid lane and actually being near my allies because my ult isn&#039;t reliable, I don&#039;t have sustain to keep me against the lane bullies in top lane (but surprisingly against mages he&#039;s decent), any decent top can out-farm, out-damage, and out-sustain me, and last but not least you keep NERFING HIM FOR SOLO QUEUE.\n\nI&#039;m finished with my rant. Do whatever you want, it&#039;s your damn game. I&#039;ve said my bit already time and again, and I hate to repeat myself. To all the Shen mains, out there, I&#039;m sorry I couldn&#039;t do much to stop this stupidity from reaching live. I now await our impending gutting.\n\nSigning off, \n#Melledoneus","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-12T19:46:42.823+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"Godspeed Mel.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-04-12T19:48:15.790+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"I sure hope he gets here fast.

That's what he was released as, balanced around, etc. He's not a god damn mid laner where he needs absurb wave clear. Most top laners don't have that much waveclear, and Shen was one of them. His split pushing is far from the reason he's hard to balance, it's because of his global presence in LCS that Riot is up in arms against him. He's one of the most underwhelming tanks in Solo Queue.\n\nThat's funny that you mention him being in the jungle, too, because Riot specifically forced him out of the jungle before this set of nerfs with the Q nerfs, so where the f*ck is he supposed to go?\n\nYour entire post is devoid of any real statistics or facts to back up your absurd claims.

Shen is already an excellent splitpusher, not balancing this change would make him push even faster than he already does.\n\nAh and just wondering, why are you bringing back old patchnotes? The only important things here are Shen's actual state and Shen's state after patch 7.8. You are crying for no reason about version 6 patches, which sounds really ridiculous as you seem to find yourself out of arguments to put on the table.\n\nNow, you get a buff on Twilight assault to compensate, but you don't seem to give a damn about it as you kind of take it as \"deserved and justified\". Ah, I think I will borrow this argument if you don't mind. Everytime a hero I play gets balance changes, I will claim that \"the buffs are justified but the nerfs actually are unnecessary\".\n\nAh, this is not how it works unfortunately. Shen is strong, as he has always been, and he needs to be balanced. So basically, as the empowered attacks nerf is actually balancing the Sunfire change, the only \"nerf\" I can see so far is about the ult. So now you'll have to actually think before using your ult. Do you want to get there faster but shield less or shield more and get there a bit later?\n\nWow it will be hard to be a Shen player after patch 7.8, seriously I would cry for you if I had any tears left after reading every crymeariver stories about patch 7.8. But, just saying: it will actually be more flexible than it is right now, as you can CHOOSE what you're going to do best and adapt to the situation you're in.\n\nYour cries over Shen's changes are, imo, pretty ridiculous as it sounds only like balancing, not nerfing at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-04-13T15:03:19.403+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, let me put this into terms you'll understand.\n\nLux's E now deals 50% less damage to minions.
