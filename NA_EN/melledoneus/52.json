Since Shen&#039;s shield is already delayed due to having to have him use an ability, can we please, _please_ give him a faster Q missile speed? It would be a lot better because: \r\n\r\n**-Sometimes enemies will have taunt wear off before the Q even hits them \r\n\r\n-It takes so long to recall it if you need the shield, and a lot of times it&#039;s already too late once you finally do get it \r\n\r\n-It makes farming with his Q difficult if you&#039;re trying to get reach for that minion before the turret takes it, but the Q was too slow for you to get the empowered auto**\r\n\r\nI know Shen got buffs recently to make his stats more like a tank, but this is an issue that stats alone cannot fix. Increasing Shen&#039;s Q missile speed would make his kit feel a hell of a lot more fluid and would make him feel a lot less clunky than he does now.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s comparable to how it feels when lowering the speed of Orianna&#039;s ball on her E and Q, as it would basically screw up her entire kit&#039;s combos with that delay in there. Please consider this change to Shen as it would make him feel much more better, play much smoother, and properly reward players for utilizing positioning as Riot intended to.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this post, feel free to discuss your opinion below!","replies":[{"poster":"Buzhidog","date":"2016-12-08T02:22:11.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen works all the time. 15% of the time. I also hate the delays its on champs that I love though. Like Sol, Kled, and stuff and stuff. When you try to save yourself via shield but die, its the same feeling you get with Kled. They lowered the delay on Kled though. I demand a change for Shen, the one who will shadow dash and sacrifice himself. I want Shen to be able to not just outsustain, but have more power on his own because of farming.","replies":[]}]}
