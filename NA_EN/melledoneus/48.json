They can think quick, play well, and know what changes mean and can adapt to the meta quickly. Somebody can have really good knowledge of the game and not play ranked, either.\n\n So next time somebody says something and you see they&#039;re in Silver or Bronze, think about the validity of their statement first and only use their rank if it actually applies instead of trying to put them down for something they may not have the patience, time, or energy to achieve.\n\nAnd to that person in Plat who told me &#039;stfu you&#039;re silver&#039; when arguing against me that Lee Sin&#039;s kick doesn&#039;t root his target while it&#039;s casting... hik you, man. Hik. You.\n\nLong Live the Beta Metals!","replies":[]}
