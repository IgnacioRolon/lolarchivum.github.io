Anybody with a sense of humor can appreciate a joke or a meme, and could make even the harshest days just a little bit better. I personally have had a good chuckle on my worst days when on these Boards. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMalicious Metal? Mordekaiser is the most famoust and meme-able champion now thanks to you. You brought metal to the Boards like no band has ever brought to the genre, and have kept this community iron-clad and steeled for anything. You have made us a proud nation.\r\n\r\nRaptorkarr, we may have had our battles, but you are officially the most anime memer ever. That is an honor I can only dream of. Thank you for doing your best to dig through the bowels of Deviantart and Google images to find us quality content, and thank you for making the Boards a bit more interesting with your shipping and drama. It&#039;s been awesome.\r\n\r\nRalanr, my brother-in-shields, speak for all tank mains. Your contributions to Sionce were great and revolutionary, and you will never be forgotten. Also, we still need to play a game together.\r\n\r\nAnd for all those wonderful people my tiny pea-brain can&#039;t remember... thank you. From the bottom of my heart. These Boards are my home on the internet, and it warms my heart to see how much we&#039;ve grown together as a community and will continue to share our unique brands of humor with one another.\r\n\r\nAnd to the downvote trolls, thank you. Whether you downvote this or not, remember that someone out there loves you. And I will give you a friendly hug if you allow me to. And I know that trolling may be your own brand of sadistic humor. But hey, it&#039;s humor.\r\n\r\nI await this post&#039;s burial.","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-06-15T14:03:31.161+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tfOUwfS1Lm8/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-06-15T17:22:16.823+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noticed.","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-06-15T17:34:50.868+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/kdeXw36FQvvXi/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-06-15T17:43:00.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Nods and teleports away.*","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-06-15T14:00:37.578+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god, are you dying?\n\nEdit: Ok that was probably an extreme question to ask, but this seemed pretty sudden. \n\nAnd we should play sometime.
