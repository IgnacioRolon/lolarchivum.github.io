When i log in, it doesn't respond for a while. After I get into a game, it always takes a good 5-10 minutes to get to loading screen. I always have to create a custom game and wait for it to load (frustrating). It happens every time I first open league and it's pretty annoying. Pls Halp Thnx     \nPs. It might not necessarily be a bug","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-29T17:55:09.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this is only happening during the first match of the day, it's likely this is caused by there being missing or corrupt files in your League install that are then grabbed from the server and cached in memory. This would cause issues loading the first time, but since the assets are then loaded to memory, they'd load faster in any additional matches.\n\nI recommend working through the steps in our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to address permissions issues or missing files that could cause this. Let me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
