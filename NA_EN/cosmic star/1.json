Some personal highlights, for me:\n\n* The overall flow and pacing of the video. This was a project lovingly crafted from start to finish, and it's really cool to see what they can do with the medium, in so little time, and how much they can pack in. I keep going over it to look for easter eggs and goodies! It's overall just amazing!\n* Yasuo looking like THAT. Jesus. Riot's secret mission statement continues to be making the most aesthetically pleasing characters in any video game, ever.\n* Talia's giant wall, gave me goosebumps.\n* Full AP Blitzcrank KSing Ekko's kill.\n* Miss Fortune's whole personality--I love her character so much. She's SUCH a badass, and it shows so much in this scene. She wakes up, surrounded by a giant tentacle monster, clearly just got blown up, things are looking bad, and what's this girl's number one priority? \"Where is my gun so I can kill someone?\" What a woman.\n* Thresh waiting for Lucian to clear the minion wave so they can rotate mid. (Also the generally swooshiness of Lucian. The difference in movements and body language... somebody loved this cinematic.)\n\nIf this was a trailer for a movie I'd be l o s i n g my mind right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot c0ttonnz","date":"2018-01-14T23:03:02.205+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which easter eggs did you find?
