Just like I turn on the Star Guardian Music when playing with an SG skin and then, unfortunately turn it off, cause none of the music (classic or updated) are enjoyable enough to listen every game, either I turn off the music and put it on my own or just don&#039;t listen cause lags me a bit.\r\n\r\nSo this has been like this for quite a lot of time now, and I pray you already have projects on this cause music turns me on so much to make the plays in those epic team fights but listening to that calm music when a giant brawl is happening kinda sucks. \r\n\r\nSo please think about updating the music to be as awesome as the game! \r\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2018-01-16T05:29:12.771+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BornToBeAhriGod (I'm an Ahri main myself, but clearly not a god, more like... bronze-clad Arhi),\n\nThanks for your awesome question (and your kind words on the music for \"The Climb\" which I wrote and produced)!\n\nThe following are my views on the subject and do not necessarily reflect those of the rest of the music team or those of the developers of League of Legends.\n\nLeague is a highly competitive game... which is a blessing for players _but_ creates strong limitations for music. One of these limitations is that we are trying NOT to interfere with gameplay with information that may clutter perception/interfere with it. The music I wrote for Star Guardian that you hear at the beginning of the game only plays there for that very reason (not much happens before the music ends).\n\nAnother limitation has to do with how quickly game states (which is a technical term that generally refers to the stage the game is in) change in League. Whereas you can define a set of rules on how the music could change overtime (gold, objectives, dragons, etc.), a lot of fights have very quick onsets, and have very unpredictable outcomes. How music would react to these game states would be pretty haphazard - we could have music that doesn't react fast enough (getting in or out of fights), or do it in a clumsy way, or do it in a way that fits rapid changes but sounds bad. In any case, these sudden changes with music would probably interfere with having clean, readable audio gameplay information.\n\nMore linear games with NPCs have more predictable outcomes that really help defining solid rules for interactive audio, which allows for a wider range of implementation of interactive music. \n\nSR is particularly complicated in this regard (and is also our only competitive map). I wrote the music for Dark Star Singularity, Star Guardian Invasion and Project Overcharge maps/modes, which allowed for a lot more variety in the approaches we chose. \n\nOf course, the stuff I mentioned above doesn't mean there's no room for improvement or that we won't find a good way to have very interactive music for League.\n\nCheers!\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Star","date":"2018-01-16T15:54:11.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do totally understand the reason and the difficulty regarding this topic, and it's totally fine (btw thanks for making so many cool musics, as you mentioned, SG, Dark Star, Project, all great themes that completely fit the role). But although there are tons of things to improve I still look forward in the evolution of the music! It might not be anytime soon but I will hope to one day see people actually using League's music when playing.\nOne question if you can answer: Why can we have music like SG for 1.15 minutes, and we can't have it for the hole game, it makes it special I know, but would it influence the gameplay or something like it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DBS Ronovon","date":"2018-01-16T05:30:59.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is music in the game??\n\n{{champion:119}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-01-15T03:02:10.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be really cool.
