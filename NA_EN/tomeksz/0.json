I was thinking about {{champion:80}} this dude is a Targon Aspect of War and sadly he looks like a basic spartan righ now. There is so much that can be done with him. Another champion is {{champion:6}} I just can&#039;t take him seriously cuz he looks so wierd.

He's treated as a joke pick and has always been seen as unhealthy to the game as a result of his kit.\n\nOther older yordle champs like Tristana, Heimer and Popppy received great updates; yet, Teemo has pretty much remained the same since day 1 aside from the mushroom toss/bounce mechanic and the slight updated to his passive last year and he's considered one of League's more recognizable champs as well.

Last time I checked, artisans of war don't fall off. \nYou harass with Q until you get cramps, W E and Q again if you didn't do enough damage. If you're ever reworking this champ, DO NOT CHANGE HIS ULT. IT IS TOO AWESOME. CHANGE HIS Q W E, SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER OPTIONS AND MORE COMBOS.\n\nMalphite is terrible outside of his E and his Ultimate. AP malphite has no meaning to me when his kit revolves around stacking armor. He's one of the worst tanks in the game (opinion there) once you learn not to crowd in one spot during a teamfight, and build {{item:3035}} items. Even {{champion:33}} has more relevancy and he's one of the most predictable champs there is in what he builds, and playstyle. Q E W R over and over again. Malphite? Ult E W Q. Rinse repeat. Make him more dynamic. Why ever play malphite top when {{champion:154}} has more potential than he does, or {{champion:111}}.","replies":[]}]}
