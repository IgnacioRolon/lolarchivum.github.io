(and I feel really bad and it was an accident)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very recently my friends and I (including my little brother) were in a group of five and two of our group members decided to kind of have a \"troll-off,\" one of them being my brother SaxtonHale123 and the other one being my friend. (We were fine with them picking off-meta picks and my brother running around the map trying to get a touchdown).\r\n\r\nWe reported them (stupidly) as a joke (we were all in voice call at the time and laughing). But my brother used the slur \"%%%got\" at me once in game and I think this was one of the main contributors to him being banned. While I totally understand why he was permabanned for saying something like this, I want to have a possibility of appealing for him by explaining that this is an inside joke between us (i'm gay and I refer to myself using the f slur with close friends as a joke and I'm ok with close friends doing this to me as well since he's my little brother). In no way did he mean for it to be homophobic and in my opinion I think this ban wasn't justified in this case. I'd appreciate it if his permaban is reviewed since I wanna play with my lil bro again :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T04:37:08.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People can understand inside jokes and all, and it really sucks that your little brother kinda got baited into this, but using homophobic slurs like that simply aren't cool regardless of your friends not minding. Others in the game likely won't take it that way whatsoever, and many are heavily offended. If your brother wants to look into what could be done, he'll have to submit a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) over to player behavior to discuss why things like this aren't allowed, and what if anything could be done. Overall though, it's not likely these types of punishments to be reversed, mostly since anyone could claim \"jokes mate\".","replies":[{"poster":"jirens whore ","date":"2018-01-22T04:46:50.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"understandable, and thank you for pointing me over to ticket\n\nbut is it possible it could be reversed if we have everyone on our team testify that it was a joke??","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T05:36:51.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be real with you here, it's not very likely tbh. Simply due to the fact that anyone could claim 'just jokes' after any kind of punishment. These things aren't cool out in public, and we all know how offensive they can be to others. There are certain things that just cross the line, homophobic slurs being one of them. While I can personally understand you being okay with the term and it not offending you, others don't see it that way.","replies":[{"poster":"jirens whore ","date":"2018-01-22T20:40:17.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dang, it was worth a shot :/ thank you for the help though, i really appreciate it","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheSummonerDoom","date":"2018-02-01T01:27:41.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if this applies just thought Id give my 2 cents","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSummonerDoom","date":"2018-02-01T01:27:04.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope im not necroing here but sadly the same rule applys to getting into a fight. Some schools will even suspend the kid who got the snot kicked out of them and it leaves a bad mark on the one who was bullied. Some people even say oh whats 2 days In School Suspension? People who were part of it but did nothing wrong shouldn't be punished. Reminds me of when 2 kids in my class were flinging food and the whole class had to pay the price cuz the two kids wouldnt admit they did it.","replies":[]}]}
