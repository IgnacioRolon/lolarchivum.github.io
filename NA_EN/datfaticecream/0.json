High risk patterns that result in death frequently/where the best way to play is to expect to die in an even team fight. Post death passives here give you some chance for contribution regardless of how quickly you die and synergize well with the sort of actions you should be taking anyway (middle of enemy team or front of your own team). Sion and Karthus are the best examples here, with both often doing it right if they end up dead near the enemy team. Zyra's fits this category slightly, as a squishy, immobile mage with moderate cast ranges, whose contribution drops off significantly after she's used her CDs/seeds.\n\n2. When we want to offer a champion more power when they're having a poor game than a successful one. If a character's too feast or famine, absolutely crushing some games and failing to contribute anything in others, then a post death passive can be a good fit, since it offers more power to the struggling games. Kog'Maw's the best example of this, with the passive being non existent in games where he's stomping and a pretty reliable true damage AOE in games where he's having a lot of trouble. Zyra comes into this category pretty solidly. She's got a lot of damage between her plants and spells and regularly tops damage charts when having a reasonable game. She's pretty vulnerable though when her spells are on CD/against enemies with the right tools to avoid them, so if she's not having a good game she can end up dying a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-07-27T19:09:58.362+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally think it would be fair to give Zyra a passive that also affected her gameplay when she's alive.

I assume there's a reason champions like Veigar, Annie, Fiddlesticks, Karma, Malzahar, Ryze, and Cassiopeia (who probably has the worst range of them all)--who all fit the bill of being squishy, immobile, mid-ranged mages with windows of power limited by ability cooldowns--don't do something odd when somebody on the enemy team outpositions them and turns their screen grey. I think for Zyra in particular, something that rewards her for staying out of harm's way or gives her a tool to deal with champs like Fizz who can jump straight to her from 1250 units away (and champion LoS is 1100 units, if I recall correctly) would be more appropriate, but I think this actually brings us to the second point.\n\nWith the second case, I'm going to say that it's not that great a justification because you guys have come up with much more elegant and creative fallback patterns for many other champs, and have left other champions to suffer from that feast-or-famine gameplay (Yi is probably the most tragic example) for over half a decade. Yasuo, for example, doesn't Seppuku himself through an enemy champion Yoshimitsu-style when he dies, he creates a projectile blocking wall that his entire team benefits from. Akali doesn't burst into a cloud of kunai when she dies, but she can create a slowing field. Even Kog'Maw has a much longer, more potent slowing field, an armor/MR shred, and his ult's reveal to contribute to his team when he isn't doing too hot.\n\nIt just feels kind of bogus, having a chunk of your ability kit denied from you when you're actually playing well (Sion's expected to still use his because \"playing well\" for him could mean eating 3 ults that his carry no longer has to worry about), when other more satisfying solutions could have been applied. Allocating power in ways that give enemies some way to respond when certain champions are \"crushing\" in any particular game, I think, would ultimately be a more satisfying way to prevent that feast-or-famine. \n\nFor example, toning down some of the raw power in Kog'Maw's kit and tying it to an Innate that increases his damage dealt to an individual target after attacking them a set amount of times (tying in with both his acidic theming and his role as a marksman) makes him a bit less of a nightmare, because now if he's doing really well, circulating your frontline before he reaches that peak or keeping fights limited to short skirmishes are viable ways to undermine his power--I believe this is actually something that was done with Ashe, who could be 13/0/5 and still be dealt with if measures are taken to mitigate her strengths.\n\nFor Zyra, something along the lines of taking some immediate power away from her plants (since right now, they're basically DoTs that are occasionally applied at the end of her abilities and \"drop two seeds before throwing a Q or E\" doesn't create much different gameplay than Brand going for a pillar -> stun combo or Vel'Koz guaranteeing a few Innate procs by setting up with his weird knockup) and pushes her towards a more unique style of play might be worth exploring. Perhaps instead of going, \"hey, Zyra's a champion, and all champions should be designed around contributing to huge teamfights,\" turning Zyra into a champion that broadens the range of strategy available to players by defining her strengths around cultivating her plants and tactically spreading them around the map could make her [a champion that's unique in her own right](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.com/2012/12/champion-redesign-zyra-rise-of-thorns.html?q=zyra) (beyond having lamer versions of Heimer turrets) with counterplay that's unique to her (kill the plants before they grow to deny her map presence and damage/utility), and ultimately make her a lot less feast-or-famine without locking a fifth of her kit behind one of the intentionally worst feelings in the game.\n\nTL;DR - \n\n1- Post-death abilities are cool on champs whose gameplay puts them at direct risk of dying; post-death abilities on champs whose abilities/roles don't require they throw themselves into the enemy team don't really make sense, and I assume Veigar/Cass/Ryze/Annie don't explode upon dying for deliberate reasons. I didn't mention this in my spiel, but Karthus and Anivia I can mostly understand from thematic viewpoints, but I think those qualities to them could be improved as well.\n\n2- I can see your train of thought on this one, and you're by no means incorrect, but there are definitely more creative solutions to the feast/famine problem that don't involve locking away 20% of any given kit. Either that, or I expect Yi/Vayne/Draven/etc. to explode on death in future iterations of their gameplay kits. I hope A) that's not the case, and B) that we eventually get better solutions to Kog'Maw's and Zyra's Innates.\n\nThanks for reading!

She has CC, but there are plenty of other mid laners with stronger CC that is much more reliable to hit. Zyra's damage is actually lower than some other Mages who are also played commonly as a Support. Like I noted, Sona's Q + Passive alone can essentially do more damage than Zyra's entire combo, especially since she can also apply Lich Bane. Even Soraka can do more damage than Zyra's Q, while also being much easier to hit and also healing Soraka significantly.\n\nIs not about her damage on spells, it's about the damage on plants + spells. I play a lot of zyra mid and I've never had a bad game with her. Her mana costs are high because it'd be ridiculously oppressive if they weren't, plus she's only got two basic spells that cost mana. Her mana per level is actually really good, I can usually get by post lanephase without buying anything more than a morellos. The only thing I'd lower is her ult cost because 120 is weird and annoying. As for her Q being hard to hit, well that's honestly your opinion, not fact. I rarely miss with it, and when I do the plants make up for the damage I'm missing. \n\nYou're comparing Zyra to burst mages. Zyra is not a burst mage, so of course she's going to do less damage initially than them. \n\nMaybe try some other sustained damage mages like: \n\nKarthus Q: 120 + .3 or 240 + .6\nE: 110 + .2\n\nOrianna: Q 180 + .5 that gets lower as she hits enemies.\nW: 250 + .7\nE: 180 + .3\n\nVladimir: Q 230 + .6\nW: 160- 320 + .45\n\nRegardless of who you're comparing her to, you're completely leaving out the fact that nearly every spell she casts spawns a plant that does 120 + .2 per attack.\n\nAlso, Zyra's ult's damage is not instant. Much like Liss's ult you take the damage as it expands, not instantly. \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"DlVA","date":"2015-07-27T15:34:27.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Miss Fortune,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=lZwERUAI,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-07-27T03:16:45.097+0000)\n>\n>.Even Soraka can do more damage than Zyra's Q, while also being much easier to hit and also healing Soraka significantly.\n\nReally?

Zyra is one of the champions that if well played and not shut down takes over the game with how ridiculous her damage is. I invite you to actually look at the damage done to champions in an end game screen with or against a Zyra. You'll be much surprised. I'm a fairly decent ADC and my girlfriend who is the same rank than me maybe a bit lower plays Zyra a lot as support only. She buys all the regular support items, wanna know what happens end game?  She has most damage of the whole team; Every. Single. Time.\nThat's how ridiculous this is, and we generally play with gold/plat people when we play together. The problem ain't the people playing bad there, it's the champion being strong. Strong enough passive wise. she needs something but definitely not what you're proposing IMO :/\n\n**About the people than zyra only kills one person per game with her passive:**\n\nI honestly think it's higher than that, but then again it depends oon the elo we're talking about, the lower you get the least people are likely to dodge it properly, if any buff happen to her passive i think the numbers and speed of the missile have to be changed in someway\n\neither buff the damage but really reduce the speed, or increase speed but really reduce the numbers, cause right now it does a lot of damage and it flies really quick.\n\n**About the comparison with on death passive like kogmaw:**\n\nKogmaw stays an ADC that is mainly single target, you ain't expecting to deal a lot of dmg with your saliva or hit the whole team with ult,\nWhereas Zyra got the area of her ult that is as large as amumu's, got cc in slows with plants, root, bump from ult as already mentioned,\n\nI agree that for AP kog all this is less relevant.\n\nBut as far as i'm concerned i think letting zyra have those numbers and buffing the passive in the revive way is totally going to be unbalanced, i'm expecting to try it out on PBE\ninb4 Zyra mid OP... ^^\n\n**About the revive on passive suggestion:**\n\nI read the suggestion about making Zyra's passive actually revive her if she kills the enemy. And why i think that's a terrible Idea.\nWhen Anivia and Zac die they are obliged to spend a bit of time waiting doing nothing while the enemy can prevent the respawn by killing the egg or the blobs. If Zyra were to have the passive the condition was for her to kill someone which means that in a 1v1 lane like middle if you actually kill your opponent when he went all out and you did too, and he managed to outplay you, then you actually kill him and revive without him being able to stop that revive (because you just killed him, right ?) means she gets a free revive.... unless your jungler is there, and we know that's not gonna happen everytime. SO basically what you would like to do is to give the passive a kill potential and revive potential, then why not let zac deal damage with his blobs? or anivia cast spells in egg form ? Or aatrox ?? why not let karthus revive if he kills an enemy in his passive form ? even though we know that he just has to press R, while zyra just had to press one key and aim properly, and as far as i'm concerned the passive does pretty decent damage and flies pretty quickly too. Some long range mages will be able to dodge it because out of range, then other idlaners, like diana, talon, zed, ekko,Fizz will have a much harder time. If her passive is buffed in the revive way the missile speed and damage can't stay this way. either numbers up speed down, or speed up numbers down. from what they currently are. **_My suggestion would be to actually remove her being able to deal damage with the missile, but let her plants live for her current passives duration (which is already th ecase f i am not mistaken, and if she kills her opponent with ignite or her plants she gets revived at the location of the kill, she spawns as a plant,  the plant start small then grows over 3 seconds and when she blooms Zyra reappears half health, half mana. can only occur once every 5 minutes_**\n\nI agree Zyra needs something but, in the current state if well played she is one of the highest DPS i've seen with brand, the passive as plain out revive and dmg potential is not balanced :(...\n\n@Meddler You guys be really careful in the way you are going to buff her :)\n\nayway that was my two cents :(\n\n\nThanks for reading","replies":[{"poster":"datfaticecream","date":"2015-07-29T12:31:18.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you think reviving with half health and mana is a bit too much? Aatrox can revive with quite a lot of health but that's only if he dies with a lot of the red bars. I also partially agree with what you said, this would be really strong since this is basically giving Zyra two passives. But the main point I'm trying to make is that although it varies from player to player and it is very situational; I strongly agree that Zyra has one of the highest DPS and in a 1v1 battle against certain champions even when dead and the enemy is low, she could easily finish them with the vengeful thorn, however, that is if there is no external interference. Because there is almost always a way the enemy could surprise you e.g. Soraka/Bard ults and saves the enemy you just 1v1'ed, or you haven't fully analysed your enemy e.g. you calculated when was the last time they used their heal/barrier summoner spell, but did not look up their profile and check if they have the mastery that reduces the cooldown of their ss. If this is revival passive does get added to Zyra, then like you and some others might have said, the dmg, speed etc. of the missile should be reduced.\n\nI appreciate how you took the time to counter my suggestion with  your opinions. I think the main reason I posted this suggestion on this page may be because I don't like how she has to die to use her passive.\n\nBut a more accurate reason may be because I don't like dying in general and would want to find ways of preventing death even to the point of altering a champion's kit just because I play the champion. I can understand if this idea gets rejected at the end because although situations change in battle and there can be a lot of unpredictable moments, if Zyra players understand their role, take precautions e.g. warding/staying with the team and do nothing 'wrong', then my reason for suggesting this passive is gone. (In other words, death is the punishment for doing the 'wrong' thing' and my primary purpose for proposing this new passive is to avoid the punishment of death; thus why it is reasonable not to change anything about her although this could lead to new playstyles and plays)\n\nSorry if that was hard to read, I should really use a thesaurus and also find better ways to connect my points.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-07-27T07:33:16.036+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I highly question any post that says Zyra's damage is mediocre.
