I wanna win just like everyone else. then boom game sets me back to the lobby i&#039;m like WHO DODGED only to realize it was me due to not locking in. haha so silly.","replies":[{"poster":"Waffletimewarp","date":"2016-01-18T15:35:01.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's to teach you not to be one of those pricks who waits the full countdown to waste time","replies":[]},{"poster":"DNA Polymerase I","date":"2016-01-18T14:29:59.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ikr what is the point of locking in.\nI have 52 min Q because people keep failing to lock in\nRiot fix this ,,,,,","replies":[{"poster":"bobyboucher","date":"2016-01-18T14:45:10.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's simply so that people cannot put a preference pick in at the start then go afk and let it all automatically happen. In the past if this first preference was available you could have set that and went afk letting the clock count down and auto lock you in. The no auto lock is to ensure no one can just set a preference and walk away , you need to be there until you lock in your champ and actively make the derision. I understand the frustration of no auto lock but also understand the need to not let it be an \"automated\" style process of highlighting your preference and then walking away / not dynamically picking your champ as things change / get banned/ get picked.","replies":[]}]}]}
