I am a Solo queue player and I do not microphone or voice chat. Now that I am playing more ranked games than blind pick and really trying to win. I am working with others more and more often to make good team compositions and select strong champions. I play all positions from top lane to bot lane with a decent champion pool. \n\nWhen I start a match I try to pick and ban and talk with other players about who they want, where they want to go, and if they would like to trade. During  this time we are on a timer looking at huge wall of champions with no names and when hovered over we cannot see chat and have to make decisions fairly quickly, so please hear me out. \n\nHere is what i would like to see\n\n1. Champion favorites section of the champions I love to play and are really good with\n\n2. Easy to click categories \n           Please keep alphabetical listing. This I feel is part of the essence of champion select, but also add role selectors, tank, fighter, marksman, ect..  (yes I know you can type it in, however again I am on a timer I  have little time for typing especially if I am typing to a teammate. In a last minute decision I sometimes cannot find a champion fast enough and I lose LP by timing out trying to help the team get a win by picking a champion that would make our team stronger. very frustrating and unfair.)\n\n3. Add champion names under there pictures\n            With all of the reworks, and visual updates (which are awesome) it is hard to keep up with all of the new portraits and when I hover over a champion to see which champion it is. My chat gets covered up by champion information that is fairly vague and that I usually already know. It makes my decision harder and less about the teamwork because I cannot see what we are working out in chat. So either take off the champion information,  move it, and add champion names PLEASE!\n\nThanks for listening \nBest wishes to all and remember GL HF :)","replies":[{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-10-11T13:42:55.909+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I'd like is for there to be some time before the banning starts where people could chat, even if it's just \"pls don't ban morg\".

I'd say some good ideas are:\n---\n1: Add a slider for thumbnail sizes, perfect option for users of monitors in any size/resolution.\n---\n2: Have fun with text presentation options (aesthetically). Perhaps when you mouse over them, a thumbnail become visible. So instead of viewing 120+ thumbnails at once, instead you are given an alphabetical list. Again, make this a check-marked option.\n---\n3: Implement a system akin to team builder, where after the banning phase (a lot of people tend to change roles after a banning phase), each team member selects the role they want to play from top to bottom. instead of those battling and arguing through text. This allows bans to be distributed while the team discusses roles, then a visual display of those roles after the banning phase is given (for those that dont pay attention, if you don't choose, you are automated to \"Fill.\" I suppose you could even go the extra mile and add preferred position selection while searching for a game.\n---\n4: Have The chat appear out of champion select as an arranged chat, ALA the pre-lobby organized team chat.\n---\n5: Have selected skin Art appear as your selected champion. (see attachment)\n---\n\nJust some morning ideas I came up with, I also looked online and found a sleek custom imagery, I'm not sure who to give credit to but I altered it a tad on paint. the full example is only represented on the top left Riven (I'm lazy).
