You should be able to change this in-game via the Video options.  There should be a drop down to increase the resolution, as well as full screen.  \n\nNow, if they're not saving then there might be a problem with your files syncing properly to our servers.  To resolve this, enter a custom game.  While in this game, navigate to your League installation folder ( C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends).\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHopefully, this gets you sync'd up!","replies":[]}]}
