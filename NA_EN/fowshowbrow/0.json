A bot kinda just runs it down too lol. Just post up in mid lane, wait for it to attack your tower, because it will, it will not adapt, it will reliably try to attack an objective regardless of allies being present or not, and kill it over and over like you would an inter. On top of that, I dont think theres an active system in place for players to not abuse that. How does Riot know its an inter as it happens? Players could just troll vote kick innocent players. Add some parameters, and inters will just stay below the set parameters while still ensuring your loss. I dont think its a plausible idea, but like with many other things, I could be wrong.
