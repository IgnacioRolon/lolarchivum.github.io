I was quiet the entire game . He threated to report me for ks ( its called assisting ) and for leaving lane . I was assisting the entire team and went to help the mid ( Heimer ) who was struggling against the Annie Bot . I went 3-0-17 with lowest kills and top assists  . The funny thing is that I gave this jungler ( the guy who reported me ) a leash and helped him DO DRAGON .  At the end of the game I got a message warning me of my player behavior. This guy was harassing me all game and I get reported :(               \r\n\r\nPls riot do something about the reporting system . Most of the times the people who are innocent \r\nare the ones that get reported .","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-02T21:48:37.227+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't worry about it. If you didn't do anything then the report won't hurt you. You get a notification when you've been reported a lot recently but it doesn't necessarily mean you are going to get punished. However, if you get reported often enough to see the notification, you're probably actually doing something wrong in your games (even if you didn't do anything in the game that triggered the warning).","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2015-11-02T22:08:15.112+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Building on what Deep Terror Nami said,  if you're not doing anything wrong in a match you don't have to worry too much if someone reports you.\n\nWe know that anyone can report someone for just about anything whether or not an offense was performed.

There is currently no feedback on if our reports are being devalued or not. I would like to think that every one of my reports is valid, but if a specific behavior isn't generally considered reportable but i feel it should be then my reports get devalued and i have no idea that it is even happening. Then when i do submit a valid report, it is devalued and action doesn't get taken.
