As long as your other units stay alive long enough for him to use his ability he will still just go hyper carry mode and slay 5 champions no sweat. god forbid they get a rapidfire too, then its honestly just ggez. \r\n\r\nNerfing his attack speed on his ability would be a good start, so he isnt already throwing axes at the speed of light from rageblade.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-08-31T04:57:01.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are plenty of ways to counter Draven.

Rounds are now infamous for only giving gold, and now the item pool is going to be 1/8 more diluted, so getting any specific item, isn't going to be as reliable, outside of Carousels.\n\nFurthermore, a single PD won't protect an entire team vs 45% Crit Gunslingers or 65-85% Crit Assassins. They will kill around the person with the PD so fast that killing the PD user won't be an issue the next time their skills come around.\n\nI have a feeling now that the Always hits mod is off the RFC, it'll be a contest of pure Yordles vs Last Whisper...... which is going to be a harder item to earn than previous items. No-Dodge comps aren't going to have a chance, because of how strong 95% Dodge team can be, especially of augmented by items like Dragon Tooth/PD/Thornmail.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reaversal","date":"2019-08-30T17:49:11.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porglit,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=mP8w3dBr,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-08-30T17:14:45.234+0000)\n>\n> This will all change when the new {{item:1051}} is introduced.
