It's not the same as telling someone to stop typing arguments and just play the game.\n\n\"shut up and just play the fucking game\" is telling someone who's probably busy typing bullshit to get his shit together and actually do something useful in the game. It's not an insult. It's practically the same as my friends telling me to \"get my shit together and fucking study\" when I complain about a bad grade. It is actually respectful that they are treating me like an adult and telling me to take responsibility rather than saying \"oh its just the teachers fault for not being a good teacher\" etc. There is 1 person I can change, and it's me. Most of the time the teacher is actually fine and I'm just being lazy, however, even if the teacher is bad, if I can't drop the class, I have to still try my best to study and do well.\n\nWhen I tell someone who is arguing with someone else to \"shut up and play the game\" it's because I believe that they are capable of being a better person and not letting the troll drag them down to their level.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-02T23:57:40.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you not mute the kind that gets to you?
