I'll adjust.\nRuns behind tower and starts to back for no reason when I go to gank lane.\nPlays AP miss fortunes not\nPings my ult (I'm nocturne) I use it to engage, miss fortunes and support both run away despite being full hp and wave advantage.\n\nJust why.

Yeah, it's not supposed to be like this, but if you take yourself out of the situation, re-imagine it with clown music playing, that *is* kind of funny, isn't it? \n\n(shields head against white knights)\n\nOkay, seriously now, sorry.\nIf you're worried about winning, try to relax and remember that individual, even if repeated, events like this aren't actually important. Of course, identify the behavior if you're trying to win and don't take their lead, and remember the 40/40/20 rule. What really matters is what you do in those 20% of games that you are the determining factor of the outcome. The rest of the time? Stay cool and *play*. You will eventually make it to the rating you deserve, because really, if you're not a troll, the presence of trolls actually *gives you a slight advantage in the big picture*. 4/9 chances your team gets a troll, 5/9 probability the enemy gets one.\n\nAnd if you're playing for fun and it's spoiling the fun, take a break. Nothing is always fun. Joyride motorcycles need maintenence and the weather doesn't always agree. Movie marathons take up the whole day, potentially procrastinating that thing you probably shouldn't. Girlfriends ... ah, nevermind that example. I think you get the point. Go have fun with something else, or just chill out listening to music, opening a book, or trying out that cooking recipe that sounds really good. Then when you come back, remember those trolls were just having stupid fun at your expense, and *you're better than that*. Then enjoy yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaldorain","date":"2020-01-21T01:35:46.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even better yet, quit this game and go find another game that IS fun to play. \nRegardless what you may think of CoD, I never fired the game up and went... Man... I feel like I've wasted hours to get nothing out of it. Nor did I get absolutely pissed off at trolls back in my Halo 3 ranked days. \n\nMy recommendation, the current generation of gamers are a joke. Avoid team play games as much as possible. Get involved in the fighting game community, go to your local LGS and meet some new people. Get away from all these toxic \"players\" who seek to only ruin the game for other people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2020-01-13T05:02:30.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Wise Counsel ™**\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boppas","date":"2020-01-14T18:01:47.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and we all know who gets banned first :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"lamakisser","date":"2020-01-14T14:38:01.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant see the difference. theyre both everywhere and both ruin the game and the community","replies":[]},{"poster":"HazeVictory","date":"2020-01-13T18:13:01.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely this.
