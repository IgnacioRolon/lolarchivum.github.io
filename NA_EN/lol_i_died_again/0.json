Big numbers are not likely to pass, so what did he do? \n\nOpponents has dash and blink? Ok now I'll give my champ Mulptiple dash/blinks (to a point it's like infinite).\n\nAnother way is to inject some hidden stats via \"passive\", CertainlyT did it well. \n\nYet another way is stacking damage, the classical way is via AoE damage, the new way is stacking ability or stacking points: if you hit a Q then you can hit another Q; or stack multi points Q to proc consumption as a burst.\n\nHe also combines some nice ideas like \"extra dash\" (Thresh lantern), or \"slow box\" (Karthus+Veigar = Thresh's ult); or comebine untargetability to dash/pet would increase outplay ability to next level. Don't have to be 'ultimate' skill as low CD, it's good if that skill can be spammed.\n\n\nThat's the reason why when other designers starts to realize those, they also wants their designed champion has some \"nice\" damage. Which leads to the points of \"true damage\" as you see. \n\nExample: \n + Tom Kent has hidden stats like \"sustain+shield\" (for defense), and +8% health as damage (for attack). If this trend continues, many old champions have to be re-worked cause their old kits can not compete - their numbers are reduced already and some buffs would not exist past a few months because their is no \"smart way\" to hide that from testers.\n + Ekko also has some hidden stats but it's more obvious so the numbers are toned down a bit. Some later designed champs (like Juggernauts) were disguised smarter to avoid nerfs not soon as Ekko - for example, some %HP dmg ;-) .\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-10-22T16:32:10.451+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"What the actual hell does this have to do with anything?\nHate on CT if you want, but atleast be damn LOGICAL about it.\nCT had no part in Garen, GP, or Fiora.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Janna Me Fiddle","date":"2015-10-23T21:51:16.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=o9AGEhjg,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-10-22T11:14:55.840+0000)\n>\n> True damage is okay.\n> \n> What's actually disgusting is the %HP.\n\n^This all day.\n\nTrue damage is countered by building HP, %HP or %HP True damage (Looking at you Vayne and Jinx, more Jinx) has no counter other than \"Don't get hit by it\" \n\nJinx'es R is just plain disgusting, it makes me want to return to the days when Tristana and Lucian were the carries of choice.","replies":[{"poster":"L Rayquaza","date":"2015-10-24T04:14:30.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx ult is physical,  not true","replies":[{"poster":"Janna Me Fiddle","date":"2015-10-27T20:40:21.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's physical, doesn't stop it being disgusting because it has %HP damage","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akesgeroth","date":"2015-10-24T06:38:06.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely agree there.

But if the objective is to allow melee carries to be relevant damage wise while also being able to build tanky enough to survive to do said damage, %hp would seemingly be better than true damage imo.\n\n%HP damage falters against shields and gets blunted by by defense.  Typically %HP damage (physical or magical) is going to be vastly more effective against soft targets since they'll typically be grabbing one resist item and that's about it.  %HP damage mostly exists for the purpose of giving a champion relevant damage at all stages in the game against all targets without snowballing into itself too hard.\n\nTrue damage is specifically for tackling hard targets.  Tanks, Juggernauts, Bruisers, heavy Fighters and the like.  If the damage were tuned to still be viable against these targets while being Physical or Magic, it would pop soft targets near instantly.\n\nCombining the two means you want damage that is equally effective against all targets.  Case in point: Fiora.  Her whole thing is being able to effectively duel any champion in the game.  If her Innate was dealing physical damage it would be vastly inferior against hard targets.  If it were dealing flat True damage then it would likely be snowballing even *harder* against soft low HP folks.  As such, %HP True damage is the most workable solution.\n\nDamage types are simply tools.","replies":[{"poster":"Axis the Dragon","date":"2015-10-22T21:22:43.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"% BONUS hp true damage\n\nboom, affects tanks more than carries","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2015-10-23T02:07:11.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And make her not have a passive early game or vs carries?
