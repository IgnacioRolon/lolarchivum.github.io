So apologies in advance.\r\n\r\nI enjoy playing a bit of ARAM and this weekend played AR URF (Terribly!!). Previously (last year in the old client) in champion select I was able to click on the portrait of the champion i was assigned and I was then taken to an info page for that champion. I could see if they were AP or AD and got a quick overview of what their abilities entailed. In this new LoL client that doesn't seem to be an option. I find it immensely frustrating that when I am assigned a champ i`m not too sure about that their doesn't seem to be a quick way to find out what type of champion they are.\r\n\r\nAm I an idiot?? Please tell me that their is an easy way to find this info out and that I'm just somehow missing it. If this isn't an option anymore, could someone tell me why?  It seemed like a pretty fundamental and important feature to have in champion select.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T21:14:35.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a feature we have in the new client quite yet, but I can definitely see it's benefits!! Hit up the Client Discussion board with this idea to get more attention from the Devs and see what the community thinks!","replies":[{"poster":"madefrombeef","date":"2017-08-15T14:15:43.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.
