Why should some wildcat (Rengar for example) be able to kill a Demi-God Forge Being (Ornn for example) instantly.\n\nThis just goes to show how little effort some Assassin's need to kill someone when there are so many resources available to get higher burst (Duskblade, Dark Harvest/Electrocute, Stormrazor, Black Cleaver, Lord Dominik's Regards revert). As well as how poorly designed some of them are, due to low interactability (Rengar Q = Basic Attack Bonus damage [undodgeble], Kha'Zix Q point to click [undodgeble], Zed R Point to Click [Undodgeble] and damage unavoidable [without Zhonias] since Basic Attacks add on to the deathmark damage).\n\nOn top of all that (I know not everyone is like this) but some people who main Assassin's say that Assassin's should be able to do this and that and the eay that they say these thing suggests that they hold some sort of supremacy balief when it comes to their class, that they should be the most dominant and that they should be able to beat everyone.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Exin0","date":"2018-08-19T08:18:20.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first off all they need clarify for themselfs what they want and stick to it. if the want fastpace oneshot deathmatch its ok just tell it to people anyone who like it will remain others find another game now there is no direction no targeted audience one camp wait for game tilt to pure deathmatch another camp wait for game tilt to long strategic battleground and riot is oscilating between trying to cater to both sides which is creating mess. sorry for english :D","replies":[{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-08-19T09:35:02.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is they now have Nexus Blitz, a mode where it's all fast paced, meaning people constantly will be fighting (basically a battle royale).
