Every skillshot is randomly visually incorrect. It's been this way for a very long time if not since the beginning. Maybe one day they will fix it.\n\nIt doesn't have anything to do with the hitboxes. I would argue Morgana and Thresh and such are more blatant problem champs to deal with because their abilities are slower and therefore it's even more irritating when their skills don't go the angle they are pretending to. Every champ's skillshots can visually hit a target but actually miss them, just as they can visually miss a target but still hit them. I'm not sure how often it happens in an average game but I know it happens more often at certain angle ranges.\n\nThe skillshots definitely go to where they are targeted. The biggest issue I see with players who would ever claim otherwise with their own projectiles are those that would intentionally or accidentally click on a moving target instead of on the ground.\n\nWhy do you think people hate Zoe so much? Visually inaccurate skillshots. I'm not joking. It's not her kit that's frustrating, it's the randomness/inconsistency in visual display inaccuracy.\n\nTL;DR it's not a champion-specific problem. It happens to everyone. It's only frustrating for the opponents of the visually inaccurate abilities, but everyone sees the visual inaccuracy when it happens. It doesn't happen every time, but it happens every game for sure, so that Riot should be trying to fix it by now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-07-22T12:24:43.024+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":22,"body":"That’s how line skillshots work.
