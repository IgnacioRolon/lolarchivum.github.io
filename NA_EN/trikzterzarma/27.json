You literally get one shot by a Kha'zix auto if he has any sort of a lead... They are well overkilling their target, and I really do not think this is something that needs to be worried about. \n\nHalf of the champions in the list you gave shouldn't be in the list anyways as their objective isnt to one shot. To name a few: Akali (sustained pressure), Elise (hello this one is so super obviously not a burst mage XDDDDDDD), Jhin (you are joking right? This is an ADC not an assassin), Kassadin (again sustained pressure), Nidalee (i miss when she was sustained pressure, now she is a 1 shot carry which just doesnt feel good), Pantheon (this is where I know you are trolling, he was never supposed to one shot people like he does).\n\nThe problem with your argument is you are taking the current meta and supporting it with current meta roles. Half of their roles in the game have changed just this year where damage was ramped to obscene levels. Burst champions that are supposed to burst can still burst, nobody cares about that because that is what they are supposed to do. With Items and base damages they are doing it a full healthbar over what they need to. I've seen a 2-0 fizz 1 shot a Nasus through ulti who was 1-0. When that starts happening there is an issue with damage. \n\nThe across the board change is needed. A full reduction of base damages and scalings. The problem stems from the amount of damage that any champion going any build can put out. Soraka is better off poking than healing when given the option because she does alot of damage from level 1. Tanks who build one off-tank item are 1 shotting ADCs. Burst mages are 1 shotting tanks with alot of MR. ADCs are shredding everything with little to no effort. Bruisers have their sustain while still doing obscene amounts of damage. And this is the thing, if you played enough, you would know that all of this is an issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BIGCAT2000","date":"2018-06-11T05:36:31.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"at first i agreed with the post, then you helped me see it was wrong... so nerf everything besides health by 10% might as well then increase health by it instead","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightningShado","date":"2018-06-11T05:09:54.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nothing truer was ever said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2018-06-10T15:30:06.886+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":"this creates more problems than it fixes.

There's been entire metas centered around assassins in environments where tanks were waaaaaaaaaay tankier.\n\nAnd this opinion that tanks will win every fight when they've had their items' AR/MR gutted season after season is so dumb.  The main things increasing their durability are overloaded sustain/durability in resolve and if you nerf that tanks don't have much to speak of other than maybe Gargoyle's Stoneplate.  Go look at things like Force of Nature or old Randuin's Omen.  Tanks used to be way tankier and burst mages and assassins still had a place because guess what - YOU STILL NEED DAMAGE TO END GAMES!!!  No meta has ever been stack 5 tanks.  There's been 1 hypercarry 3 tank comps during patches where they were strong but those typically don't last long after item/mastery/rune tweaks.\n\nLike honestly even if you leave Resolve as is, the other trees are offering penetration and burst which outclasses Resolve early especially after that change that splits the health into other stats.  And if their health does become a problem look at all the champs that can pack % damage.  And those BorK and Liandries buffs.  Tanks are entirely based on health these days and health stacking has counterplay baked into soooo many champion kits.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"five oh tree ","date":"2018-06-10T21:44:19.788+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"let's do one massive sweeping change, that'll really fix everything.

Eliminating those invisible sources of stats is what first caused the damage spike, or at least made it noticeable.  It was surprising how important those relatively minor stats actually affected balanced.\n\nThis is where the new runes system has failed, imo.  Think of old runes: reds affected damage, yellows defence, blues for magic/ability, and glyphs were an extra boost to any one thing.  The new 'runes' (which are really masteries, idk why they called them runes) don't follow this at all.  Imagine if instead of the trees we have now, we were given a similar choice:\n\n1. Pick one damage modifyer: damage, attack speed, penetration, etc.\n2. Pick one defence modifyer: armour, HP, regen, etc.\n3. Pick one ability modifyer: magic resist, mana regen, CDR, etc.\n4. For glyphs, they could be the same as before (pick one stat to give a bigger boost), or they could be the keystone.  This would make more sense, as it would then more truly combine runes and masteries in one tree.\n\nThey could make this more sexy than just pure stat boosts.  They could implement the gathering storm idea, where you sacrifice early game stats for more late game.  You could do the opposite.  You could have stats tied to kills, to kda, to minions killed, to number of enemies nearby.  You still give players a chance to make the runes apply to their playstyle without introducing ridiculous things like Boneplate or Manaflow Band which is just the default choice for everyone.\n\nIt would be easier to balance, easier to understand, better able to adjust pre-match (similar to old runes, where you have a special armour page to use against assassins in lane, for example, whereas now you just go your default page most times) and put a serious dent on the early-game damage, which should reduce snowballing.  Doesn't solve the turret problems, but it's a start.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2018-06-10T13:47:24.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"If all champions are hit with the same nerf, how can they become overpowered? If, for example, Cho'gath and Annie were fighting, and you suddenly nerfed both of their damage by 10%, why would either of them get an advantage out of it?\nI ask because i've only been around since some time before the start of season 7, so I have never seen a tank meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-06-10T17:55:00.678+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Annie would suffer a lot from the 10% damage nerf. Her kit revolves arround oneshotting enemy champions. With 10% less damage this will be extremly difficult, even impossible. With her low range and squishiness playing annie would be a lot more difficult.\n\nOn the other side, cho gath is very tanky. Building tank items is a lot better, because their item efficiency is not reduced, whereas all ad/ap-items are 10% less efficient for the same price. Cho gath would be much harder to kill for a team, and he'd survive a lot longer in a teamfight and so he would do a lot more damage. Despite the 10% damage nerf. He can stay longer in a teamfight and do more attacks.\n\nYes you could argue that annie also survives longer because enemies do less damage, but this will probably not matter. After Annie flash tibbers and uses q and w, her spells are on cooldown. Even despite the enemies doing 10% less damage, they will still kill annie before her spells are off cooldown. In the time she survives longer she can do one auto attack at most.\n\nIf we only look at 1v1 annie and cho gath are not the best examples. Let's take leBlanc and jinx: In the current version leBlanc uses all her spells, jinx dies within 1 second. During this time jinx can attack once or twice. Leblanc looses half her hp. After 10% dmg nerfs, leblanc uses all her spells, but it's not enough to kill jinx. LeBlanc spells are all on cooldown, she can only auto attack for the next 5 seconds. Jinx kills leblanc after 3 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gramps69","date":"2018-06-10T15:34:39.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not so much a nerf to impact that early game/lane phase damage, it would be more impactful later on once team fights are starting.

There was alot of discussion about game balance that came to the conclusion that buffing instead of nerfing to balance a game made it more exciting, and in a certain way it does, and i believe that Riot has actually taken this to account. \n\nOR, \n\n2.) There has been some power creep over the last couple of patches and metas that have gone unnoticed.\n\n\nIf it were the first point, meaning Riot has purposely focused on buffing champs, they need to realize that continually buffing will, yes make the game more \"intense\" and \"exciting\", but that will only become a case of URF; something that's intense and fun for the first few games but quickly wears down and, by Riot's own words, makes even long term players quit the game.\n\nIf it is the latter however, i would be rather disappointed that they haven't noticed such a change occurring so drastically. With all the talk about games becoming faster and faster and with more and more people finding that their games end up incredibly stompy and one-sided one way or another, Riot really should have recognized this problem much earlier.\n\nEither way the solution is to carefully turn down the notch for all characters and most importantly, talk with the community about what your goal is with the meta: Not some \"we want to make the meta exciting and dynamic\" descriptive BS that avoids actually communicating but actual goals like \"Slow down all out teamfights but avoid making it into a game of cat and mouse where nothing happens till a team gets a clear advantage and the losing side just backs of and the winning side just slightly push an advantage while no kills occur\" as. well, this is whats happening all too often in the pro scene: Anybody remember the \"fight you f**king p**sies!\" line? yeah. Final rounds to decide the winner of the year and of the league cup and no kill for 20 minutes. incredibly disappointing.\n\nAlong with the great points that Dorans Pants have mentioned this is all i really have to say.
