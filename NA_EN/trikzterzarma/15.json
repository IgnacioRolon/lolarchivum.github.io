There will always be a strongest, but they won't be as bullshit to deal with as the true top tier.","replies":[{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2018-06-28T02:28:17.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wanfear,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5JGGrdkp,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2018-06-28T00:49:27.506+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s not as true for URF as it is for regular games.

As long as math exist we are going to figure out who is the best quickly. We only see the current lineup as \"bullshit\" because they are the strongest.
