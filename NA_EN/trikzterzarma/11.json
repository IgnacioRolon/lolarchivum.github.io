Releasing a buggy and nonworking game for 60 dollars, straight up lying about content in the game, and scamming people with their 200 dollar Power Armor edition. All of this has more or less killed Bethesda.\r\n\r\nAnd now Blizzard. Announcing a new MOBILE Diablo game. Then just dropping the news of Heroes of the Storm. If you haven&#039;t heard about it, they are gonna remove some of the staff working on the game and put them on other objects, meaning alot less patches and little new content. At the same day, they revealed that every big tournament is cancelled next year. This without telling anyone i advance, leaving many proplayers and coaches without a job.\r\n\r\nWhat is going on? Has gaming companies just stopped care about their fans? Without us players, game companies would not even exist.\r\n\r\nPlease Riotgames, dont jump on the bandwagon. If anything big is going to happen, tell us a long time in advance so we are prepared on it. Listen to the players. Don&#039;t get to greedy with money.","replies":[]}
