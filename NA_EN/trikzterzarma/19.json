I am not crying I simply described a very common situation in a pretty funny way. Point and click CC abilities are an issue and do need to be reworked (to have more rewarding gameplay and a healthier game overall), but Fiddlesticks is only annoying not broken and worth crying over. Look at my champion {{champion:245}} his stun is so hard to set up, but very rewarding once done, other than that his speed boost is 3 hits and even his slow is a skill shot. Fiddle 3 point and click abilities, and 1 AOE ultimate. Wouldn't you want a fiddlesticks that takes more skill to play and in this way he can also be stronger, but only if played more skillfully.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Keirm","date":"2019-06-05T05:30:55.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fid is actually a trash champ.
