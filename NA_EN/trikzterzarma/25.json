Why? Because it was just absurd and extremely fun! You could go with things that wasn't good at all in normals, but worked extremely well in URF! \r\n\r\nI've wanted to play AP Ashe for the entire weekend, because it's fun as hell sniping someone down with her ult, but the game haven't given her to me at all. \r\n\r\nURF was all about picking whatever champ you want and test out new things, and just slam your head on the keyboard and spam spells all game. It was FUN! Getting a completely random champ, often a champ you really don't want, and having to play with that champ for around 20 minutes **isn't fun at all.**\r\n\r\nNext time, at least give us 10 bans, and allow us to play whatever we want after that.
