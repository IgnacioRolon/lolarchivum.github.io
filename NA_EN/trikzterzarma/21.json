If it's so easy then why don't they land their stun on the yi. Lol. You literally have to have multiple abilities with hard cc between at least a couple people just to guarantee you can stop the yi because he's so hard to hit.

If you waste your cc on a low priority enemy and get punished you missed an opportunity for counterplay. Even not using cc is counterplay since your opponent might not dare to engage when it's still available.\n\n> With that logic, no champion in the game is broken, because \"you can just stun them\". And if that was the case, everyone would pick a champ that has hard-cc.\n\nI agree, cc is useful against many champions, but there's always a trade-off. I you pick hard cc you will sacrifice damage, mobility or other useful stats for it. Your team needs a little bit to ground mobile opponents or kite, but any more than necessary will hurt your team.\n\n> Stun Yi? Good luck when he's alpha striking all over the place.\nStun Katarina? Good luck when she blinks three times in a fight (Oh, and Kata can oneshot you without her ult)\n\nJust because it's challenging doesn't mean it's not counterplay. Quite the opposite, you can easily hit Yi directly after his Q, but Yi can save his Q until you use your cc. This creates an interesting environment of anticipation and execution both sides have to play around. That's like the very definition of counterplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-08-17T10:02:54.631+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Doesn't even have to be a stun, a snare, a root, any hard CC will do, but if your team comp is so crappy that you don't have any hard CC, you don't have any right to complain when you lose.","replies":[{"poster":"TrikzterzArma","date":"2018-08-17T10:09:57.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oWh5A47U,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-08-17T10:02:54.631+0000)\n>\n> Doesn&#x27;t even have to be a stun, a snare, a root, any hard CC will do, but if your team comp is so crappy that you don&#x27;t have any hard CC, you don&#x27;t have any right to complain when you lose.\n\nThat's not what I said lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-08-17T10:15:44.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying and it is true.
