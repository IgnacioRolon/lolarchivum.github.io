You don't get to complete Duskblade at level 1 so that number is irrelevant, by the time you actually finish Duskblade you're gonna be like level 7-9. Phreak's patch notes video has a table that contains how much damage you would need to do from 8-18 against Jhin with 0 armor to make up for the loss of the Duskblade proc. It was about 1150 premitigation at level 8 to put that in perspective Kha's against an isolated target at level 8 plus an auto attack and proc does about 1050. Keep in mind this is almost best case scenario, against higher armor targets the number is even higher for the break even point. Realistically speaking the only duskblade users that aren't actually nerfed by this change at all points in the game are the ones that get to auto attack a lot or have a massive AoE.  So it's a nerf on EVER duskblade user at all points in the game except {{champion:62}} and ironically for the crying ADC mains {{champion:21}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Envonyx","date":"2018-08-30T01:59:54.723+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":23,"body":"Yes!
