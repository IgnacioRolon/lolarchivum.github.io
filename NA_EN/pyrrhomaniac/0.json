That being said, we're making a big push to fix tons of legacy bugs, so you should notice a substantial increase in the speed at which bugs are getting fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2017-06-29T18:55:23.935+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It would be nice in the future if someone could simply say \"We're aware of X bug but it's low on our list of priorities, but we will get to it eventually\" rather than dead silence on a bug that has existed for close to a year. I can understand that it's low priority amidst all the gameplay bugs out there, but having it reported constantly with no sign of it being noticed sucks. I've reported this bug several times and I know others who report it weekly. Save us some time and effort by letting players know the status of what's going on.","replies":[]}]}]}
