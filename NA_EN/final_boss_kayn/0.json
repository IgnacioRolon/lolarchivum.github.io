I never ordered a TPA Shen skin... ever... it just... &quot;appeared&quot; a few days ago. And i&#039;m sure I wasn&#039;t drunk when I got it because I don&#039;t drink and I certainly don&#039;t do drugs. Plus I don&#039;t even like TPA skins (no offense) But did it just happen because of an event or what?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-06-06T04:04:29.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mystery gift from someone, or did it really just appear with absolutely no message?","replies":[{"poster":"Final Boss Kayn","date":"2016-06-06T04:14:40.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No message what so ever.
