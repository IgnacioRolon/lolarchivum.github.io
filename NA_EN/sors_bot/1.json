When taking a look at the Legendary, we opened up a dialogue about who Vayne is in her base thematic and who she is in the Project universe. When you hear base Vayne, you hear the Gothic horror influences. It's consistent with our remorseless monster hunter, and the melodramatic purr really works to reinforce those thematic elements. When shifting to Project, we found her base VO, while iconic, took away from what we were trying to do with this particular skin. It's always our hope to give players the best possible experience we can. Shifting away from base Vayne's VO and leaning into the Project thematic created the most cohesive experience and one that we were excited to share with all of you.","replies":[{"poster":"Rojo176","date":"2017-11-09T23:26:28.302+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the main question was whether or not the voice actress is the same as the original, not as much about the lines being too far from her character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cHAncEman1292","date":"2017-11-09T22:33:48.712+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to respond. I believe the issue with the voice is something reminiscent of the issues players had with Fiora. There was whiplash because there was a disconnect between what Riot believed were some of the iconic elements of the character and what players gravitated to. Vayne resonates with a lot of players, and personally I feel like she's a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. \n\nI never thought about it until I heard this skin's VO but Vayne's voice is integral to her character. She should come across as twisted, confident and dark. In my opinion the voice over work for this legendary is the weakest part of this skin - I believe other players feel the same way. The VO of this legendary doesn't feel like a different interpretation of Vayne but the delivery of the VO lines leaves a lot to be desired. When I play Vayne want to I feel wicked, aloof and remorseless. \n\nI love the work done on the skin. I just believe the VO delivery didn't preserve an essential element of Vayne's character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-11-09T23:41:13.075+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the issue is that PROJECT: Vayne’s voice sounds so disturbingly close to Sivir’s that it’s hard to imagine it being anyone else but Sivir. The skin itself is rad, the  lines are well-written/thematic, and the delivery of the VA is great. But, that’s Sivir in Vayne’s body, and the voice is too far removed from what makes Vayne, Vayne (which is precisely those pointed, melodramatic, gothic horror tones). For that reason, it’s difficult to feel immersed in the fantasy of the skin, in my humble opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Idols","date":"2017-11-10T00:43:32.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Diggity Jones,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=j78wRLx5,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-11-09T18:35:49.949+0000)\n>\n> Hey there, I&#x27;m the VO Producer at Riot, and I wanted to give you all a heads up as to why we moved in the direction we did on Vayne&#x27;s VO.
