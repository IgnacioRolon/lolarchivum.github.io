I have ran the 'tracert' command in CMD prompt and added a screenshot of the results to this post. \r\n\r\n I am unsure how to fix.

This specific traceroute doesn't give a whole lot of info of how your network is reaching our game server, but I appreciate it nonetheless!  Instead, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run it again for a few minutes.  This will give us a better idea of where your connection is going exactly, and if there's any hiccups along the way. \n\nKeep in mind, though, that the issue isn't necessarily always with an ISP and could be more local issues or settings causing hiccups.  I suggest running through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide just in case to make sure your network locally is in good health.  Let me know how that goes!","replies":[{"poster":"Hyperbolic","date":"2017-05-05T21:51:29.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your response!

It looks like your ping is getting high as soon as it leaves your modem and gets to your ISP just outside your home.  You may want to hit up your ISP and show them those logs so they can look into that node.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Hyperbolic","date":"2017-05-05T23:38:57.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I called my ISP. They had me run a speed test to their location. Ping was only 2ms. And then they just repeating over and over how it was not on their end.  I relayed all the information above and they still just kept saying it is not on their end and the test was proof.  *Frown* Can you help?","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-05-15T14:37:11.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The speed test they get you to run is made to do that (make it look like it's not on their end)\nso that's why MTR is used instead.\nTell them it starts on the dsl-208-102-92-1.fuse.net node and that it's inconsistent.\nYes, you're going to have to nag them about it.
