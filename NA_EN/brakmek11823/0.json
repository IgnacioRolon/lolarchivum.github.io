In game I get disconnected at least once a minute for 3 seconds to as much as 30 seconds. The game isn't registering what I do at all, but it does register what everyone else does. I walk up to kill some creeps, stop in place where I last clicked, can't move anywhere or cast anything. Enemy comes up to me and basic attacks me to death and I can't do shit. I don't know if this is some kind of firewall thing or something that prevents me from sending data to the server or what, but as of now, the game is completely unplayable. This has only been happening since I got the new client. Please help if anyone can.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-27T00:50:58.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You could be having issues specifically connecting to the game server and it could be a local or ISP issue.  I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your PC and get a better overview.
