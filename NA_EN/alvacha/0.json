Tbh, this list is probably redundant, but I'm proud of it and will use any excuse to post it.\n\nI've sorted them into sections based on area or allegiance and listed the champions in the story.  If you see that I’m missing a story, please mention it.  \nI know that some stories appear more than once. For example, Kalista's stories are under Shadow Isles AND Independent, because she has ties to the Isles, but she also regularly operates outside of them.\nI only put things here if they are in story format, so no champion backstory, just actual stories.\n\nBandle City\n[From the Journal of Professor Cecil B.

Champ bios and stories (those that have them) can be read in any order, yet many are related. I mean, Jhin has a large connection to Zed and Shen yet reading them out of order won't hurt the story telling yet reading Shen and Zed's bio first might give more insight to Jhin stories for example.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2018-02-08T00:18:16.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, so I know you're probably not expecting this, but I have something to tell you.\n\nI was going through a \"routine\" check of my story-archive and found that an unacceptable amount of the stories listed had dead links or something like that, so I went through and cleaned everything up.  The updated list has been re-posted here, but editing a comment doesn't notify the OP, so here's your notification.  Have a good one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2018-01-31T02:42:11.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great, I am genuinely excited for you! \n\nThe first thing I will say is get everything off the League of Legends \"Universe\" website. Everything there is canon (yet still subject to change) everything not on there is likely retconned.\n \nGo to the regions tab on the universe page and choose one, read the summary of the region then read every champion's biography and short stories. After reading them all, read the \"Region story(s)\". These serve to flesh out the region more and a lot of times include several champions that you've previously read about. Once you are done with a region, move on to the next. \n\nWhich region you start in really doesn't matter in the end, but I do have suggestions now that I try to look back in the eyes of a new comer:\n\nFirst, I would avoid starting in regions with \"un-updated\" lore. The game went through a retcon and while all the lore on the universe page is \"friendly\" to the retcon, a lot of it WILL change down the road, not to mention that the old lore was a lot more \"simple\" to put it kindly. Considering this, I would put off reading lore from these regions: Freljord, The Void, Ionia, and Bandle City (especially this one, It will likely completely change), and Noxus (Noxus will be updated very soon though). There is no harm done in reading them after the others, but I wouldn't want your first lore experience to be something that might be retconned. It is pretty easy to tell what has been updated and what hasn't, if the character has a long story, probably their permanent lore.\n\nAs for which one you Should start in, I would recommend reading Piltover --> Zaun. These regions are heavily related and the champions that inhabit them are numerous and diverse, and this diversity allows for these two regions to have many strings connecting to other regions. \n\nAgain, I am super excited for you, I would love to read your impressions of each region on this board if/when you finish a region!\n\n\nEdit: Champions may also have supplementary material like comics or shorts that flesh out their character and they are usually amazing.

So... start wherever you want, it doesn't really matter.\n\nMy recommendation is to pick a Champion that interests you and go to their Universe page. They'll have a bio, and in many cases will also have a color story (this is especially true for recently released or reworked champs). Most of the regions also have their own overarching story. You can also go to Universe's main page and just pick one of the recently released stories (Varus just got his lore redone, for example, and Swain is releasing soon.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-01-30T14:41:01.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As it was pointed out already, the Universe page is the best place to start, however if a link to a story is broken look for the story in the Lol Wiki since there are a few missing links in the Universe page.","replies":[]}]}
