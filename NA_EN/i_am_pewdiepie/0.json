And it's not in all game only sometimes and for me it was only invisible when it was in me. I could Q it somewhere else and it would travel there but as long as it was over oriannas head it was invisible. Made it really confusing to play","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-04T18:02:33.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey again! \n\nThanks for the additional context here.

I know that I played her again a day later and used Sewn Chaos and the bug did not occur.\n\nEdit: Though I did notice that my ball would disappear if it was on someone and they died. But once I used an ability it would show up again.","replies":[]}]}]}
