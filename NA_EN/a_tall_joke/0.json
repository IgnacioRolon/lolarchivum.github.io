I've mained him since I started playing end of season II and got to Gold II maining him season 3. Not much has changed for him (other than the increase in assassins and mobility and some minor buildpath changes which weren't really Veigar-targeted) since I started playing the game so I'm not really sure about the direction Riot intends to take him in but I thought I'd give my input.\n\n**Identity**\n1. Infinite scaling. It's the primary thing that drew me to Veigar and kept me playing him; there's a certain draw to the infinite potential power that Veigar has. So, when Veigar has very little that other mages can't do, this is the one thing that keeps Veigar awesome.\n2. Immobile, traditional mage. Veigar is as traditional a mage as you get. He dons the traditional FF I Black Mage inspired robe and hat, wields a staff, is immobile, has cast times (W and E), and deals a lot of damage, both to single targets and in an area.\n3. Burst damage. This is a tough one because Veigar can be really frustrating to play against. You get hit by a stun and by the time it's over, you're dead, no doubt. But this is definitely a core component of Veigar's identity and it is a large part of his gameplay pattern.\n\n**Kit**\n*Passive:* This needs to change. All other champions with mana based passives are at least getting rewarded for interaction. Veigar's passive is 100% passive and his ridiculously high mana costs are balanced around having a passive that recovers mana. His mana costs need to be rescaled and he needs a new passive that actually affects his gameplay patterns (because emptying your mana so you get more mana isn't a gameplay pattern)\n\nTo be honest, both thematcally and gameplay-wise, a passive like Cassiopeia's new passive would've fit well, giving him distinct points in the game at which he improves (and consuming your soul to get strong is pretty Veigar-esque) and building up to be a hyper-carry.\n\n*Q:* is completely fine. This makes Veigar Veigar.\n\n*W:* With the high delay before it lands, it almost certainly has to be used in conjunction with E to hit someone. The only utility it provides is a moment of vision, controlling enemy pathing (which E does very well anyway) and discouraging chases (only time it'll land without E support). Otherwise, it's raw damage that's not very exciting.\n\n*E:* is probably Veigar's best skill and the only thing that keeps him viable. Landing it perfectly can be challenging with a lot of moving pieces in team fights (or Fizz jumping around the map) and it's equally rewarding. No complaints here, other than the egregious weakness to QSS (but veigar gets it better than Malz so he's fine).\n\n*R:* Single target burst which maintains his identity as a traditional, burst caster. Neither good nor bad.\n\nI'm of mixed feelings about the enemy AP scaling. On one hand, it provides a mechanism for Veigar to pull back when he's behind which is bound to happen.\nOn the other hand... It punishes enemies for doing exactly what they should be doing. It also creates a weird power dichotomy where Veigar may be slaughtering AP champions 20 mins into the game but AD champions can get out unscathed, making him weirdly extra-weak to AD assassins. It's a weird purely champion and build based strength/weakness. This also expends a lot of his power budget unnecessarily. Later in the game, anyone who builds enough AP for this to be significant will melt regardless. But this takes away opportunities for power elsewhere in Veigar's kit.\n\n\nPrimary points to target are his Passive and his W; removing target AP scaling from his ultimate can provide an extra lever to better his balance around (though his ult becomes incredibly boring at that point).\n\nEDIT: One more vital thing I forgot to point out: CDR!!! My typical build was Athene's > DFG which meant early game turtling to mid-game kill potential. with 35% after masteries, I could minimize my downtime between bursts and maximize my Q farm. There is now a gaping CDR hole in Veigar's life that does sort of desperately need to be filled.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-01-20T00:35:49.222+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to buff veigar: \nStep one: GIVE HIM BACK HIS FUCKING LAUGH","replies":[{"poster":"Salzigorimando","date":"2015-01-20T00:38:06.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-01-20T01:07:57.596+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bug introduced in a previous patch caused his ult to not prompt Veigar's laugh emote whenever he murders a champion with his Primordial Burst.\n\nThis was unanimously agreed upon to be a serious nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Salzigorimando","date":"2015-01-20T01:30:55.835+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"!

His Q stacks AP with minion, monster, or champion kills, none of which a support is meant to do. Dark Matter is a delayed aoe that requires precise aim, an incredibly inattentive enemy, or use of his E, to land. Considering the only useful thing Veigar offers as support is the utility of his stun, wasting this on attempting to land Dark Matter is a very poor decision.\n\nIn short, Veigar support, like many current supports, is an unintended consequence of the meta shifting. In this position, Veigar is significantly outclassed by proper supports, hence a lack of play.\n\nIn other words, why waste Veigar's potential as a hyper-scaling, nuke by sending him bot-lane when he can provide the same level of utility in teamfights by sending him mid-lane?","replies":[{"poster":"Yormaughm","date":"2015-01-20T04:07:37.711+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main support Veigar too, and I realize he isn't \"best\" as a support, but that doesn't make him a bad support. And since when do we have to define every champion by what they do \"best?\" Isn't pigeonholing every champion into only one role and only one build something that makes the game stale and rigid and something that Riot would be wise to try to avoid? \n\nI have absolutely had games where I've carried the team as support Veigar, and it's awesome when you pull it off and when the team acknowledges it.\n\nPeople always say Veigar is useless unless he gets farm with his Q. But just because something *exists* doesn't mean you have to use it. Several champions have abilities that scale off of the damage type that they don't primarily do. There's something in their kit that they *can* do that isn't being done, that doesn't make them useless. In fact sometimes the versatility and ability to do something *other than* what everyone *thinks* you're going to do will pay off big time.\n\nI run Movespeed and CDR runes, I never buy DFG so I won't even care about it when it's gone (on Veigar at least.) I always bought Morellos for the CDR. Veigar's rank 5 E with full CDR is like a 9 second cooldown, and I pretty much consider it the best stun in the game. But it's not like he doesn't have drawbacks. He doesn't have great range and he has no mobility at all so if he misses his stun he's basically dead (this is true of mid-Veigar as well.) People argue that he's poorly designed cause he's basically never trades, he either wins 100 - 0 or loses 0 - 100, but I don't see why that can't exist as long as it doesn't apply to every character in the game. He's high risk/high reward.\n\nYou asked about why \"waste\" Veigar's potential bot lane when he provides the same utility in teamfights if he's mid. I assume you're referring to his stun. Thing is, if he's the support, you get all the utility that Veigar was going to bring to a teamfight if he was mid....and you also get the utility of having another mid. Why take one mid and one support when you can take two mids? I realize this is something that Riot has been trying to discourage, but I believe it's just a shift in the meta that's not going to go away unless they're are incredibly persistent with nerfs to mages (which they sort of have been.)\n\nOne super nice thing about support Veigar is that if things start to go sour, he can build as if he were mid-Veigar without much change to his build path. This has saved me before in games where we have a disconnect or it's a 4 v 5 from the start. Sure he's not as strong as mid-Veigar would have been, but he's still more dangerous than most supports who start building AP, plus....he can build AP with his Q without buying anything. It's a last resort as a support, but in situations like I mentioned above, or if for some reason your ADC isn't in the lane, you can pick up a little bit of AP here and there.\n\nAlso, even if you support perfectly and never farm AP with your Q, support Veigar's R is *still* a threat to the enemy AP champions, *because* it scales off of their AP. He's a well-rounded character IMO because he can be played in more than one way. But most Mid-Veigars and people who don't play Veigar disagree with this, they see him as an all-or-nothing glass cannon. He's very potent when played that way, but if you're an unselfish player who understands how huge his impact can be in teamfights and when he's allowed to roam around, support Veigar is more fun IMO.\n\nHere's another argument for why support Veigar works. A well placed stun can stop a 3 v 2 gank cold. Most supports can only stun one character, and even if Event Horizon misses it can still be a pretty large area of denial, unless they're super mobile and can jump or flash over it. Veigar's E is like a better version of Thresh's R. Also, anyone stupid enough to teleport near Veigar will get stunned too, so even top lane ganks aren't scary if they enemy is an idiot and does it right on top of you (I've seen it happen many times.) Then mid-late game, if things have gone well, you can roam and create chaos everywhere. (Which honestly supports should be doing if they're warding/sweeping appropriately.)\n\nNow you might say that only works in low ELO or would never work in ranked games, and maybe that's true. I don't play ranked, and don't care to, but Support Veigar is easily one of my favorite roles and it can be quite hard for people to deal with so I wholeheartedly disagree that he's not as good as a \"proper\" support would be.\n\nWhat makes supports good anyway? Stuns. And Veigar's is IMO the best in the game.\n\nIf they're going to change Veigar, the one thing the absolutely cannot change is his E. It's what makes him viable and fun. Well that and the rare dunk with his W. Nothing like killing someone with that, especially if you just predicted their movement correctly. Or if they popped Zhonya's with no health :)","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-01-20T04:52:08.327+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said Veigar was a bad support, nor suggested he should stay out of the bottom lane. My intent was to point out Veigar was not *designed* to be a support. He is a mage, through and through. This thread was posted to discuss changes to Veigar because with the removal of Deathfire Grasp Riot commented on adjusting The Tiny Master of Evil to compensate this loss. Any changes to Veigar are going to affect whatever position he is used in, whether it be in as an APC or support.\n\nVeigar has not received any significant changes to his kit since Patch 3.9, nearly two years ago, and that was only to normalize the delay of his Dark Matter. All of us who play Veigar, either as mid-lane mages or bot-lane supports, are concerned about possible changes to his kit. My argument is that Veigar is a mage, first and foremost, and though it is incredibly selfish of me to say, I would prefer any tweaks done to him preserve his role as a mage.\n\nChampions that escape their typical restrictions within a meta are viewed critically by Riot. Should an anomaly prove oppressive, that champion is promptly nerfed. Lulu, for example, was a designed as a support, but when the meta shifted to permit her dominance in the top-lane, along with Soraka, she was nerfed. Despite Riots best attempts to preserve her primary role as a support, Lulu suffered overall. I do not want Veigar to follow a similar path.\n\nI love Veigar, I play him frequently, perhaps more than any other mid-lane pick, though Viktor is a close second. He will always be a mage to me, no matter what role the meta permits him to take.","replies":[{"poster":"Salzigorimando","date":"2015-01-20T04:58:13.512+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"so what you're saying is, riot stricty enforces the meta.\n\nHmmm.\n\nI know of no evidence to the contrary now that I think about it.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-01-20T05:29:42.901+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, which is why I was heartbroken when Lulu was nerfed.

It's a nerf yes, but will it ruin him? After all you won 5 games in the screenshot you linked above without ever building DFG.\n\nAnd yeah, the \"Riot enforces the meta\" comment above isn't completely wrong, they claim they don't but then they also use the \"character identity\" fuzzy language to make excuses for when they do enforce the meta. \n\nMost of the discussion in this thread has been about Veigar's identity, he definitely has one, and it's definitely important to Veigar players, myself included. With the exception of his passive, which is boring (but more awesome than people realize) each of his moves is quite unique despite the fact that to anyone fighting Veigar they all seem pretty simple and similar. (Get stunned, get nuked 3 times.) Fact is there are little aspects of each of his moves that matter a whole lot more than just \"they do damage,\" and those are what create his identity. \n\nPassive - Allows him to stay in lane, and makes building mana items, which is a big deal for most mages, a tertiary concern for Veigar.\nQ - Only ability that lets you build AP without having to buy items. Strongly influences how he's played in lane and gives him the potential to hypercarry if the game goes on long enough.\nW - Grants vision before it hits. And I remember reading that it has the highest AP ratio in the game.\nE - One of the only and definitely best AOE stuns in the game, though difficult to land perfectly (unlike say Amumu's ult.) Also the only thing that makes Veigar viable, please don't ever change this.\nR - Only ability that scales off of your opponent's AP. Feels really oppressive if Veigar is ahead, but feels really necessary if he's behind. This is a big part of what makes support Veigar viable too.\n\nI'm not saying I think Veigar should be made into a pure support. One of the reasons I think he's a good support is the fact that he's also a good mage and one of the reasons he's fun is that he could be either. No matter which role we play him in though, as Veigar mains I think we're all afraid that when Riot finally looks at Veigar to decide what to do with him they'll probably nerf him rather than compensate him for losing DFG. That's why personally if they just took DFG out of the game and promised not to change Veigar at all, I'd be ok with it. Because if they give him more damage, people are gonna bitch until he get's hard nerfed. But as a support Veigar player I'm probably in the minority who think losing DFG isn't a big deal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-01-20T01:17:41.551+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/GY8bpWR.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-01-20T18:27:32.664+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't know about the complaints about AP scaling on Veigar's ult.

It makes sense thematically the way his ult works, and I think that part of the counter play to him is not stacking AP, or picking an AD assassin. With DFG being removed, he will now actually need the enemy AP scaling on his ult to have the same anti-mage burst, which I think is overall better for him as a counter pick type of champion. I think Event Horizon and Baleful Strike should stay the same (both are incredibly distinctive parts of his kit), but Dark Matter should be changed.

It should in my opinion deal a little less damage, but also have another effect of some sort, maybe along the lines of shredding MR when it hits.\n\nAs for his passive, it is a little blah and a little boring, but it allows for him to have a very strong kit. If they gave him a stronger passive, they would have to nerf his abilities in some way, like weakening their damage or reducing his stun, or anything really. I like having his passive, because with a Tear into Seraph's (my usual mana item of choice on him) build, it allows him to regen large amounts of mana with ease (his base regen, plus Seraph's, plus his passive means he never goes oom), which is exactly what almost any burst mage craves. I understand that you prefer the lower cool down oriented build style on him, and I prefer the higher raw damage long cool down build instead, and that is all personal preference. With the nerfs to so many mana regen items and the upcoming removal of DFG, I think it may ultimately push Veigar back into relying most on the Seraph's build instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-01-20T09:19:35.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mr shred on Veigar's W if it stays the same would be a bad idea as the delay often can and will make it the last that hits in Veigar's combo","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-20T13:01:52.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I don't play him enough to remember that, but I see your point.

Veigar is a traditional mage; nothing lorewise would imply he's mean to be an antimage. And the only part of his kit which at all implies he's an anti-mage would be his ultimate.\n2. Countering through picks/item decisions has been explicitly stated to be a design philosophy to be avoided.

Not only is it an inefficient use of his Q, it also provides no early game power, especially defensive power which veigar desperately craves. He doesn't go OOM with Chalice either (courtesy of his stupid passive haha. Lower mana costs!). Also, Veigar rarely craves more raw AP; his burst damage scales pretty well with 1-2 pure AP items (like... DFG + Deathcap). At any rate, with strategic diversity being a very distinct design goal, multiple buildpaths should be viable. Reduced access to CDR  is just one more straw to break the Camel's back.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-21T15:08:32.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, I don't play him frequently and this is what I considered to be Veigar based on seeing other people play him.\n\nAlso, whether you think his kit says \"anti-mage\" or not, it is what he has become over the years.

Veigar favourite champ here, playing him since end of S2, shared my toughts on other posts.\n\nI feel like you are right on most stuff, however if i must drop my toughts...\n\n1) the passive is a bit less passive than you think: this is not a mere mana regen instrument but one that changes dinamically during the game: it can allow you to keep casting and regenerating loads of mana while at low % and keep farming Q, plus giving a different mana swing to him.\nSure, is not a real \"buff\" for him since he pays it with high mana costs, but a player can play around it with itemization.\n\n2) i think the scaling must remain traditional without weird architectures like the cassiopeia one that only delays uselessly his powers and add unnecessary mechanics\n\n3)I like W as it is now. Remember when the delay was even bigger? that' s when landing an E was necessary, but actually i manage to land a lot of W on an enemy by predicting him. Sure, sometimes is the enemy that is a doofus but the good thing about W is that it is a psycological attack: you can trap him in a way, force him to take more steps, force him to choose to pick a creep or leave it be and so on. Plus it has a nice team synergy with allied cc's.\nJOLLY COOPERATION!!\n\n4)I don' t like actual E and R actually. I mean, it' s not like i really dislike them, it' s just they are the more plain thing on his kit. Landing a good E can be sometimes a great act of skill when you have to trap enemies that walks in or more than one but i find being able to stun on the edge really lame; i would prefer a little delay like Thresh ulti, else it has a too much oppressive power ( we are talking about a 1,5-2,5 sec stun istant!).\nAbout R, i would really really like it to be a different kind of burst. Still a burst, Veigar is a nuker and ' s all good, but maybe with less spam potential ( like \"i see ahri- one shot one kill late game\"). And mostly without AP: Veigar is not an anti-mage, it' s not in his personality and the enemy ap scaling it just bad as it is now because only adds raw power. Maybe making it still dependand on enemy stats, so they ahve some kind of pressure on what they build ( it should not be good, but if it is clear to the enemy why not?) but equal for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"A Tall Joke","date":"2015-01-19T22:33:47.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, thank for sharing :) In response, I'd say\n\n1) The passive still plays very passively. I'm not actively doing anything to maximize or minimize its impact onto the game. Deliberately keeping my mana low would be very dangerous as I need my mana to interact with other champions. Especially when being ganked.\n\n2) I agree for sure! His linear AP scaling with bursts from buying items work fine for him now. I was just pointing to a potential direction that could be engaged (though mirroring Cassiopeia is definitely not what I'm asking!)\n\n3) I'd say I never land W's on enemies that give me satisfying games :P. The cooperation is a fair point though-- not dissimilar to Yasuo's ultimate.\n\n4) I like E as the only legitimate utility he provides for his team and the only thing really keeping him viable at higher level play. It is definitely oppressive and I see why people might hate it (but then again, QSS exists)\n\nAs for his ultimate, I agree. I don't like the enemy AP scaling (as mentioned) and I think that remaking his ultimate is a great lever but I'd prioritize his passive for sure and his W still isn't all that great.\n\nBut that's just my perspective at any rate haha.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-01-20T03:20:51.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"His aoe stun is toxic, and really should be tuned down a bit, at least the friggin duration.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-20T19:21:17.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tenacity makes it tickle.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-01-20T23:25:15.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats nice, I mean theirs only like what, 2 items with tenacity?

It also needs to be so wide because that's the only actual zoning he has. Without it he'll either have to get hugely increased damage to compensate his vulnerability, or increased mobility to better position himself, both of which would raise him into true op levels. \n\nBesides, unless he goes nuts and dives he shouldn't be able to hit anyone vital with it without dying in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-01-21T00:03:49.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He doesn't need an AOE stun for this, a single targeted stun would be perfect, His stun takes up an entire lane, thats completely unneeded even if hes squishy.\n\nBut thats probably what you get if you build a kit around his stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Salzigorimando","date":"2015-01-21T01:08:55.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly sure his kit was built around his Q actually, since that's where everything he is comes from, and where he gets all his strength.
