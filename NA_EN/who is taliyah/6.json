There's quantifiable amounts of chance and all of these mechanics have delays (You need to buy lots of crit for it to turn on, plants and dragons reveal where they are and what they are before spawn).  \n\nHowever with shit like Zoe W and Kleptomancy it feels like the RNG is getting out of control.  There's like 10+ things you can get from Klepto, we know they're balanced in pools but if we're not given information on what the pools are or what the %s are then for all we know Riot could \"rebalance\" it and without weeks or months of tracking results across multiple players we'd actually have no idea if their changes went through or if they're bugged or if Riot fibbed about them... \n\nLeague is pretty math heavy and part of player skill is calculating plays in a split second.  If there's a bunch of hidden information on crucial game mechanics that can swing fights its honestly pretty bullshit.  I really don't mind having pools of RNG if its clear how they work because we can petition for change if it turns out to be imbalanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2017-11-26T20:42:21.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you even get out having this information laid out in front of you?    \nEven if Elixir of Skill's chance to be stolen is 1%, what relevance does this have to you?

Zoe is definitely more complicated with having something like 36 items but if they made it just summoner spells that drop off minions and it had a specified rate (maybe cannon minions only) you'd have enough predictable elements to be balancable.\n\nHonestly I'm more concerned with it being balancable and having the numbers change if they're ass which is why it should be public, it'd also make it easier to argue how consistent/balanced these things are if certain elements should be removed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-11-27T00:02:32.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rng inst supposed to be predictable the it is rng because it is unpredicable.
