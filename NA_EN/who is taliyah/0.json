The past 2 days were like heaven for me. Winning so many games, making plays etc. \nToday is just a 180° turn. had a few games today that just were not winable. The enemies stomped us so hard. I lost my lane at least twice today and my roams were just so bad.\n1 game I had 3 smurfs in my team. Let me tell you, Smurfs are not necessarily a good thing. The smurf riven lost her lane to a teemo and camp jungler. She flamed our jungler who was in his diamond promo to be low elo and trash for not ganking. The thresh and riven lost their will to play, because it was only their smurf. Only the smurf draven wanted to continue, and I am grateful for that, but we still lost the game.\nSmurf are good when they carry you, obviously. But they are hell if they lose their lane, because of their high ego, they think everyone below challenger/master is trash.\n\nAnd yes, the 3 were confirmed smurfs. each of them had less than 100 normal games, a really good KDA on most champs and a really high winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2017-01-04T10:53:09.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never have, nor ever will consider smurfs a good thing in any way what so ever.\nIf they carry you, you didn't deserve the win because you had an unfair advantage. If you lose, they're almost certain to flame everyone for it because there is no consequence to them losing that account.\n\nSure if they carry it's a free win, but it's like getting a free ice cream land in your hand out of nowhere. Only to realise it was flung from a child's hand after they were hit by a truck. It's free ice cream but there's a certain....unease about it. (extreme example I know, call it back to work blues xP).\n\nBut plenty of my matches in the last two weeks have been mostly garbage too. Some were a result of me doing poorly I don't deny that, but if I had a penny for games lost due to other lanes feeding like sin while I had a good/even lane phase, I'd be a rich man indeed by this point.\n\nStill, congrats on them good stats.
