I&#039;m trying some masteries for vi leaning more towards the resolve tree. I was trying out Grasp, but CoC sounds like it could work.\n\nEdit: It actually does work with your q to great effect. Sadly I lost the game because their front line was too strong and my bot lane was behind but it was effective. In a better game where I can reach the back line it should give some good survivability.\n\nNow, as for the build, so far warriors into tank boots and then into black cleaver works fine, though i'm not sure where to go beyond that. I like the effect of iceborn but i need more health. Deadmans plate is also effective though. Suggestions?\n","replies":[{"poster":"Trekkorm","date":"2016-11-13T23:19:11.417+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt you can CoC Vi, i think she has a thing going for Caitlyn.
