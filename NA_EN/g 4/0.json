The account is inactive, and the last game played was Friday February 13, 2015, according to the API.  According to the update [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/summoner-name-clean), _based on when you played your last game and what your level is, you’ll have a period of immunity from name clean ups._  The immunity time is 2 years, 6 months for it since it's a level 30 account.  But it also seems that according to the API, something was done to the account as recently as Friday May 26, 2017 (such as a summoner icon change or tutorial).  I was wondering if this means that I will no longer be able to obtain this account name, even though the original owner has not played a game on it in 2.5 years?  Because the blog post led me to believe that it is only playing an actual match that will save you from name cleanup.  It will be very disappointing to have saved up all this IP just to not be able to have the name I want :(  Thanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T22:43:09.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't really comment on how long another summoner has before his name is cleaned up, as that's really his own personal information. I can say though that he most likely hopped on and played an AI or Aram match in order to keep his name active.","replies":[{"poster":"G 4","date":"2017-08-11T23:19:46.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But can you tell me (without any specifics in terms of a given summoner) in general if accounts get cleaned up after _match_ inactivity or _login_ inactivity?  The blog post says _match_ inactivity.  If it is just login activity, it seems to promote people hogging account names either for show or to sell without actually playing the game.  And that doesn't really seem to be the spirit of the Summoner Name Clean Up feature.\n\nEDIT: for example the blog post says _It’s important to note that non-immune names can only be claimed through Summoner Name Change, and not by new players. This ensures the name will be used by an active player, and not someone who decided they absolutely need [names]_ which to me means the whole idea of this feature was to ensure that cool names could go to actual active players.","replies":[]}]}]}
