Tazville. i decided to chunk it to the game and move on to create a new account which is finally back to Silver II. I find it hard to continue playing when youve done nothing to recover said account, i constantly have trouble logging in due to failures on your end (sometimes 10 min sometimes cant log for over a week) and getting D/Cs when im about to hit promos. now since my buddy did a remake i get penalized, lose LP and possibly get a time ban. Ive spent hundreds on RP and yet i feel that money gets dicked around. do something about your servers guys. im tired of getting d/c's atleast once a week. ive played plenty of other games and never have i d/c'd until this oh so wonderful game you released. so if anyone has tips on how to stop these d/cs or even recover my account let me know. Mind you i already submitted a ticket for the account and i got told to \"reset my password\" which i couldnt do because i had to immediately create a new summoner name and start all over under the same email/password/account name.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T17:12:20.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are still have issues recovering your old account, let us know by replying to your current ticket.
