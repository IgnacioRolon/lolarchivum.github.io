For example, when I was starting off playing Azir, I was spamming him on Lonian at ~gold 1. I was doing horribly; could not use my abilities for Sh-t, couldn&#039;t combo the enemy laner, could hardly even keep my KDA positive half the time. Slowly, I began to test the waters, attempting to drift even when failing. It slowly got easier and better, and now I am a pretty mechanically-refined Azir player.\r\n\r\nRight now I am doing the same thing on Jayce, trying to get as good as possible. I&#039;d say i&#039;m moving alot faster-paced right now than I was when I was starting out with Jayce. I am getting the hang of &quot;Q-Eing&quot; with the gate right ontop of you, and my ability to use melee form is getting alot more refined.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys strive for in League?","replies":[]}
