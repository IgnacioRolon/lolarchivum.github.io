This will make it a more valuable item for the champions that need to build it most (mages). Right now I feel like, at its gold cost, all it is really good for is like support morgana or support annie, because anything mid really needs stronger items like rabadons, rylais, zhonyas, etc, that all cost more gold but do more.","replies":[]}
