I still have yet to try it, and i&#039;m scheduled to see him again in like 3 days. He probably thinks i&#039;ve been on it for like a month now, so I don&#039;t know what to tell him. Should I try it now, or wait to ask him more questions?\n\nHere&#039;s the thing, i&#039;ve done a lot of research on venlafaxine and there seems to be A LOT of people complaining about this drug, some saying it downright ruined their life (it is an SNRI/ Antidepressant). It&#039;s like half and half. The big issue is that coming off of it is a very long and strenous process, so if it&#039;s not working for me then it will take a while to get off it without complete withdrawal. Withdrawal also is a huge issue with this drug in particular, and it can do a lot of crazy things to people based on what I read. This drug also seems to cause insomnia which is something i&#039;m very afraid of because I value sleep big time (I like to wake up early every day and I always schedule my classes in the morning becuase it feels so much nicer to me to get it done early in the day and I just like the early sunset and everything).\n\nI don&#039;t know what to do here. Am I being too paranoid or are these unnerving feelings about these medications warranted? Should I try them now or wait until I see my psychiatrist for the second time? Also, what are the chances of being accused of saving these drugs to abuse them (how addictive is this drug)?","replies":[]}
