He had to sacrifice even the ability to move around in order to increase his utility, which is honsetly an amazing concept that should not have been thrown down the trash.\r\n\r\nNew Xerath is just like every other cancer mage. I struggle to draw differences between new Xerath and Lux, Vel&#039;koz or any other typical AP caster. He has four damaging abilities, and nothing interesting about him.\r\n\r\nRevert his rework, that is all I want. Don&#039;t buff or nerf him, just make him interesting again. PLEASE.","replies":[]}
