First off, I do not have the time nor the inclination to appeal to lesser minds; I don&#039;t even know why the hell I&#039;m stuck in the same class as these fools. I take a gander at the problem, and notice that it is a simple vector cross multiplication problem. I tell the girl to take atleast one mere attempt at the problem, and she does. Not even one step was followed properly. At this point she is begging for me to assert an answer, although I refrain from articulating it to her immediately; rather I simply ask walk her through the baby steps into solving the problem. There is a clear hint of mental frustration in the pupil of her eye, and my intuition tells her that her anger is directed towards me. She then says &quot;It&#039;s okay, I will find someone else to help me with this problem.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhy is my intellectually-inclined field of physics and chemistry perpetually tainted by absent-minded, anti-intellectual amateurs such as these? I only wished to inform her of a solution to such a ludicrously easy problem, and she declines because even applying one fraction of her brain cells (which are already in a infinitesmally small number relative to mine) to this problem is simply &#039;too hard&#039;. I struggle to see how I will fnid a girlfriend if all girls can never seem to understand my quenching thirst for knowledge.","replies":[]}
