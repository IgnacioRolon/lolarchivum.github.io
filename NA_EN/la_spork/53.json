It is really not that hard -- if you can&#039;t handle the intensity and vigour required to be part of the elite band of intellectuals known as engineers, then back out. Engineering doesn&#039;t even pay that great, literally just barely six digit figure jobs; people that want to go into engineering should be doing it for the passion/ love for knowledge.\n\nIf you want money go be a lawyer or something, stop taking up space with your presumably less valuable essence that a real intellectual could be filling up in a position requiring high skill and precision. There are so many other ways to get six figures that don&#039;t require you to think much, all you need is to be a bit extroverted and assertive, which frankly are traits most non-intellectuals seem to have (or atleast they like to talk it up like they do).","replies":[]}
