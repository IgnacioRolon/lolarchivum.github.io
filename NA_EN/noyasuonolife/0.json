As a huge company i feel like I'm getting back stabbed and refusing to answer. I understand that they get millions of tickets everyday but just choosing to delete my ticket and ignoring my next ones just doesn't seem like support aren't do their jobs. Honestly I know that people can get toxic once in awhile but I spent hours on the account and money. That's all I'm going to say have a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T15:18:38.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Creating duplicate tickets or spamming replies tend to cause confusion and delays in responding back.  We don't ignore players, but those factors as well as a higher volume can take a bit to reply back.
