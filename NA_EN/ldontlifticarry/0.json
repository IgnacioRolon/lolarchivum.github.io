So even if you get a black cleaver or a last whisper you're only getting the base damage of the ability. Also having hybrid damaging abilities are not good for the game. They are hard to itemize for and against.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-07-09T21:17:16.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jakojo,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=s2AL9Nf9,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-07-09T20:56:37.241+0000)\n>\n> Yes but the part that scales with AD deals magic damage. So even if you get a black cleaver or a last whisper you're only getting the base damage of the ability. \n\nYou're getting the base damage of the ability plus bonus scaling damage of a type that - if they're counter-building your primary damage type - they can't soak up as well.\n\n> Also having hybrid damaging abilities are not good for the game. They are hard to itemize for and against.\n\nI see no problem with hybrid damage. It creates an interesting question for the opposing team.\n\nTo use MF as an example: if they overstack armor to deal with auto-attacks, they remain vulnerable to her Impure Shots. If they build MR to deal with that, they're investing less in armor to handle her normal attacks.\n\nThe question of how to address that interests me. It's a type of interplay that I enjoy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
