For the first one, Windows forced me to update my computer even though i clicked wait an hour when the popup came up, making me leave the game permanently. The second time I just disconnected because league crashed and it would not run for 3 minutes. I now have leaver buster and its a huge inconvenience for me when I don't deserve it. {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T22:20:01.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of intention, a disconnection negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a reason why disconnections are treated equally by the system and why penalties cannot be modified or removed.\n\nIt sounds like your PC decided to do the Windows 10 Anniversary update during the middle of your game. :'(  If you can give me more details around what happened when League crashed and you weren't able to disconnection, such as error message details or specific behavior, we can prevent this from happening in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"terti killer","date":"2016-10-01T14:50:41.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have leaver buster pls take it off i dont deserve it because i was in an internet cafe and my time finished pls take it off","replies":[{"poster":"terti killer","date":"2016-10-01T14:51:47.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=terti killer,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=FlUw9UKB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-01T14:50:41.015+0000)\n>\n> I have leaver buster pls take it off i dont deserve it because i was in an internet cafe and my time finished pls take it off","replies":[]}]}]}
