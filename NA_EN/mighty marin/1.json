Now my fps has dropped to 5 fps. It's not my computer because I can run other games with 150 fps. I would like someone to tell me why is it so low.

It would be nice to get an actual answer or timetable for Riot to fix their code (which this appears to be) instead of  uninstall this, uninstall that, reinstall this, reinstall that...rinse, repeat.","replies":[]}]}]}
