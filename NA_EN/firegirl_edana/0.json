But i&#039;m missing a conversation in my app chat, that i am seeing on my client. The only thing that had been different on that moment was dat my tablet ( where i have the friend app on) was shut off. \r\nAlso why isn&#039;t the club chat included in the friend app?? \r\nI also miss letters in my friend app chat. My friends and i, instead of writing:  &quot;see you&quot;, we write &quot;cu&quot; but this is shown as : &quot;**&quot;\r\nevery time again we write that it&#039;s been shown as an astrix. i have only see this with: cu, not with other letters/ combinations. So i don&#039;t know if there are more letters/combinations like this\r\ni know this concept is a relatively new one for riot, i&#039;m not going to blame them for these tiny mistakes ( are they?!). I know they have said that the app will be evolving like the client does, so i&#039;m just going to wait till it is fixed ( or what they intend). At least i have pointed out things that are not working completely fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2016-03-23T17:35:12.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the filter should catch all languages unless a special exception has been made.  So when everything is in English but you swear in German it should still show up as \"*****\". If it doesn't, please do report it through the bug report feature in app!","replies":[{"poster":"FireGirl Edana","date":"2016-03-24T10:32:26.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, i will.

Good find!\n\nWe recently re-did the \"bad words\" filter to be better at making bad words go away. Unfortunately, sometimes it catches things we don't want it to - like \"cu\" for example. I've put \"cu\" on the list to be removed from the filter, but if you find any other words or phrases (in any language!) that are getting filtered and should not be, please let us know! You can also turn off the language filter if you'd like, that option is under \"Chat & Friends\" in the settings.\n\nThe discrepancy between phone and client is probably because it takes a bit for the phone to sync your conversations. We're working on some optimizations around this process and making it clearer for you folks, the players,  but depending on how much service you have, etc. the time it takes to load things varies a bit.\n\nAs for club chats, we're working on it! :simple_smile:","replies":[{"poster":"FireGirl Edana","date":"2016-03-23T10:18:20.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sparkle, nice quick reply :)\n\ni didn't even got a message that u had responded to this. It's not even showing at all in my updates/notifications.\nI can't even find this on the boards again, i had to search my web history to get back here.. i wonder why?!\n\nAs i said i won't blame it on  you guys, as i understand this is new and needs some smoothing. \nThe missing chat is still not showing in my app, but new chat is. i'm not sure if my missing conversation will show on my app.\n\nFor the word filter i can try words out in different languages but, will it filter a (for example) german bad word when i have everything in english? \n\nIf i find anything new that does not work the way it should i will let you guys know. I will wait paitently, better take your time and do things right ;D","replies":[]}]}]}
