Its never a good idea to let a non-aoe shield/heal target minions. \n\n1) Its annoying to face against as an enemy, especially when behind, especially against an aggressive support who is already going to be pushing you out of lane anyway. You need to be able to have a safe option to CS.\n\n2) Losing lane because you shielded a minion instead of your ADC will always be bad. Its the same reason they removed ignite from being able to be used on minions/monsters; sure, you could argue some random stars align situation where it would be optimal, but more often than not it would literally cost you the game by causing an accidental use unintended.\n\nMy guessing as to why Lulu is an exception is because her spell has an offensive version that targets minions, as well as changes the angle of her Q. Theres legitimate use for it beyond straight denial. Likewise, janna shield on towers isnt comparable either; only 3 towers per lane and theyre fairly large hitboxes that you often arent standing right ontop of, so you arent likely to \"accidentally\" shield tower over your adc, while you are extremely likely to shield a minion over adc by accident depending on matchup (enemy blitz/thresh/morg where you want to be essentially in your own minion wave if youre not zoned out).","replies":[{"poster":"Sheldons","date":"2016-07-27T02:36:58.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"keep in mind that this is karma's ultimate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-07-26T14:08:18.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Said this in a previous thread, but here we go again.\n\nIn 6.9, Riot made several changes to mid lane champions to reduce the amount of wave clear in the game. Because of this, along with Zed's massive drop in play rate, you cannot expect pro players to kill every minion out of a wave instantly, and that's what Riot wants.\n\nHowever, because you can't instantly wave clear, the counterplay to Karma's Defiance disappears. Currently, the ability can't be used if the enemy team is using long range AOE abilities to prevent you from bunching up. The enemy team should be rewarded for doing this against Karma. But if she can target minions they don't NEED to be bunched up to go in.\n\nThese nerfs were targeted at pro play Karma specifically to reduce her play rate before World's.
