I&#039;ve reached Gold 2 but I don&#039;t have a main role or main champion. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m decent on a lot of Champions but I get bored so I have never fully learnt a champion or their limitations etc. My game knowledge is immense but my mechanics is lacking and I think this is because I have not taken the time to play the same champion over and over, any ideas? What is the most rewarding? \r\n\r\nMy play style is usually play making, I prefer to have an effect on the game rather than let my team carry me and do everything for me.\r\n\r\nThanks for advice {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"AstroFerrari ","date":"2016-12-20T03:41:56.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Play champions until you find the ones you really have fun on.
