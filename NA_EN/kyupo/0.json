I initially thought it was just a visual bug, since a friend of mine pointed out that the bond passive was activated but we had no visual ques to let us know. The game kept going and I hit lvl 6, this around the point we noticed it was not just a visual bug. I would ult and my bonded Leona could not cast the ability while ulted, then I also noticed that she was not able to activate my W passive. I was using championship Kalista if it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-29T17:09:45.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey kyupo,\n\nIn this specific instance, did your Kalista bind an ally target with the Black Spear and then use another Black Spear to rebind? There is an issue with Kalista where rebinding has caused the issue, it's not something that is skin-specific.","replies":[]}]}
