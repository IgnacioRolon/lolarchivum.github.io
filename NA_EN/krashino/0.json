At the start of the match, when I was running down to help leash Blue I kept instantly teleporting back to Base the moment I left base, this continued throughout the entire speed buff thing you get at the start of the match. Apparently it wasn't a lag related issue either, both myself and my entire team witnessed this odd...experience, at the same time.\r\n\r\nI have yet to reproduce it, and it didnt effect the game itself, but I figured I'd post about it anyways.\r\nIf it happens again I'll get a video of it","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-12T02:33:48.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rubberbanding like that can often be a pretty good sign that your network is having issues with packet loss for one reason or another. Do me a favor and run a quick trace route using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1.
