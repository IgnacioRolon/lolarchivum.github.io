My camera lock doesn't properly stay on my champion whether or not I use the camera lock at the bottom screen or press my camera lock key.  It keeps making me hold the key and it really affects my gameplay... Also I can't access the mini-map camera thing are all as well as me not being able the switch around my items and being forced to double click everything when I didn't have to before.  I don't know what's going on at all, my pings are all weird, my mini map is broken, i can't use my shop effectively, my items can't be switched around and the worse part is that my camera lock is broken......... How can I fix this???","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-20T01:11:23.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's go ahead and try resetting your config files since so many aspects don't seem to be working the way you remember anymore.
