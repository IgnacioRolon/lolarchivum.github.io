While stealthed, Evelynn regenerates 2% of her missing mana every second and ignores unit collision.\n\ntoday i thought about this: what if evelinn could not be seen, behind champions while stealthed.\nFrom one side, it kinda makes sence. This will increase her early game pressure, thanks to her passive stealth that makes her ganks a little easier and more strategic in the point of view that you've got to pay attention to your enemy monevents. Now, with this you can get closer to your enemies  from behind without being seen, but also ofc you can make your teammates snowball hard in some cases and make her enemies spend their gold on pink wards (that everyone in the game should buy).\n\n*the indicator is just a example of what i wanted to say: basically evelynn can't be detected while stealthed near and behind an enemy champion.\n \n(the triangle or cone behind the enemy could be in 80º,  just like in cassiopeia ultimate indicator, memember this is just an idea and you can tell me what you think).\n\nand remember this: \n\"There is little mystery about her to me - she is the ultimate predator.\"\n― {{champion:24}}  Jax","replies":[{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2015-01-29T19:14:37.332+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"My superpower is that I can turn invisible at will, as long as nobody else is looking at me.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Solaxo","date":"2015-01-29T20:14:12.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tis a nice day,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6c5wE0g8,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-29T19:14:37.332+0000)\n>\n> \"My superpower is that I can turn invisible at will, as long as nobody else is looking at me.\"\n\nYeah but in RL you don't see everything from above","replies":[{"poster":"Triariici","date":"2015-01-30T11:33:29.787+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone missed the joke","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SunGold","date":"2015-01-29T23:58:04.395+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Centuros","date":"2015-01-29T23:20:17.378+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Facing-dependent mechanics are bad in a game with zero turn time, not to mention the oddities with spinning (even though a champ may spin, it's just a visual effect, and they remain facing in the last direction they moved)","replies":[]},{"poster":"8yVkmwxq0D","date":"2015-01-29T19:17:11.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a great idea :)  Fits in with her theme of being an assassin.

You mentioned Shaco, because he comes in the same way. Except, Shaco's invisibility has a set time limit and costs mana. With her current passive you can see her coming and escape.

I just feel a permanent invisibility that already ignores wards and can only be seen by facing her direction is beyond broken. In a fight, you are facing your enemy more than 90% of the time, which makes it too easy for her to sneak up on you.
