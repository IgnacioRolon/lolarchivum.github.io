But it doesn't say where I can get the skin at all. I thought it would be added to my account since I logged in to purchase it but it isn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T22:41:44.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to redeem the skin through the order details section of your [merch account](https://na.merch.riotgames.com/en/customer/account/login/).   There should be an option to unlock digital content, with a prompt to select a region and summoner name.  Hope that helps clear things up, and grats on your figure!","replies":[]}]}
