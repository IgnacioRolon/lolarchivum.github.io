Almost like LCS.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now here is my story. \r\nI played the in Pokemon VGC eSports for the past few years, and sadly those years came to a end after I went 3-4 in the second day of the World championship series for Pokemon. I can still play in it after this year, but now I'll be in the masters devision, the devision with all the old people who have been playing longer than I am and better than me. Being in the masters devision now means I won't be taking Pokemon as seriously since I'm playing with a lot of the good players. Since I am not to focused on Pokemon now, I am focusing on getting into a competitive scene in League of Legends, I am still in High School and gold 3 at the moment hoping to make Platinum by the end of the season. \r\n\r\nBut the big thing here is I don't know where or how I can try to get into competitive League of Legends other than a few things. And I'm not worried about getting into it now, I know at least I am not old enough or high rnough ranking.\r\n\r\n(Excuse my bad writing, I've never been good at english.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T16:55:14.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Working your way up the ranked divisions is certainly a good place to start if you wish to join the competitive scene of League. Another great step would be to stop by [Team Recruitment](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) and reach out to any teams that may fit you.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
