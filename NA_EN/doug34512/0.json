This is just my opinion, but it would be a nice option to see in the futre.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T04:30:34.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a pretty interesting option. Though it's important to note that ARAM is more of a laid-back and fun mode, and it's really common to be given a champion you haven't played before or rarely play at all. I'm sure most players you're matched with will be more than understanding that you may not know your champion well. :P\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. ^.^","replies":[]}]}
