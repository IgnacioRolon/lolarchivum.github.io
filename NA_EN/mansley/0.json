It jump between 150 and 70ish with even lower dips in team fights. It is very noticeable and makes everything feel choppy. The problem started happening the other day with me being locked to 60 fps no matter what I did. I saw a thread about disabling the windows game bar app because it causes issues so I did that and it fixed the locked fps problem, but now I have this choppiness. I am not sure what to do at this point. I even tried putting my setting to very low but the fps doesn't change at all which is weird. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T16:44:40.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check your in-game settings, and see if capping your frame rate might help.
