Every time I login, I have to change the region to NA, then login. It's not that big of a deal obviously, just a slight annoyance. I was wondering if there was any way to fix this. Please tell me how to change the default region back to NA!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-04T02:38:44.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeiiiiiird....typically I believe the client should default to whatever region you had last signed into. Let's try unchecking the remember username box, switching to NA, and then closing the client. Try opening it then and seeing if it's changed the default state or not.\n\nIf that doesn't do the trick, let's try doing a config reset to see if that helps. Follow these steps and let me know!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Liv Inda Moment","date":"2017-12-04T11:37:54.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! Your second solution fixed my issue. All I had to do was reset my preferences. \n\nI know this problem was really small, but having to change the region every time I logged in was getting pretty annoying haha.","replies":[]}]}]}
