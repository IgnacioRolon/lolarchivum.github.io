The match up system will try to give everyone a 50/50 win rate. If you did well in everygame, you will suffered, consider the match up system is trying to give every player a 50/50 win rate. when you did good in everygame, the system will team you up with bad player(feeder, toxic player, afkor, poor internet lagger and etc), so you can carry them to win. So if you did really good, if you were in a winning streaks, guess whats coming: yeah, lossing streaks. Here is what will happen if you are a really good player, you wil win win win win win, then the system will think you are good to carry those bad player, then you will lose lose lose lose lose....I was playing with a friend from school, and he did really bad. I look into his match history, and he feed hardcord everygame. Yet hes still magically has a 50/50 win rate. \n\nSO if you do not try your best in everygame, if you just chill and not try hard. You don't have to have a win win win win win then lose lose lose lose lose situation...You just need to win lose win lose win lose. If you are in a losing streaks, try to lose more game as fast as possible and as much as possible. And the system will eventually believe that you such, and reset your win rate.........If your performance is average, you will get a better gaming environment, because the system will team you up with average decent player. \n\nIt works for me.","replies":[]}
