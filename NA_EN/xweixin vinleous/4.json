You posted about a 10 game chat restriction, which ordinarily would only go up to a 25 game chat restriction, not a 14 day suspension.  So, either there is something else from these logs that you have not shown us, or there was a possible glitch with the system.  If these are the full and complete logs, and you did not have an additional 25 game chat restriction in the interim, you should submit a ticket to Player Support and ask why your punishment was escalated.  They will be more than willing to help you out and give you an idea of what happened, and if it was a mistake, they can fix it for you.  However, if there was any sort of hate speech, or instructions to self-harm (like kys), that you've edited out, then the ban will not be reversed.  It will cause an immediate escalation to a 14 day or permanent suspension.  \n\nAs far as why the logs of what other people said isn't included, it doesn't really matter.  The context of what is said doesn't matter.  Whether other players are being toxic doesn't matter.  All that matters is whether you personally are being toxic.  Which people did try to explain to you in your last thread here on the Boards.  You are responsible for your words and actions, whether provoked or unprovoked.  Riot does expect its players to have the maturity to \"turn the other cheek\" so to speak, and either mute or ignore players who are being toxic towards them.  Report them after the match if they are disruptive or ruining the gaming experience, but do not react in kind.  When you react to toxicity with toxicity, you are simply breaking the rules as well.  \n\nYes, it's clear that your comment to the Kayle about playing safe is not meant as an insult to the Warwick, but that does not automatically mean that there is no toxicity in the match.  It's fairly mild compared to the first match, but there's still a fair amount of arguing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Falkentyne","date":"2017-11-23T22:33:28.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Too bad.
