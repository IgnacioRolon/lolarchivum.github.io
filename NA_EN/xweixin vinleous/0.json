Well, I pulled up the enymy zed&#039;s match history and saw that he had a 38% winrate. So, I say in all chat this, and then I tell him to &quot;stop calling us noobs, noob&quot;. ANd for the rest of the game we were calling each other noobs, until someone on my own team says &quot;report syndra for toxic?&quot; and of course, they were upset with me, so they agreed. Now I got a chat restriction when 1. I was defending myself and 2. I didn&#039;t even say anything reportable compared to the harassment and bullying the enemy zed said to me, seriously Riot Support, read EVERYONE&#039;S chat logs. I&#039;m not the typical baby asking Riot to unrestrict me for being ultra toxic, it&#039;s a genuine request for Riot to look at the whole chat and judge whether or not I deserve this punishment while the other team didn&#039;t. I Didn&#039;t even report anyone, anyway...","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-07-26T08:14:18.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xWeixin Vinleous,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=im9Mk961,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-07-26T01:19:21.345+0000)\n>\n> I was defending myself\n\nSo you muted the offenders, reported them at the end of the game, then moved on with your life?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-07-26T01:22:42.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I was arrested, but I didn't even stab him that much.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-07-26T01:31:03.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I was arrested for stealing from a store, but they stole from me first!!!!!!!!!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"TiltoverEnforcer","date":"2017-07-26T07:37:25.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Escheton,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=im9Mk961,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-07-26T01:22:42.627+0000)\n>\n> &quot;I was arrested, but I didn&#x27;t even stab him that much.&quot;\n\n\"I could've stabbed to kill, but instead I only cut off his hand.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leylania","date":"2017-07-26T01:21:04.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post your chat logs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jackpresident","date":"2018-05-11T17:32:47.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The funny thing is that most of the times the other players flamed too but because u aren't a snowflake u dont report them and they dont get a ban .. rito , logic?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FighterA236","date":"2017-07-26T03:15:59.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs? :D","replies":[]}]}
