Adding to that, qtpie isn't known for being toxic, probably trolly but not a total asshole. Barring that, it still doesn't excuse your other negative behavior and just generally harassing your teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"xWeixin Vinleous","date":"2018-01-08T05:49:57.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"so what was harassing my teammates?","replies":[{"poster":"Rester","date":"2018-01-08T05:51:01.671+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xWeixin Vinleous,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ATjI6kky,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-08T05:49:57.670+0000)\n>\n> so what was harassing my teammates?\n\nI give up.

(Like when you claimed he didn't read that you say that to your frienfs, and then he explained how that doesn't matter.) For real man, these people are telling you the truth. I don't know why you're denying it. We've been watching the boards for a while and have a pretty good idea of what Riot bans for.\n\n Take it as a learning experience, not us showing you what's up. We are here to educate and that's what we are trying to do but you're refusing it lol. This isn't us trying to win an argument (maybe to some it is) and rub it in your face. You asked a question, and we are giving you the honest answer. Yet you're sitting here telling us we are wrong? Then why are you punished??? \n\nJust because you don't agree with it, doesn't mean you have to refuse accepting it. You can carry on with a new account, knowing what will get you punished, and avoid it. It doesn't mean you agree with it and Riot won and now you're a little bitch lol. \n\nNo, it just means you're no longer ignorant of the rules and your account will always be safe because you aren't ignorant and you can prevent yourself from crossing that line again, even though you don't think that line should be there. It's what I do. I don't agree with permabanning people because you offended someone. But I'm not gonna get my account banned out of a stubborness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-01-08T17:31:18.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">because i explained most of my chats in my post.\n\nYour post isn't visible to the people in the game that reported you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-01-08T05:52:47.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure he's doing it on purpose, as if every little bit of \"_innocence_\" can save his account.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mobile Phone","date":"2018-01-08T06:01:13.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xWeixin Vinleous,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ATjI6kky,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-08T05:49:57.670+0000)\n>\n> so what was harassing my teammates?\n\nsO whAt WaS har- well shit lets look at just game one!\n\n> xWeixin Vinleous: 0/3 yas needs a gank btw hahaa\nxWeixin Vinleous: typical yas\nxWeixin Vinleous: we lost infernal now\nxWeixin Vinleous: 0/4? checkmark. lost lane? checkmark. wants a gank? checkmarl. typical yasuo player\nxWeixin Vinleous: see this yasuo is the type of person to shitpost on reddit\nxWeixin Vinleous: not typing anything toxic (haha thats a good one)\nxWeixin Vinleous: enjoy your ban, yasuo\nxWeixin Vinleous: toxic\nxWeixin Vinleous: ? im not even inting lol\nxWeixin Vinleous: im 0/4\nxWeixin Vinleous: he's 2/7\nxWeixin Vinleous: pls\n xWeixin Vinleous: 2/8\n\n\n\nand the obv asking for reports.

It looks like this ban was appropriate. In both these logs and the 2-week logs, you single out players, insulting them, arguing with them, or harassing them. You also called for reports, which also factors into your punishment. You were told in your previous punishment that the permanent ban was the next step if you did not reform. I would say if you make another account, that you not harp on players' bad plays, or their poor kda. It doesn't help the team achieve goals, and insulting them isn't a proven way of getting better results from your teammates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oxyrotten","date":"2018-01-08T05:49:26.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is losing report value a thing?

It doesn't matter that other person happened to be in the same game as someone who did.\n\nSay there's a game and it uses a point system.  You get 4 points every time you violate the rules by fighting and you get banned at 100.  One person in a game has 76 points on their account another person has 96.  They fight with each other, they both are guilty of it, they both receive 4 points.   They are both being treated equally and fairly by the same rules.
