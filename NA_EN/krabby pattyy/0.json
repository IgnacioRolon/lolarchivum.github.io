I've played diana enough to know her play patterns and how her q works, her q fires in a counterclockwise curve. My point about diana is more about her having more obvious weaknesses. Her mana pool is low, she's actually vulnerable to poke* and can't farm properly from range, which exposes her to poke (q to farm will eat her mana fast). Her shield costs a fair amount of mana and is on a fairly long cooldown, which makes poking her down likely possibility\n\n*As in, she can't dash around to avoid all poke without going oom really fast.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2015-12-22T14:49:13.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find her immune to poke, but in non obvious ways.

I can trash him with a lot of champs (including non-counter picks). My problem is with how *little* that actually affects him. He's worse than Akali/Katerina.

He's practically full build with just 2-3 items because he's a huge ball of *free stats*.\n\nThen there's the matter of actually punishing him. He has a lot of safety nets for a \"hyper carry\" (I really need to find that red post where they call him that): Passive shield, lots of dashes, resourcesless, wind wall, strong wave clear, low CD Knock-up, his knock-up can zone opponents for just under 1/3 his time in lane (using *minimum values*), and he can ult off ***any*** displacement (not just knock-ups, and not just his own).\nBut for all his safety nets; he not only punishes opponents extremely hard for making mistakes, he punishes them just for using common concepts (like not spending all lane phase in the side bushes).\n\nWhen played well, the risk/reward paradigm on Yasuo is broken. That's what makes him so infuriating to play against. He's not impossible to play against.

Sure having 60% is nice, but say you get a critical with what would be about 130ish AD, that would be about a 236 damage critical and Warlords would heal for I think 15% of that which would be about 36 health (10% being 23.6 = 24 and 5% being 11.5 = 12). That's not as frightening as a higher base damage that is consistent when your damage at that point is inconsistent, albeit in a favorable type of inconsistent with it being Yasuo. This was always the big reason why you always built raw damage on ADCs before your crits; crits are meant to be better as the game goes on and the carry's AD goes up.\n\nShiv was always a first buy on Yas was because of the wave clear option it gave as well as the nice crit and movespeed. And the thing about Yasuo is that crit on him scales much better via his passive, so he can afford to build shiv first and get away with it because it gives him 60% rather than 30%, which is a bad buy for any ADC with less than 170 AD. Therein lies the only issue (not problem, just issue) with Yasuo imo. It's just that his crit scales well to the degree that it goes against what is true for every other champion in the game. I'm not saying it means he's broken, too strong, etc. It's just he, as a champion, fundamentally changes how the statistics of the game work. That is what makes the champion unique however, and changing that changes the champion's identity. \n\nJust things to consider.

They're so good at it that it SEEMS easy. Give these champs to some random silver nabs who main WW/Kayle/Annie, they'll feed until their enemies have diabetes. Only exception is Fizz. An inbred monkey with head trauma can survive lane with him.\n\nAs a Gold II Fizz main who is also an inbred monkey with head trauma I can confirm this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aikki","date":"2015-12-22T18:42:41.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're way too forgiving.

He was a killing and sustaining machine with one of the most versatile kits in the game for a while there. I don't think everyones anger about that has subdued yet and there are still reasons to be pissed about how good his kit is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-12-22T07:47:54.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are strong duelists but they contribute overall less to the team as a whole.\n\nOther champs like {{champion:37}} {{champion:57}} and {{champion:113}} have no real \"outplay\" potential but they are the types of champs that actually win games.","replies":[]}]}
