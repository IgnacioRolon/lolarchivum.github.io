This has happened about 5 times. I just need some tips of what to do to climb silver 1. I just won my promos so we will see how it goes today. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"UltraSceptile","date":"2015-08-06T16:42:57.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play jungle, pick shit like Volibear, Hecarim, or Vi.  If you don't like these tanky junglers pick someone like yi, or warwick, or udyr and win games by taking every single dragon and snowballing off post six ganks while maintaining farm (warwick), or splitpush all day (udyr and yi).","replies":[]},{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2015-08-06T16:41:36.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you play jungle.

But i caaaaan play someone like janna and do my best to keep these idiots from feeding as hard as they're trying to. \n\nAnd i can't emphasize this enough: WARDS. wards. wards. wards. upgraded trinket is cheap af. Let me know if you need help for some good places to ward, but it's vital and it's a team effort, not just support who can only put 3 down. everyone can put a pink down, and vision goes a long, long way to helping you pick off people and know exactly where your enemy team is. \n\nDragon really is important, I played a game where we had over 20k more gold, more than twice their kills, but drag was 6-1 and we just couldn't keep up and eventually lost. kills are never, ever more important than objective control. ever. You can kill the enemy team all day long, but if dragon and towers aren't being taken, you'll never win unless the enemy team isn't getting them either. Seriously, dragon gives amazing buffs the more you get it, and it can be game-breaking. jungle dieing to out-smite dragon is perfectly acceptable- i would totally do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xSenketsu ","date":"2015-08-06T16:43:30.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forgot to mention, that im an adc main, and i play jungle or mid when I cant get adc.","replies":[]}]}
