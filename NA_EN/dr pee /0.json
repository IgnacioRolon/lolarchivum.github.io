If there were strangers in the chat, then your fcking around (whether directed at them or not) will certainly not help your case.\n\n> I also don't believe I was in breach of the summoners code\n\nSo from you are saying, it seems like that you are fully aware that your \"fcking around in chat\" was a breach of the summoner's code. Your credibility is dropping here and chances are we'll label you as a liar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-07-16T20:25:38.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Collnes,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JQZbWiGh,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-07-16T20:09:02.920+0000)\n>\n> Isn&#x27;t that a flawed system?
