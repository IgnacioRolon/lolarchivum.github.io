Unbreakable is also maxed second, while Wind Wall is maxed last.\n* Braum's shield reduces/blocks **all** damage, not just projectiles. If you walk up and crit Yasuo for 900 damage as Tryndamere, he dies\n* I don't know what kind of teamfights you're in where it takes 4 seconds for someone to dive an ADC, but its an awful one\n* Braum then walks sideways and continues blocking. Not only that, but the ADC is gaining distance as you walk at an angle, peeling yourself. Braum also gets 10% bonus movespeed to reposition faster than you\n* Braum is supposed to be in front of his teammates, while Yasuo is supposed to be on the enemy backline, so I don't really know what you're on about here. The only time Yasuo will be behind is carry is while he's fleeing, and that again means you'll be past Wind Wall in about 2 seconds, wasting his 26 second cooldown","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-02-06T04:57:24.156+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"* Unbreakable is maxed first/second because it needs to be. Windwall is maxed last because it's a one-point wonder ability. You only need one point in it. \n* Sorry if I was unclear, I'm talking about protecting another player, not yourself. The shield only intercepts projectiles. If Tryndamere walks up and crits your ADC for 900 damage, he's dead. It doesn't matter if there was a Braum shield or a windwall. Both only protect against projectiles. \n* If someone is using projectiles they don't usually dive the ADC, they'll use them from a distance. Or rather, they'll already be at that distance when they are using the projectile such as a Jinx or Lux ult. If they are diving into your team, such as a Rengar, a windwall wouldn't do much. \n* Braum can do that, I'm just saying if someone would get past a windwall, they'd more than likely also get past Braum's shield. My point was comparing their work-around isn't really saying much because they can both be worked around.\n* If everybody is low HP and fleeing, then you see a red laser of death from Lux you can throw it out while ahead of your team and continue running. Anyway, it wasn't really about the positioning in the slightest. It was more about how his has range and Braum's doesn't. \n\nI'm not saying Yasuo needs a nerf or Braum needs a buff, but it's pretty obvious who has the better shield here lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Steel Blossom","date":"2016-02-06T08:09:01.401+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":8,"body":"So lemme get this straight, you're playing a full tank, and complaining about having to stand in front of your ADC and soak damage...","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2016-02-06T12:39:24.970+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, why the melee carry has a better shield than the full tank, or honestly pretty much EVERY support in the game, is something worth mentioning.
