GTX 460 = 90fps VS GTX 580 = 40fps ???","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been playing the game fine on a GTX 460 but received a GTX 580 and installed it. Im getting about 25-45 fps although it looks much worse with many frames being skipped (looks like 15 fps). When I try playing it on the practice tool I noticed if I turn off the minion spawn I get a choppy looking 60fps.\r\n\r\nFresh installed (several times) all the drivers, turned off all background applications and tried changing Nvidia control panel settings with no luck. Checked GPUZ status and temperatures and clock speeds seem normal both in and out of game. The GTX 580 works fine in everything besides league :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-30T16:45:48.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Checking your drivers is a solid plan in case of outdated versions.
