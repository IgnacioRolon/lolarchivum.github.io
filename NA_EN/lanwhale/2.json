He was a guy who would woop ass without the slightest hesitation. \r\nBut his Pantheon is **all** about kicking ass.\r\n\r\nNow that sounds weird but its the truth. \r\nThis Pantheon only has that one thing about him, there is no other goal he has, no dreams, nothing else. I got remind this with the teaser of him standing at the top of a mountain looking into the night sky. Its sad because I don&#039;t see them giving him any actual character growth sure he&#039;ll have stories but i&#039;m sure they will all be the same, him just beating up an army of people.\r\n\r\nMaybe its the lack of information we have on the Aspects that makes him seem this way. Or perhaps they showed us Atreus a character that had goals, a dream, depth and then removed him to give us this flat cardboard. Perhaps these things combined make me feel like Pantheon is extremely boring of a champion.\r\n\r\nEither way this is just my opinion on it. Oh yea as far as the teaser goes, i&#039;m pretty sure its Aurelian Sol. But that&#039;s just because &quot;Sol&quot; sounds close to &quot;soul&quot;, kid you not this is the reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2016-03-01T00:37:09.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Or perhaps they showed us Atreus a character that had goals, a dream, depth and then removed him to give us this flat cardboard. \n\nThe thing is, Atreus achieved his dreams and goals. He became the greatest warrior, the last one standing at the peak of the mountain. His story was finished. Pantheon's story might not have much yet, but he has the opportunity to grow and become more.\n\n> I'm pretty sure its Aurelian Sol.

New Panth is even less than that. At the moment, he could just as easily be an over-sized melee minion that some god decided to jump into.\n\nI suppose he could always be fleshed out later on, but this current lore team seems to work in bursts. It's a very real possibility that if we don't get anything else on Panth by the end of this event, he won't get any more lore for a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-03-01T18:09:13.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah thats what I meant,panth didn't get any attention in the lore pieces except for the parts where he kicked ass,but like you said thats not really outstanding,in fact he pretty much only appeared at the very end of his own origin story,which is why I hope that we'll get a bit more of his character with the upcoming champion/event/whatever(they said already it won't be a real event,so I think its difficult to judge it).\n\nAlso I think the \"old pantheon wanted to be a baker\"-thing should be seen with caution,considering that this only came from his joke(and since the VO didn't change,new panth also has the same joke),heck old pantheons personality came entirely from his VO,so in the end one could assume that new panths personality isn't that different.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrodinium","date":"2016-03-01T17:37:24.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The baker thing existed only in his joke line, it wasn't an actual part of the character.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stellafreyja","date":"2016-03-01T18:11:51.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only as a character is he bland, but his design is so bland and uninspired.

He had landed in a warrior’s crouch, one knee lowered to the ground, and as he looked up at the enemy defiling the lands of Mount Targon, the Rakkorans saw it was Atreus… and yet not Atreus. The Aspect of the Warrior had infused him, and he was now both mortal and immortal, the incarnation of war made flesh. He was now an avatar of battle. He had become the Pantheon.\"\n\n\n\"Atreus’s family mourned their son and held a funeral for him. While they had suspected he was dead after he had not returned from the expedition, now his demise was confirmed. _**The Pantheon Aspect had obliterated his personality, memories and emotions. Atreus’s flesh was nothing but a shell inhabited by the supernatural Aspect of War**_; his mortal soul had joined those of the ancestors in the celestial afterlife.\"\n\nHe's meant to be shallow now. There's literally nothing left of the human Atreus, he is now only a fighting machine.\n\nIt is assumed that Atreus entered the \"Real Targon\", and thus he obviously left; well, his body did. The Rakkorans believe his spirit was taken away to reside in the afterlife while his body became the Pantheon of war.\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong in the slightest, you're 100% right.
