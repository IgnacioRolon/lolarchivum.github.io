Allow me to phrase that better, that lore and advancements in lore wouldn&#039;t be tide to lore based events or champion releases. Now i&#039;m not saying that i&#039;m getting my pitchfork and torch ready but as it seems lore seems to be still tied to champion release and lore events. \r\n\r\nIs that bad? Pft, no. I would be shocked to **NOT** see lore attached to champion releases and events. What I do find bad is the fact I have to wait for a champion release and lore event for there to be any lore.\r\n\r\nBut like I said i&#039;m not mad at Riot or anything of that sort but just kinda wanted to bring it up ya know. But as always Riot make that lore nice and juicy.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-01-21T19:47:00.931+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"TL;DR: You'll be seeing that happening more this year. \n\nAt times, we will bundle releases together, partly because we release a lot of different things across the patches and so having things come out at the same time that relate to each other can often just add value for players (keep an eye out for that). We're also putting together stories to release just because we want to tell that story.\n\nDefining what a lore-event is from an external perspective can fall into a grey area. At times we will be putting a story together for release and another team will get pumped for it and want to make something alongside. It's just a case of teams inspiring other teams. Would this qualify as a \"lore event\"? Maybe, maybe not, but it's delivering good stuff for you that Narrative and all the other disciplines and product teams are focused on. For us, that includes creating great characters, themes, places, and stories.\n\nOur main concern is not creating story that divorces itself from things made by other teams (and vice versa), we just want to get story to you via whatever means make sense. As long as we can get more story to you that meets the increasing quality bar that we've been working toward, I don't see the problem of whether it has other things tied into it.\n\nFor example, I hope that the Champion launches and ChampUp releases contain great characters and very interesting depictions of them that makes each one feel like a mini-story event, purely because the Champ is great and their story is enthralling, particularly as we put a lot of effort into both things.\nIf we release more stories of a quality that is at least as good as our best efforts last year (Burning Tides, Shadow and Fortune, A Good Death being among my favorites) then we will be heading in the right direction.\n\nWe've now got a few teams for whom making stories in various media is their sole concern, as well as other, more established teams where story and characterization is a part of their work. You will be seeing story produced by both kinds of teams this year.\n\nSorry if this is an over-explanation. I completely understand the desire to feel that we are working on our story and our world for the reason that it's just worth doing anyway, without being released within another product, such as a Champion (though the amount of story and world-building that comes from Champ Team is extremely important). I agree that telling stories is within itself an activity worth doing and that it will add value for players. It's a large reason for why I get out of bed in the morning and fall into it at some point at night. I am by no means alone in that belief, and I'll tell you that the most senior leaders in the company agree.  We understand that some players believe that the way to prove that is to release stories in isolation, to show that we didn't need to justify them with something else.\n\nI can't talk specifics, but all I can say is that I'm proud of how we moved the bar in 2015, and I'm very much looking forward to us improving on that for you in 2016.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-01-21T20:07:14.657+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of releasing things not tied to an event,how's that map of Valoran coming along coming?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LANWhale","date":"2016-01-21T23:43:34.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No understand and thank you for taking some time to talk to us Jaredan.
