But something I cant get over is the fact that when Riot revealed the new Sion, they said that most of your damage will be in your passive. Which is totally right, you can still go full tank and still do heavy damage, sure it won't be burst damage but damage none the less. \r\n\r\nAnd this is where I have my only problem with Sion:\r\n\r\nIf Sion's main damage is from his passive shouldn't he get something more than getting 100% life steal, a Attack Speed Buff, % HP damage to the target, and a Move Speed increase by re-activating a spell? I mean you could argue that these buffs are really strong and I totally agree with you but I wanted to suggest buffing his uh passive spell and giving him extra Move Speed.\r\n\r\nNow the MS (Move Speed) would be increased to a flat 400, why not make it scale? Well his passive spell gives him a pretty huge MS increase and to make it scale would be crazy. Now if your not aware of this when Sion enters his passive state he actually doesn't get a MS increase, or I may be wrong, but it sure doesn't feel that way. \r\n\r\nNow onto his passive spells, something that always got me is the fact that once Sion gets one CC on him, hes done. Now something I want to see done is make his passive spell brake from the CC, like {{champion:12}}. Not make him immune to CC by casting it but just remove it also something that I would like to see, but might be a big stretch, is to make him get tenacity from entering his passive form. Maybe like 10% but that just might be too much to ask for.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you too would like to see these changes? Or are there some buffs you want new Sion to get? Any feed back is better than no feed back.","replies":[{"poster":"King of Ferrets","date":"2015-01-07T11:01:32.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the big problem with Sion's passive is that it will always feel undertuned when he's balanced properly, because otherwise they're just going to be sucking way too much of his power budget away from actually, you know, being able to *do things* when he's alive. I get the impression that the budget they gave it is closer to Koggie and Zyra than Karthus (Karthus has to die to function, and almost always does something if he dies in a teamfight - Sion gets occasional REVENGE KILLS when the timing/positioning/etc is right. He can revenge kill people that have higher percent health than Zyra or Kog, but at the cost of being less reliable than either.)\n\nTechnically, he could be balanced with a version of the passive that doesn't feel undertuned, but he'd probably become a melee Karthus if he did, and he'd be frankly boring if more useful alive than dead - he'd be focused on the high moments of being literally a right-click champion with one ability, which is an MS boost. (Not that his passive is boring at the moment - the sheer drain-tanky-ness of it combined with the constant HP loss provides some interesting decision making, especially in terms of target choice - but it would be poor as the focus of a champion compared to his normal kit.) Unfortunately, the buff to his passive I think would be most useful at making it feel good would probably push him in this direction. If the passive popped as soon as he died (ala Kog/Karthus) rather than having a brief animation (ala Zyra/Aatrox), it would be a massive reliability boost and fix the bad feeling of \"oh, I died, now they're just going to run out of my range during the animation\".\n\nTL;DR - Sion's passive should probably stay like it is for game health reasons. However, it's designed poorly to always feel undertuned when healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"LANWhale","date":"2015-01-07T19:26:42.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess, I didn't think of the health of the game play actually.

Building {{item:3074}} {{item:3022}} . Because the Frozen Mallet Gives the slow on hit, it provides the slow anyone caught by him, Forcing them to either Flash, dash, or attempt to duel you.  The Hydra provides the massive LS bonus on it's passive an active giving more Opportunities to sustain. \n\nThe Problem with SR is you really are not going to have room for these Items, when the meta says that you should Focus Tank stats. Top lane Sion basically builds unkillable tank while spamming E for minion farm. Personally I prefer using him as a Jungler. His Q damage has good enough scaling.
