But I have looked for so long on how honor checkpoints work. And I have yet to find an answer. Yes, we understand that being honorable will increase your honor level. But.. how? Is there an algorithm to determine and place honor levels, like the ranking system? Do you have to play a certain amount of games? Get a certain amount of honors? What do we have to do? Oh, simple, right? &quot;Just go look at their page on the honor system&quot;. You told us about pretty much everything. The levels, the flairs, the rewards. You told us what checkpoints are. I read the FAQ and you tell us what checkpoints are. I read other forums and you tell us what checkpoints are. We know. But. Where. Are. The. Statistics? How do you move up in honor? Tell us please. I beg this, on behalf of my fellow summoners who have searched in vain for an answer.","replies":[]}
