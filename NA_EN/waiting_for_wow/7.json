SO WHAT DO U THINK IS GOING HAPPEN WHEN THE LEAST HORRID OPTION IS NOW THE ONLY OPTION?\n\nher winrate dropped by 8 percent.. WHO DA THUK??\n\nat the same time.. the gutting of {{item:3116}}  the SAME PATCH dropped hr wrinrate ANOTHER 5%\nuntil for 3 patches she tied the record for the tenth lowest winrate in the HISTORY of league for her main role at 38%\n\nin fact TO THIS DAY i have only been incorrect in my nid predictions on TWO occasions.
