Comet and Aery have no niche uses or niche champions they should be used on they are just raw and general damage that every champion can use. Phase Rush which should be a niche mage keystone feels terrible on every mage right now and is being kept that way because of all the bruisers that want to use it.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2017-11-17T16:13:40.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo. Be creative, make the runes work for you mage champ. I was on the PBE the other day and I tried Electrocute on Zoe in a custom game and ,oh boy, does it destroy. I know I played up against NPCs but the rune was great for her. \nI even tried out some things for my favorite mage, well my favorite until Zoe comes out. Sorcery is not amide towards mages nor any other type of champion style. It all comes down to how you like to play. I like high early game burst damage, so I go electrocute pretty often with Quinn. But if I have to go tank or bruiser I either go for the Press the Attack or the new and better grasp of the undying.\nIf you like late game high burst damage, dark harvest is just for you and it works amazingly well with Quinn and her Dusk in mid to late game. \nDude, just find your play style. This is what so fun with the new runes. And I a going to make a post on great Quinn rune builds for all types. So if you want to learn how to play her and what type you are with her, then just keep looking on the site for my post.\nGL man, and have fun.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galactic Mayhem","date":"2017-11-17T13:10:15.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't need to be,that's was the point of the new runes,more choices","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metleon","date":"2017-11-17T14:02:24.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Champs like MF and Jhin really should be taking sorcery because they want the ad moreso than attack speed and aren't assassins.\n\nNo tree is really restricted to actually certain class.
