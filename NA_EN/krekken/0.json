I keep getting one shotted from a champ that I have enough MR to at least ult him. \nRengar is great! If you enjoy having your cc being canceld (I swear if that cancels Ahri's charm)\nLeBlanc passive is not needed. Stupid 3 hit passive. Really creative Riot.\nZed I feel like is the same.\nSame with Ekko\nKatarina-- I haven't fought against too many Kats but with the ones I have played with, they have said the combo is the EXACT SAME and the rework is more of a buff because you can get two spinning blades in place of one.\n\nI think Riot needs to stop and analyze the assassin class as a whole and wonder what is the problem. Or maybe listen to the players and stop having Kat getting her a reset upon kill or Akali not costing energy when she ults.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-11-12T16:34:40.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2016-11-12T17:23:36.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooohhhh.

Overall it works well but he does too much in a 1v1 more than ever. But the stealth is really fine tbh it has proper points of power.\n\nAkali will hopefully be properly addressed in her relaunch but nothing HOT atm(shots fired at a certain player xD)\n\nAD Shaco only got damage nerfs and rank 1 stealth hit, I'm not worried cause damage is easily fixable and rank 1 stealth can be increased to a manageable 2 seconds rank 1 and scale per level instead of rank to address their balance issue of stealth gap closers.\n\nFizz takes more to play now imo. Properly gated and moments of power well expressed. Feels like him+kat just need more time to practice to me.\n\nRengar's wasn't a failure but keeping bonetooth is. He can't actually reactively cancel CC if he jumps on you, you still have plenty of time to CC him. But bonetooth again as it has since release is breaking him. His new kit is entirely fine aside from it.... Shame they still won't just give him his own version of kha evolution, even fits his hunter theme still...\n\nLB isn't a 3 hit, if anything it actually needs a lower cook time per level down to 1 second late game. Her rework addressed her issues fully.\n\nSo I really don't believe anyone except akali, who's planned for a relaunch, was a failure. That's why I assumed it was a joke :P","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2016-11-13T13:57:31.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was I exaggerating? Yes. Did I mean Akali and Rengar are more so questionable a failure, yes. It was more  of a hyperbole then a joke but you caught it... somewhat. \n\nAlso, my apologies for LeBlanc and her Passive. That was just Talon. I forget the specifics of a champion that I care only the abilities of.
