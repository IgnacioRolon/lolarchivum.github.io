With old tribunal when they showed all chat and all reports/messages it didn't matter.  You are responsible for what you type.  You have options other than raging or being toxic for dealing with other toxic players.\n\n2. Toxicity attracts toxicity.

Considering the most egregious of those that I report do get banned. [This thread is a great example of someone who I reported. Level 137 account. Soft inting/passive behavior in ARAM not SR. That's a permaban. Not a restriction.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/4bchKgdr-my-account-has-been-permanently-banned-for-feeding-in-aram-despite-having-a-positive-kda)  They didn't type jack.

You're responsible for your behavior. They are reasonable for theirs.\n\nPlay the game not the text wall.

Not that I really care, I have already figured out how the game is rigged at this point, so I just play to waste time and goof off. \n\nRiot has made bot lane a total fuk fest.\nIf you don't have one of the 3 OP  ADCs and your skill level is the same or slightly better than your opponent, you lose. With the snow balling effect, you are unlikely to ever catch up after dying 3 times. I base this on thousands of games played. After 0/3 that's it. Unless you can farm for 30 minutes and run up against the level 18 ceiling, the game is over before you can catch up.\n\nSupport is hard to get right and easy to fuk up.

If I just a little better than bronze, which I am...I will never get there. Not that I really care, I have already figured out how the game is rigged at this point, so I just play to waste time and goof off. \n> \n> Riot has made bot lane a total fuk fest.\n> If you don&#x27;t have one of the 3 OP  ADCs and your skill level is the same or slightly better than your opponent, you lose. With the snow balling effect, you are unlikely to ever catch up after dying 3 times. I base this on thousands of games played. After 0/3 that&#x27;s it. Unless you can farm for 30 minutes and run up against the level 18 ceiling, the game is over before you can catch up.\n> \n\nChoosing the correct champions for the meta, team composition, individual style, and individual skill also fits as a facet that works under the same principles.\n\nIf the people you are matched with choose better champions, your winrate will decrease. If the people you are matched with choose worse champions, your winrate will increase.\n\n> Support is hard to get right and easy to fuk up. I think they should change jungle and support, but they wont. All I want support to do , is harass the enemy adc and make them fall behind or get zoned out and protect me and ward a bush, any bush. That is soooooo easy to do. But they just can&#x27;t do it.\n> Brand , Lux support never work. They &quot;accidentally&quot; push like crazy all time while starving the ADC. Of course they do ok, but it is at the expense of the ADC who is then irrelevant and gets flamed the rest of the game while the &quot;support&quot; goes 12/4/5.\n\nI moved these lines together, because first you ask for harass and then you criticize it. But, aside from that, if you think that supporting the varied tempos, aggression levels, skill levels, and champions is an easy thing, then you should do it. Either you will rank up because it is easy to do well, or you will gain appreciation for its difficulty.\n> \n> You leave out a lot of variables from your neat little arrangement.

They wont.\n> \n> I am not allowed to manage the wave as my support takes it away from me, while making sure neither of us gets the cs so he can point to his cs number in his defense.  &quot;But I only have 3 cs&quot;.....a duuurrrr.\n> \n> \n> Most winning bot lanes are duo together which should not be allowed in solo cue. That one thing almost always guarantees success. If I que with friends and we play bot we almost always win until we get up to playing against gold, then I just can&#x27;t play at that level. And why are 2 bronze players matched against gold anyway?\n\nThe matchmaking formulas do account for grouping status. It is expected that groups will play with slightly more cohesion than pugs. [Matchmaking Support Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954) Based on [this support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) it would seem unlikely to be matched with gold players while bronze in the ranked queue. Normals have their own MMR, and as such you may be placed against any rank based on their normals history.\n> \n> The whole game is rigged. You are penalized for winning. The people you are matched with gets worse and worse every game you win. You simplae ratio does not take any of this into consideration.\n\nIf your assessment was correct, then all that would be required to win and rank up is to be worse than average. Because if you're worse, then you'd get stronger teammates, who'd win, and you'd rank up. Be a poor gold 3, get matched with stronger gold 3s who carry you to gold 2. Be a poor Master and you'd get matched with stronger Masters who'd rank you up to challenger.\n-----------------------------\nThe game pulls you, your teammates, and your opponents out from the same pool. This pool is \"people at or around this specific MMR\". \n\nFor example: Imagine that your teammates and your enemies were pulled from people at Challenger level MMR. You'd have 4 challengers and you on a team. Your opponents would be 5 challengers. The other team would almost certainly win. As the skill level of your team and opponents rise, your personal winrate drops.\n\nAnother example: Imagine that your teammates and your enemies were pulled from a preschool. These little humans cannot read or write. They have very low mouse/eye coordination. They have very short attention spans and may wander off during the game. You'd have 4 preschoolers and you on a team. Your opponents would be 5 preschoolers. Your team would almost certainly win. As the skill level of your team and opponents drop, your personal winrate also rises.\n\nNow, ranked MMR exists on a spectrum between 60 and 3000ish. That roughly translates from preschooler to challenger. \n\nYour team and your opponents are drawn from the same pool, the same MMR. Starting at 60 MMR, your winrate would be decently high. As you won games, you would rank up. As you rank up, your winrate steadily declines, because you are facing tougher opponents. How high you climb, and the rate at which your winrate declines is based on your personal skill, how much you personally contribute to a given team's chance of winning.\n\nIf you started at 3000 MMR, your winrate would be decently low. As you lost games, you would rank down. As you rank down, your winrate steadily increases, because you are facing worse opponents. How far you drop and the rate at which your winrate increases is based on your personal skill, how much you personally contribute to a given team's chance of winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-08-21T02:53:48.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silent Gravity,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=RqoOtUzV,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-08-21T01:13:36.562+0000)\n>\n> Are you saying that you have a different number of teammates than 4 and a different number of opponents than 5?\n \nJust wanted to respond to this part here. It is possible to have less than 4 or more than 5 teammates or opponents respectively if you're playing Twisted Treeline, which is a 3v3 game mode, or are playing Hexakill (a 6v6 mode).","replies":[{"poster":"nubulas2","date":"2018-08-23T05:24:08.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No what I am saying is statistics fail in 50% of all situations or they would rule with absolute authority and they don't , because nothing is ever 100%...\n\nJust because you can make the 4 and 5 arrangement sound nice and neat doesn't mean it is true or that it is of practical use.","replies":[{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2018-08-26T09:15:32.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing Silent Gravity is trying to tell you is, that your team has 4 potential idiots, while the enemy team has 5 potential idiots.
