Anyone reading any of your posts can come to the exact same conclusion. \n\nRiot themselves have stated that the game is balanced toward high level play. Therefore, champion.gg is a more valid source for winrates than lolking. Now, you have two options, keep whining on a forum full of people smart enough to invalidate your complaints and continue to look like a petty child or accept the fact that this player is better than you and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-08-09T00:12:03.403+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I cited champion.gg to show how players who play Ahri for the first time win 52 percent of their games with her.\n\nI have been telling people how broken Ahri is weeks ago...it has nothing to do with the recent game. Even if you go on champion.gg you see that Ahri has the 3rd highest winrate out of all midlaners while having the highest pick rate out of any midlane champs and out of all the champs that have a higher winrate than her (from all roles) only Janna has a higher pickrate than Ahri.\n\nThis has nothing to do with a single player being better, it is about a champ. You see the numbers yourself, there is no denying the fact that no other champ enjoys such a high winrate despite being picked so often, even by people who don't \"main\" her. If you can pick a champ you have never played in ranked before and have a 52 percent chance to win the game what does that tell you about the champ?\nFor comparison, Azir has like a 42 percent winrate for players who have 1-5 ranked games on him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1000angrybees","date":"2015-08-09T00:14:11.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've come to the conclusion that with EVERY site having all DIFFERENT statistics- including some of the same charts in the same categories- that i literally don't give a shit about non-cohesive data that changes practically every couple of hours.","replies":[{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2015-08-09T00:20:37.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sites show statistics with different cut offs.
