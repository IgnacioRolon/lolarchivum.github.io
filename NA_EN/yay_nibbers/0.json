Also Ahri","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I read the good Sir Santagelo&#039;s journal and I wonder, does he even know what he&#039;s talking about? \n>I would theorize that the vastaya are not an individual species, but a taxonomic classification more on par with a larger order, or a phylum. \n\n**&quot;Phylum&quot;**. He does realize how far out there that would put the vastaya away from not only humans but other vastaya, right? For reference, humans and fish both belong to the same phylum (chordata), and I&#039;m sure you can tell just how different we are as animals. *In entirely other phyla,* you have things like insects, snails, and even creatures down to the microscopic level all in different phyla. You can tell just by looking at the various vastaya shown to us that they&#039;re all almost definitely within our own phylum, ****as vertebrates are (among some others). A case could be made for them being their own *order*, especially when you consider the origin Santangelo was told, but even that (and phylum as well) is thrown out the window when he mentions the possibility of insect vastaya. &quot;At this rate, the next vastayan creature I see could likely resemble a walking roach.&quot;\n\nWe also have to take into account their human origins, that is, the fact that they&#039;re at least half human (or the first generation of them are at least). Then theres the shapeshifters that the human refugees somehow paired with. Considering creatures of different species (let alone higher classification levels) generally can&#039;t reproduce together, they must be human as well.\n\nOf course, this could just be a man trying to make sense out of something magical, which by nature doesn&#039;t always make a lot of sense. \n\nBasically: Magic is weird, vastaya (like magic) are weird, Santagelo is doesn&#039;t know jack, other stuff\n---\nRegarding Ahri: Ahri&#039;s inclusion doesn&#039;t make sense. If Ahri were a vastaya, would there not be more fox ladies running around (yes please)? Not to mention her lore contradicts their supposed origin, solely on the fact that she was born a fox who was magically transformed into a human (or almost a human, she&#039;s working on it). Meanwhile, what we&#039;re told would suggest the vastaya are born the way they are. As vaguely as they&#039;re described, Ahri could *maybe* be a member of the tribe of magical shapeshifters that originally helped bring the vastaya into existence through their pairing with a bunch of humans, but that still puts her out of the vayasta.\n\nAll that taken into account, either the pig merchant is a liar or Ahri is getting a lore update soon.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-04-04T04:07:48.945+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Not exactly.

With the new backstory, it really explains why Ahri looks so **different**. Other Vastayan's are either animal people, or their bloodline is so diluted they're basically humans with shapeshifting capabilities.\n\nAhri though, Ahri is \"in between\". Her appearance by and large is very much and distinctly human, but she has very distinct animalistic features and nonhuman behavior. Combined with the fact that Riot apparently plans this shit out **years** in advance (with room for changes based on brainstorming and ideation, I suspect), I get the impression this is very much intentional.\n\nWhat _I'm_ curious about is this; if Vastayans require a certain level of magical ambience, assuming Rengar is a Vastaya- assuming, Riot has given no explicit confirmation besides \"Rengar knows what he is\"- then how can he apparently roam and hunt where he pleases?

Her eyes met his and he knew she felt the same.\nBut it was more than that.\nWyn felt a connection between him and everyone in the audience, a sense of oneness and harmony he’d never known or dreamed was possible.

On top of that, the domestic dog is itself a subscecies of the canis lupus, gray wolves, which has many other subspecies besides the domestic dog.

Basically they are too different to count as a single species.\n\nNow as for the common/rarity of people like Ahri we will have to wait on a lore update from her but there are a couple things to consider.  First of all vastaya are pretty rare.  Most of the world doesn't seem to know they exist at all.  As such it isn't surprising that a tribe of fox people could live without being known about, especially if they have reclusive tendencies.\n\nHowever we still don't know that Ahri is a vastaya.  As far as I know her lore is still canonical.  Based on her current lore that fox lady could be entirely different from Ahri or perhaps Ahri has simply could a place among the vastaya.  She might be magically created (Similarly to how WW was a human) but in her current form it makes sense that she would choose to live in an area where she would be mistaken as one of the locals.\n\nAlso note that we don't know for sure how vastaya are made.  If you remember the vastaya the author originally stayed with became very offended when asked about it and as such it could be a secret of the vastaya.  Perhaps they aren't born (Or at least the first vastaya of each species aren't born) but rather created through a magical melding.  That would fit with what we know of Ahri.
