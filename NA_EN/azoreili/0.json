I understand that it's necessary, for several different reasons, just like server maintenance itself (including server restarts). The question, however, is....why two nights in a row? They say \"brief disruptions in service\" but i tend to get ping spikes rather frequently. Is this something that must be done while servers are live? Was something goofed last night, or are they just splitting it up over the coarse of several days during non-peak times (which just so happens to be when i play the most, because of work/sleep schedules). I really wish Riot would actually give announcements beforehand, and just information in general on this kind of thing. Some people actually like to be aware of these things, and not left in the dark. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-07T15:44:37.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We try and give a heads up for scheduled server maintenance or issues as soon as possible.  I recommend bookmarking our [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page to keep updated on upcoming downtime.  For example, we currently have one schedule for the incoming patch.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
