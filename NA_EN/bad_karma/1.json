You are so right, it works well for her and especially her personality!  Plus, it has this mysterious vibe. (Gosh I am so hyped now >_<) The wings are really awesome and the outfit is simply stunning. Her white curly hair (first time on her, since she only has straight one in her other skins) fits perfectly. I can imagine wonderful green and (well, it's purple) purple particles, but I am so ready to see other colours of this skin line (since it's my favourite one!) Maybe her soil would dissolve into feathers after the duration expires? So many awesome possibilities! Tell me what you think about that! =)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-03T18:03:14.664+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the different hairstyle personally.

I think a good start would be the soil idea you had, where it dissolves into feathers.\n\nWell the particles do look similar, but in my opinion the theme is totally different! For me, Ghost Bride expresses pain, sadness and loneliness, and the Ravenborn one displays mystery and darkness. Eventhough the particles are quite similar, the iconic attribute for the Ravenborn particles are the spectral-feathery look of them. How I said, the soil idea could work out very well, and I think it could be done very well with spectral like feathers. I've got other ideas aswell for her other particles. Especially the soundeffects on her spells (if there would be any, but I'd appreciate sounds like the one LB has (since they fit the mysterious theme). :) Overall, I think Ravenborn brings in also a little royal vibe, which is accentuated A LOT by Morgana's beautiful gown - which is also iconic for the fallen angel.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SuperOmelette","date":"2015-04-04T00:16:43.935+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elysian Astraea,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=UHWkIH9E,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-04-03T17:49:19.277+0000)\n>\n> Maybe her soil would dissolve into feathers after the duration expires?

(because i feel like the purple needs black feathers to work, i dont want the dress to be green...) White feathers would be scary too and get the dress kinda lik reaper soraka colors. or a white dress?\n\nalso i feel like we dont see/ hear (lorewise) a lot about the angels in LoL (are you planning on expanding that like mount targon rework? add a ne angeltype champ?), we know we have Kayle and Morgana but Kayle in her fully angelic robes is different from Morgana in her almost turned dark- robes because Kayle is a warrior and Morgana a mage. \nSO What about a skin (not this one but like another concept) that shows Morgana if she hadnt taken the dark path but practiced good magic? White wings, maybe even an elo above her head etc i would look forward to seeing a ravenborn/ archangel Morgana skin!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreddeth","date":"2015-04-04T06:15:24.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I'd go with a deep red, or maroon.
