I have lost probably around 30 lp and a promo series because of this and after looking around for solutions I saw the hextech repair tool and figured I might try that since everything else seemed to not work. I installed it and did a regular client repair and went back into league and I was dodged out of champ select. I went back into the repair tool and tried to repatch it. It went through the scans and everything and the bottom said \"Gathering logs..\" and then the repair tool just closes. If I re open it and try again the same thing happens. League is completely unplayable for me right now and I would really like to repatch the client but even that isn't working properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-21T03:22:44.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there could be something blocking the repair tool from running.

I never asked for it but it's on by default. It took a little while before it affected my friends in the same manner but when I told them to disable the overlay in discord settings they found it was a good solution.\n\nBasically the game was working 100% but nobody documented the error I was facing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KingKrul","date":"2017-09-24T10:00:25.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem.  I uninstalled the repair tool and reinstalled it like the RIOT Admin recommended.  I then ran the repair tool as admin.  I got the same error.  I then deselected all the options that it allowed me to deselect.  Which  left \"Run Ping Test\" and \"Sync System Clock\" selected, only cause they are grayed out for deselection.  I then selected \"Reinstall\" and \"Clean Uninstall\",  then ran the program, and it worked perfectly.  In hindsight, you don't have to reinstall the Hextech Repair Tool, or run it as admin.  Just deselect everything it allows you to, and select \"Reinstall\" and \"Clean Uninstall\" .  I know this post is 6 months old, and this is my first post ever on the boards in 7 years.
