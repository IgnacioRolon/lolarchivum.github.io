I was able to play on medium to medium-high graphics and be A-OK with 30-50 ms. Then blood moon map came out and I couldn't play at all on that- massive ping spikes. Same with aram. So I thought it's just special maps it can't handle whatever. But the last couple of days I've been jumping on normal summoners rift to 300ms, 800ms 1.4k ms, 2.5k ms and up and down and up and down and there's no easily noticeable reason that would make me go \"oh yeah it has to be that obviously\"... pls help it's actually driving me nuts. Tell me what info you need and I'll do my best to provide.","replies":[{"poster":"DaNinad","date":"2017-03-06T00:39:34.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same problem, mine usually stays around 40 ish ms,  but now it spikes to 400-800 sometimes and it seriously affects my gameplay","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T00:04:54.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection to our game servers may be impeded by something local on your network.
