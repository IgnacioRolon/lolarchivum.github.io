This needs to stop.

Even humans are not able to judge that with accuracy in all but the most obvious cases - which do get punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Detrimis","date":"2019-12-19T05:17:31.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you explain 5 AFK's in 8 games?

It's hard to see it. But I was up 7/1 and then the fed bot lane came to mid and I had to deal with it. Then my team mates went afk. Watch the game and you'll see.\n\nAnd... I still stand by what I said. It's totally natural to be upset by the gross amount of AFK's. If you experienced this as well, you'd be upset. There's no denying my team went AFK. You can see it in the replays. So yes, MUCH harsher penalties. It doesn't matter even if the team is doing poorly, it is bad sportsmanship to AFK. Srsly, need much much much harsher penalties.
