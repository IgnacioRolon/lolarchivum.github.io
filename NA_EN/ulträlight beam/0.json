For instance, you can yell and rage at the screen, punch a pillow, squeeze a stress ball, type it out in a Word document, etc. Not only do these things let you vent your frustrations but they also don't put you at risk for an account punishment.\n\n> chat should be opt in to begin with. if someone is so sensitive then they can not have chat enabled. if they enable chat and they troll then they deserve to hear how theyre making the other people feel, its good to know the consequences of your actions.\n\nIf you ask me the sensitive ones are the people who feel the need to lash out at others the moment things go south and who can't stand the fact that there are actual consequences for misbehavior. Chat is meant to be used as communication tool, not a \"flame those you don't like\" tool. From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nFrom [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&amp;page=1#post43465401): \n\n>**People who report are simply being oversensitive.

When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player._\n\n>Simply put, Riot says no. You can scream and cry all you want, but it is their house and their rules.\n\n>With that out of the way, I think the topic deserves some further discussion. The theory is that, if people resolved to care less, then they would be happier. I often refer to this as Argument from Stoicism and I think it is a fairly weak philosophy because it places the burden on the person being expected to endure the behavior rather than the person exhibiting the behavior. You should be able to handle it is just a flimsy excuse for being a bully or a jerk.

Don't do it.\nEverything you said here about being treated differently is a punishment, which is justifiable. That is completely different from you flaming people in the game. The people in your games have not broken any laws, and do not deserve to be punished by you.\n\n> Doing your homework is an effort, not like pressing a button. I can easily understand why some people do not want to waste their time with homework. The question is more like: You are in a 40°C room, you have to press ONE BUTTON to turn on the AC (which is free). If you do not press the button then you want the hot room, i can not see any other explanation.\n\nThis is just the same example of you not understanding that there is a difference between WANTING something bad and failing to stop it.\n\nEveryone is worth the same. I never said value IN THE COMMUNITY'S EYES. I said VALUE IN THE GENERAL SENSE. This means: you have a life, and a desire to avoid pain and seek pleasure. It should be EQUALLY respected, regardless of whatever crimes have been commited in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"DaBooosh","date":"2019-07-25T17:58:08.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> No, there isn't more.

I am telling you: saying that it is the people who failed to mute you who are at fault that they got hurt is the same thing as saying all of this!

Yes, they are clearly not murderers or rapists, but they are doing something wrong. You might not value your own time at all, because you think that the troll is just as good as a person as you, and let him have his fun, but in my view they clearly do something wrong.\n\nExcuse me sir? The majority of players don't do poorly in the game on purpose. If they are wasting your time, they are wasting their own as well.

You are a PLAYER and do not have the power to hand out punishments. The rapist's life is NOT ANY LESS RESPECTED.\nThey are being punished for their crime, which is necessary to create a good community. They are not being given any pain that is UNJUSTIFIED.\n\nAlso, the second purpose is to protect others while the person is still dangerous.
