We picked our champs, I picked Draven he picked Jayce (idk why) but 2 guys from our team suddenly said that they are going botlane too.\nI got tilted so i started to feed middle. we lost.  THAT IS MY 1 GAME THAT I TILTED AND FED. \nNext day i logged onto my account and got 14-day suspension :) ??? for 1 game that i fed ? \nBut thats not the thing i am angry about. The thing is that i dropped my honor level to 0. ZERO\nI would not make this discussion if i wouldÂ´ve dropped to level 1,  but level 0 ?\n_**I am responsible for my decisions** ._ i fed that ONE god damn game.\n\ngame: http://matchhistory.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUN1/1749605393/31203281?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T01:51:32.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good that you realized that intentionally feeding in that one game was still negative behavior. I went ahead and pulled up your account to see what happened with your honor level, and it looks like our system detected a history of feeding from player reports which issued the 14 day suspension. \n\nIf you check out the [**Honor FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148), a two week suspension will drop your Honor Level to 0 regardless of where you currently are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-14T01:36:37.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally an inter gets caught.
