I would first reach out to them to see if there's anything unusual going on, and be sure to point out the trace you've run and the 65% packet loss results you got. That should give them some data to work off of and see what's happening.\n\nif they don't see any issues or aren't willing to look into it, go ahead and shoot this over in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with some network logs as well so our techs can take a look to see if anything weird is happening somewhere else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-01-07T17:12:35.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Website browsing is not as impacted by packet loss, due to the fact that there is no real-time constraint. I would bet that you have packet loss during your internet browsing, but all that it will do is make the page load more slowly (due to the need to get packets repeatedly sent).","replies":[]}]}
