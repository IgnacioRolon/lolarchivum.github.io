This has led to everyone adhering to the social norm known as showering due to their underlying need to feel accepted and wanted by society. Some social norms are fine, but showering is actually HURTING you and putting you at serious risks.\n\nHere are just a few of the MANY reasons why showering is BAD and you should stop showering immediately.\n\n1. Vitamin D, as a fat-soluble vitamin, is made in the oily layer of your skin. It is then slowly absorbed over 2 – 3 days. If you shower and use soap, you will wash this oily layer off your skin and will not absorb the vitamin D you just made!\n\n2. Showers disturb the natural bug flora of the skin as well as skin oils. In other words, if you get rid of the good bacteria, you interfere with one of your body’s simplest defenses against germs\n\n3. You are washing away dead skin cells, which help protect us from undesirable bacteria, and they can make it harder for some harmful chemicals to easily penetrate the skin\n\n4. Your body produces oils to keep it soft and supple. Hot water (from hot showers) softens these oils and makes them easier to strip away, leaving your skin drier and more prone to flakiness","replies":[]}
