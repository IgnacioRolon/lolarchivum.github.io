I think Reksai is fairly balanced right now; I laughed the first time I played her on release because I knew right away her kit was overloaded.

Vi is a far scarier jungler, jarvan too. Reksai can get away with falling behind because her clear amps up after 6. So even if she falls behind she can adapt and farm up a storm in a few clears.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-11T15:21:18.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At level three her jungle clear isn't even all that impressive compared to vi, lee, jarv.also tunnels have a long cd at that level.
