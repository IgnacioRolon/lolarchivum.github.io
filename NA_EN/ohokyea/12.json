It's alright in jungle if you have 5 ferocity. W is cool if you can get in range. Best scaling ability with AP. Doesn't make sense to build AP since it's range is non existent so you'd just do a bit of damage then die. E is pretty nice, and can get a 1.75 second root so your team mates can finish off whatever's trying to get away. does decent damage and scales well. The R is really cool. That's about it. The only time I tried to use it, I was going to go finish off an enemy champ that didn't know I was there but rengar unstealthed after less than 2 seconds for some reason and jumped at the enemy. So I died instantly.\r\n\r\nJust wondering what I should do with him. Build ferocity and wait in bush to root? I wanted to build for damage but he doesn't scale well and can't really escape when being fired upon or CC'd. So I figured I'd build tank but didn't do much damage so I just got ignored by the enemy lol. Wanted to try the 20 kill/assist bonus from the necklace, to see how fast he can go across the map but couldn't get it without feeding, so not really worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-26T06:04:53.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"with rengar you build ALL damage and armor pen. Hydra, Yumoos, Last whisper, Triforce if you want. Then you delete squishies with your ult.","replies":[{"poster":"OhOkYea","date":"2015-02-26T06:07:32.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ult doesn't do any damage? I stopped trying to use it offensively when I realized how quickly he dies soon as he makes any sort of attack. Doesn't really seem to be much help to the team outside of ebola throw.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-26T06:09:22.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol what. Build damage and he does damage. He's an assassin. Ult someone out of position, leap on their face and delete them. His ult stealths him and increases his movement towards champions.","replies":[{"poster":"OhOkYea","date":"2015-02-26T06:16:42.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I'll try again with a damage build. Not sure though. Seems like a master yi with stealth and much less damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-26T06:23:36.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit of advice, always gank with full ferocity, even with ult up. Use ult to get close with 5 stacks then use Q or E to root or burst depending, then get more stacks from the aftermath of breaking stealth. Can kill a lot of champs this way. Use ult to secure kills and scout surroundings before going for a risky play.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"N3mO06","date":"2015-02-26T12:05:42.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also wanted to try Rengar in Free week and wanting to use him in the top I asked a friend of mine (Plat 2) how to use him. He discouraged me for using rengar top from every point of view: because even if he has more damage then other laner He can't take him  because of his situational mobility (vs gnar for example) or because he is outscaled level 6 as with Irelia or jax or simply because he has less damage, less stats and less CC as against Riven, Renekton, Jarvan, Lissandra, Kennen. So this friend of mine told me to use him only in the jungle, however, because the damage was still good. My problem is that, in my case the mid lane is ungankable if there is a LeBlanc, a kata or one zed simply because in mid the bushes are too far away to use th closegap and when I use the final  the enemy jumps away when see the exclamation point. So the only way is waiting for an error-----to situational compared to Vi or jarvan who can gank if they want----- I have also read that after the rework empowered skills  scale with the level and now that jungle suffers from lack of experience I find myself always 1-2 liv under the topper that has only farmed althoughI have 4 kills. So I think that this also helps to make  difficult rengar's life. My opinion is that he is a  too situational champ and too easily countered (I jump, the enemy has a ga or zhonya and I can not do anything, but not anything like Zed, who has the ability to savehimself in a click of r , but the kind that I die badly and feel useless","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-02-26T06:55:51.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before you even think about playing Rengar, watch videos of him.
