I bought a full set of tier 2 on my smurf because of how cheap and how close they are to tier 3. Jeeze.\n\nLet's compare a set of runez:\n\nTier 3 AP blues give 10.71 AP\n\nTier 2 AP blues give 8.28 AP\n\nThis is a net difference of 2.43 AP.\n\nWhen you look at the cost difference it just becomes hilarious:\n\nA full set of tier 3 AP blues will cost 3690 IP at 410 IP per rune.\n\nA full set of tier 2 AP blues will cost 315 IP at 35 IP per rune.\n\nThe tier 3 runes cost nearly 12 TIMES MORE than the tier 2 with a marginal benefit to stats.","replies":[]}
