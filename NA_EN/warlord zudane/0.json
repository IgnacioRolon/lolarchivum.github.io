I did pretty well and got an S rank.  I received the chest for the S rank, but not my level 6 token.  I certainly would like to get that token.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-20T23:15:48.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats on your level up!  Per the [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide, tokens are actually only available through Summoner's Rift currently.  Also as a heads up, it's not possible to level up to 6 and get a token in the same game.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
