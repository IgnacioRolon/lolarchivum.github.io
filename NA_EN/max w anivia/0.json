However, I've notice that once in a while I end up in a game where I've had insane ping. Usually it's about ~250ms, but this ARAM game i just had was the worst. I can't predict the issue, it just seems to happen once every dozen games or so.\r\n\r\nI tried Alt-F4ing to the desktop, restarting my computer, and logging back into League, but I was still getting about the same ping. Needless to say, it was extremely noticeable and made playing rather difficult this match. Timing shields and stuns correctly on Morgana was next to impossible with such a delay; I was basically guessing. \r\n\r\nI may not be that great of a player, but I would hate for this to happen in a ranked game. Not only for my own ranking, but because I would be a liability for my team due to issues outside of my control. I wasn't able to fix it for that game, but the following game, I had my typical ~60ms. Am I just getting randomly routed to the EU servers or something?\r\n\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2016-02-23T18:50:32.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry that you're having random ping spikes -- I know there's nothing more annoying than a connection going haywire in the middle of the match.

I think the problem is the internet provider. I've used Ethernet and (currently using)Wi-Fi, and they both give similar results. I have Time Warner Cable, and I was going to switch to someone else soon. If you do some research, you could probably find the best ISP for your area. http://www.speedtest.net/awards <--- You can check here.\n\nThen again, not to be pessimistic, but most big name companies that have really fast internet operate in NA and EU. If you're using Ethernet, and you have the best router you can get, with the best service provider, I don't think there's anything else you could do after that.","replies":[{"poster":"Cherysse","date":"2016-02-24T00:39:50.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you are trying to be possitive xD and thanks for the help, but actually Im just joking, currently Venezuela (hello here) is under a dictatorship and everything is f-ckd up so hard that if I tell you, you just wouldn't believe me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-03-03T05:58:47.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MarshmallowBob,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Hg2XA5nE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-23T18:50:32.715+0000)\n>\n> I'm sorry that you're having random ping spikes -- I know there's nothing more annoying than a connection going haywire in the middle of the match.
