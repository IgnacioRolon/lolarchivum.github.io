Wondering if someone could help me with these FPS Issues.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright so i made a post on the german forums a couple of weeks back. ( Maybe even a month or two now) about fps drops and i thought they had gone away but apparently they havent.\r\n\r\nBasically what is happening now is that i get an average of about 260 fps in games, but whenever i get into a teamfight/baronfight/dragonfight i can legit drop from 260/320 alllll the way down to about 30-50 fps which definitely affects my gameplay especially as an adc when i have to kite and backline effectively dealing with fps issues can really stop me from uneashing my best performance. Its not too bad to play at all and i know many people play with 30-50 on a regular basis, i was simply ondering why this may be happening.\r\n\r\nIm thankful for any help/tips or maybe what you did to fix a similar problem.\r\n\r\nBtw. I have an eight core 3.20 ghz processor and an nvidia geforce gtx 960 graphics car so i dont really think i should get these problems.\r\nMy monitor also runs 144hz refresh rate so i dont think thats the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso my processor isnt (boosted) or sth. my friend told me he boosted his processor to get higher fps or sth. But i didnt do that cos i dont feel like messing up this pc. I think its called \"overclocking\"\r\n\r\nAlso i have used the fix option in the launcher.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help ^^\r\n\r\nHope i get this sorted &lt;.&lt;, many happy wishes\r\n\r\n{{champion:83}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T17:55:56.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few factors that could be dropping your frames, like outdated drivers or bad game files.
