Even if your internet is solid, you can have problems accessing specific servers like the game server.

The average was 60ms but there were spikes for a couple pings at a time about double that. It says that I lost 0 packets throughout the whole test.

It will end up staying at that ping for about a minute or so and then drop back down. I also noticed that it pretty much always happens when large fights are happening.
