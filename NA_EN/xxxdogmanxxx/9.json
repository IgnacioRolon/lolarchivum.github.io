I will make the whole world believe that you are the pig!\"\nMonths later, it happened. While stalking the girls Facebook page as he had done for years now, he came across a newly uploaded picture, the girl with her nose pressed against glass, making her face appear similar to that of a pig.\nDakota smiled a sinister smile to himself, thinking \"You fool! This shall be your undoing!\"\nHe quickly got to work in photoshop, creating what he hoped would be the new hottest meme. This wish of his did not go the way he planned however, as the internet was not interested in his forced meme. \n\nTo this day, Dakota still posts this picture whenever he posts anything, hoping that one day it will finally catch on and he can finally enact his revenge on the girl from many years ago.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zak Kusar","date":"2017-06-01T17:21:29.531+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love how much this has to do with LoL!","replies":[]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-06-02T23:52:17.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had more free time as a student. \n\nYou had more freedom to set your own work schedule so long as things got done.\n\nThere was a very sustainable, balanced, and reasonable relationship with authority (teachers) for the most part.\n\nYou had work-life balance. \n\nPeople from above did not try to take over your entire life.\n\nThere was a lot less insincerity, politics, and passive aggressive BS power plays. \n\nSome of your peers may have been ______s, but they were also less likely to stab you in the back and play passive aggressive games against you.\n\nWhen you were expected to do X, you were expected to do X (if you did X + N, good job but whatevs)... now, if you're expected to do X, you're really expected to do X + N \n\nTeachers in general are much nicer and more patient than \"mentors\" and supervisors  \n\nHaving No Life and having your mind occupied by work 24/7 was considered unhealthy as opposed to a mandatory social exercise in bragging rights","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2017-06-02T02:21:53.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they dont reward you when you finish school work early tho","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-06-02T23:42:23.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I finished an hour early once.
