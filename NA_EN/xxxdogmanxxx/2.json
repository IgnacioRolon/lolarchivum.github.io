If the latter, it seems fairly unintuitive, and I might recommend adding something like a 10 second internal timer on single-source long-duration shields.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-10-25T06:22:25.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Captain Gameplay,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EewyubPW,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-10-25T00:10:12.645+0000)\n>\n> (ie: Malphite passive gives you infinite duration so long as the shield is on you)\n\n*sweats profusely*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stained Spear","date":"2018-10-25T01:09:06.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Captain Gameplay,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EewyubPW,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-10-25T00:10:12.645+0000)\n>\n> You have at least 4 seconds to proc it (Riven E short duration shield still gives you 4 seconds), but otherwise it lasts until you no longer have a shield (ie: Malphite passive gives you infinite duration so long as the shield is on you)\n\nI feel like overheal will be insanely strong with shield bash if you don't give this a long cd.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2018-10-25T06:15:49.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It won't be insanely strong.\n\nRemember, you can only stack Overheal with Lifesteal and active heals (meaning, no Warmog's/Hp5/Ocean Drake/Grey Health).

I didn't assume that all shields last 4 seconds at all.\n\n> Some shields are very short- the minimum is to normalize the duration.\n\nThe source of my confusion is that \"minimum\" is supposed to means that the proc time will never go below 4 seconds, meaning 4 seconds is the least amount of time you have to wait before you can proc it. If they wanted to \"normalize the duration\" as you say, hen they should have not included the word minimum at all and should have just said \"4 second proc window\".\n\nI'm fully aware that it wouldn't make much sense if they made it this way, which is why I'm confused in the first place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PÃ³ppy Chulo","date":"2018-10-24T21:32:50.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe \"Upon obtaining a shield, auto attacking within 4 seconds while shield is still active...\" is better wording","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2018-10-24T21:58:01.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, that is much better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aZ3R0n","date":"2018-10-24T21:13:41.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xxxDogmanxxx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EewyubPW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-10-24T21:08:18.003+0000)\n>\n> Are you sure?

On an adc, it's more about the fact it can continually be renewed than the fact of how strong each hit is. On Jinx or Draven, the rune can add about 40 damage per hit, and they have an easy time of getting to the Barrier proc. And Every time they take damage, they can reproc it. And Jinx.... at her insane auto attack range, can actually based on her mechanics... reliably abuse this, because anyone who gets close to Jinx is dead, so the only damage she's taking is skill shots. If she's got {{item:3031}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3080}} , she can literally overheal into shield almost constantly.\n\nThe Bonus Health part of the equation isn't as important as the size of the shield, or the base damage, which outstrips Scorch, Cheap Shot, any non keystone damage rune.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this is on hit physical damage for an adc, so that damage also will LIFE STEAL, speeding up the rate at which an adc gets to the heal.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox9T","date":"2018-10-25T00:16:00.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Also, an Overheal/BT champ can have a shield of up to 560\n\nunless you can can heal for 560 + all the damage you took with one AA you will proc this rune when the shield is weaker (so less damage)\nit's more likely to be 100/150 when you proc it\n\nalso this situation is going to happen only when you are enough fed to outheal their damage,which is not always going to happen and if it does you didn't need this bonus damage,you are already overfed\n\n>On Jinx or Draven, the rune can add about 40 damage per hit\n\nat lvl 18 where things like gathering storm or absolute focus would give you more damage with more reliability (you need your items and to get in this situation where you stay nearly full HP) + you don't have to take a resolve rune (others are not the best)\n\n\n>keep in mind that this is on hit physical damage for an adc, so that damage also will LIFE STEAL\n\nnope,lifesteal works only on the AA's direct damage,on hit effects and abilities won't heal you (you need spellvamp for that)","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-10-25T07:40:08.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) I'm just stating the potential, and Jinx can actually do that much life steal in one hit, since Fishbones + Runaan's almost triples her per hit Life steal. I'm more concerned about the fact an adc can dip in and out of the shield and abuse the BASE damage on the rune. If it wasn't for the Base being 10-39, plus a little, I don't think any adcs would take it. But 10-39 is a big deal compared to other runes.\n\n2) Gathering Storm on AD champs does not add more than this rune at any point in realistic game lengths. It adds more base stats, which would be useful..... if Adc skills scaled high on AD (most don't..... 50-70% AD multipliers)\n\n3) Why do you care about Resolve runes when now we have subrunes that you get to CHOOSE the base stats it gives? Resolve can still give AD or attack speed.\n\n4) Depends on what ability it is and what it's classified as. Some abilities are attacks. Runaan's secondary targets count as attacks. Some skills are specifically designed to apply attack based on hit structures.\n\nFishbones' added damage does life steal. Draven's enhanced Axes life steal. Ezreal's Q can Both Life steal and Spell Vamp. MF's passive life steals. Vayne's added damage can life steal, just not crit.\n\nOh. I forgot: {{item:3031}} has a hidden passive as well: It applies Life steal to all sources of physical damage from attacks, AND all sources of Physical damage converted to True Damage (including Conqueror). It's a hidden mechanic added to deal with the fact IE's conversion reduces life steal viability if it doesn't behave that way toward true damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LFG","date":"2018-10-24T22:26:53.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my guess is that, just from reading, you get the shield bash everytime you get a new shield. \nSo let say J4 uses his W to cast a shield, you dont have the bash yet.\nJanna shields J4, now you have a shield bash, you have 4 seconds to proc this(minimum 4s window).\nand before you can proc this another teammate like lux shields you, now you've resetted the window since you got a new shield on top of a new shield not 100% sure, but my guess is that everytime you get a new shield while proc is up, you'll get a new time window, first bash might be 4sec, next 6sec, etc","replies":[{"poster":"LFG","date":"2018-10-24T22:33:15.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or actually since i dont see any CD on the proc, it might be \nJ4 shield, Janna shields J4, you get a proc\nyou proc shield bash (you have 4 sec to proc this)\nif the shield hasnt expired and lux shields you on top of this you get another bash and this time the proc window might be longer. \nand so on everytime you get a shield on top of shield","replies":[]}]}]}
