Not really. In fact, all three of them hover around 48-49% win rate. So why do I ban them?\r\n\r\n{{champion:64}} - I ban this champ because statistically he is the most played Jungler in the game, even more than {{champion:104}}. This means that banning him gives me the highest chance of screwing over the enemy jungler even before the game starts.\r\n\r\n{{champion:67}} and {{champion:157}} - I ban both of them for the exact same reason: They int so damn often, and when they int, they int HARD. I haven't had a game with a {{champion:67}} where she doesn't die at least 6 times. For {{champion:157}}, he dies at least 7 times every time he's on my team. It's like the moment you play a champ like {{champion:67}} or {{champion:157}}, you get this massive inexplicable desire to constantly try 'sick outplayz!' and 'insaaane mechanics!', and then get yourself killed.\r\n\r\nWho are YOUR top 3 permaban champions, and why do you ban them? Leave your answers in the comments below.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex h8721","date":"2018-09-05T05:45:20.121+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:104}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:202}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2018-09-05T03:46:30.309+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:105}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-05T16:01:36.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:7}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:7}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RISE Shlack123","date":"2018-09-05T12:47:21.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:9}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:555}} \n\nFiddle and Brand are pretty obvious - obscene, obnoxious damage with very little risk.
