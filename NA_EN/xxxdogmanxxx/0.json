I want to get 60 FPS, but I don't want to lower my horizontal resolution to 1366. Now, I figure I can use NVIDIA control panel to slash around 25% off my vertical pixels and make a custom resolution of 1920 X 823.  I already know that League can autodetect and run at that resolution.\r\n\r\nMy question is, will I get banned for using third-party software? I'm deathly scared of getting banned. Please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-10T22:35:22.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Certain custom resolutions can provide a competitive viewing advantage, which is why those resolutions aren't offered in-game natively. In this case, using this specific resolution would be a *use at your own risk* situation. I strongly recommend suing 1366x768 or 1024x768 since they're standard widescreen resolutions available in-game. Additionally, you can work through our common solutions for FPS issues in [this guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2016-10-11T06:33:52.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for answering Targons Blade! I'll be sure to read the FPS guide you linked.\n\nI have a question though. What do you mean it will provide a competitive viewing advantage? If anything, I would have thought this would give me a slight disadvantage, seeing as I'll have 25% less pixels to work with, right?\n\nThis is also why I don't want to go down to 1366 X 768, because 1366 X 768 is only 50% of the pixels of 1920 X 1080. 25% less pixels, I can still tolerate, but 50% less is too much of a handicap.\n\nAlso, isn't 1920 X 823 in the 21:9 aspect ratio? I know league natively supports 21:9 monitors at 2560 X 1080 (my friend runs an ultrawide setup), so I really don't understand what's wrong with 1920 X 823.\n\nAgain thank you for your help Targons Blade, I really appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}]}
