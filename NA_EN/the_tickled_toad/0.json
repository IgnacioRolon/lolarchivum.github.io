I suggest going over the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide and following through each step to rule out any possibilities.  You can use the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) as well to perform a clean reinstall just in case any old game file is being missed during your update.  Let me know how that works for you.","replies":[]}]}
