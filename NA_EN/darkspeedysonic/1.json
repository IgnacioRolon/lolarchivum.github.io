I run it on a mac and my average fps is like 20 because its old but thats besides the point. Over the course of the last 2 weeks I've been depressed over this game because I'm only losing all my games. Ill get maybe on rare occasion, 1 win every 15 games. This made my self esteem as a player drop drastically and now i feel like I'm absolute garbage when at one point i used to be somewhat half decent. Ive gotten so toxic. Not towards anyone but myself. This game is ruining me. Im flamed all the time for being bad, I've played every role and i find jungle to be the funnest. I'm not good at any of them. I main support because i hide behind the support role because im bad. Ill try other characters and roles but it doesn't help. I play teemo, im bad, jax, bad. Everything, bad. My friends that i play with try to stick up for me but i put myself down because i know they pity me, try to carry me. But im too heavy. Im a burden on everyone. A worthless feeder. I don't know why but im starting to hate League of Legends only because i cant get anywhere. I don't feel rewarded at all for when i make a good play, or when i actually win a game. Even when i win i dont learn anything because the entire game for me is colourblind simulator. Im just so bad it hurts me. It hurts me to know my friends have to put up with dirt like me. I would add on but i dont want to make an essay on me being worthless. So? Should i quit?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-15T21:29:50.491+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The point of any game first and foremost should be to have fun, so that is ultimately the question you have to ask yourself.  Are you?  Self-degradation is just as harmful as being toxic to others, so a break might not be a bad idea.  Even if that means playing ARAM, normals, or stepping away completely.  \n\nAs much as winning every game sounds nice, I don't think it provides as much learning value as losing could.  Matchmaking is also made to make games as even as possible, so you may lose just as much as you win.  Yeah losing can suck, but so what?  Who told you that you have to feel bad for losing?  Not your friends, that's for sure.   Would it be fun to win every game without even trying, instead of a tight close match?  Why does it have to be a constant negative experience instead of a learning one?  I know it can feel bad, but how you handle that is really important.  Actually, a bit ago we released an [infograph on how rioters de-salt](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sZdrHNEP-long-infographic-i-asked-some-rioters-how-they-de-salt-after-a-bad-run-of-games?show=rundown).  Maybe it could offer some ways that can help prepare between matches.  \n\nIf you want to quit or take a break, that's fine!  There's no harm in taking a break and doing other things that you might enjoy, especially now during the pre-season.  I've personally taken this time to catch up on games, and looking forward to come back and practice before the new season.  I also want to point out my appreciation for your friends who have your back and stick up for you.  You have a good crowd of support, so if you do quit then your friends will be there for your return.  Keep in thought all the good things they say to you, and let that help hold you up when feeling down.  You're not heavy, you're well grounded.  <3\n\nP.S.  2 months!  It took me 2 seasons to even understand what a meta is!  You got this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GilKT","date":"2016-11-15T20:49:51.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quit? Yes you should quit if its causing you such emotional distress. Would I quit because of lack of skill? No, because you shouldn't play with people better than you. You should play against AI that'll test your abilities. Learn a champion, its mechanics and how you can use it to your advantage. Moral of the story, yes you should quit. Because you shouldn't let it get to you. I have been playing for five years. Probably spent of 500$, but since riot can never it's ranking system right. I have officially decided to put it aside.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSpeedySonic","date":"2016-11-15T21:00:37.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does cause a lot of distress but i do enjoy the game sometimes. I play a bot game fir the win of the day. Also playing a new champ for the first time seems fun... But then i hate it after i realize im bad. But i have fun. Sometimes. It really is the only game i like to play because overwatch isnt good to me anymore and league is more appealing. Ill see what others have to say still because runes and things like that are still things im delving into. Although i dont think ill get any anytime soon considering i can only get a hold of maybe 100-400 ip a day. Because i lose all my games. Thank you for the reply though, it means a lot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"yonggon","date":"2016-11-16T02:32:48.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally have emotional trauma from the toxic community so I don't play ranked or normals I mainly play aram or bots because people really don't care what you do as long are you contributing","replies":[]}]}
