Welcome to this week&rsquo;s Rune Corner. I&rsquo;m Riot Sparkle, Experience Designer on Runes Reforged and I&rsquo;m here to be your rune guide for today. This week we&rsquo;re gonna take a break from keystones (but we&rsquo;ll be back soon with more!) to round out a complete set of runes from our Domination path. \n\n\n**!!! WIP DISCLAIMER: **Please do remember that we&rsquo;re still working on these runes, so names, icons, numbers and DEFINITELY in game VFX will change before these ship. That being said, if there&rsquo;s anything you folks really like be sure to let us know! **!!!**\n\n\n\nAs you may remember from [Riot Stashu&rsquo;s post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hFIemE4p-runes-corner-hunt-of-the-blood-moon-sneak-peek?show=flat), Domination is a path focused on stalking prey and taking out targets quickly. The major rune slot in Domination focuses on that first part  - tracking down your enemies. \n\nWe&rsquo;ve already seen one rune from this slot in the past - Zombie Ward. First introduced by [RiotWrekz](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/coming-preseason-runes-reforged), Zombie Ward is about turning an enemy&rsquo;s safe zones against them.\n \n\n**Zombie Ward **\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/waDKZk7.png\n\nAfter killing an enemy ward, a friendly Zombie Ward is raised in its place. Zombie Wards are visible, last for 180 seconds and don&rsquo;t count towards your ward limit. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tI3zre1.gifv\n\n\nBut what if you want an option that doesn&rsquo;t require enemy actions to make use of? Or one that loves you? That&rsquo;s where our next choice, Watchful Poro, comes in.\n\n\n**Watchful Poro**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GD5n0T8.png\n\nWhen you enter brush, a poro appears. It will stay behind to give you vision until an enemy champion scares it away or you enter a new brush. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/s8dSP24.gifv\n\n_Sidenote_: You may notice this poro is definitely not a poro. This is what I mean with the temporary VFX - sometimes you need to use your imagination a little! We&rsquo;ll be getting this little guy a proper model and icon soon. \n\nWe&rsquo;ve seen Watchful Poro used for all kinds of interesting scenarios - personal protection against ganks, pointing out areas with wards for teammates or even deep warding early with some careful pathing. \n\nSo at this point you may be thinking to yourself, what if I want to stalk my prey WITHOUT having to manage extra thingies in my game? Well, there&rsquo;s an option for that too - Trophy Collector. \n\n\n\n**Trophy Collector**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uwGjaZg.png\n\nGain +1 Ability Power or +.7 Attack Damage (Adaptive) when you or a nearby ally kill an enemy champion or an enemy ward. \n\nTrophy Collector still touches on the core fantasy and gameplay of stalking prey, but instead of focusing on the set up it&rsquo;s more concerned with the payoff. This rune is more unreliable compared to its neighbors but can offer more direct power as well, similar to other aggressive gambits like the Bloodlust rune in Precision. \n\n_______\n\n\nSo that&rsquo;s all three runes in this slot! Remember, the way the new runes work means that you can only ever have one of these in your page at a time - they&rsquo;re mutually exclusive. \n\nReally excited to read your thoughts and reactions for these runes! We&rsquo;ll be hanging around in the comments section for a while to answer questions and, if we&rsquo;re very lucky, maybe even meme. \n\nYou can check the previous Runes Corner posts here:\nRunes Corner: [Runes Content Development Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/MZd3jemX-runes-corner-runes-content-development-peek)\nRunes Corner: [Meteor Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/nVHz5tjE-runes-corner-meteor-sneak-peek)\nRunes Corner: [Hunt of the Bloodmoon Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/hFIemE4p-runes-corner-hunt-of-the-blood-moon-sneak-peek)","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2017-07-26T20:20:39.771+0000","up_votes":87,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Braum uses the poro mastery it better have a mustache","replies":[]},{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2017-07-26T19:55:14.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"for the trophy collecter is it going to have a cap in stats?","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-07-26T20:01:51.199+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=meowwow7,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=9ls3OEo8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-07-26T19:55:14.978+0000)\n>\n> for the trophy collecter is it going to have a cap in stats?\n\nNo cap, only dreams.","replies":[{"poster":"Apex Support","date":"2017-07-26T20:47:42.027+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna make a deal with the enemy support to trade wards over and over {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-07-26T21:21:38.201+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vanquisher79,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=9ls3OEo8,comment-id=000100000003,timestamp=2017-07-26T20:47:42.027+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m gonna make a deal with the enemy support to trade wards over and over {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}\n\nWorth noting there are no infinite loops with Zombie Ward - after the first Zombie Ward, the ward will be put in the ground for good. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lemius","date":"2017-07-26T22:03:06.571+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do believe he was talking about the Trophy Collector Mr Sparkle Sir ^.~","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-07-26T22:11:38.223+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh, I see. \n\nI feel as though that would result in a \"curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal\" moment at some point lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Fedmahn","date":"2017-07-27T17:39:16.351+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha ha ha!

There's more to reveal in Domination around burst and snowballing, for sure, but I'd caution against thinking that this set is only \"support stuff\".\n\nWe consider Zombie Ward, Poro and Trophy Hunter to very much fall under the umbrella of Dominations \"hunting\" tools and have seen them used in a variety of positions.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-07-27T02:18:49.371+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"So -- good things first. The Poro and the Zombie Ward are awesome, and I'm already thinking of fun ways to use the Poro to counterjungle hilariously.

Sure, ever now and then you'll get up to something like +50, but it just doesn't feel as cool as the other runes.\n\nWas there any consideration to adding another mechanical hook to this to increase player satisfaction? Getting +1 AP or +0.7 AD is almost unnoticeable, which seems like it creates a boost in power that's all but invisible to the player in question over the course of a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Apex Support","date":"2017-07-27T02:28:10.150+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting your trinkets cooldown reduced by 1 second permanently our something like that would be quite nice ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fatefuldeath","date":"2017-07-26T21:38:38.050+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets say I have the Astronaut Poro Summoner Icon equipped while using the Watchful Poro rune, will the poro left behind by the rune be an Astronaut poro or a regular poro?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Partybringer","date":"2017-07-26T19:57:52.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So is {{item:3711}} going to be reworked? cause it seems like {{champion:64}} and {{champion:24}} are going to be the only ones that build it","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-07-26T21:20:17.255+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Partybringer,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=9ls3OEo8,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-07-26T19:57:52.665+0000)\n>\n> So is {{item:3711}} going to be reworked? cause it seems like {{champion:64}} and {{champion:24}} are going to be the only ones that build it\n\nthere are tons of people who build that item in higher levels where vision is important.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnderscorBunnies","date":"2017-07-26T20:43:15.988+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Partybringer,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=9ls3OEo8,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-07-26T19:57:52.665+0000)\n>\n> So is {{item:3711}} going to be reworked? cause it seems like {{champion:64}} and {{champion:24}} are going to be the only ones that build it\n\nHm?

Can you equip two major runes somehow? If so, then the distinction isn't needed (though AFAICT you can only equip one major rune). But really, if the only distinction is \"this is more noticeable than the other\", and because of that property you can only equip one instead of two, then I would either change the criteria after which you define a rune major or minor, or would drop the distinction altogether :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-07-26T23:08:00.661+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is good feedback and I _think_ it's the direction we're headed but we're still discussing a bit. _Someone_ (not gonna name names here :P) may have titled their Boards post badly in that regard. \n\nIf I'm being totally honest, we were worried that players would want really defined rules around which things would get in game VFX and which wouldn't (a shield, for instance, needs VFX to work for the opponent case but something like extra armor doesn't necessarily). \n\nBut we've found in testing that players actually care less about that (and can figure out the shield vs. armor example for themselves) and more about the distinction in power. If we call something a \"major\" rune, players expect it to be more powerful than a \"minor\". Thus, our naming has been slightly misleading in that regard. Also, sometimes SOME of the stuff needs VFX (Poro and Zombie) and other content...doesn't (Trophy) which adds to category confusion.\n\nWe'll probably talk more about this and answer more Qs in the future, but as of right now I actually expect that we'll drop the distinction going forward. \n\nWould love additional feedback from a player perspective on that to help us though - have you folks following along been confused around our category names and what they mean at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Night 25","date":"2017-07-27T00:48:17.579+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe something like \"Selective Runes\" and \"General Runes\" instead of \"Major\" and \"Minor\" would sound better, if you keep the system as it is now\nBy the way, i'm really looking forward to have a Rune system that supports different play styles, instead of something like searching \"Urgot runes and masteries\" on Google because there really is just one best option.

For instance, we revealed a slot in Resolve where you could get defenses in the form of armor, MR or wait a while and then get both. Depending on the matchup you're in that \"right\" answer might change some of the time.
