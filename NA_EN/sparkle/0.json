As far as I can judge, the short mode is there to allow quick picks in champselect, so supporting skimming should be a priority. Example:\n\"River - MS - adaptive\"\n\nOther request:\nCan you please add livetracking scalings into rune tooltips? When I'm quickly trying to check for numbers ingame, my eyes are automatically drawn to the bold base damage and colored scalings.\nWould also be nice to have the full damage composition layed out instead of just the end result. This stuff is nice to have, to quickly judge what my level/items are doing for me.\n\nThere might be players who like the summary style better, but why not both?\nIn fact, could you make it a toggle option like for timers (seconds vs minutes+seconds), to allow summary numbers; eventually colored in white/green/red/etc to still reflect what it scales with? Seems like this would be a nice secondary use of the C key; to shortly view a different version of the hovered spell tooltips.\n\nI personally don't see lost skill expression from being able to add up 2-3 numbers, when the damage calculation is already beyond normal human thinking ingame (aside from rough estimates)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shegi","date":"2017-11-07T22:20:03.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of new players, they might be new to mobas and not know the notion of movement speed","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-11-07T22:20:50.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But they know the notion of AD and AP?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ephriell","date":"2017-11-08T00:58:14.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember i played for about a year and a half till i learned what cc meant","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Draw Blank","date":"2017-11-09T01:46:20.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sparkle, why don't you guys make the locked rune pages locked to one tree each rather than to each specific rune within the tree?","replies":[]},{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2017-11-07T23:33:55.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is Phase Shift being left in such an undertuned state...
