Right now they are the same for each combination of paths, but that could change in the future. \n\n**Path Summaries** \n\nHere&#039;s a visual TL;DR for each Path and all the runes within it.

I know dark harvest scales better into late game, and Eve kinda powerfarms for the first 6 levels of the game so she doesn't use the early game power of electrocute as well as most, but she also kinda stalks around to position for ganks, so only having 20 seconds after a camp might not be enough early.  What have y'all found internally?\n\nAlso: DO SCUTTLERS COUNT FOR STACKING THIS???","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-11-06T23:32:19.071+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"~ I USED THE PHONE A FRIEND OPTION ~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2017-11-06T23:22:27.948+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo! I'm a designer on Runes Reforged, and also designed the Evelynn update :3 This is a tough question, and we've been pretty split between these runes. I think they are both good, and the better choice will be determined by other circumstances.\n\nEvelynn has great synergies with Electrocute since she can proc it really fast with her Q. This allows her to get the snowball rolling quickly, which helps rush her to her powerful mid game.\n\nOn the other hand, Evelynn also makes good use of Dark Harvest with her E. Lich Bane + Dark Harvest + Runic Echoes = insane damage in the late game. However, as you said, DH takes longer to get going, and isn't especially reliable in the early game. The 20 seconds is enough to convert a gank off a scuttle (yes, it does work on scuttle!) or a nearby small camp (raptors to mid lane, krugs to side lanes) if you hustle straight from the camp to the lane, but Evelynn is more of a opportunistic ganker so this can be challenging.\n\nOverall, I think Electrocute gives Evelynn more of what she needs when she needs it (burst damage early/mid game) and while Dark Harvest scales better, Electrocute scales decently enough on its own to be the better choice on average. That said, in games where you expect there to be a lot of kills, Dark Harvest is almost definitely the better pick, since it gives Evelynn a more powerful teamfight presence in the late game and allows her to turn getting a single kill (something she excels at) into multiple (something she is bad at).\n\nTDLR; They're both good, but I expect electrocute to be better in most situations, with Dark Harvest trumping it in games with a lot of kills.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aristeas","date":"2017-11-06T21:01:31.216+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!
