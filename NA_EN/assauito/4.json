Despite being better at the champion its actually harder to carry as them after a while.\nI&#039;m also noticing that my winrates for champions I play a lot is shaped like an upside-down U.  The winrate increases to a point, then gradually decreases.\n\nThis has been happening so much that it is obvious. Initially, I tried to ignore this but it is apparent. I get much easier games on less experienced champions, but at the same time, I may not know how to play that champion.\n\nThis is very strange.","replies":[]}
