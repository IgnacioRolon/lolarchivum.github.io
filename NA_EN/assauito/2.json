With no ad , attack speed, armor pen runes or items. all the champions I played it on can last hit a melee minion, cannon minion and caster minion thats just slightly under 1/8 hp.  (like in the pic above. I also try to land my last hits in between the auto attacks from my own minions. \r\n\r\nWaiting til its any lower than this often results in the creep being missed because of the time it takes for auto attack projectiles to actually travel. \r\nEven though i know WHEN to last hit, I still can&#039;t get above 160 cs at 20 minutes without  using abilities.   \r\n\r\nThe hard part is actually clicking on the minion in time. Each misclick causes me to lose cs.  If don&#039;t click it early enough I also lose cs.  There is only a split second window of time to land a last hit on a minion.\r\n\r\nIf I stand completely still and last hit, I can get around 150 cs by 20 minutes. If I click around my champion rapidly, move around a lot and keep re-positioning behind my minions, then I only get about 130 cs by 20 minutes. \r\nSo the more I click around, the more misclicks I make, and the more CS I lose. This happens even when I&#039;m using attackmoveclick. \r\n\r\nFor some reason I just can&#039;t click fast and accurate enough to keep my champion moving without losing a lot of cs. \r\nThe other problem I get is not being able to get close enough to the creeps before they die. My own creepwave severaly hinders my movement as I try to move though it. \r\n\r\n\r\nLast hitting and laning well is somewhat like playing Aimbooster. http://www.aimbooster.com/","replies":[]}
