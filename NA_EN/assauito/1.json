Liquid water is densest, essentially 1.00 g/cm&sup3;, at 4 &deg;C and becomes less dense as the water molecules begin to form the hexagonal crystals of ice as the freezing point is reached.\n\nIce has a lower density than water. This means the same amount of mass of ice takes up more space than the same mass of water. So if you melt the ice on top, then the water level in a cup or beaker should not raise.\n\nDoes global warming even raise sea levels?","replies":[]}
