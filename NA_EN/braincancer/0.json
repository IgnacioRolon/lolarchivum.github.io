Recently I have been experiencing fps drops around the 2:45 min mark everytime i play on summoner's rift (doesnt happen for arams) and it negatively impacts my performance. It usually happens when i start my second buff and then my fps suddenly goes from 60 to 30ish then some times around 20. I play on the lowest res and lowest quality to increase performance but it doesnt work. This is super annoying and i hope if riot or someone can see this and tell me whether i should change some settings or just I need a new pc.\r\nThx","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T20:47:33.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be caused by a failing game file or driver and resulting in some fps loss.
