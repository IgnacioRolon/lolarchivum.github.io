I got this confirmed on multiple occasions where the support team told me they cannot tell me if the subject was punished or not because of data protection and stuff. When I looked up the profiles of those players I noticed whenever they had some kind of money spend in the store i.e. and Icon or a skin I noticed ingame they wouldnt get banned even if they inted multiple games. I guess this is an open secret now but I dont think I will spend more money than usual on League anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcited to see how long this will remain on the forums until it gets deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-15T10:01:45.507+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just go through the PB&M board and you'll see many threads from players upset because they lost an account with hundreds or thousands in it.

Support won't tell you if someone was punished. The leap of logic that follows is the one that is crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-02-15T11:26:37.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same logic as how you don't get the name of the punished player when you got the \"Thanks for the report, the player is punished\" pop-up box.
