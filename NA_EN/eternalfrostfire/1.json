Recently, after the client update, my league stops responding every time I open it! As ussual, the client said, requires update and said it needed to restart with a countdown. I let it restart, and then when I tried to open it, it would not open properly. When I attempt to open it, windows tells me, there is a separate instance of LoL running and asks me to terminate it. I terminate the program, to prevent any interruptions it might cause. The logo shows and then, windows would tell me that the client had stopped responding and ask if I wanted to end the task or wait. I have tried waiting, but of course, that never works. \n\nThis is unlike any problem I have ever experienced before. When I first downloaded league, league never worked properly because it could not connect to a server. I used the hextech repair tool which fixed my problems. Now, I have tried the tool, but it still does not work  ;-;\n\nRiot, please help!\n\nIf anyone else has experienced this problem before and has found a way to solve it, and prevent it from happening in the future, please feel free to share it.\n\nEdit: I have checked the task manager, and there appears to be no separate instance of LoL running even though windows claims there to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-18T21:39:18.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is crashing, but some of those processes that are still running are getting in the way when you try to launch it again.
