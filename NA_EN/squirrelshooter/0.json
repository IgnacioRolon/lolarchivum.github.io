I assumed you got the hoodless version if you unlocked the first strike border, but apparently that's not the case. Can anyone clarify how to get the hoodless version? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T16:43:18.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like the image included in the bundle was meant to show that you'll see Ashe with and without a hood inside a match. I wasn't able to find any information related to splash art for this skin without a hood. As *Lew* mentioned, her skin mechanics in-game will result in you seeing her both with and without a hood while playing. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-08-15T03:41:51.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is only one Project Ashe skin but the hood toggles on and off during the game if you are near your own base/towers.","replies":[]}]}
