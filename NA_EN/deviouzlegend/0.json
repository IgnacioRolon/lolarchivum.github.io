It said something about to vote for a Pool Party skin. It seemed legit and I thought all I had to do was vote so I clicked the link and entered my League account info normally like I would to log into the boards. I'd been doing this on my phone on the League Friends app by the way. Then some page came up that said \"proxy\" something something, I can't remember it well but it was an orange page. My friend in game asked me if I was hacked because I sent her the same link my \"friend\" sent to me. I didn't, because after I opened the link on the League Friends app I locked my phone and proceeded to finish the Nexus Siege. After the game finished it turns out my launcher said \"Account Logged in Elsewhere.\" This link was also sent to 50% of my all people on my friends list. So at this point it was obvious to me that someone got a hold of my account through what I'd thought to be a legit link. I messaged one of my friends who was online at this time and told him that whoever sent him that link was not me and I asked him what should I do. He told me to reset my password immediately, so I did. Thankfully, after this it didn't seem like he had access to my account any longer.\n\nOne of my closer friends actually clicked the link and logged her information in like I did. So i told her to reset her password, and she actually happened to try to do it, THE NEXT DAY. But every time she tried to type in her user to reset her password, she'd get this response \"Invalid Request.\" She logged into league to find that somehow some of her RP and her skins were missing. Along with that, the next day, she discovered her once unlocked Ziggs had now been reset back to locked and this \"hacker\" played 2 games on her account, both on Coop vs. AI.\nOne with {{champion:134}} and another with her Mastery 5 {{champion:18}} \n\n\n* She's done a Support Ticket\n* She's tried to reset her password countless times (\"Invalid Request\")\n* She can't log in to the boards or the League of Legends site. \n\nThis hacker still has access to the account, she's tried everything and I've recommended everything I could think of.\n\nPlease help, out of options at this point.\n\nEDIT: It turns out he used all 3 of her refunds to refund her 2 skins and {{champion:115}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T20:46:39.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *Rineyy* stated, your friend will need to await contact from an account specialist on their ticket. Be sure to let your friend know that reply to or \"bumping\" their ticket will send it to the back of the queue, so let her know to just remain patient until our specialists can get back to her. \n\nIn the future, I definitely recommend avoiding any links to sites you aren't familiar with. Generally, if something requests you to log into your account and it isn't part of leagueoflegends.com, it's probably best to stay away from it. \n\nLet me know if you have any additional questions.","replies":[{"poster":"DeviouzLegend","date":"2016-07-28T21:48:05.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She just got an automated email detailing her ban etc, how long usually does it take for a response to a ticket?
