I guess he flamed kinda since the games honestly were kinda frustrating, even i said something once or twice, but nothing to get a ban for, since everyone was toxic, and he was flaming far less. Basically, when i woke up this morning and when i opened up League, i saw a message from him: &quot;This was my last breath. I will not be available for a couple of days. Then if I&#039;m going to play, we&#039;ll go further. &quot; This looks really odd because he never puts much effort in his messages, because why would he, I get that, but this last message looked really &quot;tidy&quot; i don&#039;t know. He also doesn&#039;t know English and grammar very well so that was another reason this message looked really weird. \r\n\r\nMaybe its just me overreacting but I really care about him and i wanna know if there&#039;s such a thing. A message you automatically get when your friend gets a ban and you try to talk to him.\r\n\r\ntl;dr My friend was a little toxic and later, I got a weird message from him and i want to know if there&#039;s an automatic response if your friend gets banned.\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-12-25T09:14:13.947+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no notification when people on your friend list gets punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-12-25T22:46:29.470+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds more like a case of depression or a suicide attempt.

If you have him on skype or discord or anything you should try messaging him and asking if everything is alright.\n\nThat being said, you don't get notified if a friend gets punished, and if you did it definitely wouldn't be that.","replies":[]}]}
