I have tried reinstalling it thrice, I have tried adding -no-sandbox to the shortcut, deleting files in the projects and releases folder, opening in with administrative properties. What would happen is I would reinstall, it would be fine and then I would restart my computer and this problem will arise again. I don't want to keep reinstalling league of legends just to play it.","replies":[{"poster":"Nicol Bolas","date":"2017-01-11T00:16:37.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not my connection because my roommate uses the same wifi access point as me and is still able to run league. I allowed League through my firewall and turned off UAC controls.
