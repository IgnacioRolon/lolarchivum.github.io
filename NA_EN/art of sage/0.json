Its shown in the above link that there's a space after my name and the colon is 1 space away from my name, it looks weird.  Another thing is, is that when others are in game they cannot communicate with me because the chat won't let them add a space after my name to pm me in private message with \"/r\" so they would have to wait till out of the game to pm me.  I don't have any money or effort to save up IP or RP again atm.  I also do not have any refunds left.  **So I'm asking if there is a way I can get this fixed please.  **","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-08-06T02:41:18.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need to use a name change to remove spacing or change the capitalization of your Summoner Name! All you need to do to get this fixed up is to contact Riot Games Player Support in a ticket, and they'll take care of the rest. \n> # CAN I CHANGE THE SPACING OR CAPITALIZATION OF MY SUMMONER NAME FOR FREE?\nYes! As a one time exception, you can change the spacing and capitalization of your Summoner name without having to purchase a Summoner name change. For example, you can change your name from \"nancymon\" to \"nancy mon\" or \"Nancymon\" at no cost.\n\n>In order to do this, send us a ticket with the following subject line:\n\n>**SUBJECT: Summoner Name Change**\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752814-Summoner-Name-FAQ#h1q5\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Art of Sage","date":"2016-08-06T03:47:37.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much.
