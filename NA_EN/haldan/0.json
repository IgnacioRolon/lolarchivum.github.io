The extremely aggravating part is that i am on a hot-spot playing off my phone because we do not have Internet routed to our house, which means if i actually wanted to re-update it from where it says it is, it is going to burn through basically all my data. I don't understand why this happened, as i was playing just an hour earlier with it all up to date and working fine. I don't think my computer could have crashed in any way, as i have shut it down normally and done everything like normal, and out of the blue this happens. Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T21:26:33.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time when that happens, it's because the client noticed that some of the files were damaged or corrupted for some reason. It's basically reverting to the safest build it can find so that it can try to repatch without any errors. \n\nIt really sucks that you have to use your phone's data plan, but you will need to repatch before you're able to play again. I'd really suggest trying to find access to a more proper network since even playing matches you will still be eating up that data plan.","replies":[]}]}
