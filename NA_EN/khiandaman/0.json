First of all, I recommend verifying that you got a Skin Permanent or a Skin Shard. If the latter, you'll need to use Orange Essence to Upgrade it to a Skin Permanent. Second, you'll need to own Poppy before you can redeem the Lollipoppy skin.\n\nIf you're still having issues redeeming it or having issues using the skin after redeeming it, please contact my colleagues so they can help you further:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
