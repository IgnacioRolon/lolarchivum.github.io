Progressed to occasional DC's (once every few games) which escalated to atleast 2 DC's every game which in turn advanced to my game crashing atleast once every 10 minutes and then the occasional DC every 3 - 7 minutes. \r\n\r\nObviously the game is nigh unplayable. I've repaired the game, troubleshot other games/apps - everything works perfectly. \r\n\r\nInternet is 100% during these games (as I am on Teamspeak with mates 99% of the time). PUBG, Rust, Unturned, Overwatch, CSGO, everything works 100% so does Discord, Teamspeak and Nvidia. No Internet disturbances whatsoever, so I am 100% certain this is a League specific problem. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say I am out of options and beyond frustrated with the lack of customer care for a 5 year + fan of Riot. I've spent more money on LoL than any other game and I am at my the end of my patience. \r\n\r\nTim.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T01:52:44.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you know 100% that you're having some packet loss, that would definitely explain all the weird stuff like champs floating around and not reacting correctly to your commands. Packet loss is essentially when some of the data being sent from your network to our servers is lost for whatever reason, meaning our you client can't really display everything correctly. \n\nI'd suggest using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to be sure of the packet loss suspicion. Take your most recent game log that had these issues, pop it into that log reader, and then let us know what it says about your packet loss!","replies":[]}]}
