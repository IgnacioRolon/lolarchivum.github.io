No one else was really having problems (Xin said his pings weren't giving the correct message, but that's not what I was getting).\r\n\r\nLaning phase against Kennen went fine.  I even went up to gank top a couple times and there was no problems.  However, when we all went for dragon at one point, tried to right click a pink ward but it wasnt going.  20 seconds later of trying to fruitlessly auto this thing, it all of a sudden jumps forward and its taken 3 of the 4 hits and the enemies were coming.  I couldn't do anything during the team fight at that point cause any time I tried to Q, or ult, the animation never showed, everything was happening at a small delay (more than 72 ms, I can tell you that much), and they took dragon.  \r\n\r\nThe same thing was happening throughout the match, such as trying to ping a lane several times, and getting nothing til they all happen in one big burst. I couldn't do anything to help my team cause my game was \"lagging\" more than it was running normal (which would happen on the rare occassion, usually when I was split-pushing away from any of the enemy team).  I tried several things to see if it would fix, and the most effective thing I found was closing the client altogether (not just disconnecting from the game, or disconnecting from the internet, closing the whole client down), and then logging back in, but the \"lag\" would come back shortly after.\r\n\r\nWhats weird is that I'm plugged directly into the ethernet port on my wall, and I've never had this issue so far.  Not even in the two games I played before it.  On top of that, the ping in the top right Almost always showed 72 MS.  very rarely would it fluctuate, and even then, it only go up to 73 or 74.  It was staying at a solid 72 MS throughout the entire game, and we lost cause of it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this was cheating software or what, since absolutely no one else was complaining about glitches.  Gnar was apparently lagging but his ping was actually going up to 4000 or whatever.  My internet is perfectly fine, even after the match, so what's the issue here?  Was there cheating software involved?  It didn't even seem to be lagging due to low ping or low framerate, cause I've had problems with low ping in the past and it didn't act like this, nor did limiting myself to 60 FPS fix the issue either (my framerate was staying pretty steady through the game too, but I didn't try watching it as much)\r\n\r\nI put the link to the match in question.  I died twice cause of the lag (once cause I tried to fight, and once cause enemies popped out of nowhere.  The rest of the time, I tried to split push but I couldn't really do much else, and my team was losing teamfights without me","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T18:13:50.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your description, it sounds like you were experiencing bursts of packet loss.
