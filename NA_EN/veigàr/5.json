For a champ that can one-shot targets, stun multiple targets while giving him a great damage shield, dash away to escape or engage, and slow targets while damaging them in the process twice, his ult is overkill. It allows him to play like zed. One shot the carry, and get out unharmed. Yes, fizz can do the same, but fizz cannot get his health and mana back.Akali too, but she needs a nerf just as bad as ekko. His ult has a short cooldown considering the utility, damage, and flat out game-changing potential. He has no counter play once he gets his ult, his kit gives him THE most outplay potential. Either rework his ult or nerf his kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warwick the OP","date":"2017-05-01T05:43:24.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ekko is insanely broken tbh. his ult and his passive damage need nerfs. and his ult in general is retarded as fuck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revali","date":"2017-05-01T05:36:10.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get the impression you're not giving us the full story\n\nwhat were his items?\n\nmr really screws him over since his base damage early on is, to be quite frank. really low outside of passive early on. \n\nif you had 70 mr by that point in the game then he probably had sheen which makes his e deal a good mix of _**physical**_ and magic damage \n\n\nif ekko has something say... {{item:3057}} {{item:3020}} then you have 55 mr, now lets take into fact he probably ran pen runes, (so what's what, Eleven?)  now you have 44. extra mr with 250 extra hp.\n\nso with that bit of extra mr he could do about half if not more hp with two parts of his q + e for passive thunderlords sheen bonus, which you deserve to be hit by if you let him get both stacks of his passive from q on you.\n\nif you want a trick to help with him as veigar ekko when he blinks will _always appear infront of you_ try aiming aiming your cage with this bit of knowledge. Treat him as a ranged champion. Yes, he's melee, but his e is exceptionally powerful to get into the face of people trying to get frisky and get into aa range to farm safely, putting them in harms way of being combo'd. when he uses his q to push, FIGHT HIM. He just used a huge chunk of his damage on the minion wave to push it to roam, fight him as he only has aa's and his e to fight you, get a quick trade in this time as early on before he buys cdr it has a decent enough cd to warrant a quick trade. \n\nJust my two cents from an Ekko main.","replies":[]}]}
