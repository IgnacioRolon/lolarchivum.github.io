You can start from starting MMR and still end up Bronze V. You need to work on your logic. You don't know as much as you want to believe you do.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-05-25T01:45:46.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What point?\n MMR is directly tied to wins or losses. Que dodge, Ranked Decay, punishments, 0 affect on mmr.\n In my fist post I'm point out that some one in a MMR bracket with a **sustained **terrible win % will enough losses to drop their personal MMR out of that bracket, even if you never get any better they still will drop to a point you wont ever see them again. Its not to say that a overall win% on  account determines the MMR for any one account as there only so much value to gain per match. a 100% win rate with 1 game has only earned a single win worth of MMR.  When im talking about win rates over time the assumption is this is for a player who is still actively playing games because its impossible for an account to change their MMR when they don't play and obviously a inactive account is never a factor in anyone's games.\n\n\nSome people place b5... Yea? some players go 0-10 and place silver or gold. some go 6-4 and place b5. You should be aware that they only do a soft reset, previous season and preseason influence your start point, its just new accounts that have the same start, its commonly accepted that's in silver mmr. You can look at a player after placements, know a rough trend of if their MMR went up or down from their 10 games, then have an estimate about what their starting point was. if they 0-10, their start was higher then the division they placed into. You have to treat it on a case to case. When I say you start higher then b3, I mean that exclusively for the very first games of ranked you play on a unranked account. Each season after starting mmr for that season is person to person, but the first time you adventure into ranked your starting above bronze.\n\n\nBefore any one goes, \"well MMR should be the same gains for every match\"  No... that's not how elo works. A favored player gains less and loses more.\n\n\nHOW DID ANNIE PLACE X.  well she had enough MMR in her pool that their terrible loss streak she did not get placed in bronze 5. Its not like she's Gaining MMR for her losses.\nI don't know why you cant look at the end result to figure out what happened. This player has lost X games, Losing games = losing mmr. The players MMR is hidden, Their division and LP don't  reflect what the current MMR of a player is. If a Player loses 26 games and has only fallen to bronze 3, it does not mean their MMR is bronze 3, its likely lower because MMR changes more rapidly then LP. It clearly means that the player did not place in bronze 5 after promo games. This is not to say that player does not belong in bronze 5 mmr.   You don't seem to have a realistic expectation of how many games team biased elo systems need to function properly for players not in the majority MMR.  \n\n\nWhy is this such a struggle for you lark?\n\n\n @others help explain this  better as I don't seem to be communicating in away that is helpful.
