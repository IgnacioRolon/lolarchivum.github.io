If the above challenges didn&#039;t hurt immobile mages enough, the average game length decreasing from 40 minutes to 30 has sealed the deal.\r\n\r\nVeigar - Buff his passive ... currently when Veigar kills a minion with his Q, or uses any spell on an enemy champion, he gets 1 AP stack.\r\n\r\nBuff: Grant Veigar 2 stacks when he hits an enemy champion with his spells. (Buffed)  Grant Veigar 1 stack when he kills a minion with his Q. (Not Buffed)\r\n\r\nCurrently, Veigar has to make a decision, Interact with the enemy laner and lose out on 1 potential stack and 1 potential gold CS - or ignore the enemy laner and gain 2 potential stacks (+1) and 2 potential CS (+2)  \r\n\r\nThe current Gold/AP ratio is about 21.25 - So the hard math of Veigar&#039;s gameplay is as follows.\r\n\r\nChoice #1: Ignore enemy laner - 2 CS + 2 Stacks = 21 + 21 + 21.25 + 21.25 ( 84.5 )\r\n\r\nChoice #2: Trade and kill 1 CS with Q - 21 + 22.5 + 22.5 ( 63.5 ) - This is the best outcome, but lining up to kill a minion and last a Q on the enemy often leads to unfavorable trades where you take way more damage than you put out.\r\n\r\nThe following choice is by far the most optimal trade, as it often is a quick skill shot on the move. \r\n\r\nChoice #3: Trade - 21.25 ( and slightly damage the enemy champion, which more than likely has gunblade and will heal it back before your spells come off cooldown )\r\n\r\nThese outcomes leave the best option for Veigar to be Choice #1.  ( at least in the early game pre lvl 6 )\r\n\r\nChanging the AP gained from hitting an enemy champion with your spells would encourage players to trade and interact with the enemy laner early, which makes the veigar experience more fun for both Veigar players and enemies who are laning against Veigar.","replies":[{"poster":"ankoanko19","date":"2018-10-20T19:52:13.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" Veigar has lost his way competing against mobile champions \"\n\nVeigar has a 60% wr against Akali. A 55% wr against Yas and a 54% wr against Irelia a 61% wr against Azir and a 57% wr wr against Galio but alrighty. Ironically enough Veig struggles the most against early game pokers{{champion:74}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:136}} \n\nVeigars current problem is that he doesnt have a reliable keystone. He doesnt need more dmg or slows, he needs survivability. Phage rush is so awful because it doesnt work on burst so you cant R and run away like with stormrazor. Maybe next season something that fits Veigar will be introduced.","replies":[]}]}
