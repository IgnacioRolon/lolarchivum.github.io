And Veigars damage output seems so weak lately.\r\n\r\nAs an example, in my last game, there was a Darius top who got semi-fed.   He built the following:\r\nSpirit Visage ( 55 MR ) / Merc Treads ( 25MR ) / Frozen Mallet / Titanic Hydra / Black Cleaver / Death&#039;s Dance.\r\nEnemy Team Comp: Shyvanna / Darius / Lux / Talon / Malphite  ( No Healers / 1 Shielder )\r\n\r\nI was Veigar with 1400AP.  I had Void Staff in my build ( 40% Magic Penetration )\r\n\r\nI literally did no damage to him.  Would land him stunned in my Gate - Drop a W on him and a Q .... and he would drop like 10% life.  \r\n\r\nMy abilities were doing (**Supposedly**):\r\nQ = 1,154\r\nW = 1,840\r\nR = 325+(1,162) to 625+(2,310)\r\n\r\nIt seems that burst mages do barely any damage .... yet melee assassins were given massive true damage.  How is this balanced?","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-09-26T02:42:35.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its because he has the same kit he had 25 years ago.

Sure he might survived, but I guarantee Darius took at least 30-50% damage. As a dar main myself who had built lots of Mr against being before, I can testify that veigar can easily deal 40-50% my house even with just 1000-1200 AP in a regular rotation.","replies":[{"poster":"Veigàr","date":"2018-09-28T01:04:10.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just about to go download the video off my match history to make a few second video for you ... but it says the video expired even though it has only been 2 days ....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2018-09-26T03:25:52.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I need to see this.
