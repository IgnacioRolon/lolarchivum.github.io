If you can get new players without spending BE you would prefer to do that - which is what Riot has done for many, many years. If Riot has to give BE to get new players it means that they're not getting enough new players. (Side note: BE for events is a little different, since they're doing that to keep players satisfied and coming back. A player that enjoys the game and comes back may spend money, a player who isn't satisfied and doesn't come back doesn't spend money.)\n\nNow, you could argue that they increased their expectations on what's \"enough new players\", but that's unlikely considering the age of the game. You expect to not gain as many new players when your game is nearly 10 years old. That leaves the other interpretation, which is that they have noticed a dip in new players/new player retention, below what they predicted, and are looking to correct it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-07-15T00:13:18.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, yes and no.  \n\nMMOs are generally most fun when you are playing with friends so I'm guessing riot is trying to get everyone to be friends with people so they play more and enjoy the game more.  _Now there certainly could be other ulterior motives_, but this might also be a harmless incentive.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-07-15T00:47:48.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not wrong, but most games don't need to tell you \"go out and get a friend to play in the next 2 weeks.\" *League of Legends* didn't need to tell people to do that.

League, especially in the current state, is not that kind of game. Their attempts are misguided, when all they really need is to make the game fun again-- at least for the kind of players who are vocal to their friends.
