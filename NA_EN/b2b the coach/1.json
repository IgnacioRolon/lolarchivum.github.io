For that reason i&#039;m creating here a topic about the new black cleaver. \r\n\r\nI Really love it! but the build path sounds really weird. As a lot of people said in the topic on the bpe board, {{item:3044}} + {{item:3134}}  ar a lot better then {{item:3044}} +{{item:3067}} . With this path it will be better maybe 300 or 350HP and 45AD bonus. \r\nEveryone will be happy, phage and brutalizer will have both 2 possible paths, tank and bruiser will still have kill potential thanks to brutalizer.\r\nI also think that evolve the flat 10arm Pen to 30% armor pen it&#039;s ok. you&#039;ll still have more then 10arm pen, so i don&#039;t see any problem.\r\nplease riot. listen the community and make {{item:3071}} build path {{item:3044}} + {{item:3134}} instead of  {{item:3044}} +{{item:3067}}","replies":[{"poster":"B3ER","date":"2015-04-08T11:24:39.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they wanna take Big Black Cleaver away from squishies and make it Bruiser/Tank centric. So yeah, this would be the way to go. Look at it on the bright side, it's a Zed nerf too.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-04-08T15:47:56.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, zed can still build it. It will make him slipperier, less squishy, give him cdr, still shred your armor for his ult, i'm not sure it's a Zed nerf. Maybe i'm wrong but i'm not sure why.
