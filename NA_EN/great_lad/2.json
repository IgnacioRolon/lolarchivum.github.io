Illaoi gets pretty free wins vs him most of the time if you want a counterpick.\nHis w is the only overtuned part tho.\nHonestly every sett player I've seen ends up with near even but high kills and deaths so like 11/11 bc he is pure garbage vs ranged honestly so his post lane is pretty bad unless he gets the ideal 2k true dmg w proc in a teamfight where people think they can just kill him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2020-01-24T16:33:35.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think Sett is for the most part fine, the biggest issue is that his W is an extreme anti-meta ability that outright counters the unga bunga burst damage meta that is the whole game currently.\n\nHe doesnt have a good match-up in lane against popular picks (Darius, Morde, Fiora, Aatrox, etc all have great laning vs him) and he gets hardcountered by any adc with mobility. The thing is, the moment he can ditch laning to teamfight and is 2 items in, he outright punishes the fast bursty teamfights that are meta currently by taking all that damage and hard nuking people back with it.\n\nIf the game had proper places for poke or disengage teams like before, Sett couldnt be anywhere near as strong as he is currently. He is just a reflection of how damagecrept is the currently and how a single CC (even soft CC) can end up in a team getting aced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CRIMSONFKR","date":"2020-01-24T15:44:05.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I still don't see him even that strong his strengths is his safe laning and w but after all of that he really lack a strong engage even with his q it not enough to catch up with anyone.\n\nI'm betting alot people still have no idea how to fight him and just standing dead middle infront him everytime they fight him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2020-01-24T15:32:18.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Looking things over, his win rate shot way up with the release of the new patch with no particular reason.
