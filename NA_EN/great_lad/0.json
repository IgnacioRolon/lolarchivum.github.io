If someone comes into my game knowingly he has a negative win rate, that's...dude, no words.\n\nYou just told a guy who was explaining the way riot sees games to \"Stop Replying\" cause you already think your point is more valid than anyone else's Maybe you did deserve the ban for chatting dude. From what i see in the picture you posted he did not play any troll pick champions. Sure you should not play RANKED GAMES if you have winrates like that but it truly is not troll and this shows even me that you are just toxic to people cause in your eyes you are \"Better Then Others\". Also if this is a common problem for you then you can fix not having these players on your team by looking at their winrates BEFORE the game starts and dodging so you can live one game without calling someone a dog or monkey or whatever toxic thing you keep typing in chat. In the end it was your fault and only your fault cause you could have prevented the game AND you could have prevented the ban. Not to mention that reports on one person does go through but wont effect someone unless like 3 to 4 reports add up to you needing a punishment so this was not the only time you did this AND seeing as though you made threads about this before you clearly have not learned to just not type and take breaks or even LOOK AT THE DAMN WINRATES BEFORE GAMES. But whatever you are just gonna try to prove to yourself that you did not deserve the ban or punishment you got for typing by simply saying \"He did troll my games and i did not deserve the ban\" or \"I will admit i deserved the ban but he deserves one for playing poorly\" when that is just not the case","replies":[]}]}
