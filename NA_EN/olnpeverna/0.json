Just be patient before raging hardcore.\n\nI mean do they address Item Quantity, not really, Riots has made it fairly clear they are doubling down on the idea of uneven items to make it less 'stale' itemization (Translation: If we equalize items drops people might start really realizing that our Item system is about as shallow as a small puddle and that there is like 4 strong items you build EVERY match and it takes too much effort to address weaker items, so we will just obscure the issue behind RNG.). In fact in general 'we have RNG' seems to be the only thing that is making Teamfight not a complete rip off of better autochess games and it seems like half the stuff people request are changed are not done because if they do tweak stuff then they start being less unique, of course not realizing the reason stuff like Uneven RNG and what not is not present in other Autochess games is because NO ONE LIKES IT and its bad design.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oLnPeVerna","date":"2019-09-03T19:38:54.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porglit,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=Gb3sHbck,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-03T19:31:15.106+0000)\n>\n> There are already item drop changes coming, which are live on PBE.
