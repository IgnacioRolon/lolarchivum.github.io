I just realized, and its crazy that I am noticing this now but Evelynn has a delightful demonic laugh after the charm expires ( untouched ) that sounds like this, \r\n\r\nhttp://lolsound.zeusafk.net/sound/Evelynn_New/en_GB/File0318\r\nhttp://lolsound.zeusafk.net/sound/Evelynn_New/en_GB/File0315\r\n\r\nand I was curious but why is the caster ( The one playing Evelynn ) not able to hear this? It sounds so malicious and sweet at the same time and it would be satisfying to hear this while they run away scared for their lives. Is there a way we can have this implemented so that both the caster and the target hear this sound? Please and thank you? ; ~; ♡\r\n\r\nIf we do get this change, which would be amazing! Can we also add this laugh ( which is just her regular ).\r\n\r\nhttp://lolsound.zeusafk.net/sound/Evelynn_New/en_GB/File0316\r\n\r\nIt has to have the echo or its not as good..so...can we somehow get this pretty pretty please!? ♡♡♡\r\n\r\n_\"This craving will soon be sated.\"_ {{champion:28}}","replies":[]}
