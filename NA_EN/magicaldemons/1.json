I usually get around 2-3 honours each game, varying between each game of course but generally I maintain a stable income of honours each day.  Yet I am still an honour 3 which is very confusing to me.  Can someone explain why this is?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T04:31:19.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone's going to rank up their honor at a different rate simply due to playing games at different paces and playing a different amount of games.

Will this progress into the next season?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T05:49:22.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Little clarification, I wasn't talking about your past chat restriction but behavior that *wasn't* actively punished. Some games showed certain borderline behavior that wasn't bad enough to give you a chat restriction or any type of suspension or ban. Instead, it looks like your honor progress was slowed due to borderline punishable behavior. Instead of getting some type of punishment, your honor progress was slowed a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicalDemons","date":"2017-11-20T19:46:29.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=09iZyXaf,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-20T05:49:22.442+0000)\n>\n> Little clarification, I wasn&#x27;t talking about your past chat restriction but behavior that *wasn&#x27;t* actively punished.

Can I contact player support asking for chat logs?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T21:03:23.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely! We don't like to delve too depth into chat logs and such here on the boards since it kinda puts a spotlight on ya, but the player behavior team is always open to talking about those things with you in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
