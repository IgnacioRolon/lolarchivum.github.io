I wanted to see if anyone has some advice. \r\n\r\nI've been given the run around for 2+ weeks by Riot attempting to get my photos from the RiftWalk NYC. I've been playing for 4+ years, been to two live events, and waited in line to go to the RiftWalk. My band scanned at every photo-op (saw my name pop up and everything), and only 1 photo managed to find it's way to the emailed link. I've been trying to get this sorted out with a riot staffer who assured me 'this has never happened before' and says they passed along my info (but are refused to demonstrate any proof of that, such as cc'ing me on the email). I still have nothing to show for it accept frustration and zero assistance from the riot staff member assigned to my ticket. \r\n\r\nHas anyone had this problem or have advice on how to fix it? All I want are my photos. The riot employee wasn't helpful at all and refuses to work with me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T23:39:14.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can tell you're very passionate about both League and the experience you had at the Riftwalk by this post. Since you've already submitted a new ticket about this issue, I suggest waiting for a specialist to be assigned to it and address any further concerns about this in that ticket. \n\nIt certainly sucks that this situation happened and that you're missing some photos. As the first agent mentioned in your ticket, we had specific partners we worked with that we had to get in contact with, and since there were unexpected issues, it can take some time to get the information  we need. Please understand that CCing you in internal communications is something we cannot do, but we'll be happy to address this issue further in your new ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"ashalveh","date":"2016-11-15T00:36:00.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it appears that my person assigned to me got frustrated that i was asking for updates and decided to \"close my ticket\"- does this mean she's no longer going to contact me if this ever gets resolved? and what should be my next steps? i don't want to have to restart this process (already 2+ weeks, but if this staffer no longer wants to help...) i was getting lost in a shuffle without a way to check on status updates, and she was unwilling to follow up with any of the partners she may have contacted.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T22:43:57.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your new ticket references your old ticket, so the agent that gets assigned to your new ticket will understand the context and be able to address any further questions you have about the status.
