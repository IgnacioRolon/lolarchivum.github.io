(more AS?)\n\nHis W could be a toggle to choose between rage generation with autos and rage consumption. His Q could increase his rage on cast, while E decreases it (as he puts all his fury behind the swing).\nHis ult could possibly instantly put him at full rage and grant the CC immunity. After the ult, your rage will either be reset to zero (if W is in rage-suppressing mode) or stay at full (if in rage-generating mode).\n\nHis playstyle would be about carefully balancing his rage, as he could not avoid either building or bleeding rage, and managing the associated boni. Ideally, the boni would be made in such a way that, at 50%, he gets like 1/3 or the maximum possible stat.\n\nMaybe it would also be interesting to deny him the ability to instantly switch from full rage to low rage or vice versa?","replies":[{"poster":"Ayame Isaki","date":"2014-11-29T16:49:40.080+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never played Olaf, but if he worked like this I would absolutely pick him up.

The second part... The energy from the Lightning would hit olaf'so chest. Even if it didn't, the wooden handles would be destroyed. So, they are magically enhanced.\n\nThird, yes, Olaf was magically strengthened. Even for a Viking, which is just a buff guy, he couldn't not survive being chomped on by a chogath.

Have you seen pitchers of trees that were hit by lightning? When lightning hits something, most of the time, it will cause a small explosion. And, Vikings are just normal people, who are generally a bit larger and hairier.\n\n\nAlso, Olaf would not pray to Thor since Scandanavia, where the Norse religion was practiced, does not exist in Valoran.

I believe that if the missile speed was increased that could fix his problem. I want to be able to really choose my summoner spells depending on the matchup instead of 100% of the time grabbing ghost. He is one of the few champions that absolutely NEEDS a very specific spell.\n\nHe also has a lost sense of identity. Is he a tank? Is he a damage dealer? Regardless of what you take, there are still plenty of champions that do that job better. \n\nThe mobility creep that has recently happened in league has completely destroyed Olaf.

The main problem with olaf as i see it is that his whole kit has to be balanced around his ultimate giving him immunity to cc.\nThe effect of that is that he can not have a speed up or a dash or anything like that as then he becomes overbearing to low mobility adcs.
