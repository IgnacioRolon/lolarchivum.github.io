And some of those friends also invited their friends like me. Totally we got 20members including me.\r\nAll of them are around 25-35 years old. Everyone is a office worker execpt 1member.\r\nAll of us started this game at season4.\r\n9 of 20 members reached Level30. 7 of them finished placement match in ranked. The result is goldx1(me),silverx3,bronzex3.\r\nRecently , most of them are playing less than 1hour a day since season4 is finished.\r\nI made a document for the detail of those members below.\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1TY3nKcLwET8Jm9z9vqumuMtfMmnTW_Z6EoVJVqSlEQY&amp;authuser=0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-What kind of Japanese player will like to LOL ?\r\nI think any type of Japanese gamers will like LOL since LOL has coop mode.The most of Japanese prefer coop-game to pvp-game. They will like coop mode in LOL.\r\nBut when they become stronger than intermediate bots , they can’t enjoy AI game anymore. So some of them who really loves coop will leave LOL. And its not easy to move to pvp from coop for Japanese. Because everyone who loves coop will feel high pressure when they try pvp, especially ranked pvp. They might be afraid of losing or being blamed.\r\n\r\n-What is weak point for LOL to start business in Japan?\r\nLOL doesnt look enjoyable when we see trailer or gameplay since its rule is a bit complecated. It looks really moddest(or sobor?plain?) compared to Recent 3D video game. It can not be solved by summoner’s rift visual refresh since it is caused not only due to 3D visual but also due to game system.\r\nAnd the most players can’t understand the rule even after playing tutorials. The fun of LOL is well understood only if player can play it many times. That tutorial is a kind of boring game , I alywas say it to my friends  “Dont play tutorials , its a kind of **** , just go to coop game ASAP”.\r\n\r\n-What advertisement/marketing must be done when LOL starts service in Japan\r\n(1)advertise as Coop game\r\nIn Japanese culture , Coop game is preffered to Versus game. This can be easily understood by seeing the fact that MonsterHunter(CoopGame) is very popular in Japan. There is no verus mode in MonsterHunter, Only AI can be enemy. But Japanese really like it. Because Japanese tends to avoid arguing , if they fight against AI , all of players will become winner at the same time(or loser at the same time). So its always win-win or lose-lose. If there is more difficult game than intermediate , duration between starting and leaving LOL will be longer for Japanese. (But Nightmare bot will not allowed).\r\nJapanese player will join LOL If they notice that LOL is a coop game which 5players can play at the same time. Japanese are always looking for a good coop-game , and LOL deserve it.\r\nActually players who I invited were also playing LOL till late at night from when they finish their work. But when they became near lv30  , they felt AI was weak and no interest at coop , some of them left LOL.  Since Many Japanese tends to dislike versus game , Coop should be advertised more than versus. And After playing coop , versus should be suggested to them. But many of them will not challenge versus-game.\r\n\r\n(2)MMORPG players should be incited\r\nMost Japanese loves MMORPG , esipecially outlook view like Ragnarok Online is preffered more than 1st persion view like FPS. Thus LOL will easily be acceptted by Japanese players since its view is silmilar to MMORPG. Players with 3D sickness can play LOL. and Women who dont like intense 3D view switch can also play it.\r\nA homework is how LOL can attract players who love MMORPG.\r\nSo their pride must be incited.\r\nThey are MMORPG lover , and at the same time they are regard themselves as MMORPG expert.\r\nLOL should say below to them\r\n“LOL has the same control system as MMORPG.  You can identify if you are really good at MMORPG or not by playing LOL. if you can reach gold ranked or above at 1st season , you are really good at MMORPG. But if you are at silver , you are just an average. And if you are bronze , you are not skillful , just your character is strong in your favorite MMORPG.”  \r\nIt doesn’t matter if its true or not. The point is inciting their pride or not.\r\nThen some of them will play LOL to protect their pride. And it will also make them be interested in pvp.\r\nBut this message is really risky since some of them will think its rude.\r\nSo To reduce this risk , making cartoon is really effective. (It will described later)\r\n\r\n \r\n(3)LOL can play free , money can’t buy win ratio\r\nMany Japanese is tired of seeing billing system of Japanese free-to-pay game. Because the most player strongly think that money can buy win-ratio.\r\nSo if LOL advertise their sytems as “win ratio depends on your skill , not on your money” , Japanese players will be surprised.\r\nIf you have a chance , you can say “we dont have any mind to get money” or “LOL is running by volunteer”. \r\nThe point is how you can suprise them.\r\n\r\n(4)Depends on your sense , not on your play length\r\nWhen we play network-game , the most office-worker players feel so sorry that they can’t win against student players since student can play much time more than them.\r\n So LOL is really nice system that doesn’t depends on playing length but their skill/sense/intelligence.\r\nSo advertising like “Your intelligence will decide win or lose” is also fine.\r\nSome Japanese players avoid if a game’s result depends on “skill” since they feel the game is difficult for casual users.\r\nBut Many people try to play if they hear the result depends on their intelligence.\r\n\r\n(5)Low spec computer is fine\r\nNot many Japanese players buy a computer for playing PC video game. Mostly Japanese buy PS3/PS4/WiiU/etc if they want to play a video game. If LOL require high spec PC , its really difficult to find a player who has enough spec PC.\r\nOne of reason that once Ragnarok Online was really popular in Japan  was the game can be played by low-spec PC.\r\nIn Japan , if we watch PC video game , everyone always thinks that high-spec PC is necessary.\r\nThey will avoid it like “I can’t play with my low spec PC….”.\r\nSo advertising like “Low spec PC can play LOL!”  is effective in Japan.\r\nBy the way ,Some of us said that 1st impression of new summoner’s rift was really bad. Because  champion model and new map didn’t match. And the new map looks toy and childish. And the worst problem is PC spec for LOL became a bit higher than previous map. \r\n\r\n(6)Marking Cartoon\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\nIf LOL service can start with LOL cartoon,  ratio of success in Japan will be higher.\r\nI would like to explain the reason here.\r\n\r\nFirstly , collaboration with cartoon is really effective. Recently “Attack on Titan” and “Yokai Watch” became really popula thanks to the cartoon.\r\nAnd cartoon is required for the marketing/advertising below\r\n\r\n(A)Send chalenging message to players by low-risk\r\nMany Japanese preffered coop to versus. Some of them avoid versus game. But even avoiding versus game , they surely have a pride like “I’m expert of playing game”\r\nSo if we want to make the players who dont like versus-game play LOL , we need incite their pride.\r\nBut as I said it’s really risky to advertise like “you can identify your skill by playing LOL because…” . Some people will think its rude.\r\nBut if you send those message by using cartoon characters , we can incite them without risk.\r\nThe advertising message which is really necccessary and risky should be sent by cartoon.\r\n\r\n(B)They will spend 30mins for cartoon\r\nFor making people have interest for LOL , to make them play LOL is difficult. Its required some hours for instalattion and 30min VDT work required health. But making them watch the cartoon is realy easiler than it. Just lie down in front of TV and watch it. Its easier.\r\n\r\n(C)Emphasize  low spec requirement and free-to-play\r\nIf the story is like below , you can send a message of low-spec-requirement and free-to-play.\r\n-The leading character in the cartoon is really poor and has no PC\r\n-One day he found a low spec PC in garbage area\r\n-When he turned on the PC , LOL was installed already. \r\n-He just clicked it as curious.\r\n-Blah blah blah\r\n\r\n\r\n(D)Rule explanation by cartoon\r\nUnderstanding the rule of LOL only by 30mins is really difficult. And its also difficult to find fun only by 30mins. At least a few hours is neccessary for them. But if cartoon can explain them , they will learn it by watching LOL\r\n\r\n(E)Easy to make the best fight in every story\r\nIf LOL become cartoon , one of problem is how you can make the best groovy fight in every story. But fortunatelly , LOL has a lot of “outplay” saved in youtube. We can find many of them everywhere.\r\nSo if somebody try the best fight , just copy it. Then action part of the cartoon will be legendary.\r\nThis is really big advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way , what is NOT important when LOL service starts in Japan is  who will be those voice actors.\r\nIf voice actor’s level is stable , whoever is fine for the most Japanese players.\r\nCasual Players never care about voice actors. Only small group will care about it.\r\nSuccess/Fail of LOL does NOT depend on voice actors.\r\n\r\nAnd if LOL become cartoon , there is a good/bad example below.\r\n(I watched those cartoon less than 5min , but I know which one is better for LOL)\r\n\r\n>Good Example\r\nCardfight!! Vanguard!!！http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/cf-vanguard/\r\nOne little boy will learn a rule of the cardfight and be stronger.\r\nThis is good example how you can make people learn the rules.\r\n\r\n>Bad Example\r\nDisk-wars avenragers http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/dw_avengers/\r\nVisual taste is like american cartoon. Japanese dont like it since it looks really old fashioned. And if leading character will fight instead of heros , basic rule and fun will not be explained by the cartoon.\r\nPlease dont make the cartoon like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\n\r\n[Other general suggesion for game mode and system.]\r\n\r\n-100% No communication mode\r\nOne of my friends said “ LOL is fun , but sometimes I dont wanna play LOl since other players speaking ill of everyone everytime. I wanna play LOL PVP after finishing my work as refreshment , but those player make me tired. They are claiming even in ARAM!!”\r\nSo sometimes I wonder if there is a game mode without any communication such as chat in game , chat after game , dance , taunt. Nobody can’t say anything even after winning/losing. \r\nThen my friend might play a game after finishing work.\r\n\r\n-20min/30min mode\r\nLengh of this game is always not sure. Sometimes we can’t play a game since it will finish within 30mins or not. \r\nSo If we only have 30mins to play a game , we want to play a game which finish within 30min.\r\nSo 30min mode/20min mode is one of idea for solving this problem.\r\nFor example , game length is already decided before the game. And at 30min , game will forcibly finish. After the finish , both team’s money will be checked. If team’s money is larger than opponent , that team will win. Or maybe destroy object number will decide a game. (etc).\r\nFor office worker and married person with kids and those kind of people , they are looking for a game which they can play with short duration.\r\nAnd its also very nice practice system for everyone. Because usually win/lose is decided within 20min. So The most important time of this game is first 20mins.\r\n\r\n-Game matching tag\r\nIn Japan , if they are big group , they tend to like play only with their friends. But custom game has a IP/XP restriction. So LoL is not good at playing only with friends. If custom game overload the server , how about adding “tag” in normal game?  Then people will match with the same tag. Then current normal system will include such a custom game.\r\n-Repaly System\r\nI heard that Replay system overload the server very much. Then how about keeping the replay log only 5minutes after a game finish. Player can download the log only within 5minutes. And sell the log for 100IP (or 20RP). Because everyone wants to save the replay log even by paying money when they did really well in a game. Replay log is one of chance to make money for Riot.\r\n\r\n-Mystery Rune(IP Only)\r\nIn Japan , Some people loves a system like mistery box.  Some of them are doing not for items but for opening box. So opening box itself became a motivation for mystery box. Some people will play a game for earning IP to open mystery rune.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What I feel about LCS]\r\n-As a show business , LCS is a bit boring (for casual player like me) since champion combination is alwasy similar. I just want to see many champions which are not popular. So how about changing ban/pick systems? Good example is Pokemon matching system. They always show 6pokemons and choose only 3pokemons secrecly. Lets combine LOL and Pokemon systems. Firstly ban 6champions , secondary pick 3Champions for each players , then ban 10champions , finally choose 10champs secretly. (3ban x2 -> 10pick x3 -> 5ban x2)\r\nOr just make a rule which not allow a team to pick the same champion at the same week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your reading !\r\nBy the way , what I am regret is I completely forgot to use \"refer a freind\" when I invited those friends.\r\nSo I lost a chance to buy draven ward! Its really cool !

And I bought it with my initial 400RP.\n\nMy wife bought a lot of RP. But I've never done it.\nWhat is interesting is RP purchase doesn't depend on player's skill.\nMy wife is bronze5 and not good at playing this game , but she never care it and loves LOL so much , and she bought a lot of bundles/skins.\n\nThis situation also happens to my colleague.\nSome of them only playing intermediate and never play PVP.\nBut they still bought a lot of RP for buying many champions and skins.\n\nThis is a good situation to start a LOL service in Japan.\nBecause Riot game can get a lot of money at the beginning of the service in Japan.\n\nWhat is problem is those purchase will not last for a long time.\nBecause if they are bored for playing intermediate , they stop playing LOL.\nIt means nobody buying RP anymore.\n\nRiot's homework is how they can make Japanese players continue this game.\nIt means how they can make Japanese players migrate from AI to PVP.\n\nOne of ideas is \"Giving mystery-gift or something nice gift when they finish ranked placement\".\nBecause after playing ranked game,  some of them will think \"Normal is a place for practice. I can feel free to play Normal\".\n(Its also suggested to change a name from \"Normal\" to \"Practice\" in the menu if Riot really want to make them feel so. They need an excuse.)\n\nMany Japanese feel pressure when they play PVP , even normal game.\nThey do high pressure at ranked game. \nSome friends said \"Draft pick music make me feel nervous\"\nBut after playing ranked game, some of them will think that normal is easier to play due to the comparison between ranked and normal.\nSo Riot's homework is how rioter can make Japanese players play normal game if they dont like PVP  and are bored of AI game.\nOne of my friends shows the answer.\nHe is playing ARAM a lot  because he feels a lot of pressure from normal and ranked. \nBut he never stop playing LOL since he loves LOL a lot. \nThat's why he goes ARAM a lot. In fact he wants to go normal PVP , but he is also afraid of being blamed.\nHe can say \"don't angry , this is just an ARAM ,  win/lose mostly depends on our luck\"\nHe really loves PVP only with friends in custom game. He always ask us to play PVP in a custom game.\n\nAnd  Some of my friends who loved AI game and quit LOL  also loved PVP in the custom game.\nThey also went ARAM sometimes.\n\nI think they show some kind of hint for the answer of the homework.\n\n\n\nBy the way, thank you for giving me a mystery gift.\nThis activity is really nice. \nIt's worth doing in next year.\n\nBecause if we know that we can get the reward , we start to imagine what we can get.\nThe imagination will amplify our desire.\nIf a player are disappointed at the gift result, they will start to consider to buy RP for another mystery gift.\nIn Japan , this method is really popular for android/i-phone game company.\nWe call it \"Eduke\", it means \"make 《monkeys》 take to feeding.\"\nThat will bring a lot of money to the company.\nAnd it's also helpful for players who can't buy RP due to poverty. (And they will cherish the skin)\nIts Win-Win.\n\nThis activity will worth not only for players but also for Riot.   Its really smart way. \nI think many people appreciate the activity. Thank you for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-01-03T18:01:22.845+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"Well this is an interesting read.

I always thought Japan liked PvP more as I hear fighting games are big there. But I guess as it's the only PvP I really hear much about it should of been more obvious to me. Honestly sounds like Japan will see a lot more \"jungle or feed\" than \"mid or feed\" with that in mind. Feels kind of weird to think about it. \n\nA PvE mode that people have been wanting for a while is a survival one that Japan may enjoy for a challenge when they are bored of bots. Maybe giving it a tower defense system. A system like Sanctum would be cool to see. \n\nLeague Anime would also be something other regions would enjoy. I know there are some heavy anime haters on these boards, but it will come with some good up sides. \n- It would solidify the lore. Even if they tried changing things ahead. People would probably ignore the change and go with the Anime. If some people did change it would split the community. Something Riot wouldn't want. Something to make lore more permanent would be a huge win for the lore fans and anime fans alike.\n- If it's good, people will see it on other sites to find league. Sword Art Online, while overhyped, is good and well known. If a game came out made after it that didn't suck, it would hardly need to advertise much to be successful. \n\nLast thing I want to talk about is Voice Communication. Riot plz. Toxic players will be toxic. The problem is the player, not the tool. If a player spends 50% of a game muted by their whole team, multiple games, there should be a flag for Riot to look into this player. If a player can't handle Voice Comm they shouldn't be in Ranked. Then again i think Ranked should be more restricted than this it is with harsher punishments to trolls. Ranked should be about the competition. Not the KDA or your MMR. It should be about looking for a challenging game.

There are few games coming out of Japan that aren't obviously \"Japanese games\", as in either Final Fantasy derivatives or weird stuff like Katamari Damacy. I imagine the cultural barrier works the other way round as well. For instance, co-op is something nobody in the West cares about.\n\nIn the end, Japan may be the weirdest country in the world, but it's still just *one* country, one that is much more console oriented than PC oriented, and therefore Riot may not prioritise it.\n\nBased on your suggestions, I think you may actually be looking for Dota 2 instead of League. It has a better pick/ban system and much more intelligent bots that are actually difficult for non-expert players.

I litterally think that every account should have no chat logs until lvl 20 or something because if your truly new to the game you won't have much to say for tactics or anything and hardly anyone uses the chat for anything beneficial until you get to higher tier play. If anything they could have something after the game where players could give notes on thing you can do better or something. or if anything have no communication mode an option that you could turn on or off. Because to be honest league is sometimes so toxic at times it just turns players away from the game so that even though no communication might possibly be bad the toxicity and the fact that people leave over it is a bigger problem I feel and this is a solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RisingDecent","date":"2015-01-05T09:38:08.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi! im also playing from japan.

And at 30min , game will forcibly finish. After the finish , both team’s money will be checked. If team’s money is larger than opponent , that team will win. Or maybe destroy object number will decide a game.
