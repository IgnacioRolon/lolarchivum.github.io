I am a playor of this game. I been playeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeng dis game 4 a leetul beet maor den 5 yeers nao, and I haz issue. \r\n\r\nOkay for real tho. I've been playing this game for ages on a couple accounts throughout the years, and my step dad got this real expensive router to make sure I don't lag while I play, as I used to have issues with that, but since then I've been lag free, to \"attempting to reconnect\" messages for 2 whole years now. \r\n\r\nBut just yesterday I started going atr in games again, it seems to happen frequently too (It really sucks when your playin {{champion:98}} and you cant ult in time rip) I think I know the culprit, but I wanna be absolute sure. \r\n\r\nSo 3 days ago I got this radio app on my phone. Its called \"anime radio\" (ye I love that stuff) and yesterday i had the idea, it would be REALLY cool to listen to some sweet anime music on my phone while I play league on my computer! Yeah! \r\n\r\nWell, I dunno if its coincidence or not, but since yesterday I've been having atr issues in game, but my ping is just fine (a nice stable n smooth 40-60) so its really odd. \r\n\r\nI just wanna be absolute sure. Does listening to anime radio on my phone slow down my internet, which in turn, causes league to lag? \r\n\r\nI think thats it, but I'm not FULLY sure. Also idk if listening to radio apps like this count as streaming, which I know slows down internet. I know pandora is streaming music (I dun use that tho) but idk if a radio app is considered the same thing, or at the very least has the same effect. \r\n\r\nAlso my phone is an android, not sure if that means anything tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-12T23:49:05.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your phone was connected to the same wifi as the pc you were using for League, it could definitely slow cause issues but I wouldn't think that should prevent you from playing normally with just a radio streaming service going. \n\nDo me a favor and check out the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for some basic troubleshooting and let me know if that helps or not!","replies":[{"poster":"GudLunchHavFries","date":"2017-12-13T00:38:44.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'ma do dat connection guide now. Tho I do think I should point out that not only is my phone connected to the same wifi as my pc, we also have 4 other cell phones in my household, an ipod, and a laptop also connected to the internet at all times. That isn't even counting 4 different 3ds's, 2 VITA's, an xbox one, a ps4, a switch, a wiiu, and another desktop that we also own, but obvs aren't connected to the internet all the time as they aren't constantly being used like the first list. \n\nWould the smartphone streaming possible be the thing to push it over the edge? I should note my sister also uses pandora alot, as well as watched netflix, but this is my first time streaming music of any kind, so thats possibly 1, 2, or 3 streamings going on at once, tho most likely just 1, as the odds of 2 or more happening at the same time is rather rare.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T01:08:00.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a lot of streams or devices actively using the internet at once can slow things down a bit, but just having one radio stream and League up shouldn't cause any issues I don't think. Let me know how those steps work from the connection guide after testing it in a custom or practice match really quick. If things aren't any better we can go through a couple others steps to see what can be done.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GudLunchHavFries","date":"2017-12-13T00:40:09.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also lag report gives me an application error.
