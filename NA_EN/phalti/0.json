The whole client closed out. Mind you this was before the game started. I logged back into league and my duo partner was still in the game. I could shop, start games, and had no way to rejoin the game. This was ranked and I lost LP for this game. Why do I lose LP for a game where the client crashes. Is there anywhere I can submit about information for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T22:21:56.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While we can't modify game stats, I'd like to try and help with whatever is causing the game to crash.

It tried to repair itself. It was unable to repair and the client closed. This was as selecting my champ in champ select. I was third pick. My duo partner was in the room. The chat said I had left. The game proceeded. I was signed back into my account before the end of champ select and did not have the option to rejoin. I had full access of the client. I was able to access the store and even create and join games . Even though on my duos screen I was in his game still. The match did not show up in my history till much later.","replies":[]}]}]}
