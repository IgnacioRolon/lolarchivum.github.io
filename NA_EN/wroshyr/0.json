I just got killed over and over again by Swain's DoT and Shyvana's W while in the air under the effect of Rappel. It's stupid, you can't move at all while going up, you can't use any other abilities as far as I know, but you still take damage? I think this is extremely stupid, especially since she can only rappel to enemies.\r\nOn a side note, my computer recognizes Swain, and Elise as words, but not Shyvana, I find that odd...","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2014-12-14T23:57:18.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Rappel only makes you untargetable, not invulnerable.","replies":[{"poster":"Wroshyr","date":"2014-12-15T00:01:55.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why? She can't do anything, she has no way of making up for it, and DoT's can tick soooo many times just in the small space of time it takes to go up or down. I got killed from three hundred health because of Swains DoT from his bird, just in the time it took me to travel up.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-12-15T10:08:08.436+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"DoTs will also keep ticking while you're in the air, not just while you're ascending or descending. There are a number of champions (Fizz, Elise, Vlad come to mind, might be another one or two) that have untargetability that does not also confer invulnerability. That's the case because those abilities already give a lot of power, nullifying a lot of enemy plays, and adding DoT removal on top of that's something we don't feel is appropriate as a result.\n\nEffects like Shyvana's W that aren't already on you however shouldn't be able to hit you mid Rappel. If AOE effects like that are hitting that's a bug we'd want to fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Wroshyr","date":"2014-12-17T07:11:28.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess the DoT continuing to do damage makes sense, I just found it extremely frustrating because she can't escape or reposition herself except back to an enemy (unlike Fizz or Vlad).
