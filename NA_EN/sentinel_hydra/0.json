This is a post on Katarina.\r\n\r\nThe other day, I played as a Zed vs Kat, got fed. Unfortunately, my team fed Kat and she got a quadra. Soon after, I rushed in, she popped Zhonya's and her team wrecked me.; gave her the penta and won the game. ( I know that was stupid of me)\r\n\r\nSo anyways, I wanted to ask you guys: Is my team just bad not to have cc'd Kat in time, we just bad, or is Kat strong?\r\n\r\nBtw my team had Zed(Me), Ahri, M.F., Udyr, and Aatrox.","replies":[{"poster":"Rawrful","date":"2015-03-18T04:37:28.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kat is (far) too weak to get played in high level competitive matches.  But Kat punishes the shit out of non-coordinated or less skilled teams harder than any other champion in the game.  Especially if the Kat is a smurf and out-skills the other players, then she is crazy OP.\n\nSo really, it depends on how you want to look at it.  If you think of balance as \"At the highest levels of play\" she is under powered.  If you think of balance as \"average solo queue experience\" she is OP.  If you think of balance as a mix of the two, she is balanced.  \n\nPersonally, I just ask for her to be banned every game and move on with my life.  She is too volatile.  A really good Kat player can get out of hand really quickly.  A bad Kat player will get shut down and be useless.  It isn't worth the risk.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-18T05:36:54.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sees... less play competitively? What..? \n\nThe way Katarina works is your team either has a LOT of instantly casted CC abilities in EVERY lane or she simply roams to the lane that does not have such. If she's a first pick, it's easy to coordinate with your team to play against her, HOWEVER... If she's, say, a last pick and your team has more of a disengage comp or a poke comp or simply doesn't have more than 1 or 2 instantly casted CC abilities, Katarina can shred through some one's health.\n\nOn another thread, I had actually explained how Kat works ability-wise. We all know her combo can half life a carry without pressing R when you get to the late game. What people DON'T know is how her R actually works. Back in the day, back when 'Build CC against Kat and win at life' worked, Katarina's R actually had a .25s delay before it started slinging out it's damage. Her R currently does 25% of her AP every .25s for 2.5s. This means she does 100% of her AP per 1s you might think? Wrong!\n\nKatarina's R does it's first sling of blades as soon as it's casted, which was added in [patch 3.12](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/V3.12) and I even linked it for you. Her R hits 10 times and hits once every .25s. This means in 1s, she actually has done 1.25x her AP from her R and can finish her R in 2.25s rather than 2.5s. \n\nAverage reaction time for a human is already anywhere between .2s to 1s. Kat's combo can all be used without any kind of delays since she has absolutely no cast times outside of channeling her R. A good Kat knows how to roll her Q+E+W together and press R as well. If it takes you 1s to stop Katarina after she's jumped into the middle of your team, she's already done 1.25x her AP plus the bases on her abilities AND she'll have gotten through 1s of her ult which adds in ANOTHER 1.25x her AP plus it's base. That's 2.5x her AP of nearly unavoidable damage. \n\nCC isn't what kills Kat. Constant wards, people building tons of magic resist and finishing early Banshee's over damage on carries, Hexdrinkers on Bruisers, and insta-cast CC. For a champ to be balanced around if the enemy team is not only professional, but has some one with near-Faker-like reflexes with an insta-cast CC is simply disgusting. They nerfed Veigar's E from a .25s cast time to a .75 in total and gave it a visual. There's no visual for a Katarina and no cast times. She's guaranteed to get off a TON of damage.\n\nAlso, Katarina is played quite often in Diamond. The only reason she hasn't hit LCS is because it takes a different playstyle than the common mid. She takes a lot of skill and a lot of quick reflexes. Her ban rate is also through the roof right now. She has a 64% ban rate and a 54% win rate. In Diamond, she has a 53.9% ban rate and a 53.8% win rate as well as a 12% pick rate. A 12% pick rate with a near 54% ban rate? Imagine if she wasn't banned half the time!","replies":[{"poster":"Rawrful","date":"2015-03-19T00:46:21.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ysPNfMLs,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-03-18T05:36:54.127+0000)\n>\n> Sees... less play competitively?

First off, professionals are the highest of the highly skilled players in all regards.  And Kat has not been played in NA or EU LCS, nor in LCK (Korea) nor in LPL (China).  Clearly she is not useable by the most skilled players against the most skilled opponents.  It isn't my opinion that she is too weak for competitive use, she just isn't.  \n\nNot to mention... If she spends a full second channeling, you eat a 2.5 AP ratio!  Well shit, Annie can slap you with a 2.45 AP ratio from 625 range away, and open the whole thing with an AoE stun!  Oh, and Annie has a damage return+armor/MR skill, and has a base 625 auto attack range.  But Annie isn't OP, because that isn't an OP ratio.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-19T04:00:09.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie is also considered one of the most broken champions currently. There's a reason why she wasn't given any actual 'compensation buffs' when DFG was removed. She was one of the problems. You can even look throughout these threads and see the millions of posts that say how broken Annie is, HOWEVER.... You'll never see Annie played in mid. She's got huge damage, but people NEVER play her mid in popular play. She's always a support, just like how Zyra was. \n\nAnd Katarina isn't played in popular play anymore because no one plays assassin-style in mid anymore. No one played High-Risk, High-Reward and they never will. Even when Katarina WAS popular, back in S2 and early S3, she wasn't played as an Assassin, like how she's supposed to be played. People like Team Fighting. Team Fighting, Team Fighting, Team Fighting. In S2, she was played tankier. In early S3 when Liandry's was used, she was played EVEN tankier. People don't know how to utilize High Risk, High Reward in LCS. They choose safe picks. Always safe picks. Never anyone who might be at risk of dying. When they did use some that have a 'risk', they rushed a Zhonya's so they wouldn't have to worry. 'Professionals' might be good, but they don't know how to play the real assassins. \n\nI can prove this even more with Talon as on example. He's hugely High Risk, High Reward. He was used throughout China and abused to the fullest because he had very little risk when he had a silence. He lost his silence and all of a sudden he went from hugely played to never at all.\n\nNow we can look at Kassadin. He's now considered High Risk, High Reward. Before when he was popular? HAH. He would R NEAR them and press Q and E then R away. \n\nHell, we can also look at Gragas for crying out loud. He was popular as hell. Why? Because he could one shot people in two abilities FROM A SAFE DISTANCE. They removed that and made him need to get up close and made him able to do even MORE damage and people don't respect it because he's not SAFE anymore.\n\nName any champion that's not a safe pick in mid that's played right now. Name ONE. You won't find any because they don't exist in 'Professional Play', but if you look at Diamond or Challenger and all of a sudden you're seeing them all over the place. Professionals don't take risky champions because they've got actual money and their livelihood on the line, but that doesn't mean Assassins who are known to be way too bursty shouldn't be nerfed. She's got incredible amounts of reliability as an Assassin with very little reaction time like Annie. They're both huge issues right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Sentinel Hydra","date":"2015-03-19T15:18:02.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O ok than you","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eli Big Gay","date":"2015-03-18T04:28:04.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kat needs less catnip","replies":[]},{"poster":"BradTaste","date":"2015-03-18T04:30:48.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kat is a champ who I honestly hate, but love to play","replies":[]},{"poster":"IM GONNA GO MID","date":"2015-03-18T04:53:36.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why do I keep seeing Kat Kat Kat Kat everywhere on this board....
