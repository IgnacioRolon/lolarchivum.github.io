Now, I can't refund her. I do have 3 refunds left but it's still not letting me do it. I was wondering if there was a quick fix. I did open a ticket yesterday ( 22637850 ) but I was wondering If I could just fix it myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-27T15:47:44.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not currently possible to refund a champion through the client if it has skins unlocked.  Contacting player support through a ticket is the best option so we can look for any options for you.  I was able to confirm that your ticket was successfully received, and a specialist will reach out as soon as possible.
