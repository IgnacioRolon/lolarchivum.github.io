The question of Taric's sexuality has often been seen through the prism of jokes and memes and for better or worse has never been addressed. Thus, many players, especially those among us who are gay, have projected different values onto Taric and the gay players among us were able to bond with him. Simultaneously, most players are still quite homophobic and the idea that Taric might not be entirely straight seems scary to them. Although not central to his concept per se, \"sexuality\" is something inherently related to love, and from what I've read so far and heard from the podcast, Taric appreciates all eathrly aspects of life and puts special emphasis on love and beauty.\n\nPersonally, I think you have guys have left him quite ambiguous on that front and open to interpretation and personal projection. Still, I had to ask.... xD The lack of any compliments for male champions (no, not Ezreal) in his voiceover kind of left me confused. \n\nSo, does Taric appreciate only the beauty of women (Ashe, Diana), and the love between a man and a woman, or???? Is he straight, gay or..... multi-faceted? I'm dying to know xD\n\nEdit: Btw, I'm not rooting for a solid confirmation, I like the ambiguity, but I am quite curious what Riot actually thinks, given  how many gay people (and there _are_ gay people people playing LoL) have connected with the non-hetero \"memes\".","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-04-13T19:45:37.385+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"Taric loves all life on Runeterra and appreciates the beauty in everyone, it's not specific to Ashe & Diana. \n\nWe wanted to tell a great story about a kind, protector.

He looks better than I could have hoped, and I’m happy to see him finally getting the love he deserves! I have a few questions for you guys (a little bit for each of you):\n\n1.\tIn the Taric dev podcast, you guys mentioned that each Aspect has a little more Targon or a little more humanity in them in a unique way from and Aspect to Aspect basis. I know you guys said you threw out the chart/graph/whatever, but can you tell us where the other Aspects stand in regards to this system. Pantheon is obviously 99-100% War Aspect with little to no human, but where do Diana and Leona stand?\n\n2.\tGoing along with this, would it be accurate to say that The Protector see’s Aurelion Sol’s slavery to the star crown as unjust? Or is that more Taric’s thing, and he and the Protector don’t have to agree on every minute detail? His quote to Aurelion Sol is that “No star should be bound.” Taric even sounds a bit reverent when he says it. (Also, Yuri Lowenthal did such a good job!)\n\n3.\tIn the update, you’ve switched Taric’s hammer to a mace. What was the reasoning behind this? Was it because you wanted to leave everything Old Taric behind, or was it more to do with his “new” battle cleric theme, and clerics being more associated with maces?’\n\n4.\tBefore Taric became the Aspect of the Protector, did he have any magical potential? And how strong was he? Garen is obviously very strong but doesn’t exactly have magic, it seems. Obviously becoming an Aspect powers you up, I’m just curious where he stood among humans before his ascension to aspecthood.\n\n5.\tI can’t imagine this new ultimate, Cosmic Radiance, was the first one you came up with when developing his new kit. Can you tell us about some other things you concepted before settling on this one?\n\n6.\tTaric’s comic, Ascent, is my favorite piece of out-of-the-game content I’ve seen in a very long time. I’m currently using the final image of Ascent as my desktop, it’s so beautiful! What was the process for writing this piece, and how did you decide on the art style? (also, the “guy” near the top, was that a (fake) Noxian or a (fake) Freljordian?) And not a question, but I really liked the part where it looks like he was going to slap the guy, but instead he gave him his cape! And the line “I know, but I promise I’ll never stop trying” actually made my heart race! So good!\n\n7.\tCan you tell us about some VO lines that didn’t quite make the cut but you liked? I was surprised you didn’t go for an allied Ezreal taunt! (Love him in the armor of the fifth age splash, though!)\n\n8.\tDid any of your exploration into this rework get affected by the threads IronStylus made way back when talk of a Taric rework even happening started? Some of the suggestions in those threads seem to have been taken to heart, but I guess it’s possible you went that way on your own.\n\n9.\tWas Emerald Taric always going to go the foresty/nature route or did you have any other ideas?\n\n\nThat’s probably enough pestering you, thanks again for the rework!

I'm super happy to hear that you liked the Ascent, it was a labor of love for us. Literal blood, sweat and tears (okay, no blood.) For writing, we wanted to give players a way to 'say goodbye' and that he was leaving his past behind. Everyone was really drawn to the story of Taric's climb on Targon and what that might be like for him. \n\nFor the art style, we wanted to do something a little different than the other comics we've done (I also produced the Poppy comic)--since Taric was Demacian, we wanted something more \"Demacia.\" A little more traditional, painterly, and classic.\n\n[edit] And the dude at the top is a Noxian :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Sad Moon Boi","date":"2016-04-13T19:48:49.640+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Taric is my current main support (lv 5 mastery Taric's united!!!) and I have a couple of questions regarding the new Taric.\n\n1) I really liked his total damage output of the old Taric, it is what made him unique, and I really enjoyed it. Of course he was really really easely kited out and struggled against AP comps. My question here is, because two of his damage abilities (W/R) got removed, won't his damage get down? It's one of the main things I liked about Taric, and I'd hate to see him struggle because he's lacking damage.\n\n2) I do like his Q/E changes (skillshot in favor for AoE stun, me likes), but I feel his W and R are lackluster. His W is basically a Kalista link that can be recast, so no reason to max it (shield is rather weak from what I've tried out on PBE). And his ult I feel is completely out of line with the rest of his kit. I really dislike it. Ignoring that I personally dislike immunity ults, but the 2.5 sec cast time is just forcing the assassin meta again. Basically if Taric is dominating, hello assassin meta again. I would prefer his old damage stereoid ult back. Would there be a possibility that his ult grants some small AD/AP boost before the immunity strikes? That would be nice.\n\n3) Is he gay? Can anyone confirm that? :3 :3 :3\n\n4) Debonair Taric any time soon? :C\n\n5) Also we need a full gem Taric skin for real, like he is 100% gems. Would instabuy it.\n\n6) I like his new theme, about beautiful stuff. What would Jhin think about his idea of beauty?\n\n7) If Taric would be some other champion's senpai, whose would it be? :# :3 :#\n\n8) Did you ever consider making an ult for Taric that would charm a couple of enemies into coming close to him?

If people feel empowered to pick assassins when they enemy has locked in Taric, then that's great. That's ideal, actually.
