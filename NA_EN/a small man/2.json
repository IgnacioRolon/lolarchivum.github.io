After awhile the things you see just seem to make you desensitized.  If I'm not careful when I'm talking to my colleagues here at work I might tell them a story very casually about something I read or saw earlier that day.  I end it with a chuckle and look at them thinking they'll understand the humor amid depravity,  instead they just respond with a look on horror on their face.\n\nOut of game though, someone who was angry with us added a pretty cool GIF of a dick pic that ended with \"a particularly creative use of skittles\" ---  **Edited by suggestion from ADillonMostDirty**  ---.  I thought it was a lot more interesting than the typical dick pics we end up with.\n\nHe still didn't get his account back though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-03-01T19:23:13.099+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"When using the support system, most of the time you need to go through 2 people to get a relevant response to your problem that isn't copy and pasted, and sometimes you can't even get that.

Why is that acceptable to Riot?\n\nThat's actually a good question Disregardable!  \n\nTo start though, I wouldn't say that it's acceptable at Riot.  It's really quite the opposite.  We hate it!  \n\nBut I think your question digs into the main challenge that we (or any large company for that matter) is trying to solve.\n\nWe get a lot of requests in a day, a really ridiculously large amount.  It just so happens that the majority of these requests can be solved in just one response.  We call these \"first response\" or \"tier one\" tickets.  (Pretty basic Customer Service stuff here)\n\nBecause the player base has grown so big since we started we've since opened up new locations that focus on Tier 1 responses.  (It wasn't physically possible for us to continue to grow here in Los Angeles at the same rate as our playerbase)\n\nThe main challenge to solve with these new locations: how do we get a response that is both fast and effective to players.  The good news is that as a a result of this strategy the large majority of player questions and problems can be solved a lot faster today then ever before in Riot's history.\n\nOn the other hand though, this created a growing pain for us as a department when it comes to more complicated tasks.  Where as 4 years ago we were all working out of the LAX office and getting an escalated answer was as easy as talking to the person next to you, now our department is spread over more than one location.  \n\nIn the phase that we're at now we're looking on how we can get better \"self help\" to players.  Meaning, if you have a common question or tech problem why should you have to wait for us to respond to you at all?  If we can get that information to you quicker (perhaps with a better support site, or some degree of automation) then you'll never have to wait a long time to get back into League.\n\nThere's a lot of growth to go still, so I wouldn't anticipate change overnight.  But our commitment to reduce the overall wait time it takes for players to get the answers they need is strong, and we're making some good strides so far.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-03-01T20:54:16.536+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Word on the street is that Wuks was named after WookieeCookie ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leoric2","date":"2016-03-01T19:43:18.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"With the close of Domination, I had a lot of run-ins with bots when playing vs AI.

Is there any fear that the bots will move to a different queue, like Twisted Treeline vs bots?\n\nBots are a difficult situation.  \n\nIt's likely they'll move, their behavior is always fluctuating because their creators are trying to avoid detection.  So when we have a solution to detect them we know it may only work for a short time before it is becomes obsolete.\n\nWe'll adapt as they adapt and it will be a continual arms race.  Big changes probably won't come until we can get to the root cause of botting in the first place.  We have some people within Riot looking into possible solutions on that front, but they take time.\n\nJust a note for everyone since it's related. **Do not purchase accounts**  These accounts are often botted to level 30.  We may not find them right away, but the majority are discovered eventually and banned.  Any content you have on them will be unrecoverable at that point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HarrasmentFord","date":"2016-03-01T19:27:24.054+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are in the midst of a Wizard Battle.

Why not skip to the ones you really want to hear.  :P\n\nIf you received a 14 Day ban in 2010 or 2012 would your next be a perma?\nI don't like the way that question is phrased.  The TL;DR is likely not.  But it's not helpful to think about it like that.  You shouldn't be \"nice\" because you might be permanently banned if you're caught next.  You should work on being nice because it makes League of Legends (and LIFE!) more enjoyable.  If you're able to adopt a nice attitude towards the game then you won't have to spend time worrying if \"the next time\" will be the last.  Because there will never be a next time.\n\nSaying you're going to be nice, and actually being nice are two different things though. :P  The good news is in League, you don't neceesarily have to be nice, you just have to be not a jerk.  At most, all that is expected is that you're neutral and not creating pain for others.\n\nSome players get really caught up on the idea that they have to always be supportive or always say pleasant things or they will get banned.  But that's just not true.  I'm a firm believer in the \"If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all\".  Most games I play I'm pretty quiet,  I keep it to the gg's, maybe a jungle timer, and I use pings a lot to give my team mates a sense of where I'm going.  Any chatter more than that and it starts to detract from the game!\n\n\nHow to make life changing decisions?  Think about them, weigh the possibilities, go with what's optimal!  People sometimes accuse me of being a robot.\n\nAs for regrets,  I don't really have any.  It's challenging but I try not to focus on what I could have or should have done before.  You have to think about the positive things going on in life.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Piltovers Zyro","date":"2016-03-01T20:17:49.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any team fire skin release date for Diana? :'( I was so happy when {{champion:131}}  won, but she hasn't won yet {{item:3070}} Pretty please? {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2016-03-01T22:52:07.024+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KnightOfSidonia,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=JLiGXn2u,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2016-03-01T20:17:49.744+0000)\n>\n> Any team fire skin release date for Diana? :'( I was so happy when {{champion:131}}  won, but she hasn't won yet {{item:3070}} Pretty please? {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}\n\n\nSorry, I don't follow heretics.  {{champion:89}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2016-03-01T20:13:23.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2016-03-01T22:46:19.289+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OMG halp meh plz,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=JLiGXn2u,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2016-03-01T20:13:23.056+0000)\n>\n> Hi Cookiewookie, I enjoy reading your posts where you verbally destroy trolls/griefers/ragers/etc.\n> \n> Your style is a lot more entertaining than Lyte.\n> \n> Also aside from those, I don't seem to see you often.

Unfortunately last I checked the \"enter\" key is one of those hard coded entries in League of Legends.  It was explained to me that the key can not be unbinded.  Spaghetti Code, RIP.\n\nBUT!  I don't think that has to be game over for you.  What drives you to type?  When I want to say something snarky or unproductive I just say it out loud.  I get the satisfaction of voicing my concerns without the problem of hurting the morale of my team mates.  It takes adjusting, but anyone can do it!\n\nIf you're really desperate though I've heard of a few people physically removing the Enter key from their keyboard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"boredfatdude","date":"2016-03-01T20:37:45.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get banned do you lose all the RP, and skins you bought on the account?\n{{summoner:30}}","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2016-03-01T23:28:49.675+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheCodeUnicorn,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=JLiGXn2u,comment-id=0021,timestamp=2016-03-01T20:37:45.278+0000)\n>\n> If you get banned do you lose all the RP, and skins you bought on the account?\n> {{summoner:30}}\n\nIf permanently banned, yea.
