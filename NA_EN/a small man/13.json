Nasus has the form of a jackal and was always touted as a guy who understood the cycle of life and death. I know it was probably more coincidental but I can&#x27;t help but wonder; does Nasus&#x27;s form and his deathly powers have some kind of connection to Kindred, particularly Wolf, in any way, be it major or even in universe coincidental?\n> \n> Bah this was spawned on me so suddenly I haven&#x27;t formulated more questions! I&#x27;LL BE BACK WITH MORE AT SOME POINT I SWEAR.\n\nHey Sharjo,\n\nGreat questions there, and I'll dive in now.\n\n1 - Well, doing this when ALL THE BIOS were released might be a bit overwhelming for everyone. Doing it this way means we can address folks questions in manageable chunks without everyone's heads exploding. And we like to surprise even you now and again :-)\n\n2 - Ascended beings were once, if not common, then at least much more prevalent in Ancient times. Over time the ritual has become less successful and more and more folk being offered it weren't surviving. After Azir's betrayal and the fall of Shurima, most of the knowledge of how to do the ritual properly has been lost or forgotten. There was once many warriors of the Ascended Host, but even they are not immortal and can be killed with the right weapon and enough bodies to throw at them.\n\n3 - Expect to know more when Skarner's bio hits in the next couple of weeks. \n\n4 - I think it's a mixture of who you are and how the ritual is prepared that informs what you become. The ritual channels and hones the magic to make you into the being you need to be.\n\n5 - I don't think there's any direct connection, but Nasus is certainly a being of great and deep wisdom, so he certainly understands that cycle, yeah. And an entity like Kindred would certainly be interested in those who have lived long past their day to die.\n\nHahaha... don't worry, we'll be here for a while, so get your head all unexplodey and we'll answer what we can!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hydrac","date":"2016-05-05T21:15:38.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk if this question will be answered here or in Talyah's Q&A, but what is the relationship between her tribe and Azir's empire?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-05-05T21:28:34.257+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir's return is still pretty fresh for the people of Shurima.

They can bleed, be hurt and die in battle or other ways. Think of them as exceptionally long lived, but not immortal. There have definitely been others and perhaps not all of those raised up are dead. Perhaps that is not dead which can eternal lie... :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2016-05-05T20:47:54.173+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe immortal but not invincible?
