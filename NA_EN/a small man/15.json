I have watched it transform and develop into a beautiful, polished  well-oiled machine that generates interest and player base by the day. You've made a hard job for other game dev's as I feel I compare my experience of each new game to my league experience and not much measures up. Especially when you factor in how little you \"demand from us\" monthly fees, time invested daily and mandatory money spent to not fall behind. \n\n My question is has there been any talk of having a selection of these game modes be permanent residents? I know this was addressed probably a year ago when we were told we want to keep game modes fresh and vibrant, and not get stale. I mean, have we come to a point where we feel urf, or doombots etc will be solid enough that we can make it a permanent resident? or maybe with some minor tweaks they could be? \n\n The other bit that I wanted to touch on was something a little out of left field. I'm just curious about the creative side because I've done some simple brainstorming of my own to feel out what might be a great game mode. Has anything come up for you guys where you have considered something with multiple teams? have 3 or 4 teams with more emphasis on competing for neutral objectives.  \n\nThanks so much for your time, and I look forward to the great work you guys will inevitably produce.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dylightfull","date":"2015-10-07T20:46:24.172+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"**THE TALE OF RIOT L4T3NCY**\n\nRiot L4T3NCY was once a young boy living in Australia who, at the time, simply went by \"Latency.\" He lived the normal Australian life, waking up, eating breakfast, going to school, and fighting off giant man-eating spiders on the way home. Yes, a peaceful life indeed. There was something a tad bit dull about his life, however. Every day it was the same routine- Eat, fend off all of the acid-spitting beetle monsters, sleep, repeat. He tried to pass the time by watching anime and playing on his SNES, but it all seemed a bit boring.\n\nExcept for that one time the house was invaded by 50-foot Godzilla-esque birds in the 100 degree heat. That was pretty cool.\n\nAnd so one day, he moved to Japan and began to work in games. He found Japan a little odd, as in Australia, being chased by a flock of wild, flying, two-headed, heat-seeking alligators was a normal thing that happened on a daily basis, it would only happen during game shows in Japan. In fact, he began to find Japan a bit more dull after a few months as a result of less chaos.\n\nHe tried to spruce up his life. He legally changed his name to L4T3NCY. He auditioned for all of the different game shows to get a taste of the excitement he left behind. However, nothing seemed to work. Nothing was ever as chaotic and exciting as what he did before.\n\nThen one day, he got a call from Rito Games. They wanted him to work for them and make featured gamemodes. \"This is my chance!\" He thought to himself, and started working on his masterpiece.\n\nIt was a cold Winter day when he showed up to the office. He opened the demo of his plans, and the rest of the room was shocked. Everything was chaotic and out of order- there was no mana, super-short cooldowns, everyone was fast, and NOTHING could stop a full AP Sona. Everyone erupted with different reactions. The music team cheered, champion development became exited, the art team recoiled in horror, the PR team gasped, the programmers were emotionless as a result of The Great Spaghetting of 2010, and the balance team took notes. After a long time, everyone reached consensus- this new game mode would be official.\n\nAnd that, kids, is where URFs come from. Now it's time for the next book- \"Why am I so Salty all of a Sudden? A Guide to the Awkward Stage of Ranked\"\n\nYou have no idea how badly I want to see a \"Can confirm, am L4T3NCY\" reply.\n\nOh, I guess I'm supposed to ask a question. Hmmm...

In an era of 'ATB systems' and turn-based RPGs, here was a game where you mashed buttons to chop things, cast spells and do combos! The game also rewards you for how you choose to engage with it.

I rekon Kingdom Hearts probably owes a lot to Secret of Mana.\n\n**Music:** The music is stunning. There's a reason Square made many piano sheet music books for just the Secret of Mana games. When the intro credits come up, the 2nd name that appears is the composer, Hiroki Kikuta. He's the 2nd name?! In the credits of a JRPG! They gave mad respect and elevation to the music.\n\n**Ring Menus:** During regular play, there's no UI's, no interface (other than your little health bar). The screen is just full of GAME and you fall into it. When you pop a menu, it's fast, responsive, and right there on your character. No immersion breaking. Probably still the best example execution of ring menus to date for me.\n\n**Drop in / drop out co-op:** Your friend comes over and wants to play too? Press 1-button, BAM! They're in! Playing with you on the same screen chopping stuff together. Oh, they need to go grab snacks? Press 1-button, the AI takes over again. So simple.
