[COMPLETE]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/07lc1jY.jpg\n\n_Welcome to the latest installment of Between Two Turrets, a new Q&amp;A series from the NA Community team in which we'll connect you with various Rioters to chat about League, life, and anything in between. You can expect an installment every couple weeks or so, with Rioters from all over jumping in to spend some time with you on the boards._\n\n_This week, weâ€™ve got research manager **davin**!_\n\n---\n\n**EDIT - Thanks for coming out to chat guys! Gonna go catch my bus, but I'll try to check back later for any new questions. Take care!**\n\nHi friends! My name's Davin Pavlas, and I'm a Research Manager at Riot Games. I work as part of the team at Riot that studies player experience -- examining behavior, attitudes, wants, needs, psychology, and so on! My background is in Human Factors Psychology, I got my Ph.D. studying games, play, and learning. As a whole, research at Riot tackles how to make things fun, how to ensure players' needs are being met, and in general figures out how we know something is good or successful.\n\nIn the four years I've been at Riot, I've done research on a bunch of things, but my favorite work has been on champions (including Thresh, my favorite skellington), features (like Team Builder), and player behavior. \n\nI'm a huge nerd for games of all kinds, and really believe in the power of play in people's lives. Naturally, I love the hell out of games, whether it's playing them or making them. Beyond games, you'll usually find me talking about comedy, diversity in tech, and mental health. \n\nSo, that's me. In some brief paragraphs. I'd love to answer any questions you might have, and to get to know you all as well! Let's chat!","replies":[{"poster":"Hufflepuff","date":"2015-08-26T22:29:39.244+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":12,"body":"Are there any updates on a homosexual Champion?

And the way you're phrasing this is that only gay people should be silent about their orientation. You also want to put it to a vote to keep virtual characters from casually mentioning who they may be attracted to?  This has so many parallels to real life oppressive behavior its saddening.  Gay people have and always will be a minority in society, but that doesn't mean they aren't present.  I know plenty of homosexual gaymers, and its never a demand, its just a suggestion to represent a community that has been told to suppress their identity for so long.   As a homosexual man myself, I am never really \"offended\" by the lack of gay characters. I am just excited to see when a game company tries to incorporate one.  Countless young people are coming to terms with their sexual identities, and I think seeing a gay character in a game they adore, that has many characters, offers some feeling of inclusion.  Maybe even making them feel a little more comfortable in their skin in a world and internet culture that considers their homosexuality a matter of opinion. \nTL;DR WE'RE HERE! WE'RE QUEER! AND SEEING A LITTLE REPRESENTATION IS NOT ONLY REALISTIC, IT IMPACTS PEOPLE IN A POSITIVE WAY YOU MAY NEVER UNDERSTAND.

This is not the 70's.  The only cure that is needed, is for people like you who view something as harmless as homosexuality as a problem.  Please support your \"opinion\" with proper scientific research.  Otherwise, if we continue to throw out the phrase \"mental illness\" loosely, I'd like to document my experience with the illness. It has not prevented me from establishing confidence, falling in love, developing a promising monogamous relationship, becoming a doctor, or establishing a healthy relationship with my friends and family.  All of which have been goals in my life. In fact, my worst years were pre-18 or pre-coming-out, where I didn't show my \"mental illness\". However, I am just one person so perhaps you should try meeting the diverse group of people who are living with this particular illness.  In fact, many of their symptoms I've come to learn are quite similar to heterosexual people.  However, gay people have something different... strangers like you who tell us its wrong, tell us it is an illness, and tell us we need to be fixed.  Which, as valiant as you are with your efforts, preaches doubt, self-hate, and may lead to depression and suicide in young and old people.  People who would have otherwise lived without this uselessly negative environment.\n\nSO until you have proper evidence to label homosexuality as a mental illness, or have real practical reasons for why it should be fixed,  do not EVER label it as a problem.  Do not contribute to the environment that has made gay people hate themselves for so long.  When people like you stop, everyone else will stop glorifying being gay as there will be no reason to have pride in it anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"ProAsToss","date":"2015-08-27T21:44:57.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"The Alpha Gay","date":"2015-08-27T22:35:14.059+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll be honest, I'm little confused with your view, so I'll just say we are most likely going to agree to disagree.

I agree with you on the confusion of sex and love. However, I believe that that is a very general human problem. I would like to think most mature people see love and sexual attraction as being foundations, at the very minimum, for a life long relationship. Anyway, I appreciate your view. I just get frustrated with people thinking they have the answers to an experience they can't completely relate to.

New champ research is super fun! It usually starts with some concept testing -- we'll have some key art pieces and some action images of a few different champions. Get people's initial thoughts, what they think the character would do, have them explain to us who the character is, etc. That lets us see how well the character is communicating a particular fantasy. After that we would start doing prototype testing, testing out kits and animations in-game. We iterate through those and are largely trying to figure out whether the goals of the champion design are being met from an experience standpoint.
