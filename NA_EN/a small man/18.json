[COMPLETED]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/gevVgXa.jpg\n\n_Welcome to the latest installment of Between Two Turrets, a new Q&amp;A series from the NA Community team in which we'll connect you with various Rioters to chat about League, life, and anything in between. You can expect an installment every couple weeks or so, with Rioters from all over jumping in to spend some time with you on the boards._\n\n_This week, we've got composer, sound designer, and Pentakill guitarist **ProtoShredanoid**!_\n\n---\n\n**EDIT - Thanks for all the questions guys! Gonna get some work done, but I'll try to check back in case anyone else drops in.**\n\nHey guys,\n\nThanks for coming out to chat! A little about myself.... \n\nI started at Riot as a sound designer on the Champion team (some of my favorite champs I did sound and voice for - Velkoz, DJ Sona, Lissandra, Lucian, Thresh, Gnar....a few others). More recently, I moved to the music team and have been working as a composer. My favorite musical adventures at Riot include DJ Sona, Tahm Kench login and of course PENTAKILL!\n\nBefore coming to Riot I graduated from Berklee College of Music, and worked for an Activision studio called Vicarious Visions. You can hear bits of my music, sound design, or guitar work on a bunch of games like Transformers, Guitar Hero, James Bond, Kung-fu Panda, and Marvel stuff. I also record Instrumental Space Metal, Shred and Ambient music under the name ProtoShredanoid.\n\nDown to chat with you guys about any and all things music (or really whatever....The Cosmos, Lost Civilizations, Rocket League.....), so ask away!","replies":[{"poster":"Dylightfull","date":"2015-08-12T21:40:59.844+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a secret button that switches the normal music on SR to the pirate music from the Bilgewater event?

The coolest one by far was a 7-string custom Siggery. The thing is a beast. It makes one feel like a warrior when you pick it up. We named it \"Trinity\". For some of the solos I used a Peavey Wolfgang which is my go to guitar for the lead/shred stuff.  We also used an Ibanez baritone and a 7-string PRS for some of the rhythm tracks.........possible 8 string action coming up though :P\n\n- Favorite guitarist? Hmmmm so many it's hard to say just one so I will list a few. Allan Holdsworth, Greg Howe, Joe Satrani, Marty Friedman, Buckethead, all of the Sharpnel dudes, newer guys like Tosin Abasi and Guthrie Govan, the classics......Hendrix, Wes Montgomery, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Man I could go on forever and these are just guitar players.......\n\n- Lightbringer and Last Whisper  are satisfying tunes to play, but the riffs from Ohmwrecker and the verse section on Thornmail are semibrutal and make you feel like you got kicked in the nxts! (Which is a good thing for metal IMO) Also, the solo section from DeathFire Grasp is really fun to play.\n\n- Regarding the intro to \"Cygnus Rift\" - Its actually slap guitar played on an American Fat Strat tuned down a half step. I actually have tabs for that part! The rest is a bunch of metallic percussion and synthy stuff that I made.\n\n- Rock on! \\m/","replies":[{"poster":"Quoub","date":"2015-08-12T23:37:08.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You completely dodged the second question.

We all go through out favorite phases. As a composer you should be familiar with as many \"styles\" of music as possible. One day I'm listening to Prog Metal and then straight ahead jazz the next. I listen to a lot of film score and try to go to classical concerts. I also like a lot of weird dark ambient and industrial electronic stuff as well. I hate to classify music in to styles so overall we could just say - favorite style is \"good\" haha :P\n\n -Some of the funnest projects at Riot would be Pentakill and recently the Tahm Kench music. Outside of Rito - I had a lot of fun working on the old Guitar Hero stuff and of course my own weird music.\n\n- Funny that you mention Tahm Kench lyrics.

So at the start of the song, he's telling the listener \"You'll find all that you need [in the river].\" But by the end of the song, he's mocking them for taking his deal, and letting him in threatening to \"Drag you down the river.\"\n\nI could post what little I have, but like I said, I'm not great with music, and I some of the lines ended up sounding awkward to make them 'fit' with the tune.","replies":[{"poster":"ProtoShredanoid","date":"2015-08-12T21:49:10.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds cool!\n\nTry humming these lyrics with the Tahm Kench theme:\n\n\nHave you heard the tale of Ol' Tahm Kench?\nCome down to the river, and lay your troubles aside.\nThe waters flow\nooooooooo\nDeep into the night\n\n\nHave you heard the tale of Ol' Tahm Kench?\nHe'll give you absolution for a miniscule price.\nLet him in.\nooooooooo\n(And) Give your soul to the tides.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2015-08-12T20:11:13.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a Music of League Volume 1, will there be a Volume 2?

I mentioned something below, but personally I like to dwell on the character, get into his/her world and do my best to let the theme - whether it be the actual notes and harmony, instrumentation, sonic palette or all three - come to me, but it doesn't always happen that way. It also varies between the five of us composers here. Certain pieces are more of a team effort and others are more individual depending on the nature of the piece.\n\nRegarding writers block - of course composers have it as well! I don't know how others deal with it, but I'd recommend clearing your mind (especially of whatever you are trying to write) and do something completely different. Or take a break! A fresh mind can go a long way! I do have to say, composing, to me, is both a blessing and a curse. Since we can't always control when those creative juices are flowing, when they do occur and they are flowing, I drop everything that I am doing and the creativity becomes number one above everything else. If an idea comes at 4am, you have to wake up and sketch it out ect. While in that zone its easy to lose track of time and the world around you which, for me, makes balancing life and music kind of difficult....but totally worth!\n\nI hope I answered all of the questions!
