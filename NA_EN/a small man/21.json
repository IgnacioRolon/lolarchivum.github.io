I tried to imagine how isolating it would feel to be the only member of your species awake - especially for a creature who depends on interconnectedness. \n\nUltimately Skarner's voice brought me through the piece. I wanted to make him sound very non-human, but also highly emotional and sensitive, so I used the compound words (e.g. dreamsong, longsleep, deepdark, skywhite) to try and convey the feeling of what Skarner was going through. Kinda in the way that Skarner communicates with his fellow Brackern through song.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dinopawz","date":"2016-05-12T21:29:36.369+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"- When we started off the Shuriman champs, we chose ones that already excited us, so it was pretty easy to get into that headspace to write them. I loved the interplay between Xerath and Azir and how their story was a tragedy of pride and vaunted ambition. And what's sad is just how easily it could have been avoided if hubris and bitterness hadn't got the better of them. \n\n- Yeah, I think it's absolutely fine to have characters who aren't good. We need a broad spectrum of characters in our champ roster, so having a character who is unashamedly 'morally questionable' is sometimes necessary. And though she might not have a heart of gold, I don't think Sivir is a 'bad' person. She's been moulded by the life she led and did what she did to survive and her ruthlessness came out of what was neccessry to survive as a mercenary.\n\n- Taliyah's bio covers what it needs to to tell her story, and though Azir and rise of Shurima is certainly part of her story, it's not the meat and gravy of it. And as far as following up previously released stories, such tales will be told in time.\n\n- I think that's just a matter of personal taste. Each of us gravitates to different things in a champ, whether it's a redemption arc, a revenge story, a love story or whatever. So it was pretty easy for us to divide up the work. It was a very organic, natural process and there weren't any pistols at dawn to decide who wrote what. As far as working out the stories, we each share our work as we go and talk a lot about what themes we want to hit, so it all comes together nicely as a team effort.\n\n- I don't know about the others, but after Shurima I'm going to Harry Potter's Wizarding world...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-05-12T20:23:45.631+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"* Would Xerath explode if he didn't have sarcophagus?

Most of these ones I put down are gonna be related to Skarner I feel but we'll see!\n\n1. Skarner mentions \"thousand spins\" and \"three turns\" when referring to the passage of time, and it seems to give an indication of humans being around for a VASTLY shorter period of time than the Brackern, which I guess would make sense with them being almost elemental in origin they'd likely be one of the first organisms to appear in a world with as much magic as Runeterra. My question here is in relation to other species like darkin, targonians and humans, who've all been around on Runeterra for ages in some capacity, how ancient are the Brackern?\n\n2. Skarner tried to communicate with the thieves in the general Brackern way, but was unsuccessful, so two questions: firstly, is Skarner incapable of communicating like humans do or is it just difficult/not a thing he'd like to do, and secondly how does the Brackern's form of communication work? Is it almost like a telepathic link connecting the Brackern to each other and the earth or something different?\n\n3. When is \"Greed and Tears\" set? Because given the rumors and speculation in the lore about Amumu, I'm inclined to believe it's set a long, long time ago.\n\n4. Given the fact that the Rune Wars have been mentioned once again for the first time in YEARS, is there anything you guys can tell us about them? I imagine the specifics aren't up for discussion but are there any broad, sweeping things you could say about them? Like a general estimate as to how many there have been?\n\nAlright that'll be it for me at the moment. Thanks for doing these stories and, to the fellow who wrote Skarner's colour text; it's one of the best if not _the_ best of any I've read so far, so kudos to you on writing such an awesome piece!","replies":[{"poster":"Jellbug","date":"2016-05-12T20:41:53.652+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sharjo! \n\n1) You're right, the Brackern are VERY old. They've been around far longer than humans, and because of their long life they experience time in a very different way than most other beings. As to whether they're older or younger than other species, I'm not sure! \n\n2) Skarner certainly had trouble communicating with humans. The Brackern use their life stones to communicate telepathically by sending raw emotion, images, and thoughts into each others minds in a kind of melody. That's part of why Brackern without life stones cannot communicate as well with their species. Skarner has never spoken in any other way, so he doesn't understand the human tongue, at least not yet. By the end of \"Dreamsong\", he does learn to understand (and speak) their language of violence. \n\n3) I think \"Greed and Tears\" could have happened at almost any point in time. It depends what you believe what happened to Old Khaldun's arm :)\n\n4) The Rune Wars were absolutely catastrophic for Runeterra and many of its inhabitants (including the Brackern). I certainly hope to tell more stories about what exactly went down in the future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solash","date":"2016-05-12T20:31:41.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is it still up in the air as far as Amumu's race is concerned?","replies":[{"poster":"Rubinio","date":"2016-05-12T20:45:39.277+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes!
