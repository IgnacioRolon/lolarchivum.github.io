I'm gonna be that guy who posts all the questions about lore. Sorry, but I need more than \"Tahm takes people places and than eats their families later.\" I'm more interested in his backstory, since that really defines who he is. \n\n1. So, Tahm has been confirmed as a one-of-a-kind creature, but where does he come from? He obviously doesen't come from the spirit world, since he looks nothing like Bard, and does not have the motives of a Void creature. Is he a mutated creature, like Gromp? Or does he come from someplace new? I always thought that the Spirit World was like the Anti-Void, but maybe wherever Tahm  comes from is the anti-Spirit world.\n\n2. Why does Tahm feel the need to trick people? He could easily walk up to a village and eat everybody, since he obviously isin't threatened by most beings. He said that when he devoured the gambler's wife, it left him satisfied. Does he have some sort of physiological disorder? Supposedly he feeds on \"despair\", but i'm pretty sure anybody getting eaten by a giant monster will be in despair.\n\n3. Has Tahm ever had any run-in's with any current champions (or future ones), or is he just not connected to the rest of the lore? I feel like Kalista would try to go after him, since he certainly betrays a lot of people.\n\n4. Where did Tahm learn to talk?\n\n5. Tahm says that \"the world is one river, and i'm its king. Ain't no place i can't go, aint no place i cant go again.\" Is this true? I find it hard to believe that Tahm can go anywhere in Shurima. And how does that work anyways? Does he burrow through the ground? Not every lake, river, ocean, pool and oasis is connected, so either he burrows through the ground, or he teleports. Maybe there is a massive underground ocean that only he knows of?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2015-07-01T18:42:52.042+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":1,"body":"2.

Tahm knows many of the champs-- both as fellows and adversaries.   Certainly all of the Yordles have encountered him at various times.   \n\n4. You could say Tahm taught himself, but it was more evolutionary  than that.  He developed the ability as his prey did.  \n\n5.

One of my favorite things about LOL's champion roster is how diverse it's become. Mister Kench is a great example of a well-rounded and interesting character who would never be offered as playable in any other number of games. Seeing as this may be my only chance to ask them, I have a few burning questions that have been confusing me for the past week on the narrative side of things.\n\n1. Is Tahm Kench a supernatural being? I ask this for couple reasons. First, it's been confirmed that Tahm is a one-of-a-kind creature (a demon) and not part of a larger species. Secondly, his short bio on the PBE suggests that Tahm literally feeds on despair. What is a demon in the context of Runeterra?\n\n2. Where did Tahm come from? Did he cross over from another realm, like the voidborn? Was he wildlife now transformed beyond recognition, similar to Gromp? Did he simply exist since the beginning of time?\n\n3. In the River King video, Tahm makes a bargain with the gambler then comes to collect years later. Why does Tahm even need to make a Faustian deal in the first place instead of crashing any party whenever he wants? Is he bound by certain rules? Is that what he meant by being \"let in\"?\n\n4. Within the story, how did Tahm acquire his name. Did he name himself or did someone else?\n\n5. What exactly is Tahm's diet? Obviously, eating is a very central thematic to his character. In the video, he is shown feeding on treasure and people, but his lore entry suggests he only does this to create misery, Does Tahm actually eat to nourish and survive, does he only eat to state a gluttonous desire, or are his mouth and gullet simply means to sadistic ends?\n\n6. Would you say Tahm is more of a fish or amphibian, equally both, or neither?\n\n7. Where did Tahm learn all them fancy talkin' words?!","replies":[{"poster":"Bearded Mushroom","date":"2015-07-01T18:47:12.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Before I found out his name was Tahm, I was calling him Gum'Boe in my mind.  It makes me wonder if his proper void name is something like \"Tam'Kex\" and aiming to perfect his sociability (to lure folk) and/or the locals just changed his name to Tahm Kench to make it easier to pronounce.  \nI imagine like all void creatures he has always hungry, and probably made home in Valoran/Runeterra for the access to food.  Maybe he is more charismatic and social than other voidborn creatures and like other residence of Bilgewater because he is looking to enjoy the finer things in life without the oppression of hero's or the law.\n\nAs far as the gambler is concerned if it isn't TF himself I think the person has some kind of tie with TF.  When Tahm started to be leaked the TF artworked on the Riot website changed a bit, and his colored cards are now blank.  But if it's TF then it only begs more questions about Graves and his relationship to TF and being on the hunt.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2015-07-01T19:57:14.500+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tahm's not void.

We are not using the judeo christian meaning.  At this point all I can reveal is that it is an powerful, supernatural, being, with an agenda.   Foundations will be revealing more on them in the future.\n\n2.   His is tied to the foibles of mankind-- and his current form is especially tied to vices of Bilgewater.    This is not to say he has feed on things before man-- only that he existed differently before we provided him with sustenance.  \n\n3.  Yes.  Traditionally there are always rules with demons and devils.  The gambler is making a bargain (ultimately with himself).  It is the bargain that allows Tahm to create the human misery he feeds on.\n\n4.  Tahm Kench is the name commonly given this spirit in Bilgewater.     The real question is what is the gambler's name.\n\n5.   yep.   you pretty much got it.\n\n6.  This is an art question.  We wanted him to be unique.  Both in lore and visuals.
