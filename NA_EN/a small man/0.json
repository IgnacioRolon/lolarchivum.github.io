How much time is spent in meetings, coding, free time, etc.\n\nThe next few questions involve workplace logistics, brutal honesty appreciated if that is allowed/safe for you to do so. Of all these questions I think these few are the most important:\n\n* What is the office environment like, such as dress code, attitude towards time off, and respect of work-life balance?\n* What were you being paid as an intern, and how much do the entry-level full-time employees make?\n* What are they making after a year of employment?\n* How much of an influence do corporate decisions have at the office scale (is it laid back or is it a more professional setting)?\n* How is the gender ratio at your location specifically?\n* Could you realistically go up to your boss (or your boss’s boss’s boss!) to have any concerns addressed, or is there a hierarchy of communication flow?\n\nThank you very much for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Mijumaru","date":"2015-08-10T20:17:27.319+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"* The office environment is extremely casual - I dress however I want every day (and honestly sometimes I feel overdressed!!)\n* For research, the gender ratio is actually pretty even!\n* You can set up meetings with anyone in the company, the issue is honestly more whether they have time on their schedules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cautomaton","date":"2015-08-10T20:59:06.135+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm an engineering manager at Riot who has an intern working on my team. (I'm cheating, but I really like answering these questions).\n\n_What software development methodologies does Riot adhere to (Agile, waterfall, etc)? Were you working on a team or were you largely quarantined from this process?_\n\nIndividual teams get to choose their own process; however, most teams follow some sort of Agile approach such as Scrum or Kanban. Interns work directly on a team as a core contributor. Generally, teams at Riot are cross-functional and fairly independent (i.e.- they should have all the resources needed to independently be successful).\n\n_Did any of your code get pushed to a live environment or were your projects handled separately from the main source code? Either way, would you care to elaborate on any of them?_\n\nThe intern on our team has worked on live systems. Most development at Riot should be continuously integrated on the main branch, using other branches only when necessary. All code should go through a code review process too. Internship work would be no different.\n\n_Could you walk me through a typical work day for you?_\n\nThis will vary a lot depending on team and office location. For most LAX engineers, the answer looks like this:\n\nFlexible hours, but please be in the office between 10-5. Some try to beat the traffic and get in super early, most others try to wait it out and stay later. Teams sit together in an open office environment. You'll get in, get a snack and get started. Lots of us wear headphones. You'll have a 15-20 minute daily standup meeting. Hopefully no other meetings during the day, but for some folks, you'll have several more. I personally really try to keep meetings off my team's calendar. Every other week, you'll spend a few hours in a sprint retro and planning session. You may also attend \"community of practice\" meetings for continuous learning. You'll hopefully have time for a game of LoL each day with your team.\n\nThere's an older answer from one of our St. Louis engineers [here](http://www.riotgames.com/articles/20120917/265/day-life-stl-software-engineer).\n\n_What is the office environment like, such as dress code, attitude towards time off, and respect of work-life balance?_\n\nCasual dress code. For interns, limited PTO but for full-time employees you have \"unlimited\" PTO. Mostly that means use as much as you need. As a manager, I'm typically on the look out to find those who have _not_ taken time off and encouraging them to take a one or two week vacation. Work life balance is possible, but, it's your responsibility. Riot gives employees a large amount of freedom but with that comes personal responsibility. You have to learn how to say \"no\" to commitments and as a manager, I expect to hear \"no\" from my team members from time to time.\n\n_What were you being paid..._\n\nCheck out [glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Riot-Games-Reviews-E247538.htm) for some sense of salaries. I can assure you these are not completely accurate, but that's the best info you can get.\n\n_How much of an influence do corporate decisions have at the office scale_\n\nI'm not quite sure what this means. As far as decision making goes: Riot is not like Valve in which anyone can work on anything. We have leadership in place to determine priorities. However, individual teams have a lot of autonomy in deciding _how_ they'll accomplish a mission. \n\n_How is the gender ratio at your location specifically?_\n\nI'm on a team of 6 of which one is a woman. Honestly, the tech industry as a whole needs to do better in this regard and we actively discuss this issue within Riot.\n\n_Could you realistically go up to your boss (or your boss’s boss’s boss!) to have any concerns addressed, or is there a hierarchy of communication flow?_\n\nI feel I can reasonably go to my boss to have concerns addressed. If I felt I couldn't, there are methods for me to communicate up the \"chain\" to to speak, though we'd want to debug why there are issues with me and my mentor. I would hope that any of my team members could come to me at any time.\n\nFor more info, check out my other advice [on becoming a programmer](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/becoming-programmer-j-aaron-farr).","replies":[]},{"poster":"IIniquus","date":"2015-08-10T20:32:10.640+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a software engineering intern...but I'm a former software engineer and am on an engineering team :)\n\n1. I'm Iniquus, MBA at Carnegie Mellon and I'm at LAX.\n2. We follow mostly agile, some teams focus on specific ceremonies more than others.\n3. I'll leave this to someone else to answer\n4. There's always room for improvement, but Riot is super feedback driven and we've adapted throughout the program. Riot is asking this exact same question too :)\n5. I'm more on the production side of things, so I have more meetings than average. I'll let one of the engineers answer this more in depth, but I can say you have a lot of flexibility about how you spend your day (with games fit into your day of course).\n\nLogistics\n\n* Dress code is whatever. Please wear clothes. Time off is well respected and encouraged. Work-life balance is good, but you have to set those lines for yourself. It's easy to switch between playing games and working and you need to be able to know what is appropriate for yourself.\n* It's not the most exciting answer, but compensation is competitive.\n* Decisions are made throughout the organization and you really do have a lot of agency in those decisions. Overall, Riot is pretty laid back.\n* 20% female I think\n* Yup, without a doubt. I've reached out to a ton of people at all levels and they were willing to give me some time. We also had two intern AMAs with Marc and Brandon.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Photronic","date":"2015-08-10T20:40:08.064+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, I’m an engineering sophomore working in the LA office. I work on the monitoring pipeline for a lot of Riot’s backend services. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can!\n\nRiot is mostly agile. All the engineering teams I interact with have sprints and stuff.  I feel like I make a lot of contributions within my team and we also work together on a lot of tasks.\nYeah, some of the stuff I work on is on live right now. It’s a pretty cool feeling knowing that other people are interacting with it! I submit a PR to the repo I’m working on, it gets reviewed, merged and eventually deployed.\n\nUh my day-to-day usually varies but this is how it really goes:\n11AM – arrive to work and start looking through emails\n11:30 – I have my standup\n12:00 – Usually I grab lunch around this time\n1:00 – head back and start looking through what I want to do for the day\nUsually from here till like 8pm I’m coding with frequent breaks. There’s also a few meetings depending on the day and a game of league in the middle helps a lot as well. \n\nThe office environment is super lax. Dress code is really casual; most people just wear jeans and hoodies and like the atmosphere is pretty chill. Everyone’s really cool about time off. You just ask and that’s about it. Riot’s extremely flat and that helps make everyone really approachable. Sometimes you’re just chatting with a guy about your favorite champion and you find out he’s like this super OG. It’s pretty cool! Because it's flat, if I have any concerns, I usually just turn to the side and just tell my boss. There isn’t really a hierarchy. You kind of just talk to whoever can help address your concerns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReversePolarity","date":"2015-08-10T21:05:26.543+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm Richard, and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. It's great to meet you! I'm a software engineering intern working out of Los Angeles. I'll try to answer all your questions as well as I can.\n\nDifferent teams at Riot use different methodologies, but generally \"waterfall\" is a pretty dirty word these days. My team uses fairly vanilla Agile, with set sprints, milestones and goals.\n\nI work directly on a project team (the client update), so I work on the \"live\" code directly (obviously it's hasn't gone live yet). Some of the interns got their own projects that are separate from a larger team, but all of us write useful code for meaningful projects.\n\nI'm asked for my feedback on everything all the time, including about the internship program. It's been a pretty awesome summer, and I don't have any major issues to raise. However, my application process wasn't the most clear (definitely will give that feedback), and the team I was joining got sorta switched on me a month before I joined. It all worked out really nicely though -- I like my job a lot!\n\nI arrive for daily standup at 10:30 and then I typically check my emails, resolve issues and maybe code a bit before heading to lunch around noon. I get most of my work done in the afternoon which usually fairly free of meetings. Around 5pm there is another slot for meetings. Around 7, I'll take dinner, and then sometimes I'll finish a few things up for a bit after.\n\nNo dress code. Well I think we're expected to wear _something_ -- I haven't really tested that theory though. Time off is fairly liberal and depends on the team, but since interns are paid hourly, I would probably have to make up the hours for a day off on some other date. Holidays and company events are paid though. I was asked to never work on a weekend, because my manager wanted me to enjoy my summer. This is only my personal experience though -- being a fairly large company, YMMV.\n\nMy salary was fairly competitive for software engineering internship positions based in California. Comparable to companies beginning with letters such as \"A\" \"F\" or \"G\". I don't know what new grad engineers make personally, but [glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Riot-Games-Associate-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E247538_D_KO11,38.htm) says $91k on average, plus additional compensation (stock).\n\nThe environment isn't what I would call \"corporate\". Gender ratio on my team is 25 female/75 male. \n\nIf I had an issue about anything (including: game design decisions, R&D, champion ideas, management issues, personal issues, etc.) there's someone always there I could ask and discuss with. I'm personally very open with my manager and our team's technical leadership, and if I needed to, I could go up to my boss' boss' boss if I wanted.\n\nHope this answers your questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kyrrie","date":"2015-08-10T20:41:02.660+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) I study computer science at UC Berkeley, I'm going to be a senior next year, and I work in the LA office =)\nI work on the stack team; we're responsible for transitioning Riot's backend from a monolithic to a microservice oriented architecture so we scale better to the late game >=D\n2) The majority of Riot adheres to agile methodologies. I'd say most interns are very well integrated with their teams. Personally I felt like I was an integral member of my team, and we worked well together.\n3) Absolutely! I was essentially a fully functional member of my team and worked in the same repositories as other team members. My contributions were pushed to live as soon as it passed code reviews and QA tests.\n4) Feedback culture is really strong at Riot. We set up meetings specifically for us to give feedback to the internship program and also receive feedback for how we could improve.\n5) I wake up at ~9 then get coffee and attend standup. Afterwards I usually meet with some of my team members about specific tickets we're working on. Afterwards I might code a bit then go to lunch. Finally my team has core hours 1-5pm where we try to get the majority of our work done. I usually end up going home at ~6\n\nI'll answer the workplace questions in line\n-What is the office environment like, such as dress code, attitude towards time off, and respect of work-life balance?\n\nThe office environment is very casual just like many other tech companies. I usually wear like jeans + random t-shirt to work every day. Riot offers unlimited PTO to its employees. I'd say generally people are very understanding about PTO, and no one really abuses it. \n\n-What were you being paid as an intern, and how much do the entry-level full-time employees make?\n\nYou can check glassdoor for a sample of salaries at Riot. I'd say Riot's compensation is very competitive compared to other tech companies in silicon valley/ silicon beach. I looked at some other companies like salesforce and twitter, and Riot's compensation was competitive.\n\n-What are they making after a year of employment?\n\nI don't have too much visibility into this, but glassdoor would probably be your best bet =P\n\n-How much of an influence do corporate decisions have at the office scale (is it laid back or is it a more professional setting)?\n\nI'd say it's pretty laid back, again, similar to most other tech companies.\n\n-How is the gender ratio at your location specifically?\n\nRiot's gender ratio is ~80/20. The ratio is pretty good in engineering compared to most other tech companies.\n\n-Could you realistically go up to your boss (or your boss’s boss’s boss!) to have any concerns addressed, or is there a hierarchy of communication flow?\n\nAbsolutely! Riot is very flat, and you're encouraged to go up to people to talk about your concerns and feedback.\n\nI apologize if any of my answers are vague.

Riot looks for fit and skill in your craft, so be yourself and be well prepared. I actually knew what my project would be when I accepted the offer and that hasn't changed since I arrived. I've taken on some extra projects by choice since they relate to a topic that interests me. \n\nYou're given a lot of freedom in choosing your work - Riot is a very self-directed environment. If you know what you want to do, you can find a way to do it.\n\nMy work is internal to the Insights team, so you won't see specifics, but it is being used!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HoodriiicH","date":"2015-08-10T20:03:10.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How likely did you all think it would be to get the position?

I myself am a software development intern and would love to hear about your experiences working with Riot. I understand that you may not be able to answer all my questions so feel free to cherry pick. I apologize for the poor format, but I've tacked on follow up questions to kind of help guide what I'm trying to get at.\n\nCould you describe your role and the responsibilities that come with it? \n\nHow are new ideas or opinions encouraged at Riot? Are suggestions normally implemented? Are employees empowered to make impactful decisions? \n\nWhat is a normal working day like at Riot? I assume this varies per field, so I’m more interested in the Data Science/Engineering oriented schedule, but if the other fields don’t mind to chip in please do so. I’m sure everyone would like to know, myself included. \n\nPart of the reason why you make a company fun, is to obviously keep the employees there and keep them working too. Can you describe to me your work life balance as an intern, and also those of the full-time employees? Tell me about the ‘crunch time’ pressure that releases/patches/events apply on employees and how are they compensated? How prevalent is burnout at Riot?\n\nIs Riot’s long term plans communicated to the rest of the company? If yes, what are they? Has Riot analyzed how sustainable their competitive advantage is over time? \n\nFor Data Science/Engineering, can you describe the development environment (variation of agile development?)? Could you describe the state of the code base? What are the technology stacks used? Is development open migrating to different tools/technology? How much technical debt is there? What are the current major bottlenecks in the workflow? How is QA/testing done at Riot? How do software/development/data teams set deadlines, and what happens if (when?) it becomes clear they won't be met? \n\nThe tech industry veterans that I know describe game development as a very difficult to work in sector of tech. It’s like a movie, there’s an immense amount of resources that go into it, it could very easily flop, and it is very unforgiving. As having experienced what its like in a gaming company, care to comment on this observation? Thankfully for Riot, they’re doing pretty well, but still have felt that unforgivingness from the community. Does it create pressure? If yes, can you describe the nature of the pressure? Would you say it has a considerable effect on how decisions are made at Riot?","replies":[]}]}
