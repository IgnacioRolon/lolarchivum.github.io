[COMPLETE]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":22,"down_votes":6,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/oU1ol2p.jpg\n\n_Welcome to the latest installment of Between Two Turrets, a new Q&amp;A series from the NA Community team in which we'll connect you with various Rioters to chat about League, life, and anything in between. You can expect an installment every couple weeks or so, with Rioters from all over jumping in to spend some time with you on the boards._\n\n_This week, we've got visual designer and classical vocalist (that's her in the Diana login music) **Saiyaka**!_\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT - Alright I'm heading back to work guys, thanks for all the questions! I'll try to check back over the next couple days in case any of you have more questions.**\n\nHi there! I’m Lisa and I’m a Visual Designer. Sometimes I sing, make funny voices and always fail at beatboxing.\n\nI’m a classically trained vocalist, and from time to time have the opportunity to work with the music team on a number of League of Legends pieces like Diana’s theme - Daylight’s End, Orb of Winter from the Pentakill album, The Freljord theme and one of my favorites - Demacia Rising. \n\nAs a visual designer, I work on layout, composition and building style guides for the web experiences of everything from the Urfitational to more serious events like Shurima. \n\nMy favorite champ is Vayne. I’m currently playing Final Fantasy XIV - Hyperion server :3 I love classical music and good web design. I’m always looking for new music for my daily commute, playing League or just to listen, so send me your favorites~\n\nI keep up with a small [music blog](http://www.boldlyclassic.com/#classic-magazine) and post some of my League and non-League related music projects up on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2hlzaTkdHTD9XxcZWdTpEw). Looking forward to chatting about design, travel or random music recommendations!\n\nLisa, “Saiyaka”","replies":[{"poster":"BulbousBouffant","date":"2015-07-15T22:22:11.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you were to create a  band what 4 member would you have in it, concluding that you were the main singer? {{champion:67}} {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Saiyaka","date":"2015-07-15T22:41:44.572+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm...

There were a lot really new and interesting things we tried and a lot of really great opportunities to stress out the web developer I worked with. \n\nAs far as challenges, I'm in a little known ranked team, by the name of Teenage Mutant Ninja Tabi. We've recently entered Bronze 1 - A team best. Everyday is a challenge. However, the biggest challenge is having to explain why the name is just HILARIOUS. I mean... come on... It's like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it's Ninja Tabi, which is an item in the game - a premium play on words.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Geo","date":"2015-07-15T20:44:02.131+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ooooh bronze one!
