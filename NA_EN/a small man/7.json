Thanks for all the questions and we hope you guys enjoy Bard!**\n\nHey guys,\n\nWe've gathered a bunch of Rioters from the Bard team for some Q&A about the Wandering Caretaker himself. Whether you're interested in Bard's gameplay, story, art, or sound, ask away and we'll be happy to answer!\n\nHere are some links in case you need to get up to speed:\n\n[The Wonder Above](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/champion-preview/wonder-above)\n[Bard, the Wandering Caretaker, revealed](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/champion-reveal/bard-wandering-caretaker)\n[Bard: Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX8iSobsKTY&feature=youtu.be)","replies":[{"poster":"KriIIin","date":"2015-03-06T19:27:12.094+0000","up_votes":219,"down_votes":5,"body":"My biggest question is whether the moonstone in Nami's lore is the same stone that was taken by Bard. There are a good number of signs pointing to the possibility\n\n* The moonstone is \"a powerful object found only in the towering reaches of the surface world\", the highest places on the surfaces tend to be mountains like the one Bard took the stone to. Those mountains seem to be the highest in Runterra as well.\n\n* The fact that they use its light to \"ward off the terrors of the depths\". One would assume that this light could be the pulse the elder used to kill his pursuer in the video. \n\n* With Soraka and Bard being tied closely to the stars it's not  a stretch to assume they have ties to other celestial bodies like moons\n\n* Having an enemy pursuing the stone could explain the reason no-one brought the stone to the mystical cave\n\n* The line \"We'll die without it\" could refer to the potential threat that not obtaining the moonstone and abyssal pearl from one another could pose for both the Marai and the Ionian people, or Runeterra as a whole\n\n* I'd like to also finish this with a symbol I noticed on Nami's staff that bares a slight resemblance to another newly shown crest.

I'd also ask, as a follow-up, whether this \"celestial-ness\" has any connection to, say, Demacian holy magic, or **[Shuriman \"cosmic\" power](http://leaguefactions.net/12-secrets-of-shurima/)** such as the type wielded by Xerath. Kind of trying to get a sense of Runeterra's cosmology.\n\n**EDIT: And below, Jaredan provides an enlightening explanation. Thank you! That definitely helps address the issue I rant about in the remainder of this post.**\n\nAs an aside, one major critique I have of Runeterra after the Great Retcon is how extremely disjointed it is. I remember laughing at Elise's login screen monologue: \"The Shadow Isles: some say they don't exist!\" Um, Elise, who says the Shadow Isles **don't exist?** Anyone who watches a League match knows the Isles exist. There's a Field of Justice in the Shadow Isles. Pretty sure people know that the Isles exist, however spooky or mysterious they may be. Then came the Great Retcon, and I understood why she'd say that.\n\nBut I have to say, I deeply dislike the idea of a world made up of Champions and factions off in their own miserable little corners, ignorant of one another's existence, and without any reason to interact. I mean, do Demacians even know Ionia exists? (I imagine the answer is an unsatisfying, \"Some tell tales of a mysterious land of magic and mystery!\") Do Demacia and Piltover trade with each other? (Likely answer: \"Perhaps sometimes adventurous merchants travel between them, but for the most part they're much too wary of each other to have regular trade.\") When Bilgewater, the premier maritime city-state, was attacked by zombies for the millionth time, why didn't anybody do anything? (Anticipated answer: \"They don't know it exists!\"/\"They might just be stories.\"/\"Nobody cares about Bilgewater.\"/\"They're too busy with their own problems to help anyone.\") It's a very stark contrast to the League of Legends universe that actually contains a League of Legends, and has a \"fantasy Babylon 5\" thing going, with factions and Champions having frequent cause to deal with one another.\n\nAll in all, it feels like a universe where Champions, well, have approximate knowledge of many things.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-03-06T19:46:36.839+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":3,"body":"Bard traverses all planes that can intersect with Runeterra, so he is certainly linked to that degree, but he's not restricted only to Soraka's plane of origin.\n\nRuneterran magic has many different aspects, origins, and foci. Bard exists and journeys across many realms and planes, which is the difference in his concept of \"celestial\" as compared to the specific focus of each of your examples. It certainly makes sense to see things like Shurima's sun-disk as an attempt to tap into one part of a celestial power.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Syllin","date":"2015-03-06T18:50:39.181+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"about how long ago were the events that occured in the Bard: Mountain video. his teaser implied that his constellation was created \"Not long ago.\" so like 40 years? 100 years?","replies":[{"poster":"Loping Cinder","date":"2015-03-06T19:48:50.178+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":1,"body":"WIthin a Runeterran lifespan—the child being carried out of the flames of the conflict in Ionia in the animated trailer grows up to become the old storyteller in the Wanderer Above web teaser.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Draconomial","date":"2015-03-06T19:03:16.250+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's Bard's favorite style of coffee?

Honestly, his character design is so mystical and great plus the mask is just so beautifully simple. I've never cosplayed before but I think if I start I'd make a Bard costume; I have ideas already jotted down for what I'd do but all I need is money, time, and people to go to a convention with me :P.\n\nAnyways, I have a few questions regarding Bard and hopefully they aren't too difficult to answer so here we go :D\n\n1. Could you give us anything on why Bard's face is carved into the rocks of Summoner's Rift? Are they created by Bard as a way of going 'Bard wuz here', are they carved by people who believe in Bard and use them as shrines, do they have to do with the new lore and why champions fight on top of a mountain for no reason, or was it just a teaser and they're being removed soon? If they aren't being removed and become cannon there must be a reason behind them.\n\n2. Can we get official word on what it would be like to hug Bard? He seems to be very blimp like in his movements so I'd imagine he'd be squishy like Baymax :P.\n\n3. Can Bard be understood? I know that we as retconned summoners can't understand him but if Bard needed to could he speak to someone in a way they would know what he was saying? \n\n4. Is there any reason Bard doesn't have an in game emote or idle animation where he plays his horn like in the new cinematic? Seems like it would be a cool thing for him.\n\nThis last question is for someone else who can't be here for the Q&A. Mostly his/her words but I edited a little to get rid of extra fluff: \n\n5 . \"Bard sounds like a very boring main character: He pops in, does something and pops out. Nothing will ever go wrong for Bard without being unstoppable, because if it is stoppable Bard already stopped it. He is basically omnipotent? What kind of stories is Riot expecting to tell that are interesting with Bard if he seems to be omnipotent?\"\n\nSuper greatful for you guys taking the time to answer our questions and I can't wait to play Bard.

Officially: it's like falling into a pile of puppies (no puppies were harmed during this hugging experience).\n\n3. He can be understood. If Bard \"spoke\" directly to you, you would grok his meaning.\n\n4. His Ult animation was inspired by the cinematic, but the in-game to out of game representations aren't necessarily 1-to-1.\n\n5. Bard is not omnipotent, as a spirit he can be banished, powerful magics could potentially imprison him, and a force of equal power could possibly end him.\n\nThank you so much for the questions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blip120","date":"2015-03-06T19:04:58.323+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking deep into the character I get the feeling of a caring guardian, who's existence is too look after the ancient powers of this world (Maybe look after Nexuses?

Did you design the deep personality of Bard to be this contrasting way?

Knockbacks that are \"long enough\" will work normally. Knockups or short knockbacks will \"pop you out\" of terrain like you said. In 5.6, it should pop you out a little more nicely, assuming I can get it working bug-free :)\n\n> - if they die during travel, do their corpse stay stuck in the terrain?\n\nIf you die, your corpse is in terrain - seemed like the least surprising thing to do. If you go into a \"Zombie\" state (Kog, Karthus, Sion, Yorick) you actually complete the Journey and pop out the other side in zombie form. Zyra's special, in that she gets popped out to the nearest out-of-terrain spot in order to turn into her flower. Gotta put down roots, after all.\n\n> - if they are/get slowed do they travel slower in the tunel?\n\nNah, it's treated more like a dash than walking.\n\n> - if there is an annivia wall blocking the exit, do people stay stuck in \"buble form\" unable  not only to move, but to cast too?\n\nI'm *pretty* sure it will find a place to put you, either stuck between Anivia wall and the terrain, or otherwise popped out on the far side of the Anivia wall. You might be stuck in place, but you'd be able to cast. \n\n\n\nBy the way, it seems like you could have a future in QA :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LANWhale","date":"2015-03-06T19:14:19.277+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"**What are Meeps? \n**\n\n-We know they are some sort of spiritual beings* but what exactly are they?* \n-Why are they with Bard? \n-What do they do? \n-And why are they named Meeps? \n-Are they named that from the people who saw them?

The chimes you collect feel all the sweeter when there's some you can't get to, and when you DO manage to get the towerdive kill and grab that #!@* chime on the way out, it feels even better. \n\nThat's part of the reason chimes are frequent, small power - I can afford to have the spawner put them someplace weird or inaccessible occasionally, since it will even out over the course of the game out of sheer numbers. I call this design technique \"cheating\" >_>\n\n---\n\n**Pro play**\n\nI'm very interested to see what pros do with him. He's the kind of character that I put these tools on without a full idea of what the possibilities are, just that he can do crazy things. It's possible that in his current state, pros won't be able to find a use for him - I'm making some guesses at how things will play out, and if they turn out differently we can apply nerfs and buffs accordingly :)\n\nMy theory on it is that the teams will have to find a way to take pressure off their ADC (killing at level 2, shoving wave, early jungle ganks) in order to \"unlock\" Bard from having to stay there. From there, I think Bard scales really hard with teamwork, so I think they'll be able to figure out all sorts of strategies from there.\n\n---\n\n**Previous kits**\n\nHmmmmm... a few of the abilities I tried were super cool but not good fits for Bard, so I think I'll keep those a secret for now (they're up for grabs for other designers, too - we have a very collaborative process).\n\nEarly on, when I was just looking for an in-lane hook, I tried out Bard as \"a support for assassin players.\" He was a close-range trickster, with a stealth that he had to channel (like Recall) to enter, a directional knockback, stuff like that. He would clear the ward from his lane brush, and then zone the enemy team. The idea was that if you ever lost sight of the guy, he was just *gone*. The kit had a BUNCH of gameplay problems (it was my first stab at a kit) and also ended up fitting Bard's thematic and character pretty poorly, so it got scrapped. \n\n---\n\n**Good ADCs for Bard**\n\nThe ones you mention are good for the reasons you mention (Cait/Corki/Ez, for safety). I've also seen a very successful Sivir/Bard lane, since she can shove the lane so hard that the enemies can't get any pressure on her. Also, strangely, Kalista/Bard has seen some success internally - you don't make much use of her W passive, but her scouts, mobility, and shoving power keep her fairly safe, and her ult can pull back Bard from a mid-length roam very quickly. \n\nEdit: Aaaaaalso, I'm really curious if it will turn out that Bard+is a good lane. Bard/Velkoz or Bard/Cass might be a thing... gotta get that sweet sweet solo lane XP, after all. \n\n--- \n\nThanks! You ask interesting questions, so I'm happy to answer them. \n\n(Also, you were lucky enough to post right after he released on PBE - I got buried in bugfixes soon after, so to anybody who felt neglected on the PBE forums: I'm sorry!

I was the principle concept artist on Bard. Bard actually began quite a ways back when I was an intern here at Riot. I began pitching the early incarnations of what would become Bard in the summer of 2013 with the hopes of creating a champion from the folklore of our world. We thought about applying him to a single faction but ultimately decided he would be best served as a character that would exist in lore throughout Runeterra.\n\nOver time he did go through a number of iterations but he actually \"took shape\" visually fairly early on (with of course the support of the other artists). In terms of his lore/personality, he really took shape with the work of Loping Cinder and the design contributions of Rabid Llama.","replies":[]}]}]}
