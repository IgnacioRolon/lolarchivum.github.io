I would like someone to ask me what skin I'd like to see for a champ.  Anyone?  I promise the answer is both ambitious and controversial! \n\n2.  I am currently assigned to 2.5 teams at Riot.  The 0.5 is because I'm working on something for Foundations in my spare time.  Believe me though, if someone ever says that working on two teams at once is stress free - they're telling porky pies.  That situation shouldn't last much longer though, whew.  I am also dabbling with writing lines for one new champ and one reworked champ - but that's not a big demand on my time.  I've also asked if I can get source control access to League so I can learn how map mods (like Bilgewater Brawlers) are made.  Not because I think I'll be able to make a shippable one, but because I want to know what's involved.  Also, in my spare time I'm working on a light gun game for funzies.  I'll probably never finish it though!\n\n3. Aaah.  The Lollipoppining.  I have seen the scribbles of mad men in the internal art sharing page and I have to say... none will be spared.  Their minds were lost in her presence, her madness contagious and her grimace terrible.

It'd have to be a super fancy, lots-of-work skin, but I'd like to see Lucian's kit on a Senna model.  New VO, new animations, new mesh, the lot.  Basically, an alternate universe skin where Lucian was captured by Thresh, and Senna is on the vengeance war path.  I think that'd be cool.\n\nNot sure if there's a fan concept out there, but I imagine there could be.

It's waaaaay too quiet over on the red side of the equation.  However, I understand that a) a lot of Rioters are craaaazy busy, and b) many Rioters are craaaaazy terrified of saying the wrong thing.  \n\nI think the only way to solve that is to get more Rioters talking so they can get over their fears (exposure therapy?) but that's a viscous circle.  Despite being as old as the dinosaurs (almost - chickens are dinosaurs, right?) I am all kinds of excited by the opportunities that the new hyperconnected relationship between players and developers affords and I'd love to see us experiment with new ways of expressing that relationship.  Them's fancy words for saying \"Why do we have to do this the old way?  Maybe there are new ways of working WITH players?!\"\n\nBut that's a super hard, super scary, potentially disastrous experiment to do.

Level design, at it's most abstract, is where the rubber hits the road in game design.  Systems designers might make the fancy combat systems or game mechanics that underlie the rest of the game, but if the level designer doesn't create just the right challenges and environments to show those systems off, then the game will never shine!  Also, my personal interest is in crafting experiences for players - whether that's a story they experience, or an emotion they feel, or a relationship with another player.  People are a hard problem - a really exciting challenge!\n\n2. I main Sona, normally, but I've been playing a lot of Thresh and Nautilus recently.  Only Astronautilus though - because that skin is super amazing and I was on a total The Martian obsession.\n\n3. Ah ha!  Trick question as my bf is also a Rioter!  So it has to be him.

Woo! :D  Gratz rl ding, etc.\n\n1.  This isn't a question!  But thanks :)\n2.  I think I love 12 the most.  He's grumpy, old, Scottish and ascerbic.  I did love 7, 8 (yep, from the movie), 9 and 10 though.  And 4.  Hrm.\n3.  Probably best known for working on Bioshock Infinite before coming to Riot.  I also worked on 'cult classic' 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand.  Not as bad as it could have been!\n4.  Favorite thing I've worked on!?  Oh cripes.  I love them all and I hate them all.  Love them, because they were all part of my life and you pour yourself into them.  Hate them because you always want them to be better.  But you put it aside and make sure the next thing is even better :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AthenasVendetta","date":"2015-11-04T21:31:37.638+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Bioluminescence \n\nConsidering the massive story and bio rework in progress...

Just because I happen to speak English and live in the USA, doesn't mean that my perspective has ANY relevance to the majority of players, all over the world.\n\n2. I try to avoid being precious.  If, when you're thinking about a design of yours, you find yourself thinking \"I hope they don't ask me about that bit...\" then STOP!  You have a flaw in your design and you need to buck up and address it - before someone else does.  It's all too easy to sweep it under the rug and hope it'll go away.  It won't.  Abandon the design if you have to - just don't leave it with a weakness.\n\n3. Uh...  Stories.  Hrm.  I love a good Heroes Journey, but for the sake of silliness, I'll say that I have a terrible weakness for the slightly trashy fantasy novel series, Magic's Pawn.  It's not big - it's not clever - but when I was a teen those books made me CRY.  Ugh, even looking at the spine of the books would set me off.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A1ways 4ward","date":"2015-11-04T22:22:06.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragonmaster Swain Please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-04T21:10:14.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bio, fancy meeting you here!

What is your favorite pizza? Both toppings and crust.\n\n1.  Depending on the studio, a level designer can be anything from a scripter-programmer who writes code to trigger all the gameplay stuffs in a game, aaaaall the way on the other end of the spectrum where a level designer might be an environment artist responsible for creating the playable spaces that a player moves through.  And everything in between.  In my previous jobs, I've generally trended towards grey-boxing environments for gameplay purposes, creating puzzles and fights in those spaces, and creating any story telling that goes on in the spaces.  Varies from place to place though!\n\n2. Generally I'll enjoy ham and mushroom, but after recently having some overly meaty meat feast pizzas, I think I'd be happy with a mushroom/onion/olive one as a lighter contrast.","replies":[]}]}]}
