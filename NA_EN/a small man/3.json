We'll be discussing our major takeaways and next steps, and get back to you soon as we continue the series of discussion threads for the upcoming Boards updates.**\n\n------\n\nHey guys,\n\nWe&rsquo;re back after our [initial post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/Ep4t0zPw-lets-talk-about-the-boards) about where the NA Boards are and where they&rsquo;re going - highly recommend you give it and the comments a read (assuming you haven&rsquo;t already) if you&rsquo;d like to have all the background on today&rsquo;s discussion.\n\nToday, we&rsquo;d like to chat with you guys about the **Boards&rsquo; organization** and our thoughts (as well as yours) on improvements. Just to make sure we&rsquo;re all on the same page, **we are going to be making changes to the current sub-boards** (more on that below) - where we need your feedback is on what those changes should look like.\n\n**A gaggle of sub-boards**\n\nThe NA Boards currently have a bit of an imbalance between a few heavyweight communities and a significant majority of slow to extremely slow sub-boards. This is one of the main issues causing the Boards front page to often appear stagnant, and we&rsquo;ve been meaning for some time to do a bit of consolidation. At the same time, we recognize the value even the smallest board communities can bring to the community-at-large. \n\nSo what do? We could just delete a bunch of the slowest sub-boards and roll them into the rest. That would certainly consolidate things a bit, but would potentially leave some topics without a home and at the very least increase murkiness around where topics should be discussed. Identifying the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; topical board can already a challenge, even for us - look at how often we post official threads in &lsquo;Miscellaneous.&rsquo;\n\nWith all this in mind, we&rsquo;re convinced that there&rsquo;s a more elegant way to provide clear homes for the rich variety of League discussions while at the same time streamlining the Boards experience. Broadly, we&rsquo;d like to reorganize the individual sub-boards based on **use case** rather than **subject matter**.\n\n**Wait...what the hell does that mean?**\n\nWhile subject-matter grouping is obviously super common in online forums (which is why we started with it), on Boards we&#039;ve noticed some issues. As I mentioned, it overly isolates conversations into a bunch of often secluded boards, and in a lot of cases prevents pretty cool content from ever being shown to the majority of players. Subject-matter based boards can also lead to one particular board (and thus topic) dominating overall discussion within the community-at-large (as I work on this post, Gameplay & Balance occupies 9 out of the top 10 threads). Finally, subject matter defines the use of a board absolutely, leaving very little wiggle room on how far you can explore and meander among League topics that are often fluid and wide-ranging.\n\nUse-case, as we&rsquo;re envisioning it, opens up organization into a question of &ldquo;why am I visiting this particular sub-board?&rdquo; What you&rsquo;re actually using the sub-board **for** would be more important than making sure every conversation about X falls in exactly the same place.  \n\nSo, we theorycrafted it a bit and thought about how to minimize the raw number of sub-boards while still covering the same ground as they currently do. Our considerations included both obvious factors (volume /quality of posts, tone of community) and some less-apparent details (potential for connecting players). As a side-goal, we also sought to winnow down some of the current Boards fragmentation (GD being off its own, a couple unlisted sub-boards at times).\n\nHere&rsquo;s what we came up with (titles are for explanatory purposes only and 100% not final):\n\n* **Level Up**: Peer-to-peer education is an integral part of any MOBA community. Because players have such a large role in defining the meta of League at any given moment, we frequently turn to each other for advice on how to play, who to play, what to build and the minutiae of gameplay. Topics we think could fit here include Tips & Tricks, big play videos, tutorials and game balance/&rdquo;meta&rdquo; based discussion. _[Contributes to front page, &ldquo;upvote&rdquo; thread sorting, default nested comments]_\n* **League Creations**: Story discussion, fanart, non-gameplay videos, cosplay (we&rsquo;d love to see more from this group on the Boards) and discussion of official creative content. We&rsquo;re also considering how fan fiction / roleplaying might fit under this umbrella, though there are definitely some potential segregation issues there. _[Contributes to front page, &ldquo;upvote&rdquo; thread sorting, default nested comments]_\n* **NA Looking for Group**: It may surprise you to learn that the Team Recruitment sub-board is one of the busiest. Expanding on this idea, we think team recruitment meshes well with &ldquo;regional matchmaking&rdquo; (connecting League players to each other outside of game) by providing a place to share info about viewing parties, local clubs and other live events. We already have some channels that surface this information, but more opportunity for players to connect is something we&rsquo;re keen on. _[Contributes to front page, &ldquo;upvote&rdquo; thread sorting, default chronological comments]_\n* **Riot Plz!**: As you can probably guess, the idea here is a concentrated repository for feedback posts around the player experience.  Whether it&rsquo;s about Balance, Gameplay or UI, it all relates to specific requests and/or ideas around how you experience the game. _[Contributes to front page, &ldquo;upvote&rdquo; thread sorting, default nested comments]_\n* **All Chat**: If we&rsquo;re here, chances are we&rsquo;re passionate about both League of Legends and various other &ldquo;nerd culture&rdquo; topics Whether it&#039;s video games, movies, anime or any other of the many fandoms that exist in the same cultural space of League, we&rsquo;d like the Boards to have a space for you to share your excitement. While there are any number of topics that we can geek out about, there are some areas of discussion we feel are better left to other community platforms (politics, religion, sex, etc). There will obviously be some exceptions - a good example would be the somewhat recent SOPA/PIPA discussions - and we&rsquo;re committed to being objective when it comes to our discernment. _[Contributes to front page, &ldquo;upvote&rdquo; thread sorting, default chronological comments]_\n* **Help and Support**: Fairly straight forward - technical issues, general service related questions, etc. _[Does not contribute to front page, &ldquo;upvote&rdquo; thread sorting, nested comments]_\n* **Report a Bug**: Also fairly straight forward. _[Does not contribute to front page, &ldquo;upvote&rdquo; thread sorting, nested comments]_\n* **Behavior and Discipline**: This sub-board would be intended as a defined space where players can discuss moderation and receive feedback around Player Behavior measures directly affecting their accounts. _[Does not contribute to front page, chronological thread sorting, nested comments]_\n\nWith this organization, we&rsquo;ll have slimmed down to just five core content sub-boards (with &lsquo;Help and Support&rsquo; and &lsquo;Behavior and Discipline&rsquo; being non-contributing, utilitarian boards), which should massively invigorate their respective activity and contribute to a more fluid front page. With &lsquo;All Chat,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll also have looped the &ldquo;All things League&rdquo; space currently occupied by Miscellaneous and GD back in with the rest of the boards and ensured that all boards content is simultaneously available to anyone who visits.\n\nOne potential concern I&rsquo;d like to address right away is that this type of organization will end up swallowing niche communities that currently have their own dedicated homes. In this case, our general stance is twofold - 1) We&rsquo;re open to the idea of filters, tagging systems, etc that will highlight conversations where that&rsquo;s desirable, and 2) if your conversations on a certain topic are so awesome, then let&rsquo;s show more people! Right now, there are a lot of great discussions that almost no one gets to experience, purely because the Boards are overly segregated. The Sound & Music board is a great example - there&rsquo;s a passionate community and several Rioters who frequently drop by to chat, but even the best threads only see view counts measured in the hundreds or even dozens.  \n\nAs I mentioned, we&rsquo;re committed to updating the current Boards organization, but your feedback is absolutely vital to making sure whatever changes we make are a solid improvement on the current situation - let us know what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2015-06-18T19:10:10.577+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":10,"body":"Please do not delete GD.

We've talked it over a lot internally and with other community members and some of the things that stood out to us:\n\n- It's very insular.  Active with a small tight knit community sure but not many fresh faces are showing up anymore.  (Minus all the regular's new smurfs with funny names)\n\n- It's very polarizing.  Sort of connected into the first point, but the content of GD extends well outside the realms of what we intended General Discussion to be so very long ago.  We know that people have opinions on a variety of topics but we don't think extremely controversial conversations like politics or religion belong on our forums.  There are other places for those kinds of topics and anyone who wants to discuss them are free to visit those other web sites.\n\n- It's very low effort.  I think the common term is \"shit post\" and GD is filled with it.  There are some discussions, but not enough.  Most of the threads are either 1st world problems about Mods, pictures of a random anime girl, or a rant filled thread with no quality discussion about a specific champion in our game.\n\nIn our discussions we found that a lot of Rioters didn't want to engage in the boards or GD because of these points and others.  We know that a big point of pain has always been \"WHERE ARE THE RIOTERS?!\" and it's sad to see that participation has dropped off.  Our goal is to bring back a lot of conversations to our home here on our own boards.\n\nBut to do that we're going to have to revamp a lot of boards, and GD is one of them.\n\nSo I wouldn't say that GD is being deleted.  It will change yes.  There will be some additional rules and that might hurt some content.  But there will be room for a lot of other content instead.  And with more content will come more interaction with people in Riot. \n\nWe're going to expand GD into a place where ALL players and Rioters will want to come and discuss things outside the scope of League.  Don't get me wrong, the transition will have a few kinks in it; change always does; but we hope that a lot of you will be willing to work with us to make it a better place for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Harmony11","date":"2015-06-18T20:01:19.445+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":26,"body":"I'm going to be hated for this, but thank you WC.

It's not that people hate fun and talking and being part of a group. They just don't like the shittiness that makes up a large part of the current GD.\n\nAlso concerning moderation, I see people saying \"moderation>deletion\" but every single time I visit GD there's a thread complaining about, you guess it, over-moderation. GD has it in their head that they are different than the rest of the forum and should be treated as such. The problem was that Riot agreed and trusted GD when Boards were created, and a lot of people abused that trust. \"But we're all friends\" people cry. If a friend of mine called me half the things the bad side of GD calls each other then they would be lucky if I simply walked away and didn't retaliate in some way. I'm sure I'm not alone in that.","replies":[{"poster":"ChickenWrap","date":"2015-06-18T20:57:44.167+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"We were told that we would be allowed to mold our own community and rules. \n\nI made a thread about it and together GD came up with a ruleset that was lenient but also kept the worst kind of junk away.\n\nIt was approved.\n\nThen the mods didn't care about it at all.\n\nNow GD is upset at being a police state in regards to moderation.

I cannot even express in words how...disappointed I am in this decision (as it seems to be already made no matter how many threads you title \"discussion\"). It's heartbreaking to see a company and people you once looked up to basically look down at you and tell you you're not worthwhile to them anymore. It's mind-boggling to try to understand how one day a claim can be made that you care as a company about the people who post on GD and understand that it's a culture we want to keep and then the next day basically tell us that you do not believe the community is worth anything and definitely not the simple, basic concept of respect.\n\n   It's disrespectful to lie. It's disrespectful to not hold up your part of a bargain that was reached between the community and previous Rioters. It's 100% -not- ok to say that just because you don't like it, it should not be respected and adhered to. It hurts to be lied to over and over. \n\n   I don't expect anyone to know who I am, or accept my opinion on things. I know I'm not the most frequent poster and maybe not the most liked, however, I made a post a long time ago, when GD was forcibly removed from old forums and added to boards, if you feel like reading it, please do ( http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/2hJZATjx-riot-tamat-gd ). At this point I was excited, thrilled to be moving to boards and I have 100% supported Riot throughout the move. I offered to help people with the transition, piece together how we can make GD into something people would love to post in while maintaining the culture that was created and weeding out bad apples(lol) that cause strife between Riot and the community. I offered advice and I've talked to numerous members of the community about how we can still make boards our home. I understood it would be different, but I also understood that GD was a force of it's own and you have to respect that force. GD could be a place that is fun for everyone, without stripping it of what it is at it's core.\n\n   The problem is two-fold and they relate, just as I mentioned in my post 8 months ago. You're having a problem with GD in particular because you refuse to try to understand it as a whole and you placed people in a situation they were not ready for with virtually no warning. That situation is \"moderation\" and there's some problems with it currently. \n\n     I said in my post that you brought people from a basically free forum to a modded forum without providing any clear and concise rules. They change day to day, and while I understand you may be changing that, it still doesn't change the fact that it's been happening for 8 months. Of course a community is tired of dealing with that. **That's not on us, that's on you guys. Now you punish the result of your inability to decide your own rules. **You also need moderators that are fair and accountable for actions they are taking. None of this \"woops we messed up on deleting that one post, oh well\". Moderators need to be **named, and known**. I don't care if they are 3rd party (though that opens up another bag of worms). We have heard that the moderators are \"training\" since before the boards transition. It's completely fair of us for expect that you have your shit together by now and that this should not be occurring.....yet it is.\n\n    I have not seen any Rioter attempt to have a **discussion** with the community about these things other than Tamat. This \"discussion\" is a farce, unless we are discussing how upset we can be at your decision without you respecting our wishes. GD is a lot of people's home. It's where I've met some really amazing people and have made some long lasting friendships. It's where I go to laugh while I'm at my shitty job and it's where I go to talk to people about league of legends. I like reading the odd shitpost, I love watching friends duke it out over what champion is more freelo, I -love- that people can have an opinion on almost everything in the world and let it be known.

Given that Riot's been through some rocky times with lore lately, it's hard not to perceive this as a cynical attempt to eliminate lore discussion from the forums, burying it under a flood of \"look at my awesome Teemo t-shirt—I call it my T-MO-shirt, lol!\" posts. It would be very strange to have a lore discussion under a header of \"League Creations\". I'd always feel like I was posting under the wrong forum.

The current problem is that the community is too fractured between various Boards, causing only a few popular Boards to dominate the main page.  By merging some communities together, we are going to create a more vibrant place to have discussions, as well as help increase the diversity of the main page.\n\n> Look, the Boards Team has some legacy promises that they are obligated to fulfill.

But if you want a community that cares about the Boards, and wants to be engaged, breaking promises is a bad place to start your interaction as the “new” Boards team.\n\nWe're definitely aware of the various commitments made to the GD community in the past. Frankly, some of those commitments to GD were made in poor judgement, and have actively hindered healthy development of the entire NA Boards ecosystem. GD and the rest of the boards have evolved a lot since then, and in a lot of cases in unhealthy ways. In response, we're planning some wide-scope changes to the entire NA Boards ecosystem (organization, moderation, rules, etc), which is what this series of posts is directed at communicating and discussing with you guys. \n\nOur primary goals with these changes are making more stuff visible to more players and getting the Boards moving more fluidly. As part of that, we want to bridge the current divide between the positive parts of the GD community and the rest of the Boards. All players who currently participate solely in GD are more than welcome to participate within All Chat following the guidelines and rules that will be found there.\n\n> Consolidation may help from the perspective of “Where is the proper board for me to put this content?” but let’s look at why that is a problem right now.

Yup, murder it with fire.\n\nGiven the sheer amount of Boards, finding a proper place to find content is very difficult.  Even Rioters themselves are often confused where they should post, before ending up on Miscellaneous.  By moving to a \"use case\", we are going to make it easier for players to find the right place to share their thoughts, and have others interact with it as well.  Additionally, with less splintering of the community,  more players will have the ability to both see, and post in these discussions as well.\n\nLastly, we are open to the idea that moderators will move content to the correct board, rather than simply deleting it.\n\n> You have many, many options, to produce better organization paradigms across Boards.

This is why we are open to discussing tagging, filtering, discussion subscription features, etc.  We want awesome posts about any topic to have the visibility and experiences it deserves, and not be missed in the smaller niche communities.\n\n> This seems like a lazy way of going about this Riot.

Player created sub-boards and self moderation has not been completely forgotten about, but we want to make sure that Boards is in a healthy enough state to support this before fracturing the community into too many small pieces.  As for moderation specific concerns, such as feedback for the mods and actionable messaging from them, we are going to discuss moderation in-depth in a focused-post within a couple of weeks!\n\n> DON'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

Several different types of discussions may gain a lot of traction, and therefore appear on the main page.  While League Creations may appear several different times on the main page, it may be about wildly different topics, such as Cosplay, art, lore, etc.  With more community interaction, the greater the diversity that will exist on the main page.","replies":[{"poster":"Its Yuu and Mi","date":"2015-06-18T19:38:33.059+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=Hx8p6GoX,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-06-18T19:34:41.971+0000)\n>\n> We're definitely aware of the various commitments made to the GD community in the past.

We've talked it over a lot internally and with other community members and some of the things that stood out to us:\n\n> - It's very insular.  Active with a small tight knit community sure but not many fresh faces are showing up anymore.  (Minus all the regular's new smurfs with funny names)\n\nHow fucking dare you when the roleplaying board is allowed to be unlisted and people are actively discouraged from joining it. \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/roleplaying\n\n> - It's very polarizing.  Sort of connected into the first point, but the content of GD extends well outside the realms of what we intended General Discussion to be so very long ago.  We know that people have opinions on a variety of topics but we don't think extremely controversial conversations like politics or religion belong on our forums.  There are other places for those kinds of topics and anyone who wants to discuss them are free to visit those other web sites.\n\nI'm still a bit confused as to why instead of creating a new area which is your dream subforum filled with sunshine and cupcakes and people who don't know swear words where Rioters can frolic about as they please and deliver their overly saccharine anecdotes of information, you would rather just lump a bunch of shit together and tell all the members of the individual boards to deal with it\nwe're not small children\nwe know what we want and we know how to go get it\nif I want to go see some League Memes, _I will go to Memes and Games_\nBut that's NOT what I want, I want GD\nand you're taking that away from everybody that wants that distinction\n\n> - It's very low effort.  I think the common term is \"shit post\" and GD is filled with it.  There are some discussions, but not enough.  Most of the threads are either 1st world problems about Mods, pictures of a random anime girl, or a rant filled thread with no quality discussion about a specific champion in our game.\n\nMaybe every second thread wouldn't be about mods if they weren't \n1. Third party\n2. Ridiculously inconsistent\n3. Target banning\n4. Lacking reasonable judgement\n\nalso I just went to the front page of GD and saw literally 0 anime girl threads\n\n> In our discussions we found that a lot of Rioters didn't want to engage in the boards or GD because of these points and others.  We know that a big point of pain has always been \"WHERE ARE THE RIOTERS?!\" and it's sad to see that participation has dropped off.  Our goal is to bring back a lot of conversations to our home here on our own boards.\n> \n> But to do that we're going to have to revamp a lot of boards, and GD is one of them.\n\nI'm being honest when I say I fail to see the connection here.\n\n> So I wouldn't say that GD is being deleted.  It will change yes.  There will be some additional rules and that might hurt some content.  But there will be room for a lot of other content instead.  And with more content will come more interaction with people in Riot. \n\nI wouldn't say that GD is being deleted, but the culture and rules and name are all going to be forcibly changed.

If anything,  I'd say it would be more reasonable to just fold \"Community Creations\" in under \"Story & Art\", rather than attempting to \"segregate\" them further. After all, many Community Creations of the story/art variety are reflections or explorations of canonical Story & Art.\n\nFor example: **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)**. Where do Factions posts go under the current system? I've often found it rather unclear. It's \"Maps & Modes\", in that it centers around a community-created custom game mode. It's \"Community Creations\" in that it also involves community lore and artwork. It's \"Story & Art\" in that it involves a lot of discussion of canon sources and questions about the canon foundations of the various factions. Sometimes I think it varies by the type of post, but it's not always clear there. If I'm sharing a Factions lore update, that's pretty clearly Community Creations; if I'm asking for community input on a lore question, that's pretty clearly Story & Art. But what about announcing a Factions tournament? Is that Maps & Modes?\n\nIf I may risk a somewhat provocative statement: shoveling Story & Art and Community Creations under a \"League Creations\" banner that also includes cosplay photos is going to seem to further the alleged trend of League deleting its own lore. I have nothing against cosplayers and cupcake bakers (obviously, right?), but it is notable that cosplay (the type of \"Community Creations\" you say Riot most wants to see more of) is a fairly \"harmless\", even \"passive\", type of community creativity, perhaps maximally so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ManDude","date":"2015-06-18T20:14:24.384+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot's not keeping promises and screwing over their forum communities again?\n\nI'm not even surprised at this point.\n\nTo put this as nicely as I can, I'm deeply disappointed in Riot Games as a company lately, for exactly this kind of behavior.
