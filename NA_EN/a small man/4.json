Check out the initial discussion about NA Boards organization [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/Hx8p6GoX-letos-talk-boards-organization), and our original post about upcoming changes to the boards and our thinking behind them [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/Ep4t0zPw-lets-talk-about-the-boards).\n\n**What we discussed**\n\nTo very briefly summarize, here&rsquo;s what we covered in our first post:\n\n* Too damn many sub-boards! In addition to many current sub-boards being stagnant, this slows the front page, keeps lots of content hidden, and contributes to certain topics being overly dominant.\n* We want to slim the current roster down, but how to do so while still covering the vast array of League topics?\n* Use case rather than subject matter - why you want to use a board becomes more important than strict topical exactitude and allows, for fewer, more lively Boards.\n* We proposed a slimmed down roster of Boards with placeholder names. Also acknowledged the potential need for filters / tagging to make a slimmed-down sub-board roster workable.\n* We asked for your feedback - thanks for providing it!\n\nOur major takeaways regarding your guys&rsquo; thoughts include:\n\n* No significant objections to the concept of consolidating existing sub-boards, or the proposed Riot Plz, NA LFG, and various utility boards.\n* Minor concerns around the proposed &lsquo;Level Up&rsquo; sub-board, mostly related to naming or certain topics potentially dominating.\n* Significant concerns around the proposed &lsquo;League Creations&rsquo; sub-board, especially related to naming but also concerning topic segregation. \n* Widespread concerns around altering GD in any way.\n\n**Lessons and conclusions**\n\nFirst of all, **we&rsquo;ve decided that no boards re-org will take place until we&rsquo;re ready to implement tagging / filter tech**. We already suspected this would be more requirement than nice-to-have, and your strong feedback helped us confirm that. We&rsquo;re tentatively pegging the overall boards update to whenever the Boards dev team is able to deploy this feature, and we&rsquo;ll be sure to keep you guys in the loop regarding that timeline (we&rsquo;re working with the dev team to get you more continuous / visible info about boards dev - think patch notes).\n\nWhile waiting for this tech should neatly solve many of your (not to mention our) concerns about a slimmed down sub-board roster, some of you also expressed particular concern regarding the placeholder sub-board names. As you&rsquo;ll see below, we&rsquo;ve updated some of the placeholder names in response to your feedback, and continue to be open to suggestions (we&rsquo;ve got some time while waiting for tag/filter tech). \n\nThat leaves GD and the future of the Misc. / Off-topic / General space - let&rsquo;s break this one down a bit. Our core objectives here are essentially two-fold:\n\n* Bringing all these topics (misc, off-topic, general) into one sub-board that contributes to the front page like the other main content boards.\n* Replacing &ldquo;General Discussion&rdquo; as a name - as we mentioned in our previous post, we&rsquo;re looking for something that will more closely jibe with the sub-boards&rsquo; eventual guidelines regarding it being the place to discuss topics beyond League that still reside in the same cultural space.\n\nWe fully understand that some of you may disagree with these goals, however, we&rsquo;re convinced that they&rsquo;re necessary for making sure the upcoming updates have a meaningful impact in securing the long-term health of the NA boards. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t value your feedback on this proposed space:\n\n* We&rsquo;re holding off on the re-org until tag/filter tech is implemented, which should address some of the concerns around topic segregation (memes and games, etc). We also plan to chat with you guys down the line about what those tags look like.\n* Naming - several of you pointed out the potentially confusing overlap with the community show. As with some of the other sub-boards, we&rsquo;ve offered a new placeholder below, and continue to be open to suggestions.\n* Prior to the eventual Boards updates, we&rsquo;ll be back in future threads to chat with you about Boards-wide topics like moderation, the Universal Rules, and future dev. \n\n**Updated sub-board organization plans**\n\n1) As stated, **no boards re-org will take place until we&rsquo;re ready to implement tagging / filter tech** (tentatively ~2-3 months out).\n\n2) Slimmed-down roster of listed &ldquo;content&rdquo; sub-boards (PLACEHOLDER names below - suggestions remain welcome). These will all contribute to the boards front page and use vote-based THREAD sorting by default. &lsquo;Strategy & Tactics,&rsquo; &lsquo;Story & Creativity,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Riot Plz!&rsquo; will use nested comments, while &lsquo;NA LFG&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Jungle&rsquo; will use chronological comments. \n\n* **Strategy & Tactics**: Peer-to-peer education, tips & tricks, tutorials, big play videos, and balance/meta discussion.\n* **Story & Creativity**: Discussion of official creative content, creative videos, fanart, cosplay. (Fan fiction / roleplaying to potentially be integrated at some point based on efficacy of tag/filter tech.)\n* **NA Looking for Group**: Team recruitment, live event info, and out-of-game connections.\n* **Riot Plz!**: Feedback posts / requests regarding any and all aspects of the League experience.\n* **The Jungle**: Video games, movies, anime, &ldquo;nerd culture,&rdquo; and any of the many other fandoms that exist in the same cultural space as League.\n\n3) Utility boards to stay mostly consistent, with one addition. These will not contribute to the front page, and will all use vote-based thread sorting and nested comments. We may explore condensing them based on efficacy of tagging tech, but it&#039;s not mission-critical.\n\n* **Boards Feedback**: As current.\n* **Help and Support**: As current.\n* **Report a Bug**: As current.\n* **Behavior and Discipline**: Discuss moderation and receive feedback around PB measures affecting accounts.\n\n**What&rsquo;s next**\n\nOnce again, we&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts. Beyond this conversation, we&rsquo;ll be back in the next couple weeks to talk about **moderation** as part of our overall discussion with you guys regarding the upcoming boards changes.\n\nWe&rsquo;ve also got the usual suspects on hand to chat:\n\n* ADillonMostDirty\n* Keyru\n* dArtagnan\n* RiotZwill\n* WookieCookie","replies":[{"poster":"Thunderkeg","date":"2015-06-26T19:15:19.542+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":9,"body":"ITT: we heard your feedback and are mostly disregarding it. Post your criticism in this thread so we can do it again LOL\n\nUpdate:\nSo by this point I've written and rewritten responses and am no closer to finding the magic words to drill into Riots head how bad of an idea this is. Riot is ignoring it's players like it has been for years and I'm just tired. Judging by the lack of response from this thread compared to the other ones (because this thread isn't even trying to pretend that you are willing to compromise with us on our top priorities) everyone else is tired too. \n\n So congratulations Riot. You wore us down. You made us stop caring enough to talk to you because we know it's going to be ignored and steamrolled over regardless. You're gonna get your way as always but it won't be with player support. It will be directly in spite of player wishes for their community. I'd just like to point out that you were sure this stupid newreddit format was the way of the future for boards despite the majority of players saying they hated it and pointing out flaws. \"we can fix it when we get there\" riot said. Here we are a year later with the players looking like Nostrodamuses and many of the issues we called are no closer to being fixed before Riot comes back to us saying \"NO wait we have it now. THIS is the new way of the future, trust us\" Cant you see why we lost any drive to argue with you? Instead of all the please you had before people are just going to down vote you and not waste their time with you. You had over 20 pages of people trying to tell you what they want out of your forums but you're too blinded about what YOU want out of them to think about the good of the community that already exists. Over 20 pages in a day or so yet in this entire thread you barely reach 7 pages and still it's people trying to tell you how to fix your forums. \"Well look into it\", \"we're open to idea\" are you really? ARE you?! Because in this whole charade I haven't seen many instances of that. Maybe reflect on why all your posts are down voted and why most of the replies are critical instead of \"thank you glorious Rito for telling us what we really wanted this whole time\". \n\n So why am I here? Honestly I don't even know at this point but I feel angry as a customer and this will stop me from coming back to the boards and has really ruined my opinion on Riot as a company. I guess this is one last ditch attempt to get me feelings across. I can't believe a company I used to count as \"one of the good ones\" would be so blind as to make the same mistake over again. Which sucks because I'm still addicted to your game but your practices leave me with a bad taste in my mouth after supporting you this whole time.\n\nEdit edit: FIRST! :P","replies":[{"poster":"Kat  Head","date":"2015-06-27T14:35:48.591+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SerThunderkeg,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=bWE8wUIE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-26T19:15:19.542+0000)\n>\n> ITT: we heard your feedback and are mostly disregarding it.

The purpose of merging these boards is to increase their activity level and get more people posting in the same place, isn't it?\n\nUpvote based thread sorting is good for inactive boards.  It is great if you only visit the boards every few days or once a week.  These are niche use cases and should be expected to switch away from the default.\n\nFor those who actually use the boards, and visit multiple times a day, upvote based thread sorting is awful.  The same few threads sit at the top for essentially forever.  The vast majority of people use the default view.  Most people would, therefore, never see anything that is not one of the top threads.\n\n(Why isn't this a problem for Reddit, then, you ask?  It is a problem for Reddit.  Reddit solves it with brute force, by simply having so many users that it doesn't matter that most threads are never seen by most users.  I do not consider this a success case.)\n\nPlease reconsider.  I don't mind if it's an option.  Options are great.  But if Recently Replied is not a sorting option, I will outright not use it.  If it is not the default, the odds are extremely high that I will become bored by the lack of activity forced on the board by your use of upvote sorting as the default.  I understand that upvote sorting is perfect for the Rioter use case, but as I'm sure you're aware, most of the users of the boards are not Rioters and do not use the boards in the same way as Rioters!\n\nSide note:  I have no problem with nested view being an option as long as you fix the interactions between nested and chronological.  Nested view should work like the Red Tracker when seen in chronological view, providing an automatic quote of the post it was made in reply to.  Without those quotes, if person A is posting in nested view and person B in chronological view, person A's posts make absolutely no sense to person B because there is no context provided. \n\nAs it is, the two do not play well together, in that particular case.  Please fix it before creating an ecosystem where some users are using one mode and some users are using the other mode.\n\n(Side note 2:  I think The Jungle is a much better name than All Chat.

I think... You guys might need to take a few steps back and look at this from a different angle here.\n\nBecause as it seems now? You guys are very, _very_ disconnected from your playerbase.\n\nAs player relation managers, I would expect that you would take what your players are saying far more seriously than you appear to be for the sake of both the community and the game you are representing. Because, yes, YOU are the voice for Riot right now. \n\nAnd since it is (now) established that you are voicing for Riot, then you need to consider what that means for both yourselves and the company you represent.\n\nWhen you interact with those that post on these forums? They are your customers. They are the consumers of this game. They are the ones that will help keep the game afloat for years to come... Or choose to leave should they desire.\n\nBeing a representative of Riot and part of the community relations team? I would imagine that you would be more willing to work with your customers, particularly when they are upset at something that has caused them dissatisfaction.\n\nStep back, close your eyes for thirty seconds to clear your mind, and then read this post that you made as if you were a consumer of the game. Read it as if you were in any of our positions as the forum members. Actually try to have an inkling of empathy for our situation. Because as of now? What I see within this post that you made is that:\n\n1. You do not care about what your customer's opinions are over the forum's situation.\n\n2. You will not take advice from your customer to improve the situation.\n\n3. Stating that you read and consider feedback is merely a comfort gesture, or a form of damage control.\n\n4. You are disconnected/do not understand what your customer wants from you as a Riot representative.\n\nQuite frankly, its a little baffling to me that you guys, as representatives of Riot, take so little concern in your community, especially considering that your actions reflect that of the company as a whole. As a company that runs off the free to play model, and as such off the well being of your customers(AKA The LoL community) I would think you would try a little harder to listen to us.\n\nI stated this before in my [rather long rant thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/UdlArWbB-an-open-letter-to-the-riot-with-pictures) that there are three things that you guys need to have in order to run effective changes within the boards, and I am going to restate them here for clarity's sake:\n\n* **First:** We, as a community, need to know Riot's vision of where they see this heading and what YOU desire from us in the long run.\n\n* **Second:** You, as the Player Relations Manager, need to know what **_the community member's_** vision is. You need to know what WE want to see in the long run from both you and other community members.\n\n* **And Third:** We, as a community and as the Player Relations Manager, need to come together and decide in what way is best for us to fulfill both the Riot and the Community visions, while in turn adding and removing to what each of our visions contain.\n\nWe, as a community? We know and see the vision that you have for us.\n\nBut do you, as the representatives of Riot, know the vision that we have for our community?\n\nBased on your response to the previous thread, and other threads that have popped up in relation to that... You do not. And you do not care to know.\n\nIf you sincerely care as much as you guys say you do? Then I recommend you take a completely different approach to this matter.\n\nTurn around, face your community, and make a thread. Make a thread asking _**US**_ what _**WE think**_ you should do to solve the situation.\n\nTake the words of _**your customers**_ in a far more serious matter than you do now. **_WORK_** with us. We are more than willing to work with you, representatives of Riot, but it is growing more apparent that you are not willing to offer that same service. \n\nAs of now? I cannot take the weight of your word for anything. You can tell me all you want about how much you have read our feedback, about how much you discuss it among yourselves, but all of that is a single grain of salt compared to the actions you have shown us over the passed few months.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and reconsider the way you are going about this.

New seemingly OP picks, cool level 1 bush strats, advice on how to climb the ladder, and videos showcasing how to play technically challenging champions are all examples where players can learn more about the game and get advice, other than discussing the current balance meta. We understand that not everyone may care about all of the different topics, which is why we want the tagging/filtering tech added in, to give players that option.\n\n**Story and Creative**\n\nThere is a lot of cool shit that players are creating, and we want to give a space where players can both see and discuss it.  For example, it's possible that a player never thought about Cosplay before, but a highly upvoted post there may catch your eye and make you want to look into it more.  Or perhaps you are obsessed with fan art, but an interesting lore piece catches your eye causing you to learn about the stories behind League.  \n\nAt the same time, we know that there are some players who are *only* interested in one specific topic, and aren't too interested in any others.  This is why we are fully behind the idea of the tagging/filtering system.  Essentially, what we want to do is create a balance between exploration vs. specific desires/wants.  With this system, we can allow players to have an overview of all the interesting projects that other players are working on that would cause an \"oh shit, that's really cool!\"  or \"I didn't know about this before, sounds awesome!\" type of reaction.  If players want to go deeper into any of these topics, they can with the tags/filters.\n\n> But I'm not gonna like this change until you explain why I should like it.\n\nThis is actually a really fair response.

For example, it's possible that a player never thought about Cosplay before, but a highly upvoted post there may catch your eye and make you want to look into it more.  Or perhaps you are obsessed with fan art, but an interesting lore piece catches your eye causing you to learn about the stories behind League.  \n\nI don't care about cosplay or fanart and I already follow most of the big League musicians. Trying to shove them into my face isn't going to make me care. (Also, putting 'lore discussion' in the same place as 'fan stuff' is really irritating.)\n\n> At the same time, we know that there are some players who are *only* interested in one specific topic, and aren't too interested in any others.  This is why we are fully behind the idea of the tagging/filtering system.  Essentially, what we want to do is create a balance between exploration vs. specific desires/wants.  With this system, we can allow players to have an overview of all the interesting projects that other players are working on that would cause an \"oh shit, that's really cool!\"  or \"I didn't know about this before, sounds awesome!\" type of reaction.  If players want to go deeper into any of these topics, they can with the tags/filters.\n\nI've played league for years. This account was made in beta (though I never actually played a beta game.) How much more do I need to explore about league's fanbase? I know what I want, and what I want has nothing to do with cosplay. So why are you trying to make me care?\n\n> This is actually a really fair response.

These are way too broad categories, and seem to rely entirely on tagging.

Yes, we can see how much effort may be put into a post, especially with lore and RP topics for example. A lot of the community there puts TONS of effort into making good posts. But does that really matter to the players who care 0% about these topics? Will they view these posts any differently due to the effort put in, if their interest in that topic is already minimal?

That doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t value your feedback on this proposed space:\n\n\n{{champion:267}} I appreciate the update on what's going on since that other thread went radio silent as I assume you guys were talking about the things you read there.\n\nI have to say I still am disappointed in your consistent inability to see the good things that come from GD as a whole and instead focusing only on things that further the agenda that you'd like to adjust the boards. I never see GD spoken about by Rioters in anything but negative tones when honestly the last few Riot posts Ive seen there (Katey for one) have received a staggering amount of positivity in their direction. There has been no \"What is good, what is positive, what we want to keep from GD\". Seems kind of off-culture for a company that preaches about positivity and anti-toxicity so much. Remember that bit that Lyte told us once about a negativity bias?\n\nAs for the name of General Discussion's mash up with these other boards, I do not particularly understand or see the reasoning behind your \"renaming\" and to be honest I think you are being disingenuous when you say that you are renaming it so it \"jives better\" with the guidelines.\n\nHere is a short list I compiled in about 5 seconds of gaming forums that have a \"General Discussion\":\n1. World of Warcraft\n2. Star Wars: The Old Republic\n3. Hearthstone\n4. Bethesda (entitled \"Community Discussion\", actually)\n5. EA\n6. DOTA (On the official Steam channel, I didnt look into other places)\n7. Wildstar\n\nAll of these places can outline rules for their conversations in their General Discussion without having to rename it to something ridiculous. I honestly think this is just a measure to place the board as far away from the community that lives there already (GDers) because you don't want that community to exist, whether they want to follow your new discussion rules or not. This is disappointing because honestly there are a lot of great people that post there, that would actively follow your new rules if they didn't feel so alienated by this \"discussion\" that has been happening since we found out we were losing our \"home\". To me, I can see no other legitimate reasoning to rename a General Discussion board (which is what it will be) to anything other than \"General Discussion\".\n\nIn the end, I suppose a name is a name is a name, and it doesn't truly matter in the grand scheme of things. What does matter is the implication that you do not want to associate with the people of General Discussion so badly that you will do anything to tear away from anything that resembles it in the slightest.\n\nI've been such a positive supporter of Riot...been called a fanboy(girl) way too many times to count, but I am really finding myself struggling to find the positive message in this from Riot, and I pride myself on being able to find the positives in most situations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-06-26T23:57:24.255+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get it.

Let me subscribe and block some of the different boards. That way the front page for me will change often. If someone doesn't like GD, they just unsubscribe and problem solved.

If you reply to this message at all, I expect you all to say something like, \"Hey there, and thanks for your reply.  We care about how you guys feel about this, and nothing is set in stone.  We think filter tech will be an awesome change to make everyone more active and bring people together.\" etc etc\n\nBut you cannot possibly understand how damaging that system is to our community.  If you and the rest of your team did, you wouldn't be trying to lump us in with the rest of the creative community.  We're different and unique, with very specific needs and a very ordered and structured world that allows our members to do, and play, and enjoy themselves in all the creative ways we love and require to thrive and build.\n\nOur board desires to go public.  We still do.  Our full-on segregation is killing us, slowly.  But what you're suggesting will disrupt the community in ways that it, quite frankly, will never, ever recover from.  It will never be what we made it again.  We have spent years, literally years, that's not an exaggeration on my part, building and growing a community, and a world.  \n\nWe have dozens of threads that represent specific areas on Runeterra in which characters can have their own stories take place.  We have world continuity, and way for people to interact with specific champions if they wish to do so.  We have cohesive stories that go between threads, and the entire thing is built upon structure.\n\nWhat you are suggesting will destroy that structure.  It will destroy continuity between threads by throwing fanfiction, and art, and cosplay, and music, and whatever other nonsense in with that world, and any sense of cohesion and a unified world will be destroyed.  Even if a person hides literally every single thread that is NOT a roleplaying thread, people will be spamming inside closed roleplaying threads, interrupting stories, barging in where they don't understand, or don't care.  They will be trolling, asking questions, laughing at goings on, commenting, disrupting the flow, and damaging the hard work we've all tried to make over the last few years.\n\nImagine, if you would, an author trying to write a story, but every time he writes something, huge walls of comments, or emotes, or downvotes, or criticisms, start popping up between each line.  The story, the atmosphere, everything, would be utterly disrupted.  Imagine trying to watch a film, and in the middle of the movie, the scene is spliced with random pictures, songs, or other such things that don't have anything to do with the film itself.  It would be worse than commercials, because at least those are usually timed in specific places.  \n\nIt will ruin the system we have in place to regulate ourselves, our community rules and guidelines, our means to accurately judge and weigh decisions with wide-reaching consequences for the community itself, due to outside interference from people that aren't part of the community or don't participate.  You will break us, and everything we've made.\n\nWe want to go public, but we do NOT want to go public like that.  Not in the slightest.  And for all the time our community members took begging you, trying to explain to you, you've all plugged your ears and gone on your merry way, intentionally ignorant of our plight.  I honestly don't know how we can make things more clear to you that what you are doing will break our community apart.  It'll be the nail on the coffin and the stake through the heart that ends us.  \n\nI know if you're all reading this, you're chuckling and shaking your heads in your desk-chairs and looking at your monitor and thinking, \n*\"Man, this Kaz guy is completely overreacting and blowing things out of proportion.\"*  \nAnd while I may be exaggerating to some degree to make my point, for the most part, I am not.  \n\nI've been a major part of the community for longer than it's been its own forum, and even when it used to be on the Lore Discussion Forums.  For over three years, I've watched and helped the community grow.  I've played a major part in trying to be a force for positive change to bring everyone together and attempted to foster a feeling of communal wellness among everyone there.  I've had my finger on the pulse of the RP Forums ever since, and few know as well as I do its moods and its careful balance.  I even acted as a go-between of sorts between our community and Tamat via Skype to help get things organized after the move last October, and after all the chaos it created for us that we **still** haven't recovered from.  My words populate the sidebar when one goes to the RP Boards, voted there by members of the community, and while I have my fair share of naysayers and haters, few people, I believe, would be able to say that I have not gone over and above what is expected of any community member in terms of trying to make things better for everyone.\n\nI never speak my opinion without first trying to understand how it will affect the community as a whole.\n\nAnd right now, I know exactly how devastating this change would be for us.\n\nI'm just trying to make you folks understand it too.\n\nSo, again, I am asking you, even begging, on behalf of the entire RP Community, and countless people who feel their only real home on the forums is about to be destroyed, who have lost any faith in your ability to listen and empathize with anyone outside of your own goals, *please* do not roll us into this conglomerated subforum.  It is not the beneficial choice that you want it to be for us, and it will not serve to grow or build our community in the ways that you think.\n\nYou cannot know our community better than we do, and this kind of change will end it.","replies":[{"poster":"A Small Man","date":"2015-06-27T03:24:36.145+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Hey Ryugi,\n\nJust to make sure we're on the same page, as I mentioned in the OP we're looking at the *potential* for integrating the RP boards more closely with other content boards *at some point* and *based on how certain tech ends up looking*.
