So first we have to spend time untangling their \"spaghetti code,\" then we can work quickly and efficiently on the effects.

Maybe it's spheres with a scrolling flame texture. Maybe it's little bits of flame that start hot white and fade to yellow then red. Maybe you draw every frame by hand. Or maybe.... you get the idea\n\nSo yah, deciding which technique to go with is a big part of the job. Trying those techniques then realizing they don't work is another big part of the job. lol. But to put a positive note on it, I learn something from every attempt, and I've found a lot of really fun and creative ways to give fire a unique personality. For example, Spirit Fire Brand uses inverted colors to look like dark fire. Base Brand uses lots of small flecks of flame to feel like a full-bodied mass of flame. The torches on Summoner's Rift use a simple randomized fire texture to match the style of the environment. \n\nThe technique we choose heavily impacts the quality and vibe we get. So we get to explore a variety of tricks to get the result we want.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GwingMaster","date":"2015-10-21T19:57:12.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi There! Thanks for doing this!! Two questions and a pair of compliments:\n\n1) PROJECT: Leona is to date the ONLY skin i've ever bought. Leona is my favorite champ but I generally have a rule that I don't buy skins. I couldn't resist for Project simply because I was so desperate to have a Leona skin with cool particles. Awesome job, i love it.\n\n2.) How do you guys go about updating VFX? Are there meetings that go on that discuss how the VFX should reflect their thematic or is it largely left up to the artists themselves to decide how things should look?\n\n3) Branching from that - can you comment at all on the VFX changes for Morde? i know this is a scary topic so I\"m not trying to trap you or anything, I\"m just curious what the thinking was behind changing them and why the update includes so much less metal in favor of whispy swirls, etc. Personally I don't particularly like the new ones but I\"m not trying to criticize, more just curious how these decisions are made.\n\n4.) I played with Brand on OFA for the first time since his VFX were updated and OMG they're beautiful. I\"m gonna buy him just for those. If you had anything to do with that or you know who did, please extend my compliments. They're awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Keyserito","date":"2015-10-21T20:15:33.199+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.) Woah! That's so cool to hear! Leona was a real challenge for me to work on, having not done high-tech VFX like that before. There was a lot of failed attempts trying to figure out what \"Digital Magic\" looks like. So glad it worked out :^]\n\n2.) There's a few strategies we have on updating VFX. The first is that the Champ Up (Champion Update) team tackles what they can as quickly as they can. Beyond that, other VFX artists occasionally chip in to offer some love. A few months ago, we did a batch of updates as a passion project, squeezing it into our free time (Morde, Brand, Corki, Nunu, etc). Then there's random instances where it makes sense, like Pantheon's Q and W impact sparks. While I was working on his new Slayer skin, we realized that we could apply the Q and W to his base. So we decided to give Pantheon players some love across the board, especially since the new sparks weren't necessarily thematically unique to the Slayer line.\n\n3.) Mordekaiser is close to my heart, not only because we share a name, but because he was the first champ I ever played. Working on his new visuals was fun, but super tricky (as with many of our beloved Champ Up initiatives). His thematic is a paradox, because he's both the Master of Metal, and a magic-damage soul-controlling undead mage. We dialed back the physical aspects of the metal to better indicate magic damage. Admittedly, we did err on the side of spirit energy. I went for \"etherial metal\" where I could, giving the sense of a sharp, but other-worldly element.\n\n4.) Yah, a fellow artist did Brand's VFX update. I'll pass along the compliment :^]","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aphanopanop","date":"2015-10-21T20:09:24.572+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Riot Keyserito, what type of schooling did you go through to get  to where you are at?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Keyserito","date":"2015-10-21T20:27:02.075+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a growing number of good schools to go to.

Bill Kladis did some great tutorials in the Unreal Engine. I'm also trying to get the word out in VFX education on my YouTube channel.\n\nAs for my personal journey, I was lucky to attend a university with a great animation program. Within that program, I specialized in effects, which led me down the path I'm on today. When choosing a program, my #1 advice is to make sure the faculty have been successful in the industry (holding the same jobs you want to get) and that the graduating students are consistently getting the jobs you want to get.

It's a relatively younger discipline in the arts, and there's not as many classes available for VFX in school (usually, it's VFX for film, not games). So yes, we have a very high demand for more and more VFX in our game, and it's one of the hardest positions to hire for. \n\nIf anyone wants to learn how to become a VFX artist, feel free to reach out to me on my YouTube channel or on Twitter. I'd be happy to point you toward some good resources for learning :^D \n\nThe industry is super hungry for more flashy VFX, and I'm here to help where I can.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OrangeDonutz","date":"2015-10-21T20:22:43.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Project Leona is my favorite skin ever!
