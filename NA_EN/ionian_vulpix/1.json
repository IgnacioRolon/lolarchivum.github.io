I was looking at some older champions, particularly those that aren&#039;t slated for reworks soon (Yorick, Ryze, Warwick) and noticed a lot of them don&#039;t really have that many vocal lines in game. And with changes in the lore, some quotes make even less sense, mainly everything involving summoners.\r\n\r\nMain one that got me thinking was {{champion:103}}  since she&#039;s my main. She doesn&#039;t have that many vocal lines, and the ones she does have make her out to be a fairly ruthless predator with an attractive voice and body. But in more recent lore pieces, it&#039;s been said that she only wants to take her humanity from those that don&#039;t need it (And again, Noxus made out to be the bad guys, but that&#039;s a different can of worms) and that she does feel guilty about what she&#039;s done. \r\n\r\nWill some older champions who aren&#039;t getting reworked ever get new lines to keep them up-to-date with the current lore of the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Ronin One","date":"2016-05-03T15:23:50.782+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:81}} You belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\nYou belong in a museum\n\n\nEzreal needs an update with quotes.","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2016-05-03T18:15:54.923+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wish yi didn't get more lines T_T\n\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!\n{{champion:11}} - Your skills are inferior!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2016-05-03T13:04:42.521+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt it, it probably costs too much to hire someone just to record a couple more lines. We're talking ~100 older champions who don't have 15+ minutes of VO, that's gonna cost a LOT. And if you start cherry picking people are gonna be upset that their main didn't get a new VO instead of some other champion.

He needs a VU and a VO update, pretty badly. I mean, keep the squeaky annoying voice. Those laughs are great taunt tools because they're loud and obnoxious and the voice fits... but he could use some more lines and a graphical overhaul. I mean, in an age where we have competitions for champions who have contests over who has the most unique lines of dialogue (looking at you Tahm, Jhin, and Aurelion) Veigar has a pretty darn pitiful repertoire. \n\nHere's to hoping Veigar gets the aesthetic changes he needs soon. I mean, have you *seen* the textures on his event horizon? Looks like you're playing League with a DOOM textures, and his ult is basically a more sparkly Q with a different landing particle effect. I know lots of people who can't tell the difference and don't know if they should try to juke or use Zhonia's before they get nuked into next century when Veigar ults.\n\nRito plz.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-05-05T16:01:57.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions nowadays just talk too much if you ask me.

Adding VO lines involves writing them (a fairly lengthy process), re-hiring the original voice actor, getting them in the studio, having them record lines, localizing the lines to work in different languages (which involves more VAs), and finally patching them in.

The VA's aren't even known.  There's a great interview somewhere (Wish I could find it) with the voice of Ashe where she mentions she didn't even remember being in the game until she played it, heard Ashe's voice, and was like \"Oh, wait a minute.\"  \n\nBefore League was the biggest game in the world, it was the product of a tiny studio trying to sort of get in on a market that at the time was just DOTA 1.  A lot of these old VA's weren't Matthew Mercer or Troy Baker, they were probably almost literally \"Some guy on the street who kinda sounded like a good Mad Chemist\".  Riot might not have any way to contact them.\n\nFor a lot of them you'd potentially have to redo the whole voiceover with a new actor, and a lot of fans wouldn't like that.  Case in point, Nasus.  Old Nasus was widely considered the best VA in the League, but when it came time for his VU, the actor had died.  So they had to get someone new, and a lot of fans were upset that the old VA was just kinda...washed away.  That's sort of a special case because the guy was literally dead, but I was pretty bummed when we lost old GP, for example.  It's just a tricky subject.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Bad Nasus","date":"2016-05-03T06:51:07.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Into the Fray\"  {{champion:10}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-05-05T17:11:06.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I miss the spam of this.\n\n\"Gems, Gems are truly outrageous.
