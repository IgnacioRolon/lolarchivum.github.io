If it's still happening, I'd like to have you try switching your region on the patcher and then switching it back to normal. It doesn't sound like much, but that should force a patch to download which will let you log back in. Hit me back up if that's not helping!","replies":[{"poster":"Ionian Vulpix","date":"2017-05-25T22:07:30.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't even have to do that.
