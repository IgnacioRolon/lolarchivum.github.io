She is the perfect champion for me. Started playing in Season 5 sometime between Bard and Ekko, but didn&#039;t start playing Ahri until last season.\r\n\r\nWhy are people crying for nerfs now? The only thing I remember about her being changed was her base mana pool which occurred in the Mage update and a nerf in that her E no longer stops dashes. Yes, she was picked in the LCS, but it&#039;s because she&#039;s safe. Look at the consistent pool of midlaners in LCS: Orianna, Viktor, and now Ahri. What makes her so good is that the other champs who were OP were nerfed. LB nerfed, Ryze nerfed, Jayce nerfed. Right now, Syndra is popular. Ahri happens to do well into Syndra because Ahri is good at dodging skillshots, which her entire kit is based around.\r\n\r\nYes, Ahri is a safe, mobile champ, but is balanced around that. She&#039;s always been a safe pick. And there&#039;s nothing wrong with having a few champs who can do a lot, but not specialize in any of those tasks.","replies":[{"poster":"Dracocrash","date":"2017-03-14T03:20:09.898+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":6,"body":"because 20% playrate and 53% winrate lul.","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2017-03-14T04:26:59.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"SO you mean this\n\nThere are alot of instakill burst damage champions who snowball, so the champiosn who can survive vs that should be nerfed.

But Ahri is not that champ - if her mobility was conditional on her ult I might be okay with it, but then her Q gives her mobility too. If she was limited to single-target damage or low waveclear, I might be okay with that - but her Q and W give good AoE damage. If she didnt have CC that might be another thing, but she has hard CC.

Her damage is moderate (no where near the burst of assassins or burst mages). Her CC is moderate-weak (a 0.75 second charm that has short range and is intercepted by minions, probably the weakest CC duration to difficulty-to-land CC in the game). Her kit works really well together to allow her to make plays (i.e. her R-E or F-E combo makes that difficult to land CC a lot easier) while simultaneously punishing her for misplaying / allows enemies to punish her if they outplay (she blows a huge cool down if her opponent dodges the E). \n\nI can't think of any other champion that has to blow their ultimate or flash in order to go for a play that the enemy can avoid without flashing themselves.

Her ultimate has a shorter cool timer than most champions. 110 / 95 / 80 is not a long cool down. That's just about the same as Riven's ultimate (which feels like it's always off cool down). Even Riven's ultimate starts off with a longer cool timer fyi like 130 seconds or something,\n\nAhri is busted because her Q does true damage and gives her retarded movement speed for no skill involvement. If she actually had to hit a champion with Q to gain movement speed it would be more understandable.. she literally just throws that thing at nothing and gains 200+ movement speed.

LOL what are you smoking. Her ultimate has a shorter cool timer than most champions. 110 / 95 / 80 is not a long cool down. That's just about the same as Riven's ultimate (which feels like it's always off cool down). Even Riven's ultimate starts off with a longer cool timer fyi like 130 seconds or something,\n\nYour right that's not a huge CD for a ULT, but compared to other assassin's or even most champions mobility spells its a huge cool down. \n\n> Ahri is busted because her Q does true damage and gives her retarded movement speed for no skill involvement. If she actually had to hit a champion with Q to gain movement speed it would be more understandable.. she literally just throws that thing at nothing and gains 200+ movement speed. There is nothing fair or balanced about that. She's ranged and she has a mobile ultimate.\n\nMost people have a problem with Ahri due to her lane phase, Her Orb for the most part is pretty easy to predict and if its point blank you can get out of the way for the True Damage return. \n\nI'm fine with removing the MS, but what would be the buff she'd get in return? I'd like to see the Kiss of Death returned so she could turn into a true assassin again instead of this Jack-Of-All-Trades type champ she is now.

So any champion who has a dash, basically gets the same MS as Ahri, which like I said is a quick burst of MS, not a long duration.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2017-03-14T03:37:36.200+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrHaZeYo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Lo2wf4qr,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2017-03-14T03:23:54.218+0000)\n>\n> Your right that&#x27;s not a huge CD for a ULT, but compared to other assassin&#x27;s or even most champions mobility spells its a huge cool down. \n> \n> Most people have a problem with Ahri due to her lane phase, Her Orb for the most part is pretty easy to predict and if its point blank you can get out of the way for the True Damage return. \n> \n> I&#x27;m fine with removing the MS, but what would be the buff she&#x27;d get in return?

So any champion who has a dash, basically gets the same MS as Ahri, which like I said is a quick burst of MS, not a long duration.\n\nThe point you are missing is SHE DOESN'T NEED IT. Why did Riot add it? She was fine the entire time and never needed that movement speed added. All it does is make her unbalanced. She already was a safe pick, now she's even safer. She doesn't need anything in return for removing that movement speed, she should have never had it added into her kit to begin with.\n\nAlso, dashes don't count as movement speed because of 1 reason: animations. Try playing Aatrox, the new Galio who will come out soon, Tristana, etc. These champions have dashes however they are easily canceled by just about any CC. Granted, not every champion has a gap closer than can be canceled however raw movement speed is nearly always a lot stronger as a mechanic than the majority of dashes. Ahri even has both movement speed AND dashes that can't be interrupted. How do you balance it? Make her ultimate either channeled or interruptible (like how Aatrox's Q is when stunned or knocked up mid air - he doesn't move anywhere). That alone would make her Q movement speed a lot more reasonable however until then they should just remove it because it's extra utility that she doesn't need.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-03-14T04:23:48.923+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh my bad Dashes are stopped by CC but MS isn't hmm.\n\nAhri was in a shitty state during S4, She wasn't gutted but she wasn't good either, she was simply just there.\n\nSome backstory, Ahri's FoxFire(W) got nerfed(After Worlds S3), Each extra Fox Fire hitting the same target gets -20% Damage. So to make up for this nerf they added the Kiss of Death. Keep in mind a lot of Ahri's power was balanced around DFG and she still wasn't that strong, this was when she wasn't very good. Once DFG was removed, they also removed the kiss of death, to compensate they buff the Charm Base/AP Scaling, and added in the MS speed to her Orb. Somewhere between now and then they buffed her Orb(Q) Mana (right before S5 when the MS was added) and nerfed (Last Summer) how her charm works with dashes.\n\nIf you remove the MS you will need to add something else or up her Base/Scaling. Ahri isn't nearly as oppressive as most other \"overpowered\" Mid laners where. She simply just doesn't have bad match ups and most of them are more or less skill oriented. She does have some strong match ups that harder for her to lose but she has some weaker ones to that she can win if your simply better then the opponent. \n\nOn the latter part of your post, Lets say Tali uses her W to shove Ahri in a direction, If Ahri stops to cast her Orb for the MS she would still get hit by the Tali W. Where as a dash will simply act instantly and they don't get hit buy it. Also easier to dodge a skill shot with a dash then a MS steroid.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sagan Forever","date":"2017-03-14T17:53:15.415+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has been a very strong, but never the most overpowered champion status for alwhile now.

The only thing I remember about her being changed was her base mana pool which occurred in the Mage update and a nerf in that her E no longer stops dashes. Yes, she was picked in the LCS, but it&amp;#039;s because she&amp;#039;s safe. Look at the consistent pool of midlaners in LCS: Orianna, Viktor, and now Ahri. What makes her so good is that the other champs who were OP were nerfed. LB nerfed, Ryze nerfed, Jayce nerfed. Right now, Syndra is popular. Ahri happens to do well into Syndra because Ahri is good at dodging skillshots, which her entire kit is based around.\n> \n> Yes, Ahri is a safe, mobile champ, but is balanced around that. She&amp;#039;s always been a safe pick. And there&amp;#039;s nothing wrong with having a few champs who can do a lot, but not specialize in any of those tasks.\n\nI'm not just starting, imo I always thought she was bullshit because 1. She's insanely mobile \n2. She can't make up her mind if she's an assassin or a mage\n2a. She bursts many champs down easily with a lot of mobility\n2b. Her abilities don't cost much mana and does a shit ton of dmg\n3. She has sustain while being an assassin mage\n4. I just don't like her :P","replies":[]}]}
