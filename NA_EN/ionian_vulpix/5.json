Then tried uninstalling and reinstalling manually, also didn't work. Any other tips?\n\nEDIT: Tried running it directly through the system menu or files or whatever it is. And it started working! So thanks for the help!\n\nAnd just for something that may have been causing an issue: I had tried opening it normally at first, didn't work. When I tried opening it through the file menu, there was something in there called LockFile. When I tried opening it, it said there was already a version open and that I needed to terminate it to open another one, though there was nothing else for me to close and a second LockFile thing appeared. Upon deleting the first one and attempting to run it again, it worked and I logged in. Don't know if anyone else may have that issue or if I did something wrong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gin Undead","date":"2016-11-17T15:42:37.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If on windows go to control panel, then got to programs, then uninstall programs and find league of legends and there will be an uninstall process there.","replies":[]}]}
