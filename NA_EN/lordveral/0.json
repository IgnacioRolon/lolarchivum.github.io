I think that the jungle mobs need a nerf in damage or increase the sustain you get from hunters machete...A lot of junglers (for example elise and rengar) have a really hard time in the new jungler..if you don't have any good innate sustain you will have to recall as soon as you get your first buff and thats just not right.\r\n\r\nI want to jungle..but with the way it is now...theres no point...i'll get executed 3 times in the first 5 minutes unless i play someone like aatrox or warwick.

Smite the ancient Krug and get a leash if you can. Krug's bonus will stun and deal bonus damage with every 5 attacks which can greatly improve your sustain if the big monster is being stunned every 5-8 seconds. \n\nBe wary of which point you spend at spawn. Dumping a point into Fiora's Q, Lunge, might not be as effective with Krugs buff as her E, which raises attack speed by a huge margin, might be. \n\nAlways kill the big monster first. Machete regen passive remains active even when you're fighting the little monsters. Take out the big guy to mitigate a lot of the damage and allow your Machete passive to spool up a bit while you fight the little guys.\n\nNEVER FIGHT THE RAZORBEAKS. \n\nIt's just not worth it. Unless you're a jungler with crazy fast clearing speed, you're going to have at least 2 camps up, one of them being Razorbeaks. Fighting a high damage monster with 3 other high damage little monsters just isn't worth it unless you are stupid tanky. \n\nMonster Order: Krugs > Red > Blue > Gromp > Murkwolves. Rift scuttler is also worth taking down once you get devourer enchantment, considering it is classed as a Large Monster.","replies":[{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2014-12-04T23:03:55.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, except if you need blue first go frog then blue.","replies":[{"poster":"Cupkek","date":"2014-12-05T10:07:01.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This, except if you need blue first go frog then blue.\n\nAll the cool kids do Krugs...

Gromp gives you level 2, blue doesn't - so why not start gromp,  so you don't have to solo a camp at level 1.\n\nYou're meant to back early. The point being after 3 camps you can upgrade your machete and get a couple more health potions. Upgraded smite is a part of the new jungle,  you're meant to get it asap. \n\nRazorbeaks are OP, it's unfortunate. I think the reason is that aoe champions can kill them far too quickly once you get to mid game. So they need to be stronger early so they aren't just free gold/xp later. That said,  I still go to them after level 4 or 5. I also think they should be better to target for aoe junglers than they are;  they should have more health on the smaller ones and do less damage,  so that aoe junglers can kill them as easily as single target junglers clear gromp/krugs. \n\nThis is the preseason,  a chance to learn new routes that are more effective. Optimal strategies will evolve. We'll see a time when people oppose starting at the buffs - why would I waste 30sec of a buff on clearing camps when I don't need it? It felt awkward in the past on a blue dependent jungler to take blue buff when still at nearly full mana,  it would be more efficient to take it at lower mana as I do now. \n\nYou're not meant to do the jungle the same way. You're also going to experience some junglers being weaker than they were before and hopefully they'll be brought back up to par for the start off season 5.","replies":[{"poster":"LordVeral","date":"2014-12-05T02:52:31.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"blue/red still get you level 2.

As oppose to what? Last season where you basically absolutely HAD to start blue? This season you have basically three choices, last season, pretty much one choice. \n\nThe jungle is in a rough place, there's no denying that, but there's incredibly more flexibility, based on your champion, you can start Krugs, Gromp, or Blue. \n\nHow is that a bad thing?\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, any jungler still can hold its own, albeit difficult, but nonetheless capable. I've played at least every jungler in this new jungle and I've been able to clear 4 or 5 jungle camps before having to back. \n\nYou need to throw the old style of jungling out the window, its not going to work, and quite frankly, that's fine, there were a lot of problems unable to be rectified with the old jungles, such as ironically, being forced to run the same jungle route no matter what champion you played as. Many of the problems with this new jungles are just merely number tweaks, which are easier to cope with.  \n\n\n\n> The trick is a spell vamp quint. Then she does fine.\n\nI wonder how long it takes before people realize she is more then okay if you just run spell  vamp quints on her. Hell, I've found her mid-game clears to be the fastest of any jungler mid-game once you have Q and E maxed. And I'm not exaggerating. The argument people have given me for not running spell vamp on her is that she loses damage, but on the flip side, you're actually capable of ganking consistently, something almost no other jungler can do efficiently currently.
