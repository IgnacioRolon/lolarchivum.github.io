So randomly my client or in game screen will freeze. So this is what happens, sometimes in champion select or sometimes in game, my screen freezes and it won't change. However the game is still running because I can hear the background music and my cursor still moves. All my other programs work as well such as discord. When I try to alt - tab out my screen still wont change. When I try to alt - f4 nothing happens. I have to end up hard resetting my computer everytime. This is only happening to me on league of legends game as the other games I play never seem to freeze up. This use to only happen to me once in a blue moon, but lately its been happening at least once a day and ive gotten punished for it because it takes so long for my computer to reboot. The only other thing I can link to this is when I go into full screen on a youtube video the screen will sometimes freeze while the video audio keeps playing, but after 7 secs the screen will catch back up and keep playing. I dont know if this a league thing or a computer thing. Please help. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"AGoodPotato","date":"2018-03-01T02:36:40.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same exact issue, can't alt tab or anything. Game suddenly starts lagging and freezing up, and when I try to restart my client it freezes. This started out of the blue, and no other software cause the issue. Please provide a real solution, this is not  a hardware issue with our computers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ISmokeyTheBear","date":"2017-04-15T15:58:24.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you found a solution?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mpalomenoss","date":"2016-12-07T11:04:14.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the exact same problem with my all new gtx 1070 and 16gb ram . 3 freeze in the same game for like 20 sec each . i played after that infinite warfare with max setting and i didnt have any . the problem is in the new update","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T04:23:39.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This specific issue sounds like it may be more related to a driver or hardware issue.
