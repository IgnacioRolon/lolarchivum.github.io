While waiting for a game the client will randomly freeze, sometimes it will sometimes it won't. When the client freezes my whole computer freezes permanently and the only way to get it to work again is to hold down the power for 10 seconds and restart from there. \r\nThis has only started happening recently, I have already tried to revert my computer to a prior date where this did not occur and ran multiple antivirus programs, however nothing has worked and my computer only locks up randomly in the LOL client menus, never in game, and never when I'm not using the LOL client, any help would be greatly appreciated!!

There's a feature inside Windows 8 - 10 that can cause these types of issues outside of a match called the SmartScreen filter. I strongly recommend you temporarily disable it using [this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/930168) to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nLet me know if that helped. Additionally, if you still have issues, let me know which version of Windows you run.","replies":[{"poster":"PikoNeeko","date":"2016-09-28T16:48:53.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue, but in game like Katalix. I submitted a ticket last night or this morning (I understand it may take awhile, I am patiently waiting) regarding this here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/23500201 \nI also attached my logs to the ticket.\n\nHowever, disabling SmartScreen did not help. When I went into game my computer froze again and basically forced me to hold the power button till it shut off. I have been running Windows 10 for awhile now and am only now having issues, starting yesterday night.\nAlso, I'm not sure if I even have Internet Explorer like the page you hyperlinked says how to \"fix,\" because I have Microsoft Edge (even though I use Google Chrome). I was still able to disable SmartScreen in Microsoft Edge, though, as well as in my Control Panel. \nI'll copy and paste this comment to my ticket once I finish this post.\n\nLong story short: disabling SmartScreen, in both Microsoft Edge and my Control Panel, did NOT work for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-29T15:37:47.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just informed by one of our tech dudes that this may be caused by some recent Windows 10 updates that re-enabled a feature called *Game DVR* inside the Windows Game Bar.
