My internet is fine, but within League itself my ping has been shooting up to 13K and I have lost ranked games because of this and probably have also gotten reported as well. I have no idea what could be causing this, and to cause even more confusion I played some ARAM's this morning and it behaved relatively fine but it's still higher than my normal 40-45. Anyone have any ideas because the game is starting to get unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Remorium","date":"2016-08-05T06:25:01.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would having an issue with Port 21 cause ping problems?

Sometimes there are local network settings that can impact your connection too, so the guide that *Rineyy* linked is a good place to start. \n\nIf you continue to see high latency after working through that guide, please let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"REDSUPERCARR87","date":"2016-08-04T00:30:56.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't even smurf anymore since Riot's servers are all fucked up. They won't fix it. Instead, they'll blame your ISP and link you the connection issues page. I'd advise you play Dota.
