Nothing has changed and I normally play at around 40-60 ms every game.  Recently, for about a week now, I have been catching huge lag spikes, like 500+ms, and it occurs about every 30 seconds, making the game virtually unplayable.  It is very, very consistent.  The strange part is that my internet connection is still solid.  I can stream Netflix, music, Youtube, Twitch  all at once with no buffering.  It is just my connection within the game itself.  I'm always very cautious too to not have anything running in the background when I play.\r\n\r\nI have tried some things like flushing my dns and I've even reinstalled the client thinking maybe it would help, but no dice.  Any insight or suggestions on the situation are greatly appreciated. It's just becoming increasingly frustrating. \r\n            {{champion:32}} \r\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"LEADlNG","date":"2016-08-08T04:36:49.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Turn your Router/Modem off for 20-30 seconds than reboot it back up and test if the ping is better in a custom game.\n\n2. Try contacting your ISP about your internet service plan you're paying for. If you had 40-60 ms normally and recently have been getting 500+ ms, it may be on there end. You will have to see what's going on with the download/upload speed plan.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Man In Sky","date":"2016-08-08T04:25:43.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use recommended settings and run it through the compatibility mode program. Since you state that it does not affect other services, it may help through troubleshooting it the method I mentioned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T18:34:05.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big changes in your latency are often caused by ISP routing changes to the server. Because different services and game servers are in different geolocations, it's conceivable to have a good connection to one but not another. Since local network settings can also impact your connection, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step, along with the network power cycle that *Yxsuo* recommended in their reply.\n\nIf your latency is still problematic, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
