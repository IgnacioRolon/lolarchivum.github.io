I'm constantly unconnecting and always the last to join on average 5  minutes into the match. One of my matches today I loaded 22 minutes into a match. \nYes, that's right, twenty-two fucking minutes in.  \nIt sucks for not only myself but for my teammates too. There's no way I can come back after being out for so long. It's the only game I play so I can't compare it to other game load time but I have no issue running other programs. What can I do to stop this? I don't think it's a wifi problem because even when connected via an Ethernet cable I still have loading problems. Any advice helps. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T18:57:10.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're likely having an unstable connection if you're getting kicked off or spending a lot of time trying to load in.
