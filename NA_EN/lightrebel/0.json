I sent in a Ticket to Riot Support, but I don't know if they or you can get to this sooner.\nAnyways, on the Snowdown Site http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/snowdown-2016, there is a post by a scammer (austinthdbeast) using a tinyurl link to get past the filter. I can't report it, but I can downvote it and manually report it to you, which is what I'm doing.\nKeep up the good work!\n\nEDIT: http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2016/12/ask-riot-leagues-future-and-luxs-q/ has the same suspicious link from the same suspicious guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Curator","date":"2016-12-16T23:21:39.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeszarck,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=zmFLe7ad,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-16T03:42:04.843+0000)\n>\n> Hello TheCurator!

We know there's an issue with reporting/removing those comments and we'll go through and try to scrub them out.  We've passed it along to Riot as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-12-16T23:38:28.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheCurator,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=zmFLe7ad,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-16T23:21:39.573+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the heads-up.

I feel like you're the best person to ask because you're quite active, but if you want me to contact Keyru or someone else I could do that too.\nDid I do the right thing in sending a Ticket to Riot Support? They didn't fully read my reply and asked me to downvote the post (which works, though it's frustrating to only bring the post down to +5 because it was upvote botted) and report it (despite me explicitly stating in my Ticket that I could not report the post because it was on a specialty site and the replies did not link with a convenient Boards thread which would allow me to report them), so I feel like they didn't fully understand the situation and probably couldn't help. I do however remember Deep Terror Nami suggesting that users tell Riot Support about suspicious links that they get, so I thought that they might have been able to help with the situation because this was a case of suspicious links. Should I still send them Tickets in the future to make sure that someone is notified that there's a malicious link that I can't report on a page?","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Curator","date":"2016-12-16T23:46:05.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeszarck,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=zmFLe7ad,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-16T23:38:28.430+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for removing them!\n> \n> Do you mind if I direct you to these users posting malicious links on specialty sites in the future?

This is only an issue when the post/mini-site is created and the comments aren't linked directly to the Boards, which has been a rarer occurrence lately.  If you see something like this again in the future, you can simply make a post in Player Behavior & Moderation letting us know the link to the mini-site and that scam site links are getting through there.  Any moderator on duty can take it from there and go remove them.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-12-16T23:52:12.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheCurator,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=zmFLe7ad,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-16T23:46:05.846+0000)\n>\n> If sending in a ticket just results in them telling you to downvote it, then I&#x27;d just downvote it and comment like I noted you did there telling people it&#x27;s a scam.
