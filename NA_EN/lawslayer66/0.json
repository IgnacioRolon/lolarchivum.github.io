I tried logging back on to see if it did give me it but it didn't. I don't if I'm the only one experiencing this. Is there a way I can get that hextech key back? It was kind of a waste and I was really annoyed. Is there a way to fix this bug/glitch?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T01:38:22.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I see what happened in your case. When you opened that chest, you actually got the Poro Artist Icon (poro partyyyyy). Those icons are automatically put into your inventory of icons, so you won't ever see it in the loot screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divine Arcanine","date":"2017-06-04T20:44:28.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I were you, I'd send this as an actual ticket to Riot Support, they should be able to see what happened.","replies":[]}]}
