I&#039;ve occasionally logged on the PBE around the times of new champ releases to try them out with the exception of Jhin, who I didn&#039;t much care for because I don&#039;t ever really play ADC. I used to main mid, support, and top. Some time mid season four, I tried learning a bit of the jungle to play Rek&#039;sai, who I&#039;ve fallen in love with, so the few times I have played since S3, it has mostly either been Rek or a new champion.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve seen a lot of things about various jungle updates, people complaining that ADCs might as well not exist any more, itemization updates (I have no clue what to build for a midlaner any more), and loads of other stuff. So would anyone mind filling me in on what I&#039;ve missed the past three seasons? What changed? What are the cool kids building these days? Why are my friends that still play complaining about ADC?

It looks like a must-build for supports.\n6) Still confused by new Hextech items, though they look cool\n7) Phantom Dancer got a new passive? Sweet.\n8) 45% armor reduction on Last Whisper? Yeah, I can see how building armor is futile now\n9) Rapid Firecannon is no longer an active and that works passively. I like this.\n10) Rab's is still looking good, did they nerf Mejai's?\n11) Knight's Vow looks cool, too.

That speed boost, and stims, and shield increase... Plus AP and CD. It really should be Janna meta.\n8) That is 45% bonus armor penetration, it doesn't do anything to cut base armor, so it is less powerful than it looks.\n11) Knights Vow, I think it's meta on Taric.
