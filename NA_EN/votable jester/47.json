Morgana receives a change to her ult encouraging her to dive further in and likely die.\r\n\r\nThe ability that needed the most change on Morgana was her W, Tormented Soil.  That ability is currently useless on support (aside from being a generic damage proc) and 99% reliant on her Q to actually do damage to a champion as a mid laner.  It used to be strong mid lane for its ability to push waves efficiently but these days almost every mid laner has that (and they all push quicker than Morgana).\r\n\r\nI know there's no way Riot will pull back on this update (in part because they feel they'd need to pull Kayle's back too), but the changes they have employed solve none of Morgana's issues.  She still won't be an even somewhat strong mid laner due to her reliance upon a single, slow skillshot to pull off her damage and when she's played support she has a near useless ability.\r\n\r\nPersonally I would reduce the power of Morgana's Q to allow more power in the rest of her kit.  I'd then change her ultimate significantly as it makes no sense for a squishy champion to need to sit in the middle of the enemy team for an extended period of time to use their ultimate.  Finally I'd give her a completely new passive and W or at least attach a slow to the W so it really stops an enemy from just running at you through it.\r\n\r\nI love this champion's character and lore, but her gameplay is so incredibly underwhelming and binary.  If this update goes through as it is now, Morgana won't get the chance for a real update for many years.","replies":[]}
