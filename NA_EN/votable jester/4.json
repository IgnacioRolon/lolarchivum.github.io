Please let me know any counters you can think of as well as what makes them counter him if possible.  If you don&#039;t want to go into specifics, I&#039;d be happy with even just a link to a good website for counters that is properly updated for the new Malzahar.\r\n\r\nThanks, and I hope this didn&#039;t come across as salty/ragey/anything.  I just want to learn how to beat this opponent (I already know about QSS btw), and I&#039;m fairly capable with a decent variety of mid laners, making me think a proper counterpick is the best solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Fucck","date":"2016-10-14T19:40:39.177+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm if you really want to counter him try {{champion:3}} , If Malz uses his e on you then you got some free health :D.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkale","date":"2016-10-14T16:27:55.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone with long range, strong aoe, or poke is a good counter since he needs to wind up with his voidlings to do much damage until late.\n\nBe wary of his ult though, 2.5 seconds is long enough for his jungler to come help and finish you off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-10-14T19:43:55.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:101}} works OK against him. You've got the range to knock his shield off, and the AOE to destroy his Voidlings before they can become a full blown swarm. Because of your stun's travel time you can occasionally stun him after you've been suppressed, getting yourself out (conditional on voidlings/minions being in the way and reaction time).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Banana Nations","date":"2016-10-14T05:56:41.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many ranged mid laners that you can take cleanse on do well against malz; orianna, cass, syndra, gp ( not with cleanse), anivia vel koz vlad.

I remember Lucian being particularly annoying. He would doubletap the first minion almost as it spawned and remove the whole CD as a threat. Once he got MS I couldn't ult him, I couldn't damage him with my main damage, and I could barely hit him with my silence.
