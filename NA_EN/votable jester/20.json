Thus that is where you should aim rather than the center of their body.  For most champions, this isn&#039;t super noticeable, but then...\r\n\r\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nl4nBtzJfkY/V-GuiFxYCHI/AAAAAAAAUzE/w1bUYfLpla0b4vHBxPmDibQ8_66oSfdigCLcB/s640/ivern.jpg\r\n\r\nI think in his case, many people will naturally aim towards the far more eye-catching body/head of him, rather than the plain feet way further down.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t really expect Riot to make any changes in regards to this.  It&#039;s far too late into the process for such a minor issue, and I can&#039;t really say what could be done besides a complete overhaul of his in game model, which I think many would be opposed to.\r\n\r\nThis is more of a warning to those who read this.  Don&#039;t forget to aim for the tall guy&#039;s feet.","replies":[{"poster":"Gary B Enkelis","date":"2016-09-21T06:59:25.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice point.
