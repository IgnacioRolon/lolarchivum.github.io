This would mean that whoever is around them gets the full minion experience, making it possible for mages and such to go down there without losing out on experience.\n\nOf course, the experience generated would need to be lower than the experience from killing the minions to prevent everyone from just taking the item.\n\nThe only issue I see with this is that it will be a strict buff for adcs down bot (since they&#039;d get more experience than they used to), but if other classes go down there, maybe that would balance out.\n\nThis idea just popped into my mind and I am rather behind on sleep, so it may be a stupid idea.  If it is a stupid idea though, I'd be happy to read about why so I can do better in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2018-05-18T18:49:23.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports having less experience than their carries is outright horrible. Playing a support, ANY support, and being level 1 while your carry is level 2, or being level 2 while your carry is level 3, is outright unplayable. If the enemy team has even a slight advantage in lane, they can just engage on you the instant their carry hits level 3 and there's nothing you can do to stop them. And then you die and then you lose lane and probably the game just because the enemy ADC could clear minions faster than yours.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-05-18T18:53:49.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you'd have an advantage in your adc reaching level 2 way before the enemy (if they didn't take a support item).

This would make it good for supports like bard or pyke to roam more while staying fairly even in exp. when they get back to lane the exp gained over time is increased for a little bit so they can catch up to their opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-05-18T21:36:47.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm extremely tired, so I'm having some difficulty following that right now, but there's plenty of room for this to be tweaked.\n\nThe main idea is that the support still gets their experience, and whoever goes bot gets full experience now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
