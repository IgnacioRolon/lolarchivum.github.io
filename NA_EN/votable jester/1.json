When I load a non-GD thread, the posts seem to be rather randomly arranged when set to discussion view.  While they used to sort by highest to lowest vote-level, it just seems totally random now, often with replies with a single upvote and no replies of their own appearing at the top.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help (or explanation) that is provided.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T04:40:53.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know....I hadn't actually paid attention to how they were organized in discussion view, you're talking about replies within a thread right? I'm pretty sure they were always listed by time of response, with the replies nested in the same time of reply order. I'm not sure they were ever arranged by votes, but could definitely be wrong!

If it remains an issue, I'll probably just open a support ticket and see what can be done (unless I was enjoying a bug up until now xD).","replies":[]}]}]}
