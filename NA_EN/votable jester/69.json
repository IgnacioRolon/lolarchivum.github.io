It&#039;s not really to do with ARURF specifically, but this has only really been noticeable to me there.\n\nMy teammates just seem to be terrible in there.  This last game, the Lux on my team wen 0/9/1.  On LUX.\n\nThat&#039;s just the most recent example.  For at least 70% of my ARURF games it&#039;s been either I carry hard af, or we get crushed by the fed af guys on the other team.  I too do occasionally lose my lane pretty bad, but nowhere near as often (or generally as severely) as the other people I seem to be matched up with.\n\nBeyond that, those same people often end up going afk in base after raging about op champions.\n\nI have had at least 2 games this weekend with 2 people afk in my base at the same time.  One of those times it happened within 10 minutes of the game&#039;s start.\n\nWhy must URF be so much more toxic than even ranked?  I&#039;ve practically had to 1v5 a couple games.\n\nMy win-rate is still above 50% (don&#039;t remember what it is exactly) and my rank is Plat 5 right now, so it doesn&#039;t make sense for me to keep having to play with people who make so many basic mistakes.  It just builds up to make it extra frustrating when I get stuck playing with these people.  It makes me feel like I&#039;m doomed to be stuck with having to 1v5 if I want to win.  I don&#039;t want to have that kind of pressure in a fun little game.\n\nI&#039;d much rather have a game where 1-2 enemies are 2-3 kills ahead, and becoming a bit threatening.  That is a fun challenge to overcome.   On the other hand, it&#039;s far less fun having to try to work around an enemy who&#039;s up 10 kills and counting thanks to a teammate who just keeps trying to take tower without a single ward.\n\nI don&#039;t want to leave you thinking I&#039;ve got such a massive ego that I think I&#039;m the epitome of perfection or whatever.  I know I have many faults, and there are areas I can improve on in my games; however, I am certainly doing better than the majority of the people I&#039;ve been teamed up with in ARURF.\n\nTLDR (Not sure why I&#039;m even including this...): I&#039;m annoyed with being paired up with so many teammates who go 0/9 in lane in ARURF even on champions like Lux.\n\nPS: Sorry if this doesn&#039;t belong in Gameplay.  I wasn&#039;t sure where else it would go though, except maybe Player Behavior.\n\nEdit:  Ok so it's not \"Just a little vent\"","replies":[]}
