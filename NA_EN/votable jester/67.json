Not even as an adc honestly.the sudden burst of his E really helped him out as an ap caster and it getting nerfed is quite sad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2016-11-22T11:31:17.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Kog is awful to play against and they probably realize it. Either you have somebody that can dive and kill him easily, or he pokes your entire team off of every objective. \n\nAs for where his AP build is currently, those few players that do play AP Kog have been rocking a 54% winrate since they partially reverted the marksman update Kog changes. With that high of a winrate on his mid lane, they can't really do a whole lot to adc Kog who has been dealing with a 46% winrate for an extra patch longer.","replies":[]}]}
