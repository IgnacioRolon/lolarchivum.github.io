It reduces the base cooldown by up to 15%, meaning it will take a 100 cooldown ultimate down to 85 seconds, same as other CDR.  The difference is when regular CDR is added to this.  Regular CDR acts on the cooldown after it has been reduced by Ultimate Hat.\r\n\r\nSo with that example of the 100 second base cooldown ult, It drops down to 85 seconds with Ultimate Hat.  With 40% CDR, it becomes 60 seconds.  With both Ultimate Hat and 40% CDR, the cooldown drops to 51 seconds rather than the 45 seconds that people think it would reach.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t an incredible deal, but I&#039;ve been noticing this a lot today, and thought people may want to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2018-04-05T23:47:54.655+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or just say it stacks multiplicatively, not additively.\n\n100 seconds x 15%CDR x 40%CDR = 100 x (1-0.4) x (1-0.15) = 100 x 0.6 x 0.85 = 51 seconds","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathToEcchi","date":"2018-04-06T12:50:08.373+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"TL;DR\n\nUltimate Hat is most effective on champs that need their ult up, but don't want to buy CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-04-06T13:50:15.484+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk why people are downvoting you, this is actually how it works","replies":[{"poster":"AquariusGine","date":"2018-04-06T16:03:24.270+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TeCoolMage,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VNmQraWE,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2018-04-06T13:50:15.484+0000)\n>\n> Idk why people are downvoting you, this is actually how it works\n\nThere is something wrong with the boards, every thread starts off with downvotes and negative comments, and only  after a while will the upvotes start coming in","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-04-07T03:51:33.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh so it IS the new police","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2018-04-06T13:57:41.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do see reasoning behind your comment, but i think u were getting downvoted because it requires multiple ult casts to actually reach highest CDR; most games are already one-sided by the time a champ can cast ~~10 EDIT:~~ 5  ults for max CDR, in which case ult hat is probably not the best choice.
