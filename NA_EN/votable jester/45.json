Those that actually do know what they are talking about can at least properly discuss what is/isn&#039;t wrong and what could be done to improve the situation.\r\n\r\nOverall though it just seems like a circlejerk cannot be stopped by reason.  Comments that provide nothing to an argument are upvoted and anything against the circlejerk gets downvoted to the point that nobody even sees it.  Maybe all voting should be removed from comments and simply be on the original thread (to indicate that there is something interesting there).  Idk, currently it just feels like discussion is impossible there.","replies":[]}
