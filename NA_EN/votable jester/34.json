Kata is full toilet paper, but she has 2 mr more than the rest... Lets not revert the rylai nerfs so she can be proper mid/late game and just take away 2 MR from her, like she isn't toilet paper already... right? Oh forgot... remember that damage reduction on her e? WE're still not giving it back! Enjoy all other melee champs been able to build tons of HP items that give tons of dmg too... But at least she has same MR as them! Next patch ,we'll nerf the armor cuz it's too much... We'll actually gut the HP by half too. Just for the lulz","replies":[]}]}
