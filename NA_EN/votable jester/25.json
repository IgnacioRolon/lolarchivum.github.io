He gets free AP from csing with his Q, so you have to get ahead in cs to effectively stay even.\r\n2: He gets free AP from hitting you with any of his spells (even the stun ring), so if you don&#039;t gain something from the trade, he effectively won it.\r\n3: He gets extra free AP from killing you, so trading kills works to his favor as well.\r\n\r\nNow, I&#039;m not saying the lane cannot be won.  Generally, I just push it in quickly and try to build up leads in other lanes, but assassins can definitely build up a lead within the mid lane.\r\n\r\nMy real issue is that unless you are an assassin who can destroy Veigar without getting killed in the process, you will nearly always lose to him in any interaction or even lack of interaction you have.  The AP he gains isn&#039;t precisely the problem with it, but rather the fact that he does gain permanent AP for that that I dislike.  It makes it feel like there&#039;s no &quot;right&quot; way to deal with him.\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t come into this asking for a change to him, but I suppose in a way, I do want some changes for him.  I&#039;d like him to get maybe a little more AP from cannon minions and large monsters, but to get rid of the AP gains on hitting an enemy with any spell.  This way, he would still be well rewarded for csing and killing, but not for mindless harass.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-07-24T16:40:03.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"anyone with long range poke such as{{champion:115}}, {{champion:101}}  or{{champion:99}}  are all good vs him {{champion:25}}  is also good because you can spellshield\nim sure there are others.\n\nthe issue is lategame he becomes unstoppable","replies":[{"poster":"Keepe","date":"2016-07-25T00:27:15.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree at this point that he's a bit problematic. Mostly because of the Hitting Champion thing as well as changing his ult into essentially a Garen Ultimate. I'd suggest changing AP gains back to how they were (1 per small minion, 2 per large minion and 1-5 for kill/assist), and just making his Ultimate a burst, 1/1 AP ratio without any other interactions (IE More AP = Damages, though I do miss it, and the idiotic execute he has now.)","replies":[{"poster":"Mirkhail","date":"2016-07-25T01:49:57.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He would need way more change, he would be worse than before the mini-rework, at least the enemy ap scaling ult was worth something, the 1/1 ratio ap ultimate without nothing else is pretty boring","replies":[{"poster":"Keepe","date":"2016-07-25T07:23:39.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Frankly, I just wish they left him alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirkhail","date":"2016-07-25T11:55:30.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe now they won't nerf him when he have a positive win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Keepe","date":"2016-07-25T14:26:46.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito?

That's why he has a {{item:3135}} \n\nReally squishy? I don't think I need to explain that.\n\nHonestly, they need to go back to pre-rework Veigar and cut the AP he gets from CSing in half. Or just leave it at one AP per. I'm just tired of getting one-shotted by a Veigar ult because he's been farming safely for 20 minutes and he has 500 AP with two items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2016-07-25T12:01:41.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last paragraph is basically asking riot to revert the viegar's mage update.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-07-25T08:15:40.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't the best designed champion, but he is far from the worst. Considering that (and given that he is not statistically OP atm), I would not support any nerfs to him. He's also quite vulnerable to hard-isn counters, both in the form of champions and itemisation (banshee's). \n\nThe AP on harrass is to encourage Veigar to harrass. If he didn't have that passive he would be quite likely to farm and farm....and farm and farm and be non-interactive for a large portion of the game. He can still do this, _but_ he sacrifices damage and makes a trade-off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mirkhail","date":"2016-07-24T12:08:39.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are overestimatinverg the ap he get when trading early, if he hit an ability he only get one ap,  in a normal early combo he could theorically get 3 ap but you can easily trade him back, most mage and assassin will actually outdamage him early, especially if they avoid his w.\nSince veigar loose early trade you can zone him, he will still try to farm with his q so he will always have low mana, both his q and w are pretty easy to avoid in lane.\nI think you shouldn't think too much about the ap he get from farming or poking, play as you would do against other weak early game mage, zone him and force him to use his w to farm.\nBefore the recent changes veigar got ap only from farming with q and killing enemy champions, this made him passivly farm with q all of the early game, he would not interact, poke or fight until he was able to oneshot you, riot made this change to incentive interaction and make him healthier for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-24T16:28:37.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that the AP isn't massive from each one, and I know that there are plenty of ways to win the lane.  My issue is the mental feeling that he gains more from most things than I do, so it feels like he wins in more situations than he should.  In actual gameplay, he's fine.\n\nI do have to argue that the change doesn't really give incentive for interaction aside from occasionally throwing a max range Q through a minion at you.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirkhail","date":"2016-07-24T19:14:14.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you fell the same about nasus or sion? Maybe you simply don't like the idea of  infinite scaling champion.\nBefore this change veigar was actually \"punished\" when he used his q to poke because he could not longer use it to farm ap. Now instead he is incetives to at least try to play aggressive and someone who play aggressive is easyer to punish and generally more fun to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-25T00:16:49.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus and Sion can be zoned, and they only get stacks from killing units.
