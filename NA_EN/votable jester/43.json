So I tried to reconnect, but all that came up was a white screen that gave the error noise whenever I clicked on it.  I exited and closed the client to try again from scratch, but just got a white screen again.  I tried that once more, but waited for a little bit this time.  Still, no progress.\n\nMy friends (foolishly) didn&#039;t remake, and are currently stuck in the 4v5.  It&#039;s just norms, so no big deal, just an annoyance that I hope will not occur again.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, I play on a Mac.  Though it's been fine for previous games today and in the last few days.","replies":[]}
