She got super fed, and could then one-shot pretty much any of us.  Being Lux, this was super annoying as I couldn&#039;t simply pick her off, and she&#039;d kill me before my snare even landed on her most of the time.\r\n\r\nAnyways I just want some advice on playing against Evelynn in the future, in particular as an immobile, squishy mage in the mid lane (because I mostly play those, and it can be too late to counter pick).  I welcome advice for any point in the game, and everything from builds to warding to positioning.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-05-02T03:11:29.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need to make sure every person on your team has placed a pink ward.. \nalso if you have players like {{champion:17}}  {{champion:202}} {{champion:76}}  they can trap chokepoint with stealthed traps ot cover as many remaning areas as possible...\nbut in solo que.. if/after she is fed.. just stay grouped at least that way when she blows here spells to kill you she wont get out for free. as within proper vision/ steal reveal tools cant really see where she is going to come from.\n\ni don't play  {{champion:28}}  so that's all i really got... a eve player with better knowledge of exactly how her abilities work might be able to provide more specific counter tips","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2017-05-02T03:06:41.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what I do is take an oracle and spam it behind a choke because I know shes coming from arelative area","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2017-05-01T22:30:33.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If eve is fed its already too late. But if you are getting oneshot continiously go for mr as if you were a tank. Go for {{item:3102}} and {{item:3001}} to avoid beeing completly useless.\nIf she is not snowballing, eve is almost useless in late game, with the ap build. And probably eve will not build full ap if she's not fed. At this point eve is not dangerous to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-05-01T22:33:41.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.  Also any advice to prevent her from getting fed would be helpful, like where to ward, and common gank times.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-05-01T22:40:10.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing you can really do against Eve is ward her camps to know where she is in her own jungle some of the time.  This will give you an idea of when ganks are incoming so you can play safe.  If you don't know where she is, freeze lane in front of your tower.  As a middle laner, a control ward in the river bushes will also help quite a bit.  Ask your jungler to put one in the opposite river bush from you.  By river bushes, I mean the small bushes in the middle of the river by baron and dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-05-01T23:02:14.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mkay thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
