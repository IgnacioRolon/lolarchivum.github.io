If you consider how people acted when solo que was removed, it was the same basic behavior. Just in this case, it's people going \"it's an overpowered one-shot meta, I'm behind, so I don't want a worse KDA. Unlucky. Next game.\" This is compounded already over the early season feelings of \"Why is x position 0/8/0 by this point in my game? We've lost.\" Even worse if it's at two positions. The game is more team-based; the player base isn't that way. Maybe if Clash had ever gotten to function it might have bolstered the mentality a bit more in a trickle down effect (that's likely optimistic). But that obviously didn't happen.\n\nGames on top of this are assumed quicker (even if statistically way less than the actual---it's what? 22-25 m on average? but players are still quoting the game is over in 8 to 15 minute marks). You might see an improvement based off what's done with crit ADCs, but I feel it's about re-establishing a mindset for the player base for a while instead.

Mostly just musing with the community about the mindset of how games feel. Because this thread is essentially \"I have demotivated teammates. It sucks to play with the expectation we're going to be giving it our all as a team.\" Functionally, for many, that's the high they're seeking with League (obviously there's the montage players/skill expression solo-seekers).\n\nWhat you're expressing is what a solo player will consider for their own mental fortitude/climb. And just looking out on average how it is that games can play out. One of the issues with League is there is the honorable/good Samaritan route as you play with others while also looking at cold facts / skill discrepancies / systematic issues / is it worth it to be honorable to a high extent.  The weighting between the two tends to suggest the bare minimum; it obviously comes out in frustration as players with different mindsets get frustrated over how their teammates are playing (especially if you're not hardcore grinding games a day). {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2018-06-15T15:03:27.260+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think alotta people are just burnt out of this game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Otarito","date":"2018-06-15T13:24:25.733+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree 100% with you on this, but from what I've seen and been told by many players, people are just assuming wins/losses in champ select just through team comps alone (probably because they see a streamer play/play against a champ and claim it's busted and therefore they just see the champ get 1 kill and it's GG to them)\nPersonally I find enjoyment out of League through long matches where one team gets ahead, and the other team starts playing together and getting good picks until they are able to even the gold lead.
