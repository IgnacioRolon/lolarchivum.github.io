I always love seeing Red posts on these forums (or anywhere really). Could you also send a \"OMG THAT'S SO COOL\" to the skin team that made Wukong's flying cloud? Like, I seriously contemplated buying Wukong for the skin alone. Alas, Arcade Miss Fortune and Iron Scale Shyvana had to happen first. :S","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-02-01T01:50:17.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Could you also send a \"OMG THAT'S SO COOL\" to the skin team that made Wukong's flying cloud?\n\nWill do!","replies":[{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2016-02-01T02:25:12.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome! \n\nJust a quick question though, which Eastern Asian art were you guys looking at when you did this Log-In Screen? Kanagawa's the Great Wave immediately comes to mind, but it has a lot of qualities found in Kakemonos across Japan. I just don't want to assume your inspirations were primarily Japanese based because Korea/China has beautiful and similar art as well.","replies":[]}]}]}
