So I go to play a game, get to champ select, select my champ. We wait for 10 secs for game to start, and the window closes like normally. Except I don't see an LoL thing. So, I wait for a minute, and still nothing. I figured my game crashed. I re-log in, terminate my previous session, and come to the reconnect screen. I click \"reconnect\" and the same thing happens. I try this a few more times, unfruitfully. I then watch a show, hoping it may have just been a temporary thing. I try again, hoping to make a late entry rather than be absent totally. Same thing happens. I try a few more times until the game won't even boot up, having PvP.net Patcher Kernel thing appear. I try running as an administrator, as that usually bypasses the issue. Nope, same thing. So I gave up and prayed it would work today.\r\n\r\nSo here I am, trying to get in a game, same thing happens-it crashes right before champ loading screen. I then terminate, re-log and reconnect. I crash again. Anyone here know how to fix this? I would greatly appreciate the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-23T21:40:53.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client may be having a hard time establishing a solid connection to the gameserver.
