Actually both Jhin and Kled ran into the same problem for me. Not swear words- but visual descriptions that were deemed too violent for a T-teen ESRB rating.   In both cases though,  gotta give props to our production people (Product Owners,  Production Managers, Editors, and Legal staff) . They spent a lot of time finding out what was the maximum level we could deliver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zydron","date":"2016-07-26T05:07:28.672+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I wanna know what Jhin's line was","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-07-26T05:21:27.742+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Jhin's recall.

Something like does he create physical contact with his victims (like most serial killers, but most of them kill because of sexual reasons....?), OR just dances around them, from a distance  - \"standing in the background, conducting the performance\"? \n\nIt would be a great help for getting the character right for artistic reasons (I'd like to draw a Jhin-Sona encounter, and I have to make sure the composition is perfect!). :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2016-07-26T05:25:53.933+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's hilarious, though I admit the high pitched screaming annoys me.
