My cousins from Swiss also played this game a while ago on my computer whenever they would come over to my country,and they never complained about these problems or asked me what is wrong with my machine,but then again the last time they played here was 2 years ago and I think a lot has changed since then.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T23:44:27.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As you mentioned, your cousins may not have experienced network issues since a lot has changed in 2 years. The same is true about networks and ISP routing to the server; these things change **all the time**, often without you ever noticing. Huge latency (ping) shifts are commonly a result of ISP routing changes that result in spikes in the time it takes your connection to reach the server. \n\nSometimes local settings can exacerbate this issue, so I recommend ensuring your network settings are aligned with the specs in [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Let me know if you continue to have issues after doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Vindicta245","date":"2016-09-15T15:47:34.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks but I've always had good connection to the internet,I guess it was the PC that was the issue because I've changed my PC and Lol works fine now...\nTy for the reply anyways :)","replies":[]}]}]}
