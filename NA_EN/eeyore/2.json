I assumed the refund would be in time for the start of the blue essence sale - but now I'm scared to spend any.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, just saw the missions. Although Loot is current disabled, so I can't open the Blue Essence container.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T21:11:51.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice! Got it figured out all on your own. For anyone else that sees this, you do need to play a game which will complete the new missions for you. Those missions start the rune refund!","replies":[]}]}
