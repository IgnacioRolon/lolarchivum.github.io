All URLs in the email seem legitimate and take me to the actual League of Legends website (including the fact I'm already logged in). Can I ignore these emails, or has my password actually been reset now?\n\nI understood from the Merch Email that they only got my email address and contact details - but that's still enough to apparently harass my inbox. -_-\n\nEDIT: Yes, I was forced to change my password. Well at least you don't force me to pick a new password each time. ","replies":[]}]}]}
