Those around you that do the same thing you do get better as well.\r\nAnyways I&#039;m still gonna post on the boards but I won&#039;t play anymore. Hell I don&#039;t even watch league analysis content anymore....\r\nAlso I found this twilight zone video relevant to today. Check it out.\r\nhttps://youtu.be/oADlQPJ_Zfc","replies":[]}
