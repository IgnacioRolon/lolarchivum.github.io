I also don't recommend locating specific files from unofficial resources, as that can be pretty risky.  The updated client should be available through another name in your same game directory, unless manual deletions were made.\n\n- Navigate to your League of Legends installation folder. (Typically C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n- Open the client by using \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n- Repair the client by selecting the “?” button in the top right-hand corner of the Patcher window (the first window that appears) and under the options menu, select Repair.\n\nYou can also use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to run an automatic clean reinstall.\n\nLet me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
