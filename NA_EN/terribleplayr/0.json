Who are the offenders that most need correcting and who are the root cause of most problems? Answers follow.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a highlight video or watched a streamer or pro gamer make a really sick 1v3 outplay... and kill two or three enemies before they go down? Have you ever wanted to make a play that good yourself? Have you ever seen someone get hard counter-picked, camped by the enemy jungler, regularly roamed on by the enemy midlaner... and somehow the enemy support finds time to roam to their lane too? Usually that means that person is being targeted to have a very bad game. Only... what would you say if they are up in cs and about even or even winning in kda vs their lane opponent DESPITE being targeted by so much pressure. You&#039;d call that some amazing play. You&#039;d think... wow that guy is really good. And you&#039;d expect (aside from &quot;bronze 5&quot; meme&#039;s) that his/her teammates would be snowballing the rest of the map really hard. You&#039;d expect them to start counter-ganking for the player who&#039;s 40ish cs up and has positive kda while being camped THAT hard.\r\n\r\nWhat would you not expect? Telling that player they&#039;re terrible. Saying they&#039;re dumb. Flaming them because they don&#039;t tp the second they see bot gets ganked 1 time omg. People telling that player that their build is trash and it&#039;s costing their team the game. Teammates expecting them to babysit the team because it&#039;s too hard for a midlane mage who can nearly 1-shot the minion wave with q to sit 4v4 and hold a tower without dying (*not actually too hard; team just acts like it is).\r\n\r\nHow would you feel? How would you feel when you&#039;re team flames and harasses you all game because for the SIXTH GAME IN A ROW... you&#039;re 2v1 camped and you took tp while your laner got to counterpick you and took ignite even though they&#039;d normally run tp. How would YOU respond when they spend the entire game calling you trash, horrible, stay bronze 5 dumb (insert your role here)? What would you say when they run in 3v5 and die trying to contest dragon vs fed enemies that you never died to and blamed you for their deaths. When they told you you&#039;re trash and selfish for wanting to save a tower in side lane from a 35+ minion wave before you go dragon, but they can&#039;t wait 6 seconds? When the enemy team can play safe as 4... staying outside of engage range of your team while he splits for a full 1.5 minutes to build a giant wave to shove to tower, then groups for teamfight; while your team won&#039;t play safe while you clear 2 minion waves in 20 sec to set up minion wave pressure in side lane before looking to group?\r\n\r\nIf you were watching a streamer and this was the person&#039;s teammates... you&#039;d call them bronze 5 trash. You&#039;d say they&#039;re the &quot;r&quot; word or suffering from the &quot;I&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;10&quot; &quot;T&quot; error. You&#039;d say the game is unwinnable; but unlike that person&#039;s teammates... you&#039;d know better than to think it were the streamer&#039;s fault. Some of you would say some even more extreme stuff. And if the streamer called his teammates dumbasses or something after seeing them do the same dumb stuff for 25 min straight... constantly blaming him for stuff that&#039;s obviously their fault, refusing to lift a finger to help him or to punish the camp of him by 4 man WINNING (not feeding 4v3 or whatever) elsewhere on the map... you&#039;d say he was 100% correct and justified in saying they&#039;re dumbasses. If asked if he was being toxic, you might say no... or you might say yes, but his teammates more than deserve it for how toxic and dumb they are being.\r\n\r\nSo... who is the biggest problem in league? Is it someone calling a teammate a dumbass? An idiot? Someone who snaps at their teammate(s) after being constantly harassed when they are playing as-good-as or better-than the rest of their team while being put in the most unwinnable of situations and still managing to come out ahead or even? Or is it the people who feed and throw while given all the help in the world, fail to play up to the standard of their elo, and pick one teammate that&#039;s playing far better than them to harass and flame all game with no logic to their claims?\r\n\r\nLike we all know the doublelift and rekkles flash memes. We all know players make mistakes and we can forgive one or two here and there. But say they did that flash play... 7x in one game. We&#039;d start wondering if they were accepting money to throw the game or trying to avoid being beaten by a nasty loan shark because they didn&#039;t have the money to pay them so they agreed to throw the match. At some point we&#039;d stop excusing them their bad play as simply a mistake. They might even get benched. Now suppose that 6 of those 7x... it&#039;s the adc flashing under the tower to 2v2 tower dive a full hp enemy adc and a leona support even though they aren&#039;t fed. And suppose their jungler is halfways across the map farming a jg camp or starting herald with their toplaner. And every time doublelift or reckkles dies in this scenario (you&#039;re not going to 2v2 a leona and an adc under their tower if you aren&#039;t fed) they tell their jg they are trash or they&#039;re being selfish. Would we blame the jungler? Is there any logic to the adc&#039;s argument and any justification for their action there? Would we expect the coach to bench the jungler for telling their adc to stop being an idiot? No. We&#039;d be surprised if the adc wasn&#039;t benched for performing far below the standards of pro play in such a scenario if anything.\r\n\r\nNow... solo queue may be different from pro play; however, there are still minimal skills and expectations at each elo. Obviously if I&#039;m challenger, I can&#039;t play like I&#039;m in plat and expect to win challenger games. I can&#039;t expect to play like plat, flame my teammates for my poor play and expect to get away with my toxicity and &quot;inting&quot;. If I&#039;m plat and I play like I&#039;m silver... same principles apply. If I&#039;m gold and my teammates play like they&#039;re bronze and flame me for their mistakes while they &quot;tower dive 7x as adc in 2v2 without being fed and I&#039;m halfway across the map doing something actually important&quot; so to speak... they have no justification for their action... they&#039;re being dumbasses... and they should be &quot;benched&quot; for their poor play and toxicity. But instead, these poor bronze players (I&#039;ve seen better players in bronze - and this is gold) are excused of all their actions and toxic chat. They&#039;re excused as &quot;bad game&quot; or &quot;unlucky&quot; when they&#039;re tower diving the enemy duo 2v2 for the 7th time without being ahead and without the enemy bot lane being low only to die and feed over 2 kills for 1 or 2 for 0... for the SEVENTH time so to speak. And they&#039;re blaming me for it. They know where I am. They know I can&#039;t help. They know what I&#039;m doing because I&#039;ve communicated it nicely via chat and pings. They&#039;re capable of playing around that info... because I am and the whole enemy team is as evidenced by the whole master yi thing discussed above. Or... if they aren&#039;t capable of playing around that... it just goes to show... they fail to meet bare minimum standards for this elo and need help finding their proper home... in bronze. No offense to bronze players. As I stated earlier... some of you guys are better than some of these people I run into in gold. Do I want you to have to put up with such poor teammates and deal with their harass and flame all game while they let their laner and the enemy jg 3 man camp you while they sit on their butt doing nothing? No. But maybe when put in their proper elo they won&#039;t be as bad of players... and at least they&#039;d stand a chance vs their opponents. If they continue to be toxic... maybe Riot report system would finally listen to SOMEONE (they never listen to me) and ban them for toxicity and intentionally throwing the game so you wouldn&#039;t have to deal with them either. But regardless... these bronze players need help finding a home. They don&#039;t need to be coddled and told &quot;I&#039;m sorry&quot;. &quot;I&#039;m sorry you had to put up with a teammate 1v3 out-performing you and refusing to be your tp-bitch like you wanted him to be... that he told you you&#039;re being an idiot because you intentionally fed and flamed him as though it was his fault for 25+ min straight while he outplayed and clawed himself advantages in a 1v3 where he should be getting wrecked... and then he looked for team plays only to have you ruin any potential of that happening by continuing to throw and blame him for everything&quot;. Don&#039;t shelter such toxic bronze players and excuse their poor play and flame. Do the right thing and find them a proper home.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-17T16:18:43.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the title of this post all I can hear is \"in the arms of an angel\" you too could help these poor bronze players find a home.

Anyone in bronze 5 that doesn't realize they're bad isn't going to through other methods, they're not being \"sheltered\". (also, riot is already cracking down a ton on toxicity, pb boards are full of people getting punished for toxicity)","replies":[{"poster":"terribleplAyr","date":"2018-09-16T18:50:41.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're going after the wrong people from my experience.\n\n1 in maybe 100 people I report are punished in any way... as low as a warning or as extreme as a ban - not sure what their punishment is... doesn't matter. I just want their poor behavior changed.\n\nWhat are they doing?\nmindlessly flaming teammate(s) (myself and/or others) with no logic or truth to their claims\n\nharassing others\n\nencouraging teammates to all gang up on someone (myself or other) and just talk to them like they're shit... ex: trash jg never ganks (after jg has been invaded half a dozen times and 2v1'd or 3v1'd while laner stood by and didn't lift a finger to help them... and then fed enemy jg and their laner needlessly before allowing their laner and the fed jg to invade our jungler again; ex: you can't blame them for being a useless dummy because they have adhd and their momma dropped them on their head when they were little\n\nconstantly blaming another person for THEIR mistakes ex: we've just won a few 5v5's off the back of some great initiation by support brand and me and I want to clear a side lane to create pressure and protect our tower. I ping 2x danger on top of team to let them know to play safe. I ping I'm going to clear \"this wave\". I type \"play safe for now\". I go to clear wave and then want to join for 5 man push while enemy has to deal with 2 massive waves in side lanes... only my team forced a 4v5 mid and got aced for only 1 kill. Our brand support then flames me and talks to me like I'm stupid and doing \"literally nothing\". Then I'm further harassed for not 1v4 contesting enemy baron force. Repeat stuff like that several times a game. And yet if brand or our adc goes to clear a side lane and someone else gets caught... whoever gets caught or forces fight is bad and the adc/brand is excused for doing... exactly what I'd done - even though I'd actually gone through extra effort (that they didn't) to warn my team to play safe during that time. There's some freaking logic lol.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo 1 in 100 of these people face punishment. But if I have these people in at LEAST 50% of my games - sometimes with MUCH HIGHER frequency and the INSTANT I say anything bad back to them I'm punished.... Like maybe they've been flaming and harassing me for 25 min straight, they've repeatedly got caught out 1v5 and died for no reason. They've walked into a 1v5, died, and convinced half the team to join them in treating me like shit because it's obviously my fault a  support runs into 4 enemies they can see coming with no backup that it's my fault they died and I'm selfish trash. They've forced 4v5's and 4v4's for no reason when me or another person isn't there and then I have to 1v5 hold our inhib or die to save rest of team for THEIR dumb engage because I'm a good team player (or according to them... a dumb feeder). And after all of that... I tell them they're being an idiot (not even \"you ARE an idiot\" - a state of being, but \"you're being\" - something they can CHANGE... a descriptor of the way they are playing and not the person - which IS  key difference), then I'm punished before I can even queue up for another game.\n\n* Now so that the point of this post isn't lost... I'm not discussing if me telling a teammate they're \"being an idiot\" is acceptable or not. My point is that IF that is instantly punishable by Riot report system... then there is NO REASON why I can see the behavior from my teammates like I see (directed towards me and/or OTHERS) with such frequency and maybe 1 in 100 of them face ANY kind of punishment. That is the problem. Like punish someone for telling a teammate they're \"being an idiot\" all you want in the scenario I describe. But then you can't excuse the type of stuff by such players that I describe with the absurd frequency with which you excuse it. What they're doing is far more toxic. What they're doing is far less logical. This is why I say Riot report system is not hitting the ROOT of the problem. You know how many times I say anything negative outside of games with teammates like I described above? Zero. None. Not a single match. You know how many games like those I describe above where I don't say anything toxic? The majority. You know why I say stuff in some which I should not? Because of those previous 2 statements: I'm not toxic for no reason, nothing is done about such toxic teammates in 99% of cases regardless of if everyone else (myself included) played perfectly nicely - and that pisses me off.","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2018-09-16T19:07:10.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system is a robot, it has no bias one way or another. Some things are punished harsher than others.\n\nThat being said, you do not usually get a feedback report from successful reports, so there is 0 way to know if someone received a chat ban for their actions.","replies":[{"poster":"terribleplAyr","date":"2018-09-16T19:53:49.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. it is horribly flawed\n2. there are multiple ways to know\na. how frequently do you encounter such behavior/players going forwards in league... if the frequency is high and does not decrease... nothing is being done obviously\nb. look up players on various websites and see their match history... they still playing?\nc. run into said player again... have same experience\n\nI'm seeing the behavior and chat issues like I've described in over 50% of my matches. Pretty sure if I hear maybe 6x a year that someone is punished... that's low even with the consideration like you said that TYPICALLY you don't hear if someone is punished.\n\nMoreover, if they were being punished and I just didn't hear about it... then the frequency with which I encounter such behavior would diminish over the past 2 seasons... not intensify.\n\nTherefore, we can very logically conclude... the vast majority of such players are not being punished. Which reinforces point 1 - the system is horribly flawed (and the root cause of most of league's toxicity is not being properly targeted or dealt with).","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2018-09-17T15:28:51.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm sorry you have that experience.

I would expect that a HUMAN being or two from Riot look into my case, determine my play is far below the standard for diamond/challenger and that my behavior is not excusable - regardless of if teammate(s) flamed me back or told me I'm playing like an idiot or anything. I would expect to be punished - chat restriction, temp ban if necessary, etc. \n\nI would expect my account to continue to be monitored closely and should I continue such poor play and behavior if/when allowed to play again and use chat, I'd expect even something as extreme as being insta-demoted to the elo most befitting the skill level with which I played - even if it was just occasionally at random or occasionally with specific teammates where I played intentionally poorly and was toxic. The same for if it were every game because I'd bought my account and couldn't slice it in master tier as a gold elo player. Nobody should have to be stuck playing with me simply because \"I'll eventually drop back down to gold where I belong... it's just a game or two of their mmr and elo that I'm ruining\". My toxicity of playing like crap and blaming my teammates the whole game should not be overlooked simply because Tyler1 or SoloRenektonOnly or Voyboy, or some other player gets fed up with my bs and replies to my toxicity with something toxic. Now... they might be punished too... but I surely should not be off the hook for my behavior.\n\nAnd quite possibly if my behavior is continually poor and my gameplay is continually sub-par for my elo I would expect to be banned.\n\n*I stress here... what is and is not poor gameplay is very ELO dependent. What might be sub-par or \"inting\" in challenger would be perfectly understandable in gold for instance because players aren't as skilled or knowledgeable in many respects. Similarly, what might be unacceptable in gold would be perfectly understandable in lower tier silver. Etc.\n\n*I also stress the REPEATED part. As in... not a singular occurrence of poor behavior and gameplay. Like even Rekkles and Doublelift have failed flash engages that throw games. But do the do it say... 5x in a row in one match? That's when we'd go from \"bad play\" or \"unlucky\" to questioning if they were being paid to throw. That's when  it's not... well he got a bit upset, but he got over it so whatever I forgive him. That is when it becomes clear that a behavior (words or actions) is intentional - not 5 as a magic number as 4 is okay, but merely using 5 as an example of... it is repetitive far beyond reasonable excuse.\n\nHope that clears some stuff up for you.","replies":[]}]}]}
