Only a pop-up of  the logo shows for a split second. Nothing else. \n\nThings I tried:\n- Reinstall: As LoL doesn't have a good uninstaller, I tried my best with Windows. Did do a CCleaner and downloaded again. Nothing worked.\n- Hextech Repair Tool: Reinstalled/Clean uninstall/repatch. At first I got a messed up version of the 'launch screen', but now I got nothing. I cannot try it again as the installation path is missing for some reason and I can't find the LeagueClient.exe file anymore.\n- Windows repair: I just resetted my PC a week back, same problems.\n- Some silly solution from the boards: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/IwIEcljO-league-wont-open-2017\nShort: Removed the LeagueClient file. Nothing.\n\nI am out of options, so who can help me to fix this mess?\n\nEdit: I managed to retrieve the LeagueClient.exe from the garbage bin and put it back in the corresponding LoL map. Now the HRT just breaks down: \"chromium embedded framework-error' or something when I try a reinstall.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T20:54:55.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooooo it sounds like this might be a simple case of a lack of admin rights. League seems to be attempting to open, but your OS could be viewing it as unsafe and stopping it before it opens. Make sure to give League the [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) it needs, and let me know if that still doesn't help.","replies":[{"poster":"Verocitos","date":"2017-08-28T21:56:50.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also send in a ticket and the the problem has been solved by one of your co-workers already!

Glad our techies were able to help! \n\nTypically those steps can get a little confusing for people when we aren't talking one on one, so I try not to go *too* in-depth here on the boards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
