Doubled crit chance is an unbalanced mechanic for both the player and his enemies.\n\nSide Note:\nOn release: {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} =100% crit\n\nThey nerfed the items because of Tristana and Kog'maw back a while ago. Yasuo couldn't have 100% from only two items any more. \n\nThen they completely disregarded him with these changes, focusing only on marksmen.\nHe can once again have 100% Crit from just two items, and now there are more options besides {{item:3087}} .\n\nEdit: I've made a few threads about this. As I said before, I think this change could be implemented if they **also** undid all of the nerfs to his other abilities. (shield decrease, flow regen decrease, E damage halved, R damage reduced)","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-17T04:01:45.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted about this earlier today, but the issue with removing his crit chance is as follows.\n\nYasuo gets double crit so he can afford to build defensive items and still have decent damage. They allow this because then they can give him lower base stats. Because of those garbage defensive stats and his need to engage at close range, he's given a regenerating shield and his dashes to both close the gap and help him mitigate and/or evade damage.\n\nIf you remove half his passive, then you end up with a barely-functioning kit because then Yasuo has to build all damage, and all damage Yasuo is awful and dies instantly to anything. Also, that leaves a significant portion of his power budget unused.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2015-11-17T04:05:10.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edited to suit this.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-17T04:15:41.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, as much as I like the consistency of 100% crit chance, I'd be more or less ok with losing it, but given just how strong that passive is and how it relates to the rest of his kit, there would have to be some serious compensation buffs, and I'm not even sure what they'd look like.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2015-11-17T06:14:42.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said in the edit (and I've said in a few previous threads), I think the rest of his on-release kit should be returned to its on-release stats if the doubled crit is removed. It'd be perfectly balanced, as he'd need to use the E for its damage early (and I really miss the old ultimate range).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-11-17T04:24:56.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I've said it a thousand times but I'll say it again.\n\nIf your champion design needs double crit, free shield, infinite mobility, massive armor pen, free CDR, and a giant a wall that blocks all projectiles, simply to be \"viable\" than the design is not healthy and should be removed from the game.\n\nThis applies to so many of CertaintlyT's designs it's not even funny.  Zed/Kalista/Yasuo/Morde all have BS that no champion should have and the fact that they need them just to compete is a picture perfect example of bad design that riot should stop trying to force.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2015-11-17T03:59:51.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His shield passive would have to come up more often though, because of trade offs. god forbid he not be op.....
