Jhin is a human, so of course it&#039;s fine that he looks human. Evelynn lures her victims with sex appeal, so of course she looks sexy. That&#039;s not what I&#039;m talking about. \n\nWe&#039;re lacking a character for which the visuals alone give a sense of fear, without the need for the voice or knowledge of their background. Urgot _used_ to be scary before his VU, but now he looks more cool than scary. Cho&#039;gath _could_ be scary if his model and animations weren&#039;t so stilted. \n\nAs it stands, there are no champions who actually look scary. \n*****\nI want to stress that I'm referring to the kind of scary that could scare you with its presence without the need to simply be large and imposing. A huge guy with an axe and an unpleasant look on his face is scary by default, but only because of the harm you know he can do with that axe due to his size. There are plenty of large, imposing champions in the game that don't give off a sense of fear. \nI'm also not referring to the idea behind visuals, but the actual visuals involved. Sure, the idea of being ground to mincemeat is terrifying. But the visual of your model simply being pulled to Urgot's and disappearing is not. \nLikewise, I'm not referring to the fear involved in being helpless during the game. When Urgot's ult suppresses you, you're afraid because you know you're going to die and can't do anything about it. Not because you're given a gory visual that makes you feel the pain. \n\nI can think of over a dozen small changes that could be made to champions to change them from cool or goofy to truly horrifying.

It really is difficult for them to make anything scary, especially given the style they now have. People have brought up Urgot, but Urgot _used to be_ scary. He's just plain not any more. He does look fantastic, but it isn't scary. \n\nA lot of the fear aspect in this game comes from the imposing power of champions, not anything truly terrifying. A massive guy with an axe is scary in a way just because you know you can't overpower him. The same way a monster truck barreling at you is scary.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2018-10-06T03:04:11.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think Riot can make champions and their abilities overly scary/graphic, as it may affect the rating of the game.

Which doesn't stand to scrutiny. Plain and simple, for the same reasons all of these methods aren't brutal-- that being that the visuals aren't graphic in this game-- Urgot is not brutal, either.

One thing I'm trying to stress is that _powerful_ does not equate to _frightening._ By default, a huge guy with an axe coming at you with an unfreindly expression is going to be a kind of scary, but not the kind that gives you nightmares from the visual. If you have nightmares, it will be about the possible outcome of being chopped to bits. \n\nThere are plenty of powerful champions in League. They're strong.

A stitched up decaying monstrosity doesn't seem scary to be because there's no real intimidation there. Is he big? Sure, but he's also pretty much falling apart. It may be unsettling at first, but once you realize how fragile he is, its really not anymore.\n\nI suppose it is more of a manner of opinion and personal fears/horror preferences. I, for one, am afraid of Nocturne. Something about the way he moves in game is just unsettling to me.

Old Urgot was scary even just with the model. If they had actually kept him dead and kept the decaying flesh and sewn-together pieces, he could've kept what made him scary. \n\nAs for Thresh, I can't agree. We actually have an example of Thresh that is very close to real-- Ghost Rider. A flaming skeleton who uses a chain to drag his enemies to hell, and while Nicolas Cage was a god awful choice for the casting (why the hell didn't they just use the same actor they used for young Johnny?), the parts where he's Ghostrider are well animated. But even then, it didn't look all that scary. \n\nAnd another thing, I really wanted to stress that the _idea_ of a champion is very different from the execution of their visuals. In this game, all Urgot does with his ultimate is drag your unmoving model to his and makes it disappear while gears do a grinding motion. That is completely different from actually showing each champion's blood, guts, and bones being ground down to mince meat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-10-06T04:57:37.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ebonmaw Dragon,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=XB1ou6jA,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-10-06T04:46:34.096+0000) \n> Thresh is basically a sadistic metallic skeleton on fire...
