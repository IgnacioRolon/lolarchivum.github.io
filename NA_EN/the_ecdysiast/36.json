He needed another item or to forego crit damage runes for crit chance ones.  We saw  decrease in his play and power even though champions he counters were being played more often. \n\n\nWhat happened now? \nThey undid the nerfs to {{item:3031}} and {{item:3087}}, and added critical strike chance to a lot more items, so he not only gets 100% with only two, but can get that with only two _and_ he has a very large selection compared to before. \n\nHis healing was an issue already, since he could build lifesteal off of critical strikes. The Keystone mastery only made it so he has a little healling earlier on.  \nThe main issue is that they completely ignored him when reworking the items. \n\n**They should have removed the doubled critical strike chance passive BEFORE his release, or even shortly after. He&#039;d be okay to play against if his kit didn&#039;t take such big hits in every area in order to keep the gimmicky passive intact. **\n\nEDIT _**IMPORTANT**_:** That is, if they were to remove that passive, I want them to revert the changes to his other abilities (besides the ultimate going from 50% to 50% bonus). That, with absolutely _no other_ form of buffing, would make him fair. **\n\nIt's also implied that they'd remove the passive self-nerf to crits as well. \n\n\n\n_TL;DR: ALL FOUR of Yasuo's abilities were nerfed to keep his gimmick passive. Remove the passive, undo those nerfs and he'd be a fine champion. A little risky, but that's what you get when you pick someone with a higher difficulty. _\n\nEdit 2: \nFor those of you who don't know what happened to Yasuo from release until now in order to keep his passive without him still able to 1v5, here's a list of the changes I want reverted in correlation with removing the critical hit related part of his passive (both the doubled and the 10% reduction on AA+25% reduction  on Q)\n\n**Q: Cooldown Capped at 1.33 seconds. Additionall attack speed no longer reduces the cooldown past this number. **\nThis was so much more fun when he could have a .5  second cooldown, and I'd **give up the Q's _ability to crit_ entirely** if I could have this back. \n**W: No longer passively grants flow when E is used.**\nBasically, they were making it so his abilities had more self interaction than anyone else. They removed this because he was getting a shield back too often for someone with guaranteed crits. Removing that risk-free damage increase would require he get the shield back. (though that's broken by one auto attack anyway, so unless you're Vlad or Swain, you have the burst to kill him after you AA)\n**E: Damage multiplier reduced from +100% after 4 dashes to +50% after 2. (technically the damage at 2 was completely unchanged, it just couldn't get any higher.) AP ratio reduced from 100%(maybe 80? I forget) to 60% **\nCan you believe people were actually complaining that he was using his E to poke and damage too much? It's a little funny. Bringing this back would require him to dash beforehand in order to have the damage for an all-out (so he'd have no means of escape for the next 5 seconds besides flash). The reduced AP ratio also wouldn't need to stay, since _Trinity Force no longer gives AP. _\n**R: Range reduced. Damage slightly reduced.**\nAh, the good 'ole days when you could have an Alistar bot and a Cho top, then just walk to mid-River and R in. \nI miss that. It made for some great opportunities (also lead to some horrible mistakes, R'ing in when the enemy had our guys outnumbered). I don't particularly care about the damage, and the _penetration change should remain as-is for itemization purposes. _\n\nEdited again: The reason for the gimmick:\nAt release, Yasuo was the only champion in the game who had any sort of interaction with critical strike chance besides simply having 200% damage autos and an ability that could crit. \n\nThat is no longer needed, thanks to the changes made to Ashe, Graves, and Caitlin.\nHis core identity is not good as the doubled crit. It's enough that he has ranged AOE ability that works exactly the same as an auto attack in terms of every on-hit besides blinds. \n\n_**FINAL EDIT: **_\nJust as a side note, I think removing the Q's cooldown cap ALONE could make up for the removal of the crit:\n.5 is almost 1/3 the cooldown cap right now. \nThat means 3 times the Qs. That means a knockup 3 times as often. That means his CC is tripled. He may lose a little mid-game damage, but he'd gain a TON of late-game sustain+ability to help allies who need kills more than him, instead of having ONLY damage to get people assists and steal all the kills; how it is right now.

Reverting the nerfs:\n\n1. Passive: The 10% damage penalty now applies to Statikk Shiv;\n2. R: Range reduced to 1200 from 1300;\n3. W: No longer passively grants bonus Flow from dashing from bonus flow generated on Sweeping Strike 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20%;\n4. Passive:  Flow generation reduced at early ranks to per 59 / 52 / 46 units travelled  from 1% per 40 units;\n5. Passive: Shield strength reduced to 「 100 – 510 」 from 60 – 690;\n6. Passive: Shield duration reduced to 1 second from 2;\n7. E: Bonus damage cap reduced to 50% at 2 stacks from 100% at 4 stacks;\n8. Q: Minimum cast time increased to 0.18 seconds from 0.13;\n9. Cooldown reduction from attack speed reduced;\n10. Stats: Base health lowered to 462 from 512;\n11. Stats: Base movement speed lowered to 345 from 350;\n\n\nThese are the nerfs (live vs on creation) he received throughout his life. All these nerfs are just for mantaining double crits, if he had to lose double crits, he would still be incredibly strong and playable if these were to be reverted since he would have:\n1. MORE shield INCREDIBLY MORE often and for LONGER;\n2. 50% more stack damage on E;\n3. MORE Q;\n4. 10% more damage on statikk;\n5. MORE health;\n6. MORE MS;\n\nIf he's not viable with all these buffs and needs double crit to work, his design is just that POOR and he's just so UNBALANCED that he SHOULD NOT be in the game.\n\nSo the removal of his double crit is indeed balanced out more than enough if these nerfs were to be reverted, maybe some SMALL buffs would help people at \"learning him again\", but he would be balanced and totally viable. Remember: if a chap needs so many nerfs to be balanced because he's got some strange mechanic in his kit, usually removing that mechanic and reverting the nerfs isn't guttig him, but giving him a balanced spot, which Yasuo lacks at his core.","replies":[{"poster":"AceBlack","date":"2015-11-22T23:09:15.525+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Strong base damages?\" Hardly.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_champions%27_attack_damage\n\nHe's not bottom of the barrel, but he's not anywhere near the top.

Something he shares with Trynd, Fiora, Yi as a class called \"Melee ADCs\". And you want to remove his only steroid. No, it does not matter if you give him 50% more damage on his mobility skill (that's like giving corki 50% more damage on his non-delivery W), no it does not matter if you give him 10% more damage on shiv.\n\nIf a DPS class cannot do DPS, they are worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Valexfor","date":"2015-11-23T00:39:46.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo's q: PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+ 100% AD) COOLDOWN: 4, with that CD and it's sinergy with as + ad his damage is pretty strong.\nBase damage doesn't just mean base ad, but the literal damage output he has without items. Xin Zhao has High base damage and he's got only 3 ad more than Yasuo, why? because his q actually scales [100% total ad + 20% bonus ad + flat damage] and without items/runes/masteries that's 58 + 15 per hit so 73 x 3 on a 9 sec cd and goes on cd After either all strikes are done or 5 seconds have passed since his las aa and with a base as of 0.672 he will need almost 2 sec at level 1 to actually do the full combo so 73 x 3 every 11 seconds. Yasuo has 75 damage every 4 seconds on a single hit with his q so his damage doesn't come from sticking to an enemy unlike Xin so under perfect circumstances with only q damage Xin will do 219 damage every 11 sec while Yasuo wil do 225 in 12 sec at level 1.\nBut let's see a skill that calculates damage exactly like Yasuo's q, Irelia's q [100% total ad + 20] (Irelia 62 base ad) 82 and can cast it every 14 sec at level 1, only 7 damage more than Yasuo with 10 sec more on cast, so under perfect circumstances, only with q Irelia does: 82 every 14 sec, Yasuo does 300 every 15 and Irelia is considered to have High base damage.  If you want to throw in some aa: Yasuo as 0.658, Xin as 0.672, Irelias as 0.665 so Yasuo does MORE than Xin and Irelia in a head-on fight, but since he's got less health (withouth counting the shield) he would still lose if not shielded. They are all melee carries (Yes fighters are all melee carries) so I'm not talking about other classes. As you can see Yasuo has good level 1 (and so base) damage. I did never talk about ad in the first place, but I wanted to show you numbers that actually say I'm right, and if you're not confident about these number, when they all get the first power spike (level 3) Yasuo has his mobility and more range on his damage source, so he can poke them while not taking damage and block the eventual unfortunate damage of their gap closer with passive.\nAlso Yasuo has something most melee carries don't have: mobility, a strong shield and a wall that blocks every projectile. So he's considered a melee carry (fighter), but he's actually an Assassin, and assassin Yasuo is always better than fighter Yasuo, like Jax is built like an assassin (so full damage) but plays like a fighter. Why assassin Yasuo is better? He is just too safe to bother building anything tanky when you can just 100-0 the whole enemy team.\n\nRemoving double crit would make Yasuo more Q dependant for his damage, and that's actually good, since he won't be able to q creeps then e + q on you for half of your HP without any counterplay. This way he would have to use his e 3 times before coming to you if he wants to do some damage and he would still not chunk your healt by half with a non-counterable combo. That said: with better shield (stronger, easier to charge thanks to w extra flow on e and better base flow generation and that lasts longer) lower q cd, more health and more MS he would be able to engage, do his thing and disengage with minimal loss for him, and when the enemy is kinda low do his full combo, ult and kill you, but it would be fair since you would have time to actually heal back or you could try to fight back while he goes all in on you, it would be player's skills vs player's skills, not player's skill vs player's skill + totally unfair double crit shit, that most times than not is the only reason Yasuo players win trades, by sheer, dumb crits for which they actually pay nothing in exchange.\n\nIf you are still not convinced that Yasuo is strong even without double crit after all that math and explanations, then:\n\"Way of the Wanderer's critical strike damage penalty with Steel Tempest is 25% instead of 10%, and applies only to the AD portion of the damage. With 100% critical damage (base), the bonus damage equates to simply 50% AD (200% × 0.75); with 150% critical damage (Base + Infinity Edge item.png Infinity Edge), the bonus damage equates to 87.5% AD (250% × 0.75)\"\nAs you can see he would still not lose too much damage on his q without losing his double crit.\n\nAfter the double crit removal I would still give him some base ad buff (like 3-4) and maybe a bit of extra flat damage on q (maybe 10 per level), but he would still work, never said he should be gutted, I like his kit's concept actually, but I want him to be balanced and fun to play against since even when he's 0/6 once he gets statikk (and later IE) he starts winning no matter what.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TacoTheKitten","date":"2015-11-22T02:14:04.285+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I honestly feel like Yasuo would be downright horrifying without the crit passive.

Its such a valuble part of his kit its unreal. Not to mention he can't even ulti without getting knock ups which means he has to work for it. Basically you would need to Buff his HP regen his hp per level give him scaling mr which he does not have at all you would need to give him a steroid of some kind rather its damage attack speed or guaranteed crits. because as is he is super squishy and fails in team fights if he has to provide his own knock ups. So no i dont agree with this at all. Also he doesn't even scale with CDR he has to scale with attack speed to low the CD on Q he has to scale with Movement speed to lower the cd on his E his windwall is rediculous high CD and his ulti even off cd is not even used near as much as say malz ulti or annie or tryn or anyone else in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SolusInCadere","date":"2015-11-23T01:36:27.354+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES.

The sheer power Yas get's from just Statikk + Cloak of Agility is insane.
