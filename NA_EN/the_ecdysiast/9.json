Fid's Q is marginally useful in the jungle other than for removing Scuttle's bonus resistances. I think it's okay that Panth has an ability with good AoE DPS and high defensive utility at the cost of reduced single-target DPS.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-19T13:20:44.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that explains a lot.

But they don't.\n\nThey nerfed Tahm's ally moves, and now they've nerfed his non-ally moves. Where does Tahm go now? AFAIK, his non-ally moves haven't been nerfed as hard as his ally moves were, so top is still his best (least awful) lane.\n\nFid was more popular as support a while ago, until the Q nerf that specifically addressed his power in that role. I'm not really sure what he's supposed to do now. In theory, though, Fid jungle is still a thing, to some degree.\n\nIf you want another example, Garen's E significantly reduces his DPS against turrets.\n\nMy point is that not every ability is worth casting at all times.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JuiceBoxP","date":"2019-08-19T08:02:45.736+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't need to match auto attacking, it's a fucking immunity","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-19T09:13:52.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to actually substantiate that.

You are accepting a drop of your DPS in favor of getting complete damage immunity in one direction for the duration.
