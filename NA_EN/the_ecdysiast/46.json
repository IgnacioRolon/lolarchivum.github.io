The last time anyone played him was URF and even with the new (overpriced, since Kog's new one is actually better, but whoopdiediddlydo they changed the joke and dance so it costs a ton) skin, I doubt we'll be seeing him.","replies":[{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-02-09T23:00:47.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like playing Skarner with a slow.

So that 80% AP is very useless. I mean he need some reward to build tanky like Sejuani or Nautilus and that \"TOTAL Health\" is the thing that Skarner need in his kit. A huge shield that make him feel like a fast-truck. You are the responsable on the Skarner rework so please change his \"magic\" Shield into a very powerful \"solid\" shield. IMO has more sense the TOTAL Health scaling instead the AP...\n\n\nE. Bracken Crystal Wall \n\n\n>RANGE: 1100 COST: 70 MANA  COOLDOWN: 2 RECHARGE TIME: 39/ 35 / 31 / 27 /24\n> \n> PASSIVE: Skarner generates a new crystal wall periodically, and can only store up to 2 crystal wall at once.\n> \n> ACTIVE: Skarner creates an impassable wall of crystal at the targeted location for 4 seconds, perpendicular to which way he's facing. After the 4 seconds the wall explode causes magic damage and root all nearby enemies within 200-radius of the wall.\n> \n\nSkarner can use Impale on the crystal walls and drag the walls to an another direction Skarner can reactive his Impale to launch the wall to a target location. When it lands, it deals magic damage to all enemies in the area of impact and Stun them.

The damage of his E does not exist. I'll prefer  make a completly new E like the previously showed, It's very fustrating see that ridiculous damage, is like \"nothing\"..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2014-12-30T18:37:51.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His W need some change's to make feel more like a unostoppable tank:\n\n60/70/80/90/100 (+ 8/9/10/11/12 % TOTAL of Skarner health) and also make's some kind of tenacity buff. some like this: While the shield persists, Skarner gains 15% of tenacity.\n\nI'l agree with the increase of the duration of his passive stun ,turn into 0.75/1/1.25 feels better, now that everyone have acces to the tenacity elixir the stun duration need some review IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2014-12-14T02:07:53.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His downfall began with his rework, that removed:\nA) His permaslow\nB) His sustain\n\nTwo things that are incredibly nice for a melee brawler jungler champion to have, and Rito replaced them with a kit that is so... *incredible*. Not incredible because it's so good, but incredible because they made it both incredibly complex, and horribly generic, both at the same time. I was amazed that they managed to fuze those two things together as well as they did. Skarner now relies on combos, but in the end he doesn't really accomplish much more than other champs do without combos.\n\nI'd go so far as to say that if his ult wasn't so iconic and unique, he'd disappear almost completely off the radar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"majulito","date":"2014-12-14T01:22:29.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new jungle hasn't been good for him. It hits harder so his shield doesn't block as much. Blue doesn't last as long and none of the jungle items give enough mana except the purple one when you smite so sustain is an issue. The new jungle items are meh on him as well since he does hybrid damage so the armor pen isn't great, the ap isn't good because his ratios are bad, the tank one is ok but doesn't help clear, and the as on hit isn't that great when you have no reliable way to get in range to apply it.\n\nThat being said he could use some love. Maybe something small like getting some health/mana back if he stuns something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SIT ON ME POPPY","date":"2014-12-13T23:34:01.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a teensey tiny buff on anything about his kit or stats would make me happy.
