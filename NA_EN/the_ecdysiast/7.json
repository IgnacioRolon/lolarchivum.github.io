But one main thing I've noticed for most if not all is that they're not unhealthy and will never be good without be broken. Akali has to stay weak in every tier besides high tier environments, Aatrox lost his main gimmick since his new kit was too strong, Galio got gutted patch after patch since they didn't know what they were doing.

Because his kit was hardly changed. \n\nSomething like asking for Akali to return to a generic targeted burst dasher when her entire kit was given a new unique (and incredibly fun) style is unrealistic. \n\nBut, you do have a point if it's in regards to abilities that themselves weren't changed much. Asking for Akali's doughnut to just be a circle again would be worth considering.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2019-08-14T20:06:53.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I am glad they won't.

They also (besides giving skins to the same champs over and over) repeatedly give skins to champions who not only already have skins and who are outdated, but some who have legendary or ultimate skins (which have visual updates themselves) and outshine any previous, current or upcoming skins. Like why give Lux any skins? NONE will outshine the beauty that is Elementalist, which is visually upgraded compared to the others.\n\nInstead pick champions like Nasus (not saying he needs a skin though) who look great both in VU skins (legendary, ultimate) and in his normal skins (epic and below). Also more newer champs and vgu'd champs need skins. Giving Udyr a skin is a waste and prevents his vgu. I am not as mad about DS Shaco because its well designed and Shaco is at least decent in visuals compared to fiddlesticks. Sorry for the rant but its so annoying how disillusioned Riot is when making (some) skins. \n\nThey do an amazing job for while then make a major faux pa : we got DS skins which were great, some good Project skins mainly WW, and other major skin lines such as infernal and cosmic. Then Riot gives us Rammus and Udyr skins, ANOTHER Ahri skin in a line which isnt really all that great (Elderwood is meh compared to Blood Moon, DS, Cats and dogs, project, cosmic, SG, super galaxy, infernal). Now I know Riot needs to take care of all the skin lines. But there are some which as just so pitiful and low on the scale of good skins that IDK why skins are made for them when there are many other good lines out there to be used. But like I said its an ebb and flow. A bunch of good skins, a few bad ones.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
