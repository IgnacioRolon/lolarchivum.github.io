Regardless of this analogy, I agree with AeroWaffle here. If we're going to make it bannable for someone to play the game drunk we open up the way for a lot of other ridiculous bans. If a person is drunk in your game and trying their damndest to win just leave them alone. The only time it should get you banned is when you use it as an excuse to troll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha","date":"2016-11-21T17:19:03.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure are held accountable for both + a bonus for driving while drunk.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-11-21T04:05:38.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AeroWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fM6gMuBI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-21T03:57:40.101+0000)\n>\n> I feel like holding someone accountable for being drunk in a game is a slippery slope.

She has good harass against melee opponents and can dance around them while dealing her damage. She can possibly build defense items earlier due to the strength of her passive, which also does well against bruisers and tanks that normally go top.\n\nPerformance: Vel'koz ADC. I've done this successfully quite often-- which is also supported by the logic that helped it work in the first place. Along with having heaps his own CC (which is why he can support well), enough base damage on his ultimate to pick up on kills that escape, and his passive remains on a target for as long as you're AAing them. \n\nWhere logic fails: Singed Support. He has an AoE slow and a conditional root that almost requires that you miss the slow in the first place. His main playstyle and effectiveness is in pushing waves to have minions take towers. The CC isn't enough to compete with the much heavier CC supports that one would normally see, and the playstyle is the exact opposite of what the Support role is intended for.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-11-22T16:20:13.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frankly I don't care anymore about the singed support since the past couple weeks had several posts debating it. \n\nMy point is that you'd be surprised what works if you apply some imagination & ingenuity.

I find it unbelievable for two things:\n\n1: Like you mentioned in your edit, drinking inhibits every activity. For me, I drink a bit, but when I do, I don't play League. I know for sure that when I get buzzed or even drunk, I am in no position to play, since my fine motor functions are inhibited and affected. Typing on a computer requires these fine motor skills, and playing League definitely requires these fine motor skills. Same thing when someone says they're high. The problem I have with that is that marijuana is still illegal in most states in NA, and even then, the bulk of this community is below the age of 21. In California, it's finally legal to possess 1oz of marijuana, but only for people who are 21 or over. I doubt that people in this forum have the capability to get marijuana easily. \n\n2: The age of this community is at that point where being drunk or high is \"cool\". I've experienced both already. It's not what people think it is. When I was 13-17, I thought it would be cool to act drunk or sound drunk when I was trying to impress others. All it did was make me look like a jerk to my teammates in the games I played. Now, I know both feelings directly, and both aren't cool. I drink with friends just to relax, and when I was 18, I did the stereotypical college freshman experience and got high. It sucks when you have a paper due the next morning and you're still feeling the effects of being crossfaded. Don't do it. \n\nBasically, I agree with you, OP. I have an extremely hard time believing that people on this forum would play drunk or at the very least, type semi-coherent sentences. I share your sentiment OP: Please, if someone has to drink or smoke to have fun, don't screw over your teammates with your \"fun\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-11-22T20:28:46.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"At anyone's expense\" stipulation is a stupid rule. One could say that not picking a meta champion (not even simply Mundo adc bot. Just not picking Lucian or Vayne bot) is \"at someone's expense.\" It also could be \"I play best with Shaco support. Pick shaco support for me, pls\" and then picking Leona.\n\nAlso, tiredness is a direct consequence of the person's actions by not sleeping. No one is holding a gun to your head to play ranked at 3 am.\n\n\"Don't be a jerk\" and \"do everything you say you're gonna do\" is pretty reasonable if you define 'jerk' as physical injury and 'agree' as via contract instead of just word.\n\nAll of this \"mutual respect\" is too gray. I don't give a fuck if some random twat calls me a %%%%%%. Does that mean I can call others that since I don't care? If no, then obviously it's not mutual. I think the feedback system of the Tribunal is good, but simply banning them it honestly missing the point. I've watched this community go from relatively decent to completely uptight busybodies of the course of 6 seasons.\n\nI think Lyte's first hint should have been when he saw that only 5% of the 'toxicity' was being done by 1% of the playerbase (the worst behaved individuals.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegendaryLemur","date":"2016-11-22T00:45:09.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Enjoy Yourself, but not at Anyone Else's Expense\".
