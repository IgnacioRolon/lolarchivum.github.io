Ive played for 4 friggin years... pretty often. And i havent unlocked 1/4th of the game. I like getting free stuff.  What else can you buy besides chromas, name change and specials?

Its a very slow trickle even assuming the best case where you get skin shards every chest.

I literally just woke up, logged on, got a key fragment, made a key, opened a chest and got a single champion (Renekton) shard. Keep in mind, you STILL have to earn the hextech chests by getting S ranks in pvp games! That feels awful when all you got from something, that you (or a team mate) legitimately earned by doing well, is a single pretty much worthless shard. And as other people have already pointed out, there's already several ways for us to get champions shards, Champion capsules (upon leveling up), honor capsules, and now you also get BE for the first win of the day but even then we're still not really earning BE fast enough for those of us who DON'T own every champion the game has to offer. \n\nIt just feels incredibly lackluster when you legitimately earned something and all you get from it is..well..trash. There's a few ways I would personally change this:\n\n1. If you're going to give me something champion-related (from a chest that you HAVE to earn an S- or better to acquire) give me a fucking random champion straight out. even if I don't necessarily like or want the champion, at least it'll feel rewarding to have earned a new champion to maybe play at some point. \n\nOR\n\n2. If you're not going to remove the chance of getting champion shards from hexchests, lower the requirements for earning a (regular) chest, say bump it down to earning A- to A+ (as well as increase the rate at which you can get them) and then insert the masterwork chest in the S- to S+ spot\n\nOR\n\n3. You could, y'know, revert back to the way chests were and eliminate the masterwork chest right out. \n\nMy point, at the end of the day is, it now feels that even if you earn an S rank, there's too high of a chance to get something that doesn't feel rewarding.
