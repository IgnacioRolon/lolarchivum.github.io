A look into the motivations of angry, shouting champions.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"With the writing of Aatrox's lore (note: not _re_-writing; the Darkin weren't a solid idea before), there have been a number of complaints about him being changed from a quiet, mysterious character to an angry rampaging demon. And while I won't go into detail about how the mysterious character didn't go with his visuals, playstyle, animations, or abilities, I want to point out his and other champions' _reasons_ for being angry. I hope these short explanations shed at least a little light on the mindset of these characters. \n\nIn order of my opinion on the magnitude of their reason:\n{{champion:421}}  First things first, as for the \"angry for the sake of being angry\" nonsense I've seen claimed, Rek'sai is the _only_ example. She's angry because she's motivated entirely by predatory instinct. She, unlike Rammus, is an animal in body and mind. \n{{champion:240}} A sociopath. He isn't just telling everyone to get off of his property as a joke; he truly believes all of Runeterra is his. He defends \"his\" land from anyone in sight with all the ferocity of an old coot with a shotgun who thinks you're stealing his peaches. \n{{champion:23}} Revenge for his clan. Simple enough. \n{{champion:57}} Speaks for the trees, and the trees are not happy to be destroyed by magic. \n{{champion:58}} Driven mad by his incarceration.\n{{champion:14}} Unwillingly brought back from death into a body that has _no feeling_, with little memory of the man he once was. \n{{champion:19}} His body was torn apart and reshaped into that of the monster we see in game, anesthetic intentionally withheld to drive his sanity further away. \n\n{{champion:266}} And then there's Aatrox:\nFollowing his descent from a godly hero of justice, he was sentenced to a fate far worse than any hell I can imagine. Instead of the mercy of a quick death, he has endured millennia with no body and no senses of _any_ kind. \n\nAs you can tell, I ranked it mainly based on the pain which caused their anger, from the complete lack of pain present for Rek'sai, to the emotional pain of Tryndamere, to the intense physical and mental pain of Warwick. Aatrox stands at the top because he has the most reason to be angry: Loss of a clan? How about an empire. No feeling? At least Sion can move and see. Physical pain? The body of every host rejects him to the point that the blood, bones, and muscles tear away from each other. \n\n*****\nIn conclusion, champions are not made angry just for the sake of having an angry character. They're made angry because it fits the story.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-07-16T06:59:21.182+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot the first champion who was created to be a rage machine: {{champion:58}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-07-16T11:11:41.476+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He forgot Father of Rage lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2018-07-16T19:07:40.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally is powered off rage and has a rage bar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"6FlagsFunnelCake","date":"2018-07-16T08:11:04.447+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:150}} \n\nShooshoo bahnah!

There's nothing that indicates any care for a cause or how just the side he's helping is. Yeah he helped the underdogs, but he only did it to prolong wars and suffering.

While new Aatrox might be good, more fleshed out, even better than the old personality-wise, he's to different and that is unacceptable to me in a rework. \"Angry because trapped\" also heavily homogenizes all the darkin's personalities, and that is a problem.

Varus is in a different situation, wherein both his hosts still have enough control to force him to fight for Ionia rather than simply kill humans.

It's not that an immortal demon can't be calm and poetic. Swain is exactly that, assuming his demon gives him longevity. As are Evelynn and Tahm Kench. \nIt's not that a _demon_ can't be calm and poetic, it's that a character (demon or otherwise) can't dive headfirst into the fray, madly swinging a sword around to drink in the blood of his enemies and be calm and poetic at the same time. \n\nThat's where the first disconnect lies: between the graceful, dance-like swordfighting in his lore and the mad hack-and-slash animations he had in game. \nThe second is how his personality contradicts his story, particularly involving Tryndamere. Seeing as they're a clan of barbarians, what would stir them up and get their blood boiling is a loud, boisterous leader-- not a quiet dancer-like fencer. \nAnd needless to say those two aspects together; a majestic fighter and strong-but-quiet leader of armies, had no connection to his \"jump on top of the enemies and right click like there's no tomorrow because Blood Well is up\" style. \n\nUnfortunately they couldn't have very well expanded upon his role as an inspiration because they've been trying for years to dwindle the number of passive, unseen ally-boosting effects.

In such a being, there must be a **different perspective**, an historical one. He knows deeply what is war, why men fight and how to **move their spirits**. \n\n**He's not directly involved in the motivations of the war itself**; he could not care less about petty mortal squabbles. After so many, one war is just another one. He is not smitten by the supposed injustice of the opposite faction, he does not make his some ideal for which he fights.\n\nWhat is the fervor of battle, to him? **How could he feel pathos when he cannot die, and everyone on the battlefield is much weaker than him?** There is no fear of death, nor there is the passion for challenging a worthy foe. \n\nSo... Why does Aatrox fight? One motivation is the \"Raahst way\": \"I fight because I like killing hehe XD\". Don't get me wrong, that's fine. Makes sense. But it isn't that deep nor original.\n\nAatrox was something more: **he does not delight in the act of killing others**.  \n\nGiven his position in history and towards war, his approach to fighting must be **disinterested. He is an estimator of war, not a soldier.** He sees war as a form of art, and he meddles in human affairs with the sole purpose of witnessing men killing each other like beasts, **for he finds beauty in that**. \n\n**Love for own's concept of beautiful.**\n\nThat's what suistains his endless quest through the years.\n\nThat's his philosophy and his poetry.\n\nThat's where his calm is from. \n\nHe's external to bloodlust, hate, and rage. Yet, to \"paint a war\" **requires those characteristics in the men that fight the battle**. His role as an artist is to **incite those in the hearts of the soldiers, not to feel them**. To him, men are instruments of a work of art. They are worth nothing past their instrumentality in being part of a bloody war. \n\nAnd so Aatrox **lies** to mortals. He lies when  he turns the tides of a battle, he lies when he speaks to the men he saves, he lies when he inspires them, he lies when himself descends to devastate his enemies. **Aatrox is a deceiver**.\n\nA big part of his old VO was about finding motivations to fight (\"fight not to be forgotten\" etc.), just like he was trying to convince someone in joining the fray; the rest was praising war as a form of art.\n\nI like him because his approach to war is radically different from the classical one, and it is not so straight forward.

When a huge emperor dies its pretty damn common for empires to turn into bloody war zones as heirs, warlords, and claimants carve out their own territories and fight for control. The only difference with Shurima being that the warlords happened to be powerful god-warriors that were near immortal and had been driven somewhat mad by their encounters with the Void.\n\nYeah, he wasn't good.

Many of them (as the ritual is meant to be used) might have just been old and at the end of life after serving Shurima for a long time being important to society. They served a mortal Emperor and according to Nasus story (before he was Ascended), he commanded many of Shurima's armies, not an Ascended, and there were no doubt Ascended alive at the time.\n\nI have no sympathy for the Darkin's left, they bought it upon themselves by fighting when even some of them wanted peace (Ta'anari as example), 'madness' or not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-07-16T17:32:39.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two problems with that:\nHe can't walk. \nThe Void isn't death.

She also feels pretty angry.
