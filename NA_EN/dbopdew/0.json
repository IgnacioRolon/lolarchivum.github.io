I haven't seen where there are maybe issues with servers, but I would like to know about why we're seeing such a spike while in game! Others players in the game would be dealing with the same thing, so it's not too fun to have three minute lag in game. I'm on an NA server if that helps. \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T00:35:15.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your ping spikes incredibly high, it appears that there is some sort of connection issue to the individual game server that is causing your ping to spike.

After the game, if you had problems, **post a screenshot from the programm** and export the tracert as txt. You can upload the tracert using the [wrenchmen Upload tool](http://upload.leaguevolunteers.com/).\nOnce you finished uploading just post the links here so that i can have a look at the files.\n\n\nRegards Rkoturdo","replies":[]}]}
