After champ select the client closed, as usual. Screen went black for a moment, as usual. But the instant after, I got bugsplatted. I closed the game and tried again. After several failed attempts I decided to let it go. Unfortunately, waiting didn't help. I now have low priority queue due to the amount of times I attempted to play a game and got bugsplatted. Any ideas on what I should do? Anyone else having the same problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Jlowe08","date":"2016-09-24T19:33:50.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem.

This has been causing these bugsplats in a lot of cases, so I recommend lowering your display resolution using [this guide](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4910-screen-resolution-display-change-windows-10-a.html) to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Castoris","date":"2016-09-29T20:59:28.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for helping me out.

I'd like you to complete a reset of your config folder in your League directory. The steps below will help you do this.\n\nFirst,  **log into the game** then jump into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your installation directory, which should be here:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\n>*Delete* the folder called **CONFIG**\n\nOnce you've deleted the Config folder, leave the custom match, then hop into another to confirm the changes went through. Let me know if this helped resolve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Castoris","date":"2016-10-04T16:23:58.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for helping me out.
