Is it just me, or is Illaoi in a bad state ever since her **E-Test of Spirit **duration was reduced to 12 seconds?  They gave her very little in exchange for the massive **48 second** decrease. While she wasn't at all fun to play against in lane, after laning phase she is very easily locked down. Marksmen like Ashe or Vayne dominate her so very easily. A bruiser/tank with any CC at all is enough to prevent her from doing anything in fights, and many supports excel at keeping her away from teammates. Mobile mages can fully ignore her as well, and ever since patch 6.9, immobile mages are now tank destroying machines. I may very well be wrong here, but I personally feel that some buffs to other parts of her kit would be nice.                                                  \n\n         According to the lore, Nagakabouros is the \"God of Life, Ocean Storms, and Motion. Well, Illaoi  isn't a very good priestess apparently, because she gets locked down and dies frequently in teamfights which doesn't reflect the \"life\" aspect very well (Although I understand that the healing on her tentacles hitting someone is supposed to represent this).  She is also one of, if not the most immobile champions in the game, removing the importance of the \"movement\" characteristic. And the only  thing that makes me understand the \"ocean storms\" part, is the storms of salt my team experiences when I slowly trudge towards a team fight, only to be too late. Additionally, she often relies on Flash to even get in a good enough position to ult.  \n                                                                                                  \n  Perhaps in order to better represent the \"motion\" characteristic, she could get some movement speed for the 12 seconds that she has someone marked, or even just an increase to her base movement speed. Maybe some movement speed after a tentacle hits an enemy champion would be a nice  addition. As I mentioned previously, CC often prevents her from doing much in fights. Maybe giving her some tenacity after ulting, or when near tentacles would help her usefulness (Because lets face it, being stunned gives as much sense of motion as a legless sloth). Possibly make her E castable while moving. These are additions that I believe would improve her performance, while maintaining a balance with her lore. I'm not saying that any of this should necessarily be implemented, but some of these things would be nice to see. Or, they could just revert her passive back to the way it used to be, unless they really do hate the 60 second debuff (Which is understandable). \n\nOf course, I don't fully understand everything Riot has to look into when buffing a champion, so some of these things may be impossible. Alternatively, I could be wrong to assume she needs buffs. I'd love to read opinions on other changes that could be made, or disagreements with my opinions on buffing her. Feedback from a Riot employee would be pretty cool. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

TLDR: Illaoi's only reliable dmg is her E and for a few seconds during her ult even if she is entrenched in a bunch of her own tentacles due to just how slow they are.  If her dmg was more reliable outside of her ult due to faster tentacles she would probably be in an alright spot (would require dmg to be lowered in return for reliability).  Her current way of playing just abuses her E in order to find any success and she becomes very binary like blitz due to this.  \n\nShe is viable but it takes far more work to just get her to that point than many other champions.  A big issue for her is her only reliable dmg is the W AUTO and her E converted dmg.  Everything about her is too unreliable outside of her ult when she gets increased tentacle speed, but then when she ults you just run away since her ult/kit lacks CC and its her tentacles that do her dmg not herself so it doesnt matter if she chases you down.  \n\nShe needs her tentacles to be more reliable outside her ult so that her only window of power is not her ult.  If her only window of power is her ult then you just bait it out and then walk away and she has no ways to really deal with this since even if she follows you and sticks to you the tentacles are still  back where she ulted and she effectively does no dmg.  This reliance on ult is so powerful/annoying that even when you set up a \"zone of control\" with a bunch of tentacles, it actually doesnt matter cause skilled opponents (or champions with mobility) will sidestep the tentacle swings, meaning that even in this zone you set up you dont work unless you blow a ~1min CD OR land your E.  \n\nTo kinda show how illaoi players have adapted a lot of high elo ones are building more AD focused builds (with only a couple tank items) to abuse her one reliable source of dmg, her E.  This has sorta made her like a weird top lane AD blitz who if she lands her E she wins cause she chunks you so hard as the game progresses that she gets you into execute range so you base, and then she takes your tower.  \n\nThe way you actually win with her is through the attrition of pushing towers because no one can properly fight you but you cant chase so you just scare them away from a tower using your E poke and then you take it.   She doesnt actually get to fight anyone just basically slowly pushes her way down a lane like nasus sorta. \n(whether this very binary form of play is good/healthy is up for debate, as blitz is allowed to function similarly, but at least he still reliably does a little bit of something when he misses his Q)\n\nWhat would be nice is if maybe W proc'd tentacles swung at her current ult speed (or if the tentacle speed just somehow scaled with levels or something so that once you have swiftness boots you dont counter her) and in turn her tentacles did less dmg, and her ult was more about the spawining of extra tentacles (or maybe a long cd source of utility like maybe an aoe slow) rather than basically being the only time she is threatening cause the attackspeed buff makes her tentacles viable for a few seconds you can wait out.  \n\nSomething that helps that many will point out (somewhat, it's not often enough anyway) is IBG but HAVING to build a specific item in order to be functional/reliable is very annoying and I dont find it to be good design (also I feel this problem plagues morde but he uses rylais or gunblade to become functional instead).  \n\nIllaoi getting more or less rewards based on when tentacles do hit (such as the healing change testing they did on the pbe earlier) would only make her more feast or famine because the issue is you can't rely on them hitting in the first place except every minute for a few seconds when she ults.  \n\nThat splitpush style and her still alright teamfight  is what allows current Illaoi players to find success, but it takes quite a bit of practice/knowledge and its still iffy reliability is frustrating.  \n\nAll this said my analysis/thoughts may be completely wrong so there is that but as someone who loves playing Illaoi despite all of this it does pain me now and then when I realize I have to work really hard to make her viable and these are the ideas/things I've seen as I researched how to play her and what others do.

In higher-level matches, once teams get more organized and wary of incoming Juggernauts, those occasions become even rarer, which is why Illaoi's notorious for being one of those pubstomper champions who falls off hard when the enemy team's average level of strategic planning increases. Most Juggernauts have this problem too (Garen still has very little chance of ever being competitively interesting, Skarner/Mordekaiser were only considered when they were grossly overpowered and have their weaknesses abused way too easily otherwise, Darius is the most competitively viable pick but is considered extremely risky...), and so it might be worth adding a little bit more nuance to those champions' success beyond just \"win hard against teams that don't play defensively or kite, lose hard against teams who do\". Illaoi's got the best chances for that since her E lets her be useful even when at a pretty significant distance from her opponents, but she likely needs better base power when doing things right, and perhaps just a smidge less power during those five-man ult cases in compensation if needed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"notmebuthim","date":"2016-05-15T13:30:05.221+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illaoi is too easy to out play and has no real gap closer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-05-15T21:23:50.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really has nothing to do with the E change, she's always been in a bad spot once people figured out how to play against her.
