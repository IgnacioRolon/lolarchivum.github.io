Changing even the smallest things (Excluding numbers) can easily remove the shuffle, he needed the soldier, the soldier dash (Q), and the -&gt; solider dash (E), alongside the ultimate. Removing the ultimate would have added a lot more room for creativity and the ability to make Azir a true emperor, and i think even after the rework, he fails to be the Shuriman emperor we all need.\r\n\r\nRating of rework: 2/10\r\nSuccess/Failure: Fail\r\n\r\nXin\r\n-\r\nXin definitely needed one, but i didnt really like what he was given.\r\n\r\nXin is a champion based around all-ins/trades, and the moment i saw the new W (Another 2 slash ability, because why the fk not) i new Xin&#039;s rework wouldnt be that good.\r\n\r\nXin needs to be a champion that just stands right next to his enemy and beat the living hell out of them until theyre no more. His rework gave a self-root.\r\n\r\na very LONG self-root.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Xin poke, which is just very wrong, in my opinion, its like moving Irelia&#039;s ult to her E, it just does not work. He doesnt need to go in, he can just stand in his wave and try poking the enemy down.\r\n\r\nI really do like the Ultimate change, however. it makes Xin feel more like a duelist, ignoring damage from that {{champion:45}} far away, and just focusing on destroying the enemy ADC.\r\n\r\nHis W -&gt; E attack speed shift works really well too, his E is an initiation ability so it makes perfect sense to be on it.\r\n\r\nRating of rework: 5/10\r\nSuccess/Failure: Just make a new W that fits Xin&#039;s playstyle, rito.\r\n\r\nJanna\r\n-\r\nNote: I am a Janna main with over 100k points, but i will try to be as unbias as possible. I havent played Janna with this rework.\r\n\r\nAfter i saw the rework, the first thing that popped up in my head was: &quot;Am i watching a Bard rework?&quot;\r\nThe passive changes made 0 sense, why add AP damage to her autoattacks that scale from Movement speed, and then proceed to nerfing ALL of her movement speed passives?\r\nHer passive was meant to help allies, and not in any way janna, nerfing it from 8 to 5% just so Janna can get it makes no sense and just doesnt fit Jannas kit as an Enchanter/protector\r\nThe Q buff just felt weird and pointless as hell, the times when i even think of charging the tornado to max are just so infrequent.\r\nThe W nerfs... Again, why give her MS scaling damage and then nerf her MS passive? The cooldown nerf makes even less sense, since you max W second (And riot now force you to max E because the cooldown early is 6 seconds less than Windwall, because why the fk not), the times when you actually benefit from the passive are just so little.\r\nAn 18 second shield early... Id rather start playing Karma, it cooldown is just way too much, even if it is just that high early.\r\nThe range and AS buffs are appreciated, but the new passive just doesnt compensate for the lower ad i feel.\r\n\r\nRating of rework: Revert this crap and go with the changes from last patch (13 second E CD, zephyr is actually used not only for AS)\r\nSuccess/Failure: Bard\r\n\r\ntl;dr, fix your shit riot :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n\r\nalthough, props to you for finally balancing {{item:3504}} , it needed that.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-19T19:45:18.460+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree about Azir being a bit anti climactic. I have always loved his lore and aesthetics but hated his game play too much to use him, and I had hoped they would remove the shuffle and make him more artillery because I do enjoy ziggs and xerath and to a lesser degree lux. Azir will always feel janky to me, but at least he may be slightly less annoying to play against (although that reminds me of that terrible Fizz rework that ruined him completely for me so other people would be less annoyed by him)\n\nWith xin I do not agree about the W. I think that combined with his R changes it gives him something to do when he cannot get in range of someone. Also I am just happy to see melee weapon skills shots in general.\n\nI am also a Janna main, and while I agree that it feels bad to give a champ a low Stat to get them to build more of it, I think the Q changes are useful. I frequently get at least 1 second of charging in anyway, and significant mana cost cuts are very welcome. The other changes are not so bad I cannot learn to play around them, and after the auto range buff spellthief may not be bad for her, and once the quest is finished it will add yet more damage for her.\n\nHonestly Janna needed nerfs to calm the hate if nothing else and I would much rather get hit on cool downs or health than shield strength or ult knockback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2017-09-20T04:26:05.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I can't believe they worked on these changes for as long as they did. Like this I wouldn't even qualify as a mini-rework, they just gave him more balance changes than normal and are calling it good. They aren't even talking with the Azir players on feedback to these changes. To me, this honestly just looks like another round of Riot gutting a champion they have already gutted numerous times in the past and ignoring what the result is.","replies":[]}]}
