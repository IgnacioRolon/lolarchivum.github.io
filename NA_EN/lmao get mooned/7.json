I will never understand why you can suck ass early game and still pentakill lategame. I will never understand why her ult gives her the same amount of ad as a 3800 gold item in the click of a button. Lastly, I will never understand why every 2 seconds she gets to deal 170% of her total AD. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have a problem with her invisibility, i don&#039;t have a problem with her mobility or her condemn. It is never okay for one champion to kill a full build tank in 5 hits regardless of armor or health.\r\n\r\nBefore all the Vayne mains start screaming me down saying &quot;OMFG UR JUST A NOOB AND CANT PLAY HER FOR SHET1!!!!1!!1 SHEES RELLY HARD GUISS!!11!!&quot; \r\n\r\nI&#039;m as level 6 Vayne, Shes not that hard to play. Hard to master, yes.

Meaning you probably are not playing against competition that shuts her down nor are you proficient enough with her to expose her strengths to climb in games.\n\nVayne isn't that strong unless you let her farm AND let her keep hitting the same target in late game team fights.\n\nGood players don't let her farm and kill her before she even gets to the point of single handedly carrying a game. And even if she is strong, they will land all forms of CC to stop her from autoing the same target.\n\nShe is also one of the higher skill cap hyper carries among the ADCs in the game. Meaning you have to be really good with her to optimally use her. \n\nShe does not kill tanks in \"2 seconds\"  and Vayne is a great duelist. Meaning you should not be waltzing up to her to 1v1 her pretty much ever. The same goes for any other duelist. To name some duelists: {{champion:75}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:48}}{{champion:11}}.\n\nYeah don't fight them on their terms.\n\nIf you are letting a Vayne farm, have the game go over 40 minutes, and walking up to her one at a time, you deserve to lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesus Is My King","date":"2016-08-09T22:43:57.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"shes not that good...","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-09T22:40:54.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The entire point of vayne is killing tanks.

Any idiot could get level 7 easily while sucking at the champion","replies":[]}]}
