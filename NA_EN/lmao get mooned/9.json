At lvl 6 she can just use her instant cast R then hit E and that chunks the fuck out of you. On top of that she can dominate teamfights because aoe stun, wall, and ult is an infinite slow with rylais. You better not try and fucking tower dive her either because of her egg. \n\nRequest #1 make the E do double damage only if you&#039;re currently stunned by the q not if you were previously hit by it. \nRequest #2 Make E do double damage only if you&#039;re in the ult, not if you&#039;ve walked out already.\nRequest #3 Make her ult have a channel time of at least .5 seconds. instant cast is cancerous.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-08-01T18:46:34.267+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"She has 0 mobility, is medium ranged, has only 1 hard cc (and it's a skillshot), and moderate cooldowns.
