I am having recent ping issues, but throughout all the logs and information I provided we (Riot and I) discovered (through various tests and logs) that my wireless card was having issues communicating with the router all the time, which is to be expected since its a generic 2.4 ghz card with a tiny antenna a room and a half away from the router itself. I have a friend in the same house that is using a 5 ghz card and he isn't having these issues. Needless to say, I'll need an upgrade~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwilightSpàrkles","date":"2017-02-18T22:41:43.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well , idk what i did but now i have a decent ms , thank you <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwilightSpàrkles","date":"2017-02-18T20:54:25.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah , i wont resolve the problem...I tried that tool , i tried to change the cable , i tried to unplug modem and cable for 30 seconds and also restart the computer , but no results , i have same ping , it looks like i wont be able to play lol anymore... :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T21:17:20.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really important that you go through every step of that guide.
