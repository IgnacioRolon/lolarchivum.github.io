But I don't think this is fair at all because I'm trying to play it and your client won't allow me to!\n\nAlso, after restarting my PC, I'm having issues where after the League client has messed up my video display, the screen will boot up and when going into windows, it will then display \"Out of range\" again! I had to start in Safe mode with low video resolution in order to fix this bug you seem to have with your client. Please can you kindly look into this for me because it appears I'm not the only person having trouble with it.\n\nThe new client btw doesn't display correctly on the welcome screen on my PC so I'd have to set the video resolution majorly high to fit it on the screen! Chaos! Then.... you ban Teemo... I paid for him with IP and he's my main... so not happy :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwilightSpàrkles","date":"2017-01-13T13:41:58.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw this on service status : We have disabled Teemo due to in game issues, and are currently working on a resolution.
