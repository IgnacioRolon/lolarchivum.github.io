How come?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all.\r\n\r\nThe title is pretty straightforward, this was my first game in some days, and having updated to 6.16, I joined a ranked as one would normally. Once it was time to enter the loading screen, the client crashed, claimed there was data corruption, and it had kicked me off the game after reinstallation.\r\n\r\nI am now forced to wait because Riot apparently can't package an update together properly nor can they adequately detect whether or not a client was closed or crashed. Any workaround for this?","replies":[{"poster":"DevinaDivine","date":"2016-12-16T21:10:41.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same exact thing happened to me. 20 minute low priority queues because I got data corruption twice at two completely random times.

I suggest using our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide for a list of steps to make sure your files are in tip top shape.  You can also use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367), which provides options to repair and clean reinstall your client to a clean slate.  That should help out with future patching in the future, in case you have super old or corrupt content.","replies":[{"poster":"Xisled95","date":"2016-08-18T03:07:09.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did a repair as per the client's suggestion and the game functioned correctly. However I am still having to deal with this unnecessary waiting time which was certainly not caused by either leaving a game or doing so frequently (again, one leave). Not sure if there can be a specific fix for that. Thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
