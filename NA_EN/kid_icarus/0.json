There are a plethora of problems which consist of:\r\n\r\nLeavers\r\nGreifers\r\nUnranked (More in S II - S I)\r\nIntentional Feeders\r\nJunglers forgetting Smite\r\nEnd Game Throwers\r\nSmurfing\r\nList goes on and on&hellip;\r\n\r\nI doubt people get punished for leaving games and boning people over out of their series or just games in general. Another problem is that people just give up and don&rsquo;t even play, keep pressing &ldquo;Surrender&rdquo; (which should be a reportable offense if it&rsquo;s done too often by the same person) , and just sit in fountain and move around so they avoid disciplinary action. It&rsquo;s almost an unbearable experience to climb because you can become hardstuck with all of this happening from game to game.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ve climbed out of bronze twice in two different seasons and there wasn&rsquo;t hardly any toxicity at all, more or less it was a much more enjoyable experience than being in Silver. I&rsquo;m aware all of this happens in the other elo&rsquo;s too but Riot definitely needs to look into Silver and do something about it.\r\n\r\nAlso why doesn&rsquo;t the game automatically put Smite on as a Summoner if you&rsquo;re locked Jungle? That would eliminate the thought of forgetting it altogether?","replies":[]}
