I mean, it's not very outdated at all, IMO.\n\nHell, I'd argue Rocket Girl Tristana was more outdated, yet you didn't give her splash a complete 'overhaul' (if that's what you mean by \"new splash art\").\nIn fact, Rocket Girl Tristana's splash still doesn't look very similar to her updated in-game model, even with the redone ears.\n\nPlease reconsider. I feel like not only those art resources could go elsewhere, for the better, but also that it's a lovely splash as is, even if it was made in late 2012 (which was also the time when you guys really started upping your splash art quality).\nThe quality might indeed not be the best nowadays, but the splash matches almost perfectly with the model (if you consider the perspective in which Maokai is illustrated in), aside from his big hand probably (which, with his VU, is now a face with swirly runes/marks on the fingers rather than the big crack it was before).\n\n######Don't take my arguments regarding Rocket Girl Trist's splash the wrong way though. I understand the decision behind not giving that skin a new splash, due to the constraints and limited resources, and I appreciate the effort in at least updating those ears to match with her updated silhouette.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lùmen","date":"2016-10-21T16:45:41.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whaaat, really?\nIt actually looks really good..
