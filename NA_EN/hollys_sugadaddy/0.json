I turn it back on and log back into league and my duo is still in the game but I can't get back in. It just says Game in Progress. Any way to fix this? I really don't want a leaver buster (this happened twice, this being the second time). Ive tried turning my pc on and off, relogging into league, and running the hextec tool repair.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T03:47:00.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm looks like the game is trying to load but just hasn't been able to. I'd look in task manager, make sure all league processes are ended, then open League back up and you should be able to get back in the game.
