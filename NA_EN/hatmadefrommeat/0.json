I was able to select a champion and everything and the people I was playing with said I was loaded but I only saw a black screen. I reinstalled along with using hextech repair but nothing is working. I still get a black screen and a frozen computer. =[","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T18:45:01.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black screen you see is usually due to a network issue that's having trouble establishing a connection to the game server.
