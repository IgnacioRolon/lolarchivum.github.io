Sometimes I enter games late, 1 minute, 2 minutes late due to this bug.  I tried repair, I even uninstalled and reinstalled and repaired again twice.  My connection is 15mbs and it is pretty steady, the drops are for sure not occurring as often as I'm getting these errors.  Anyone can help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-02T18:08:22.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble connecting to the game server, and not necessarily an issue with your game files.
