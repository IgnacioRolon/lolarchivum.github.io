Please use discretion when posting / upvoting.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt's human nature to seek approval and post things that are guaranteed to get internet points. As the new Boards gain popularity (and landing lots of votes becomes more meaningful), copying successful Reddit posts to the Boards may become common.\n\nI personally have only seen something *like* this done [once ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/OPfzydoZ-this-story-is-a-great-example-of-why-riot-is-an-amazing-company-towards-its-fanbase) thus far. (I am not meaning to accuse the poster of selfish intentions.) I hope I am not overreacting by making this post, but I wanted to address this issue immediately and see what the rest of the Boards community thinks. Please listen to what I have to say, and understand that it is said in the spirit of friendly concern, and with the desire to create a meaningful and positive community. \n\nIf you've spent time on sites such as Imgur or Reddit, you'll know how rampant reposting and copy / pasting from other sites is, and how detrimental it can be to the originality, individuality, and relevance of a community. \n\nRiot wants to create a community that is distinct from Reddit, where players and Rioters can interact more directly, visibly, and conveniently. Why else create the Boards? It would be much simpler and resource-efficient to shut down the existing forums and move community interaction entirely over to Reddit, if this were not the case.\n\nNo one is forced to click a post link, but posts do take up real estate on the Boards feeds, no matter how they are sorted. What use are the Boards, if unique posts are drowned out by clones of Reddit posts? Why visit the Boards at all, if they become a copy of a pre-exisiting community?\n\nTo be clear, I think sister posts by OPs in both communities is fine. However, if the Boards become a mirror of the Reddit front page, there will be no point in visiting them. Please don't start this trend.

I can only speak to my personal opinion here, but it seems to me I'd prefer having the best content cross-pollinate. I'm probably slightly biased, since it was really cool to see my articles pop up on reddit (thus linking to content on the boards), but still, I would contend that a reasonable number of links to reddit or other sites would be further curated by those of us hanging out here, delivering only the best content to the top for players like me (those using Discussion View).

It's always helpful for discussions like this. I'm having difficulty finding the problem with content like that being cross posted from other channels in the League of Legends community. The discussion you referenced is super positive, and it also has a fair bit of engagement by other players. Don't you think that is relevant to the League of Legends community? Sure, it was posted elsewhere first, but it's not a race. If a member of the Boards thinks that people here would find value in something, then we absolutely DO want them to bring it here. Stuff likes this makes the platform better, not worse.\n\n> Riot wants to create a community that is distinct from Reddit, where players and Rioters can interact more directly, visibly, and conveniently. Why else create the Boards? It would be much simpler and resource-efficient to shut down the existing forums and move community interaction entirely over to Reddit, if this were not the case.\n\nThe aim for the Boards is to create a platform that becomes the most commonly used social channel for the League of Legends community. We want everyone to use it, and that's going to include users that help populate the Boards with cool content. It makes me sad when [Dunkey releases a new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se32VCORUjc) and no one posts it here. I learned a very valuable lesson from Sky last night when he [posted a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUHcc7ipGt0) in response to Robin Williams passing. Such a heartfelt message from one League player to another. Neither of these made it to the Boards, but they made it to Reddit, and that's a problem that we have to solve together.\n\n> To be clear, I think sister posts by OPs in both communities is fine.

We want these Boards to belong to you, and have something for everyone. I believe that the League of Legends community is deeper than any one person can know. Reddit doesn't have everything. There's often amazing content that never makes it to Reddit, but it circulates on Facebook or Twitter. Some of the best League of Legends videos I've ever seen eventually made it there, but only after it had circulated the fansite ecosystem for a few days. If the Boards becomes a place that hosts everything going on in the community, then we will have succeeded together.\n\n**Tl;DR ** - We want tons of content from all over the community posted here, and then we want you to vote on the stuff based on how valuable you think it is.\n\nWould love to hear more thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"The All Tomato","date":"2014-08-13T14:43:48.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for a response! I'm a stickler for organization, so I was sure to choose the appropriate Board :)\n\n> The aim for the Boards is to create a platform that becomes the most commonly used social channel for the League of Legends community. \n\nOk, thank you for making that clear to me. My statement about the purpose of the Boards was not fully accurate.\n\n>[...] I believe that the League of Legends community is deeper than any one person can know. Reddit doesn't have everything.

Right now, Reddit is to the LoL community what the Boards are intended to be (your TL;DR makes a perfect summary of Reddit). My concern is that during the Boards' infancy, pulling content straight from Reddit has the possible consequence of undermining the Boards' growth into replacing Reddit as the primary venue for LoL community content, >**IF**< if becomes an overwhelming trend.\n\nWhen the Boards mature and reach their intended use, I expect to see content here that I've seen elsewhere, because valuable content deserves to be shared on all relevant channels. It's great to see Dunkey videos (for example) anywhere. I also understand that, when posted on the Boards, Reddit self-posts qualify as valuable external content.\n\nThanks to responses from you, RiotExLibris, and other players, I see that my initial concern was an overreaction. Like the title says, I was being preemptive. There is plenty of great content being generated here on the Boards. I just want to see it stay that way. I want the Boards to reach their intended use.\n\n\n>The discussion you referenced is super positive, and it also has a fair bit of engagement by other players.

That post inspired me to share my concern because it links directly to Reddit, though it does not demonstrate a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CommandShockwave","date":"2014-08-13T07:38:44.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who's spent years, and thousands upon thousands of posts on the regular forums, I think it's maybe because this place just doesn't have the traffic that GD does.
