It does seem you earned 3 key fragments as well as a mystery chest in the past few days of playing.  It appears on the 23rd you crafted the 3 fragments into a key and opened the Mystery Chest, netting you a Striker Lucian Skin Shard. You should be able to see this in your current inventory.\n\nI hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Something15","date":"2016-05-25T14:19:15.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I got the Lucian skin shard from the free key and chest I got when hexatech was brought out, but like I said in the post above I got a chest and 2 key fragments a few days ago and I still had the Lucian shard sat with them. Next time I get a key or chest I will print screen and see it it happens again.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-25T22:01:35.046+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I double-checked and this doesn't seem to be the case.  When Hextech Crafting was first brought out, you opened the free chest with the free key on April 9th.  This gave you the Matador Alistar Skin Shard, a Golden Goal Ward Skin, and 800 orange essence.  You used the orange essence to permanently unlock the Alistar skin and Ward Skin.\n\nThe Striker Lucian skin was the recent skin you unlocked with the keyfragments you earned from the 22nd and the 23rd.\n\nI hope this clarifies everything!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THEREBORNJET","date":"2017-04-16T16:51:35.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dartagnan  this is concerning my account and when i got three fargments i forged it into a chest but when i opened it nothing happened and i didnt get anything please help and please give me my stuff back if you cant get the reward back.
