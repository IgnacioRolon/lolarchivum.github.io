The two board mod posts against saying the balance team are undeserving of their jobs, despite most posts giving genuine criticism, yet being removed? How about Meddler **today** complaining about being downvoted? What about Likkrit being banned from pro play in Russia for criticizing their division of Riot on their poor running of the pro scene? What about the lack of response or action for fixing pro play in EU, which is a complete mess right now? What about Montecristo who was thrown out, with no evidence, because he criticised Riot?\n\nOn top of ignoring criticism, they complain or strike people down about it when it begins to actually affect them. Is any of this Riot handling criticism well? You don't even have to agree with every example I put, but it is extremely obvious Riot does not know how to handle criticism.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-11T02:56:42.228+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot is not going to always do what the couple hundred people (up to 1k on some really big issues) on the boards want when they have other data suggesting that the changes are not desired (or the new features are desired and people are asking to revert it).\n\nThey are not unprofessional. The **community** is largely unprofessional in dealing with them - we make demands, we don't accept their explanations (how many times did Cactopus get told he was wrong after he spent a long ass post explaining the BE math and why we were wrong), and we expect them to do exactly what we ask of them.\n\nRiot doesn't respond on the NA fourms regarding RUS/EU issues because those regional teams are largely separate from them. The Rioters that come here likely have little to no understanding of the issues they're facing in other regions or the reasoning behind those actions.\n\nThey complain about criticism or strike people down because people refuse to listen. Multiple Rioters have said this - they don't post on some threads because they know from past experience that players will just tell the Rioter, the one who knows and has the data, that he/she is wrong and demand it be changed.\n\n----\nIf you want them to post more, the community needs to stop treating them like shit when they do post. They aren't here to be the few hundred boards posters' private servants and game designers.

Zoe is about to be what Camille was at the start of Summer Split, 99% banrate and picked in any role if possible. Bramble Vest and Thornmail are still allowing tanks to beat bruisers in 1v1s. Grasp and Aftershock are so overpowered that they deal more damage than damage keystones. Jayce, Xayah, and Kalista were near 100% pick or banned at worlds (Kalista being 100% banned) and have gone completely untouched. These are things high elo, not just the boards, are complaining about and Riot has done **nothing** to fix the issue. **We know that data shows people complaining are right. OP.gg, League of Graphs, Champion.gg, or whatever your preferred source is can prove this. Pro play and Master+ Tier opinions; pro play statistics. The only person saying this isn't an issue is Riot DESPITE ALL EVIDENCE.** I remember a rumor floating about Meddler having made up data about Sona being overpowered (heard about a month back, the occurrence was years ago). You think anyone should trust Live Design about their decisions and their acclaimed data when Kayle gets triple nerfed despite no proof of being overpowered by all 3 standards I gave and Riven being buffed despite being fine by all 3 standards I gave?\n\nI literally gave a solid argument for why Riot is unprofessional. Now, rather than counter it, you want to call us unprofessional. We, the people, are not in a position to require to be professional. Even when we are we do not get a response. I ask three times why Kayle is getting double nerfed despite no proof under any standard of her being overpowered. No response and she gets an extra nerf. No one cared that Kayle was getting nerfed because Kayle isn't a popular champion, rather the opposite. That would be Riot bullying unpopular champions because they can get away with it. Who cares if Cactopus might have been right (I didn't pay attention to it), every other Rioter explanation is wrong. Sterak's is overpriced because it's as good as Black Cleaver. No! Kayle is nerfed for being overpowered. No! Fiora needs to be buffed because Bramble Vest is overpowered. No, nerf Bramble Vest! Ekko is good, so he needs to be better. No! Getting 1 correct answer out of 100 doesn't negate all of your wrong answers. You still failed the test badly.\n\nExcept for the boards never cared about Likkirit nor EULCS. That was Reddit thing. Riot never responded to nor acted upon those poor actions nor attempted to fix them. Now Likkirit is a martyr that died for a lost cause and EULCS is going to tank again.\n\nI've made it fairly clear that they only strike down criticism when it gets to them. You didn't refute my argument, you just effectively said, \"No. You're wrong.\" Meddler complaining about downvotes was just unprofessional and petty. No one can deny that. You also act like players don't know the data. They do. I've made that clear that players know data and how. Even if you agree with the statement that most players are an uneducated, stupid mass, you cannot deny that the 30+ people I can recall are perfectly able to use data and give a meaningful discussion. That's not even counting high elo like Wickd, Hashinshin, ICU, Tarzaned, Dekar. Thing is, Riot doesn't listen to any these people. They don't debate, discuss, or even converse at all. These high elo players play more League games in a day than the entire Live Design team plays in a week combined. They don't have the experience to make wise decisions and changes they make can be proved wrong with statistics. You're telling me I shouldn't prove Riot wrong when they are wrong? You're telling me it is my fault they don't talk to people because they're tired of being wrong? Don't be wrong in the first place and don't be mentally incapable of being wrong; don't suck in the first place, learn instead, or don't have the job if you are unwilling to learn.\n\nAre you seriously telling me it is the Boards fault for this happening? Let me give you an example. The country of France is ruled by a king. The King makes more decisions and wastes tax money on multiple castles and an unnecessary war. When people protested the idea of wasting money and lives in both these cases, the king and his advisors ignored them. They protested again and were ignored again. Now the King wants to raise taxes because the government is short on money. People protest and are ignored. Bread prices skyrocket and people are starving. People protest, asking for assistance. The greedy King, as usual, ignored them. No response, no discussion, nothing. The loudest protestors have been silenced and sent to prison. So, people decided to band together and begin acting violently. They stormed the prison to free their friends and gather weapons. They took the King and his wife captive and executed them shortly later. Every issue the people complained about was a serious issue that was very obvious and could be proven. Who is at fault for the beginning of the French Revolution? The King is; he is the one who decided to ignore issues rather than solve them. That is Riot right now. There are issues they are refusing to respond to and refuse to fix. People before were protesting as usual, but now they're pissed. No more waiting for empty promises; people want action and will take it if they have to.\n\nI've said it before, the only way Riot fixes the situation is them acting because it is their fault. [Maybe instead of talking down to people, they talk with people like I said before.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/5wzx5LEq-it-is-going-to-take-a-lot-of-work-to-fix-league)","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-12T00:33:18.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":">Zoe is about to be what Camille was at the start of Summer Split, 99% banrate and picked in any role if possible.\n\nCool. That's totally fine.

You can't expect Riot to respond to you when you're accusing them of falsifying data. You can't expect them to respond when they get stupidly downvoted by a bunch of kids that are sad because of the fact they can't one shot someone or because they let someone one shot them.\n\nThe Rioters run the game. Your opinions as to what the game should be do not have any merit, sorry. If you want to talk about something and actually have them consider your change, it must be based on actual data, not on a rumor of them falsifying data. A vast majority of the posts on gameplay are bullshit complaints that have been disproven multiple times and/or could be if someone would just do a google search.\n\n**Riot doesn't respond to the threads you want them to because there is no Riot response needed to most of them**.

Last I checked, the game is in a shitty state when a champion is FORCED to be banned by red side (in pro play) every game or else they lose.\n\nBruisers are 1v1 class. You saying they shouldn't fight, which means not lane, which means the tank just outscales them.\n\nYou can't play around it. Tank engages with you and you can't fight because of aftershock. Can't play around grasp because it stays up FOREVER as long as they stay in combat.\n\nMaybe Riot should have responded to posts that used actual data. Maybe Riot shouldn't make changes that contradict data, but then say data shows they're correct. You don't build credibility by doing the opposite of the facts.\n\nMy opinions do have merit. I see people every day agree or disagree with them. Some fight, but eventually they do learn through fighting. Ideas I give are brilliant like a few others on these boards. I am a champion of facts and the antithesis to circlejerking. The only people who lack merit are people who deny people their value.\n\nThese boards have made discussion with actual data. Riot threw data out the window and said, \"We think Pantheon is fine having  54% winrate into Challenger.\" As to gameplay having a lot of bad posts, I already said: \"Even if you agree with the statement that most players are an uneducated, stupid mass, you cannot deny that the 30+ people I can recall are perfectly able to use data and give a meaningful discussion. That's not even counting high elo like Wickd, Hashinshin, ICU, Tarzaned, Dekar. Thing is, Riot doesn't listen to any these people.\" A majority that gets to the front page is still true. Even still, Riot does not respond.\n\nReally? You think Riot shouldn't explain themselves when they nerf a perfectly balanced champion? You think Riot should give a champion worthless buffs and ignore discussion about how to actually fix the champion? You think that doesn't warrant a Riot response?\n\nThe community doesn't act like they run Riot and that is such a vague argument.
