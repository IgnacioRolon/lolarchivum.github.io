Or never comeback to relevance for the next 20 minutes? Deny so hard that you get free farm and have time to bother other lanes?\n\nYour enemy is diamond? well don&#039;t let him walk over you and your team. Do you think the higher tier players care whether you are diamond or bronze? They will still look for mistakes and still punish you for them. They'll still use the advantages and use them to help win the game.\n\nIt&#039;s about using the lane dynamics and understanding of the game to get fed quickly, farm more gold, get more objectives, and win game.\n\nOf course, there are better champions and roles for carrying games. But just because you do well in your role doesn&#039;t mean you should automatically win games. You have to do something while you are ahead and do it faster and better than the carry on the enemy team.\n\nYes, the first 10 or so games are going to be a pain in the ass because everyone is in the same boat. But once you do the placements, The better players are going to win more and the retards will fall. You can&#039;t expect to get back to your dynamic queue instantly after getting hard boosted.\n\nAnd yes, it&#039;s not fair when the enemy team simply has better players. Get fed faster than them, press harder, and when it comes to late game, and you still can&#039;t hold, only then it&#039;s unfair. You can&#039;t win every game but if you are good enough you should win more than 50%.\n\nSo stop fucking pinging others and telling your team to do this and that (ganks, dragons, tower push, etc). Whatever it is, you do that shit yourself if necessary. Stop crying and just play better.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\nI had to rant because all these retards who don&#039;t do shit and yet think they should win while only some players do all the work in games. The least you can do is avail yourself to get carried","replies":[{"poster":"Snowball4u","date":"2016-11-14T02:12:51.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/0RmTkT1.png\n\nThis game lasted 18 minutes\n\nand you're saying the random mmr isn't an issue","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-11-14T02:19:17.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dammmn, that's sure some balance right there! lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowball4u","date":"2016-11-14T03:34:02.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh all my games haven been like this.

You probably aren't counting those games and overlooking those wins. And if you still can't win, maybe you are below average or got boosted. Maybe you deserve to be where you are, or  at least deserve to climb slower than the better players.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowball4u","date":"2016-11-14T02:54:45.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets analyze this...\n\n>Not every game is going to be fair.\n\nSo you think it's an acceptable match making system to put BAD PLAYERS against HIGH ELO? That mindset is literally encouraging luck. It doesn't matter if you are a god at this game. If you are lucky and get good players, you win, and if you are unlucky and get bad players, you lose. That is what flex queue is at the moment with the screwed up MMR. Your team is randomly made, so in a VERY unfortunate game, I would have 4 bronze on my team, and be playing against 5 challengers. I guess that sounds ok to you.\n\n>You may be facing all diamond this game but the next game you might be facing all silver players.\n\nDid you even take the time to read my username and read the summoner names of the players in the game?\nShows how little you care about the other side, and how blindly you believe that you're point is valid.\n\n>And if you still can't win, maybe you are below average or got boosted. Maybe you deserve to be where you are, or at least deserve to climb slower than the better players.\n\nSo lets take BronzeXpresTrain (Plat 4)(Orianna) for an example. He is trying to climb to reach the highest ranks. However he stumbles upon Oreowannabe (Diamond 5)(Leblanc), and feeds this game. So by these statements, you are saying Orianna must be boosted because he can't 1v1 someone a tier above him. How about you try to 1v1 me. You're gold 3, but that doesn't matter. If you lose to me you are obviously boosted.","replies":[{"poster":"MR KIMCHI SENPAI","date":"2016-11-14T03:26:22.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you stupid? or just can't read?\n\nI never said it's acceptable to match bad players against high elo players. But if you are a shitty player why should you expect to win when the enemy is full of better players? If you are truly better than average then you will simply win more than 50% of games. If you got matched against everyone in your same elo, do you think all those players will have the same level of skill? No, some will be better than others. And those, if marginally good enough, will climb. If not, they'll just hover around that elo.\n\nSo you won? Against a plat trash. You were on the better team and won. I don't know how that equates to orianna being boosted in your head. Because that's not what I said. She may have won a bunch of games, then stumbled upon this one game where she had to face diamonds and lost. That's normal. She's definitely below average in that game. Why? because the enemy team is all diamonds. But if she was good enough and shit on your face then yes, she could've won that game because she would deserve to be higher tier, based on this one game.\n\nIf I'm gold and you are diamond, then does that mean if I go close to being even, then you are boosted? Because any diamond can shit on an average gold player? I've also been in higher tier than you in previous seasons on my other account and I can easily just log to prove that. A lot of people can just grind to that level just like how I started league and hit plat 1 in 3 months. You speak like diamond 5 is reserved for the best players but it's not.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-14T02:15:20.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is an actual problem with flex queue's matchmaking right now, you know.
