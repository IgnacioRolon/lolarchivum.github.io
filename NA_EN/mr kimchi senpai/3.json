I mean these plants are so stupid I don&#039;t even know what to say about them. Why don&#039;t they know that most players don&#039;t want random factors to decide calculated outcomes, I will never know. \n\n{{champion:238}} : just became anti snowbally...? So if you can&#039;t land a kill, you won&#039;t get the bonus AD, and you will be even weaker than before. If you die, the enemy laner just comes with a couple cloth armors. Lethality is less effective than armor penetration. Currently barely does enough damage to land a kill (enemy doesn&#039;t sit there to help you land your perfect full combo), meanwhile being countered by CC, zhonya, exhaust, barrier, heal (ms boost), ghost, untargetability, etc. This was my main champion. After multiple hard nerfs, Riot finally slit the throat of the &quot;most balanced assassin&quot; so they called a long time ago by nerfing Q, W, E, and R all at the same time. Pretty sure I&#039;m going to stop playing this champion.\n\nHowever, I think Zed could be played as a tank top lane because now he can build tanky and get free AD when he gets an assist from teleport fights (aka OP, good job Riot).\n\n{{champion:7}} : I don&#039;t even play this champion. I never have. But I do enjoy laning against her because she brings challenge. Now, her combo has been slowed down so much that I won&#039;t even see her as a threat. She can wait all day to get her combo off, meanwhile I&#039;ll just play a burst mage champion and instantly delete her (annie, viktor, syndra, etc.). As with Zed, I have NO idea why Riot nerfed how quickly her combo comes off. This just completely destroys her. I feel like Riot doesn&#039;t know how these champions work. Her true weakness was that she had to get in close range with W to land her combo... now she will just get deleted.\n\n{{champion:55}} : I don&#039;t play her but changes look nice. She has everything that Zed no longer has and does everything better. She can dash back to her W dagger like Zed does with his ultimate. And she can reset and go after more kills. Possibly going to be an OP champion. Right now, you just have to exhaust her as soon as she uses ultimate to counter play. Now... it&#039;s going to be even harder to click her like the pre W nerfed Zed.\n\n{{champion:245}} : nerf well deserved, but it&#039;s minor and fair. I don&#039;t play him.\n\n{{champion:35}} I play him a lot, used to be AD but now AP. He's... yeah... going to be hard to play. His early game is nerfed, which is his everything. If his early game gets nerfed, no early gank. The weakest jungler will be able to beat him. Note that the stealth change does not affect him at all. He was already able to avoid vision when he ganks with Q mechanics. So he just got nerfed in my opinion, equivalent to being deleted from the game. Control wards disable traps too, so I don't understand how any changes benefit him at all.\n\n{{champion:84}} : Riot decided to give Akali an extra dash with shroud, while not allowing pink ward to reveal her. I&#039;m not sure how her raw stats and ability stats have been changed, but I think she&#039;ll be an assassin you won&#039;t ever beat in lane unless you have Lee Sin on your team. I don&#039;t play her.\n\n{{champion:107}} : RIP. Rengar needs to leap from a brush to gain ferocity charges now. \n\n{{champion:91}} : Sure, he can now jump over terrains, which is OP. But he really can&#039;t do anything else. His dash is incredibly slow (RIP talon). Continues to be an assassin with zero escape mechanism and will not be played. Unless he jumps terrains of course, but 99% of the time, there will be no terrain to jump over in mid lane, and there&#039;s no way he&#039;s going to land a single solo kill in lane, let alone survive the laning phase.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2016-10-19T14:29:03.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly believe that with the jungle changes, Talon will be better as a jungler rather than a mid laner, b/c sustain in the jungle is a lot easier and he can do his rotations really fast with his new e.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-19T13:39:35.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really play Talon, but I've been thinking about his new E. \n\nIn theory, he wouldn't need to run flash anymore.

It crits if the enemy is in melee range, he gains hp if he kills a unit. He's being made into a prime assassin initiator.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyperiön","date":"2016-10-19T13:44:59.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look at game play that was uploaded yesterday to YT, and there is a lot.
