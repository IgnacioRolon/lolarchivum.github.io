Not sure whether Riot is intentionally disregarding this issue which is occurring only in Mac, or really does not know about this issue. \n\nPlease this this problem. I am sure there are many users who play or will play League on a Mac or Macbook.\n\nThank you,","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T17:05:30.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My first suggestion would be to check the shake mouse pointer, but there could be another cause since your OS doesn't have that.  The issue may be isolated to your OS and not League, so it's a bit unfair to suggest that we're disregarding it.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our tech team will look into this with you individually.  We'll help figure out why your game is freezing and look for some options.  We'll get back to you!","replies":[{"poster":"82490193_DEL","date":"2017-03-22T23:55:37.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I were able to log into my Support, and just submitted a support ticket.

As I said before, there is no \"Shake Mouse pointer to locate\" to check or un-check. \n\nThere were no such in-game freezes before the 7.1 patch. I have been playing league a couple of years, and never had a problem playing this game. This issue has started occurring since the 7.1 patch. \n\nIt is very likely that Riot did something wrong with the 7.1 patch, and have not found a solution for this problem yet. I am not the only one who has this in-game freezes. Please search this issue in Boards, and you will see many people complaining about this problem.\n\nI tried to submit a ticket, but I can't log into Riot Games Support.
