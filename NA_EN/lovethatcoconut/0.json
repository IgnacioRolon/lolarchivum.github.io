If i kept clicking he would intermittently take the command. No FPS (80+ FPS) drops or ping spikes (my usual~75ms) and the game kept going on around me with no problems. No rubber banding, DC's, or auto-walking back to base. \r\n\r\nI felt like /all chats would come in, and that's when the issue would happen. Only happened for 3 minutes or so. Also went into practice mode and had no problems moving around then.\r\n\r\nJust curious if this is something that has happened before, and has a fix, or if it's time for a new mouse lol","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T01:23:36.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your champion is sometimes pausing while moving, even without rubberbanding it could still be a sign of packet loss. Packet loss is essentially when some of the data gets lost while going between your network and our servers. That can cause some pretty odd things to happen, like champions not quite obeying your commands. \n\nWe can check to be sure if it's packet loss or not by using our [**Log Reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Take your most recent game logs (the game that gave you issues) and pop them into that reader. Take a screenshot or copy what it gives you and we can see where we need to go from there!","replies":[{"poster":"Lovethatcoconut","date":"2017-04-07T01:26:00.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you,\n\nI did use the log reader before the original post (sorry forgot to mention that,) and it showed no packet loss. I could still use abilities and chat, just not move.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T01:35:50.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iiiiiiinteresting. Since you don't seem to be having any kind of packet loss, it might be best to get you some more in-depth help from our tech guys.
