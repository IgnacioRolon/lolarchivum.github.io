If you want to dodge because you want to invite someone or what ever just do it, waiting to see if someone else will (sometimes includes troll picking) means you are choosing to waste time in hopes you save your time.\n\nWhile I would like people who do this to receive a longer dodge penalty, because being in que for 7+ minutes only to have 5 last second dodges in a row does get annoying, I don't think it would work out. The client still has some odd issues with crashing etc, and being forced to dodge with an extended penalty would suck.","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-06-03T02:52:33.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone dodged because someone locked in a \"troll pick\" I'd be glad they at least dodged.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2017-06-03T02:57:44.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zFrostistic,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HBxcia7N,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2017-06-03T02:52:33.454+0000)\n>\n> If someone dodged because someone locked in a \"troll pick\" I'd be glad they at least dodged.\n\nI meant, lets say you want to dodge because a friend wants to play but you don't want the penalty, so you not only wait for the last second to dodge but you lock in a troll pick to get someone else to dodge for you, and if they don't then you dodge last second. Sometimes the person who wants to dodge doesn't dodge, or the client didn't register they did and the game starts anyways with a troll pick.","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-06-03T13:50:53.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what she your point here? \n\nSo you're going to be an asshole to get someone to dodge because you want to play with your friend?

If dodging at the last second adds 10-20 minutes to your dodge timer, but dodging earlier only adds a minute or 2, people would (presumably) be more likely to just bite the bullet instead of wasting everyone else's time.\n\nAs for DCs, if you DC because of internet issues, chances are you probably shouldn't be playing a game that requires a persistent internet connection until you've sorted it out or determined if it was just an isolated event.\n\nIt would be unfair to people who DC because of the client borking things up though, although, at least in my experience, that's a rare edge case at worst.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My Heartshaker","date":"2017-06-02T13:52:31.979+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't really do much about this though.\nWhy should people who dodge at the last second be punished more than just normal dodgers, even if both are doing the same thing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FilDaFunk","date":"2017-06-02T16:54:06.656+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get a lot of trolls in champ select, had someone not dodged, I'm fairly sure I would've.\n\nPeople dodging are saving us from 20 minutes of time being wasted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ap Mid Burst","date":"2017-06-03T17:21:17.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodging should scale with time left.
