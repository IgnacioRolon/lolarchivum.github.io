AP Nasus wasn't meant to have a DFG. o.o He didn't have any AP burst scalings, all of it was DPS. lol. AP Sion was killed with the rework, DFG or not. AP Xin doesn't use a DFG, he uses a Lichbane and Nashor's Tooth. Gawd. AP Tryn also doesn't use a DFG because his AP scaling is on a Physical damage ability. AP Jax doesn't neeeeeed a DFG. AP Ashe is just pure troll. lol. Irelia has one magic damage ability and even with a DFG, it was never worth it. \n\nNow, we will all miss DFG on AP Rengar.

Since you can't force a meta (aka the norm). Yes it gave those champions who aren't made for building ap but have ap scaling, a little more power but in all reality, the majority were using DFG on Ahri, Veigar, Katarina, etc. Causing an unbalance in power. Most builds, were focused around DFG for those champions, limiting their builds because DFG was just so good.\n\nThe only counter play was to either burst first, or get banshees/zhonyas in hopes they're not fed enough to kill you anyway. That then put limits on how someone could play against another player, who had DFG on a burst AP champion.

It was more of an exploit and was the best way to play her, to deal the most damage. They're early game nerfs, so even if DFG wasn't getting removed - by the time you get DFG - she most likely has 4 points in her q anyway.  I'm not a pro, nor high tier, but these nerfs are not going to slow her down that much.\n\nSo, I believe she'll be the one to get nerfed, they'll help veigar with his passive and maybe nerf him, and they're already testing nerfs on Katarina. Clearly I'm not the only one seeing DFG as more of an Exploit than a needed (core) item on these characters.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2015-01-20T03:10:13.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in response to the title: really? they've been doing so for a year if not multiple years","replies":[]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-01-20T01:48:33.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It should come back but I do not believe it should come back at the same strength it had.\nThe current dfg, along with many other items, is too strong.
