People only bought homegaurds until they got them for free and the +20 move speed just made everyone in the game +20 movespeed faster.   There were some specific synergies (annie tp distortion boots) but otherwise they just sped up the game for no reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2016-11-09T02:38:19.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"teambuilder while good also had absolutely terrible queue times if you were anything but support and it was near impossible to find a game as mid if you weren't the one starting the group","replies":[{"poster":"Jubilee Phoenix","date":"2016-11-09T02:42:11.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But, did they have to remove it?

No.\n\nso you want to keep a mode that barely gets used and is more hassle than it's worth to actually maintain it? to have people just keep getting longer and longer queue times since no one is willing to sit through 10+ mins to get a single game... I had to wait AN ENTIRE HOUR ONCE! just to get in a group and have it fillled! AN HOUR! that is way too goddamn much and the only reason i even bother waiting that long was because i was just playing other things while waiting and i actually forgot that thing was still there. I checked and not a single time did the room filled up while i was playing other things. Teambuilder had to go! it was doing nothing but waste space while providing nothing good! \n\nYou want to know what we got back? we got the new champ select and the ability to choose two of our roles that we would rather play. That came because of the good things that came from teambuilder that people liked so they got rid of the bad which was the terrible queue times and mode in general while keeping what people actually liked about it and implementing it elsewhere. Who knows, maybe blind pick will get a ban system maybe it will not! no one knows but we'll see what they do after getting rid of it on regions that the mode is not being played at all! so it's falling into the same place that teambuilder and dominion fell. Modes that barely anyone played yet when it's being taken away everyone immediately jumps and defends the damn mode like it was the only thing they ever played when in reality they barely even played the damn thing","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-11-09T02:36:25.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solo Q is coming back though, so that's one thing.","replies":[]}]}
