Remove all slows from champion kits to Buff rylais. If you wanna slow someone you must by rylais or mallet now\n\nUltimately, the Slows did get nerfed when buffed Crystal Scepter. Particularly the way slows stack. (i.e. they don't anymore) And that was supposedly holding Crystal scepter back. (Because if scepter slow stacked with the slow from another mage, it would have been way ware oppressive) \n\nI wouldn't think you should simply remove all slows. (That would take away from some of the more unique mechanics form certain champs.) Though I would argue that Crystal Scepter shouldn't completely out shine those champs either. \n\nI see two potential problems. 1) Rylie's slow really is powerful enough to out shine other champs and dictate the meta. or 2) There's not a large enough opportunity cost building Crystal scepter over another item. (too gold efficient, too slot efficient, etc)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jubilee Phoenix","date":"2016-07-19T19:06:32.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heres the thing, most champions only have 2 slows in there kit.

Just because the champion can use their dash, the slow effect is still prevalent, allowing either the mage or their teammates to catch up. \n\nBut since you said it doesn't stop them from dashing away, let's slap on a grounded effect for 10s to Ryali's as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubilee Phoenix","date":"2016-07-19T20:50:49.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rylais is not hurting mobility champions, it's hurting the immobile champios.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2016-07-19T20:03:52.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jubilee Phoenix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OnQnPdhZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-07-19T18:53:57.073+0000)\n>\n> Rylais is just really broken right now. **It&amp;#039;s giving better slows them most champions have in there kit.** And all the meta mages right now bay this broken item.

And when I look at their kits, I simply find that they synergize too well with Rylais. \n\nFor Azir, it should be obvious. His sand soldiers apply spell effect on his AA. and as a result, apply the slow constantly. Giving him way better zone control. And for Viktor, it's all in his ult. Since they changed his ult to be more DPS oriented, Rylais became important for keep his opponents in the electric field. \n\nBut this doesn't give us the direction of the relationship. Is Rylais being abused because Azir and Viktor are OP? Or is Azir and Viktor being favored because Rylais is OP?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZapMyHeart","date":"2016-07-19T21:00:28.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then you need to buy a Banshee's or QSS if that is an issue with you. \n\nMages only have 4 abilities to apply the slow with, so the slow itself is not permanent (plus the diminishing effect of CC stacking) unlike the AD versions of Mallet/Gauntlet.
