It just compromises the mobility of Windows or whatnot, and I think it needs to be changed immediately. I understand it helps players stay focused on playing and not AFKing for 20 seconds at base. But....no. I am requesting a change to this feature.","replies":[{"poster":"Superyummyjelloo","date":"2013-10-05T19:45:29.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my. Did not see.

I don't think it would be hard to add a binding option and it would really help out since the mouse constraint update has messed up my multitasking.","replies":[]}]}
