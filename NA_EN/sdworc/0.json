Security certificate problem (THIS IS FIXED) where none of the links/videos/articles on the home screen loads but right after that\r\n2. I get the \"Logging onto chat service... problem where I cannot see my friends/list, invite or join games by my friends or see my clan chat.\r\n\r\nI've looked around and tried everything under the sun and have not found a resolution to my problem and was wondering how many other people are having the same problem? By my guess a good amount.\r\n\r\nSome solutions that worked for other people includes:\r\nA. Downloading the Digi certificates (fixed my security problem)\r\nB. Changing dates/time ahead/behind before re-syncing\r\nC. Deleting %temp% files (excluding ones that need to be skipped)\r\nD. Uninstalling Akamai session\r\nE. Resetting Internet Explorer\r\nF. Stopping IP Helper in run services\r\nG. Simply rebooting the program over and over/re-installing the program\r\n\r\nI've spent the last 2 hours doing these things, nothing works (I may have also missed some solutions I tried)\r\nAbout to install and logging into the riot mobile app/using a vpn/proxy service to get around this.\"\r\nCan anyone else share their experiences and solutions that aren't listed please?\r\nI see that this is happening to a lot of other people and only 1 out of 10 comments say that riot acknowledges and is working on the problem, the other 9 says that riot ignores it or tells you to check your ISP instead.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-23T21:07:27.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this issue quite a lot, and almost every time this issue pops up, it's caused by a local network configuration that doesn't play well with the League client. Every network setup is different, and even someone as close as your next door neighbor may have a *completely* different network than you. Because of this, some networks may have settings or configurations (modem settings) that may result in a poor connection to the servers. \n\nYou certainly started with some good steps to take in troubleshooting this. I recommend your next step to be working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), which has a good track record of resolving these types of issues. \n\nLet me know if you continue to see issues after following that guide.","replies":[]}]}
