There&#039;d still be one released every year. This would allow newer players to acquire the victorious skin that they may want, or allow older players to maybe get the victorious j4 that I&#039;ve never seen in all my years of playing. Let me see your thoughts and why you believe whether or not this is a decent idea. Thank you for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Contrabanned","date":"2016-08-01T18:55:46.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope the skin value would go down","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-01T12:33:04.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, I need victorious Elise ):","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbeForgotZhonyas","date":"2016-08-01T08:12:40.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I CAN 100% GET BEHIND THIS BECAUSE I WOULD KILL A MAN FOR VICTORIOUS MORGANA","replies":[]}]}
