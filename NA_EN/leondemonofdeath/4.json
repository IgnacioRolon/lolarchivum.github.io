Is he in a perfect state of balance or do you even intend to push his power a little. Get him out of bot lane perhaps. (It feels really stupid to poke a support who will just block it with his sheild, walk away, wait for shield to respawn, then eat your poke again. Other supports don&#039;t have much damage either so breaking his shield is time-draining.)  Or maybe make his top lane stronger, or his jungle stronger? Right now he just seems in a weird state tbh, so I just wanted to know if there&#039;s anything on the table.","replies":[{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2015-08-20T19:00:32.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hated the change to his 'w'.

I went to patchhistory .com or whatever it is, and it said he hadn't be changed in like 3 years haha XD my mistake sorry?","replies":[]}]}]}
