Would it show up in purchase history? Last time with the free champ I got Nami and she appeared in my roster but I did not receive the chest until 3 days later so I was very confused. This isn't a champ it's a skin though so it will be difficult to tell what I got this time haha XD? Are they already distributed so should I search all my champs, or will it take a bit longer?","replies":[{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2015-08-14T19:54:39.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said within a week of the event ending.
