I wanted to test out the new map. I was hyped. I went into team builder, I was placed with a team, I ran into lane. I had 20 FPS, up until enemies showed up, I then had 1 fps for the rest of the game. I mean I didn't mind it's just a normal and my support Thresh was understanding and I said sorry at least 5 times for my lack of FPS. I get out of lane 1/4/1 with maybe 30-40 CS, at least i'm trying. Gragas then begins to comment on how i'm ruining the game for everyone, how I can't comprehend normal human actions and begins to trash me over and over. ( Just to note, I was the highest ranking player on the team.) As I try to calm Gragas down telling her its only a NORMAL game and shes only losing 20 IP, her boyfriend jumps in, giving me the most logical argument ever. -\"You're a dumbfuck\", then LB hearing that Gragas is a female, jumps to protect her from me telling her its just a normal game. - \"You were probably buttraped by your father you virgin.\" I barely have time to play League of Legends because of having a real life, and when I go on to have 1 fun game, just 1, I get shat on like this, and the funny thing? Riot's gonna be all- \"You are now permabanned. You attempted to defend yourself, you can't stab a guy holding you at gunpoint and not expect to be arrested, can you?\" Well, I guess this was just a fun story for you all, nc b8 m8 i r8 8/8, but yeah this is why the community is terrible. Switch to Inf Crisis while you can, way better community.","replies":[]}
