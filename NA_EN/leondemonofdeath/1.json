Anytime soon? This is still a problem that persists and you guys just seem to ignore it, I don&#039;t understand why? Other games have systems to deal with this..\r\nLet me give you a recap on my last 3 games and you tell me why you still haven&#039;t done anything about this?\r\n1.Our Jungler, Udyr, got mad that our mid,Azir, took red. He then proceeded to run into the enemy team and feed a won game.\r\n2.Our sivir is afk from the very beginning of the game. Reconnects for 3 minutes during mid game, and afk&#039;s again.\r\n3.We get a troll in champ select, but decide to go with it. Bot lane is mad at the troll and both afk. The game turns to a 2 vs 5. I get demoted. \r\n\r\nNow if you&#039;re trying to brush of these problems as inconsistent, or they don&#039;t exist, or they only happen to 5% of all games, I think you&#039;re wrong. This literally just happened 3 games in a row, and you guys haven&#039;t even told us if you have a plan to combat this. I mean at least if a player is afk from the very beginning of the game, re compensate the loss. Many players have come up with fantastic ideas, but Riot brushes them off because why? At least tell us you have a plan, this game grows older but remains with the same fixable problems. You keep saying players will &quot;abuse&quot; any function that you make to combat this, but then you turn around and say 98% of players are good players. Yet you can&#039;t even trust us with a simple loss forgiven, or at least 50% lp deduction in stead of 100%. Trust your players Riot, what are you without them?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-13T06:23:51.304+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi LeonDemonOfDeath,\n\nI wanted to reach out to you and let you know that I read your post and feel for you, but unfortunately, things like matchmaking and player behavior are far outside my area of expertise as a game designer. I do acknowledge your pain is not some kind of unique anomaly, and I do hope that we can continue to work on solutions to these kinds of issues, because, you're right that they feel like shit to be a part of.","replies":[{"poster":"LeonDemonOfDeath","date":"2015-08-13T18:53:18.049+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Damn, I wish more rioters were active like you.
