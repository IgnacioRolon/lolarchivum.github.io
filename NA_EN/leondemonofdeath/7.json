Before, Fiora was in a bad state. The buffs Riot is planning, may or may not help. This is not a mindless buff Fiora thread, this is a &quot;Riot here&#039;s what we think&quot; thread. Allow me to begin with what I think. Skip to the end if you don&#039;t care, but you&#039;ll miss some neat-o jokes ( ͡&deg; ͜ʖ ͡&deg;)\r\n\r\n-First off, Fiora&#039;s ultimate, it&#039;s off thematically. It&#039;s also off in the sense of game-play wise. Before, Fiora was a split-push champion, such as Tryndamere, high damage, no real cc. High risk, high reward. Riot completely changed this. \r\nThey then gave her an ultimate that requires you to do a near impossible feat, only to summon a heal janna-style. I played Fiora recently, and although I got the early advantage, the second I hit 6, the enemy had a real tool while I had... I don&#039;t know what I had. If I killed my lane opponent, I got a heal...why? This did not help me in any way. Will her ult be useless until team fights begin? You gave her this big a restriction Riot.\r\n\r\nNow let me tell you, in my opinion how to fix this. We can keep the ult as it is, but change some numbers around and add some stuff in. For example, instead of dealing 20% of an enemy max hp upon hitting all 4 vital spots, make hitting each Vital spot do 5% max hp as bonus damage. Give her a passive on her ultimate so she does not fall behind such as &quot;Lust for challenge :- Fiora gains bonus attack damage and life steal the longer she remains in battle up to a maximum of 3-7/5.5-9.5/8-12% life steal and 5-5-20/6-24/7-28 over 4 seconds.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis way, Fiora will at least gain something from her ultimate for lane??\r\n\r\nLunge :- Next off, her Q. For the love of god her Q. Oh Jesus her Q. Someone fix her damn Q. The enemies vital was facing right towards me as I lunged him and it still did not proc it. I am so mad. Just make it so her Q can proc the vital no matter where it is as long as Fiora hit the enemy with Q.\r\n\r\nRiposte :- The W. How did I remember it&#039;s name? That&#039;s not the point. So Fiora&#039;s W can block Fizz shark from eating her, (The actual shark popping up, not when you toss them Nemo.)  but it can&#039;t block Brand&#039;s W? Now i&#039;m confused. I have no preference here as to which it should or shouldn&#039;t block, but I feel you guys are being kinda...fishy with this. (Heh, see what I did there? Okay i&#039;m sorry, please don&#039;t go.) but um yeah, I just wanted to tell you guys that.\r\n\r\nIdk I found her new E kinda entertaining, buff the ratio&#039;s idk I like it. Let it do something special for turrents to help her split push idk.\r\n\r\ntl;dr :- Let&#039;s share our opinions on Fiora, mine is that her R is restrictive, Q needs more vital targeting, W is broken?, E is cool but might need buffs?\r\n\r\ntl;dr;tl;dr :- I give u opinion, u give me opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-08-10T05:42:44.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Haven't played her.

So many different thoughts on this one. The prevailing one being it isnt thematic (which i personally disagree with) and that it is just awful to use (which I agree with to an extent). But so many people dont understand how it works. First, it isnt 20% max enemy hp upon hitting all 4 vitals. It works exactly as her passive, and it works exactly as you listed. Each Vital deals 5% max hp, for a total of 20% if you hit all 4.\n\nPeople arent treating her ult properly. It is (kind of) like a Tryndamere ult. The heal after kill allows you to do things that would normally be suicidal in order to get the kill. It lets you take risks to secure the kill and get that last hit off of the ult. And when you do it, good god does it feel good.\n\n> \n> This way, Fiora will at least gain something from her ultimate for lane??\n> \n> Lunge :- Next off, her Q. For the love of god her Q.

Just make it so her Q can proc the vital no matter where it is as long as Fiora hit the enemy with Q.\n\nI felt this way for the first couple of games as well. Then I went into a custom game with a friend for 10 minutes to test it. How it works is that when she dashes, she does a Yasuo Q style attack at the end of the dash. So the only way to get it to properly hit a vital is to not dash into them, you need to either dash slightly in front of them, or dash slightly to the side. If her Q proced a vital no matter where she hit them, that would make her laning even more ungodly oppressive than it is.\n\n> \n> Riposte :- The W. How did I remember it&#039;s name?

Like trying to drive in fog as thick as clam chowder. The only time it felt good was with telegraphed abilities like Jaxs E.\n\nHer E is overall fine, AA reset and slow. I just kind of wish she got a boost to attack speed for the 2 hits, since her current kit doesnt promote her building any real amount of attack speed anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"LeonDemonOfDeath","date":"2015-08-11T05:19:52.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For R- I mean an insta 5% max hp per hit. Not all 20% after hitting the 4 vitals. And while Tryndamere makes him invulnerable WHILE he fights, Fiora is AFTER she fights.
