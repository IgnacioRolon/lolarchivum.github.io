So I have some questions, and if I may, suggestions.\r\n1)- How far are you along in Taric's update, thought about anything yet, are thing coming together, ect?\r\n2)- Will it be a \"Sion\" type rework or a \"Viktor\" type rework in where one was pretty much reborn as a new concept while the other was just updated and remains intact.\r\n3)- Will his role be changing? Will he still support? Will he still be able to top and jungle? Because you know I love me my jungle Taric.\r\n4)- How much is his story going to change? Is he still an outsider from another realm, or will he be thrust unto RuneTerra, being born there?\r\n5)- Will he remain with the \"Mediterranean\" look or is that expected to be changed?\r\n\r\nAs for suggestions, if you're not to far along I hope you'll take a look at my art and maybe get inspired from it? My take on Taric is that he is not a knight- at least not a full knight- but a \"Spell-knight\" or \"Mage-knight\", as in someone with magical characteristics but still wears armor.\r\n(Sorry for the hammer and face, i'm terrible at drawing long pole like weapons and well.. faces.)\r\nI'll just elaborate on my sketch a bit here:- His right eye has tatoos on it, left has a blue transparent flame (To much anime?). Taric is wearing gloves. His right arm might look like armor but I guess I made it to buff, and those are tatoos on it. I did not add a shield because I did not know where to fit it in, but I suppose it would be on his back? Top armor, bottom robes, perfect combination for a Mage-Knight. \r\n\r\nAs for skills, if you're not completely changing them, allow me to pitch these ideas.\r\n\r\nR- Taric slams the ground, dealing low damage in a shockwave, but creating giant gems in an area around him which can be used for cover by allies. and are irradiated by aura, like Taric, so everyone around that aura will get a buff to AD and AP. *These gems wouldn't last long, would probably take only one hit to destroy, and Taric would only spawn like 3-4-5 of them overall, or around that.\r\n\r\nP- After every 3 auto attacks, a shard flies off from Tarics hammer, any ally who picks it up regains mana and will do 15% extra magic damage on the next AA, which will reduce skill's cooldowns by 1/1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds. Taric can pick them up too.\r\n\r\nQ- Taric imbues himself or an ally with an earthen shield, that heals them while it is active. *Like the opposite of Nautilus' shield. It's heal wouldn't be that much overall (20+2% max hp per second seems reasonable), because enemies can stop it by destroying the shield.\r\n\r\nW- Increase his armor, passive for allies, pretty much the same thing but instead the active would be an AA buff, still AoE, and he gains range on the AA.\r\n\r\nE- I was thinking something like Anivia's flash frost but faster, smaller, and less damage.\r\n\r\nAnd as for his story, if you guys are removing all that weird stuff like parallel worlds this would be my idea:- \r\nBorn into a wealthy family, many people envied Taric as he grew. At first the would think him to be a stuck-up rich child who did not care for anything but his money, but the latter was so inaccurate, that it confused those Taric had met. Growing up Taric despised the riches that was born into, except for the gems. He loved the gems. Taric searched for a meaning to his life, reading an memorizing every manuscript the town had by the age of 13. He then turned to magic, switching from one study to another until he had completed every study by the age of 17, but Taric had still not fulfilled himself. So he began to travel, until he joined and soon after, led a group of thieves. He was in it for the gems, they fascinated him, but still did not bring a meaning to his life. On a certain heist, Taric and his band were surrounded and caught, but instead of surrendering they fought. Seeing one of his allies in danger, Taric immediately jumped to the front line to save his life and protect his friend. That's when Taric realized what he was missing in his life, what would fulfill him. Defending other, protecting people with his magic, hammer, and stylish gems. Taric then dedicated his life to the protection of others, and expanding his collection of precious stone, becoming a well-known hero and a friend to all.\r\n\r\nI hope you guys like my suggestion and i'm open for feedback, especially criticism on anything you have to say. Although It might take me some time to respond, I hope Red's see this and at the very least if not get an idea from it, enjoy my perspection of how Taric should be :).","replies":[{"poster":"PoE00dpWDk","date":"2015-01-28T03:27:55.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your ideas for the reworked abilities, my favorite one would be the reworked passive.
