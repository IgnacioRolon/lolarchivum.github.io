When I saw Veigar's nerf I was devastated, now I can't say that i'm one of those guys who's played him forever and he's been my main since 2009, but what I can say is that Veigar has always been a fun pick. He never seemed unhealthy to me. When I saw the nerf I thought Veigar would be ignored,but I came to the boards and wow, you guys are amazing. You all stopped bickering about Lee Sin, or Fizz, or whoever it is now to support our favorite little villain. Thank you guys.\r\n\r\nNow, Riot do you not see the outcry of the community? Are you going to ignore us? We don't want this, we want the nerf reverted. We want our old Veigar back. Veigar isn't Gragas, who was mobile in the LCS and killed people with 2 abilities regardless of them being a mage or not. Gragas did not care about someone having a banshees or not. Gragas didn't care period.  You reworked Gragas into a toplaner, you didn't bury him 6 feet underground. So why are you trying to rid us of Veigar? This is not a buff in anyway. This is a complete and obsolete nerf. You lied to us. Again. The question is, will you fulfill your promises this time, will you listen to the community, will you give us back our Veigar, will you ungut our Final Boss?","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-02-28T16:52:27.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone first timed veigar recently on our team, got firstblood, beat a yasuo and then continuted to say.. veigar is OP\n\n We tried to explain to him how he was nerfed and that if he thought he was OP now.. then.. yea... \n\nIdk don't knock veigar till you try him, some people still play him, I see alot more of veigar dispite his nerf..","replies":[{"poster":"LeonDemonOfDeath","date":"2015-03-01T00:46:13.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo can block Veigars Q way easier now he should have had no trouble. He should've began a Banshees and finished it second and probably had a mercs for 5th item. I don't know what he was doing but that's not playing Yasuo. Every champ after a major change is played a lot.\nRegarding Banshees which I assume will be your next point, Veigars had a way easier time popping it then stunning you and letting their team rip you to shreds before but now your stun is way to predictable, you have to want to be hit by hit. You can't even place it on a place you know where an assassin is gonna be because they'll just walk out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LeonDemonOfDeath","date":"2015-02-28T16:38:51.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also want to mention that I have not been able to play League for a long time now due to not having the resources so..","replies":[]}]}
