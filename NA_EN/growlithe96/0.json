Any way to get my vote back?

Most likely, we won't be able to reverse that vote, but it's not the best choice to have blindly picked knowing you might not have wanted to choose that option. \n\nAll in all, I should be able to tell which one you picked if you remember if it was the left, middle, or right one. Which one did you click on?","replies":[{"poster":"Growlithe96","date":"2017-10-13T23:40:04.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I chose the left one, but, at least it was not a bad vote.
