If that wasn't you who refunded it, hit up our account team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) asap to make sure your account is still secure. No worries, if someone else had refunded that skin we'll be able to get it back for you as well ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"punkhazard000","date":"2017-07-09T23:53:40.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!!\n\nThank you so much for your time.\n\nI checked my Bank account today and, I only saw a debit in.\n\nSo, I sent a ticket.
