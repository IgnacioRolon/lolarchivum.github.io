Clearly meant \"interested in,\" my bad. ANYWAYS...\n\nNeon Strike Vi has to be my favorite skin next to DJ Sona. (I like to drop dem beats)\n\nHowever, I haven&#039;t seen many concepts that build off of \"Neon Strike.\" When I hear \"Neon Strike,\" I picture a brightly colored champion with flashy particles that are in your face. Some champions that come to mind that would work well with this concept would be{{champion:236}}, {{champion:131}}, {{champion:89}}, {{champion:127}}, and {{champion:85}}. They are all hard engage that really work well the idea itself, as well as having particles that can be used to really fit the theme.\n\nI&#039;m hoping to see if others are interested in the line  and/or have ideas on what champions would be best suited. Maybe if enough people show interest the idea can be considered.

It's also a drastic difference compared to her currently available skins.\n{{champion:112}} : He has a flashy skill set that could really work with the color scheme. He's also in the same boat as Lux, since his skins are more dark; a brighter skin could really round out his skin roster well.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2015-04-03T00:53:28.855+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard that one way to attract the elusive \"artist\" is to provide concept art. \n\nThey eat that stuff up like it's free bagels on Wednesday.","replies":[{"poster":"Crystal Castles","date":"2015-04-03T12:18:15.586+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sadly I'm more of a Math/Statistics guy than an artist. :C I have ideas....but not the talent.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-04-03T14:29:10.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Doesn't mean you can't share them!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2015-04-03T03:05:01.388+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.deviantart.com/art/Neon-Strike-Sion-488972365\n\nNow how cool would this be?
