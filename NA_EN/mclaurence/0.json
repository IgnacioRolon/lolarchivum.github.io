Sky blue project yasuo can be awesome. Also add summuner icon of project yasuo. My favorite champion is yasuo and its just sad to think that he was the first project skin and his skin is ultimately the worse out of all project skins. Yasuo&#039;s project is just terrible looking skin for a project. A lot of champions are having project skins now and their project skins are epic but yasuo hes left behind. I would really appreciate it a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-15T16:50:28.409+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There aren't plans to update PROJECT: Yasuo at this time. \n\nChanging the color of the particles and PROJECT: Yasuo's skin thematic isn't something we would consider, should we update him in the future. If anything, the texture would be updated.  Many players purchased this skin because of the way he looked and sounded, and there isn't a convincing argument to change the color scheme, imo, as there aren't any gameplay issues, and the change is based on personal preference. \n\nWhile yes, his base does utilize light blue, skins are meant to be an alternative fantasy, meaning it should break away from the base, both in thematic and color scheme whenever possible. \n\nPROJECT: Yasuo was the first PROJECT skin, you're correct. As with most skin lines, they evolve and grow, and the first one may not be exactly like the newest, shiny one. Pool Party may be a good example of how a line has evolved over time. :) We learn from the first time we create a thematic, and we gain takeaways of what would be an even cooler idea for next time.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-07-15T17:42:34.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is Yasuo getting his PROJECT summoner icon at least? He didn't get one when the last set of PROJECT skins was released. Now is the perfect chance. I mean, he's getting a special border this year to make up for not getting one last year.\n\nOn the topic of skins & summoner's icon: Are you guys considering make one for Super Galaxy Rumble? The Super Galaxy skins this year came with their own bunch of summoner icons & Rumble was left out even though he was 1st of the skin line, like Yasuo for the PROJECT skins.\nLet's look at what happened with masked wrestler skins. Braum was the 1st of the skin line with his El Tigre skin released more than a year prior to the next set of skins in that line. When the skins for Voli, Gnar & Mundo popped up on the PBE, they all got summoner icons even Braum. Unlike Yasuo & Rumble, Braum wasn't left of receiving a summoner icon. \n\nI'm not asking you to give previous members of a skin line all the bells & whisltes newer members get. I know creating a summoner icon takes up resources & time that could be used on something else. I just want you guys to think about it one of your skins development meetings. For example: when you guys expand the Star Guardian (we all know it's a \"when\", no \"if\" here) & create summoner icons for those champs, don't forget the OG Star Guardian, Lux.\n\nI know some may wonder why I'm putting so much effort into this. Many champs don't have icons dedicated to them. Sure the icon of a duck, Gromp or Poro is good for some, but others probably just want a summoner icon for their favorite champ or their main champ. I feel the summoner icon for skins are the only chance to get one for those champs outside of special events like Bilgewater last year. \n\nThat's all I wanted to bring up today. Later & have nice day or night.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-15T23:04:50.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Is Yasuo getting his PROJECT summoner icon at least?

You're also correct in that it sucks if your champion was the first and didn't get the icon. There have been several discussions around this, so it's not a closed subject. In a lot of cases, it isn't something currently in the works, but that doesn't mean we couldn't consider it for the next time (or any time, really), similarly to what we did with Braum. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McLaurence","date":"2016-07-15T05:00:59.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"About Yasuo's project skin or just normal yasuo loading screen?
