It's an ONLINE MULTIPLAYER COMPETITIVE game that you have to play with 4 other players in your team and 9 other players in a game, and talking shit is punishable? \ncursing players, saying bad words to their family members , telling people to get certain diseases etc is toxic and getting punished for those thngs is understable. but talking shit to players who feed and still talk like they are not the reason that we are losing the game is punishable? how does getting punished for trash talking in an online competitive game that even pro players do,makes sense?","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-08-29T22:18:55.569+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but did i curse?\n> ---\n> voidsyy: YOU FUCKING NOOOB\n\nYeah, you did, but the cursing is the least of your problems.\n\nYou harassed and attacked and insulted people for pretty much the majority of those three matches.
