My idea is to incorporate something like an IP restriction. There are ways around everything, but it could at least inhibit how rampant &quot;smurfing&quot; currently is. Also, why not limit those with the same IP address? Accounts sharing the same IP address could earn far less LP. Losing would have more of an impact and grant a lower payout giving the booster and boostee less incentive to rank together. The question then becomes, what about those who play their same accounts under different IP addresses? Give an IP change a cooldown, like a week. So let&#039;s say Brandy Bronzefive suddenly logs in to her account in Detroit, when she&#039;s used to playing in Seattle, block her from ranked for a week until her account adapts to the new location. \n\nPS. I&#039;m sure there are things I haven&#039;t considered or even acknowledged but I&#039;m sure there are remedies for them as well. \n\nPersonal Thoughts: Taking ranked seriously, being dedicated and applying all the experience you&#039;ve accumulated during your climb for your tier just to wind up wasting 30 minutes of your life and losing all the hard earned LP you made almost an hour before that game to be all for nothing because some a**hole wants to beat up kids is not only tilting, but it ruins the climbing experience for everyone.\n\n- Thanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-07-16T21:56:15.479+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"The comments responding to this are all calling out good questions that need to be answered.

And this is the default in Germany (don't know about other countries) [Edit: Apparently it's not really the default anymore, still fairly common though]. Paying additional cash every month just to get a static IP in order to play LoL doesn't really seem very sensible either.\nAnd since you want to also heavily penalize people who play on the same network, playing from a larger network with a static IP (like a university hotspot) is not an option either.\n\nThat alone means you are at the very least highly inconveniencing by my estimate 16.7% of EUW players, which is a respectable 4.1% of all LoL players. I'd say it's not unlikely that the vast majority of those players will no longer have any interest in ranked anymore at all.\n\nNow add to that everybody with a dynamic IP address who **doesn't** have a forced disconnect, but who occasionally has trouble with their router, needing to reset it. People who are forced to travel a lot for their job (or essentially live in two places) who might want to play during the week **and** on the weekends.\n\nThe list of innocent players that such a change would effectively drive away from ranked is virtually endless.

You say one but then reference the other. If you want to make it so smurf accounts rank up slower because they share an IP with another account, outside of the issue that an IP is not linked to an account, it would just make it so peoples smurfs stay in lower elos longer. Right now if a player is better than the elo they're in by such a wide margin as to call it \"ruining the game\", they won't stay in that elo long enough to disrupt many games. Infact most of this just comes from people having good games, and you just assume they're smurfs. Gold's aren't that much better than silvers, and plats make up 5-7% while diamonds 2-1%. Even if they're all smurfing at the same time there's not enough of them to have that big an impact on silver and lower games.","replies":[]}]}
