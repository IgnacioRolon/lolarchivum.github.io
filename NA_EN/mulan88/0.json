It's all about seizing opportunity with him and capitalizing on enemy mistakes.

He can annihilate your entire minion wave and keep in mind its probably around 2 Q's and bunch of autos perhaps maybe even 3 (I dont know it been long time since I played league) + ALL Ekko Mains usually build {{item:2033}} {{item:1082}} and that allows him to Q more in lane. IMO Ekko's biggest problem is his W, his W is terrible , its really obvious where he is gonna use it even if he just came out of fog of war, you can walk out of it easily because of the 3 s delay, I barely ever see someone land it in lane.\n\nYou should of seen ekko during release, disgustingly op.

As I've mentioned before, his abilities are very telegraphed, and if he gets in range to E-Q you, then that's your fault. He gets easily countered by a lot of champions such as Kassadin and Yasuo. BTW, Ekko sees no play at all in Pro play, and is rarely seen in solo q, as many one tricks prefer to play hard carry champs like yasuo or zed. My suggestion is try playing Ekko yourself, as he really isn't that bad as you put him to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2018-12-25T17:26:39.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude\nI don't know if you understand this, but he isn't just standing there all lane and I choose to get in range or not.

Because he is not overpowered, as obviously seen in higher elos. There are so many champions that do way more damage. If u play a mage like TF, u can zone him.
