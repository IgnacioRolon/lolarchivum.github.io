He's using base animations - is base Blitzcrank something you also have trouble using in game? \n\nUnfortunately, it was decided early on that the run animation for this skin wasn't going to be changed for gameplay reasons. If you'd like more context on the reasoning from the team who worked on him, please check out the [animator's comment](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/UGxGnxIJ-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-lancer-paragon-lancer-rogue-blitzcrank?comment=00010002) regarding the run, as well as the art lead's [post on the Nexus](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/dev-doubling-up-on-blitzs-hook/) for a more in-depth understanding of this skin's development.","replies":[{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2018-04-11T19:04:28.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No other skins just the lancer one.  Its the interaction with the legs and arm and how they move too much.  I do have to take medicine for flying and long car trips. (Dramamine) \n\nIts like he is moving too slow for the fast pace of his arms and legs.  Once you start the game or use his run speed its a lot worst.  I'm sorry but if they are the same animation, then the lancer one is a lot faster compared to the counter parts or something.  \n\nIt is what it is.  But gets someone that get motion sickness easy to play it and get there option.  I'm not saying change it completely.  Just make it so people that are prone to get motion sickness doesn't get sick because the arm are moving at double the speed as the other skins.  This isn't a BS post.  I tried it again last night and it did the same thing.  I have post this 2 other times to you I believe.  I understand game balance might effect your income so you don't jump to fix customer issues there.  However, get some that has the same issues I have with motion sick to play the skin and maybe you will understand.  \n\nIt never fails, make a serious post and riot will tell me to read something that will tell me i'm wrong.  This feeling like I need to throw up and dizziness that makes me take a break for a few times.  (even during the game) must be all in my head or a around about way to get his walk changed.   Nope could just be a customer giving him honest opinion.  I'm done trying to post on the boards.  Its either you tell me I'm wrong on my personally opinions/feeling/health or someone else is correct without every playing the champ.  This is what leads people to ask if you actually play your game.\n\nedit SEE TWO F*CKING DOWN VOTES BECAUSE I VOICE A MEDICIAL ISSUE!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-11T19:28:41.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My intent wasn't to discount any personal issues you have when playing the skins, but I did want to give full visibility on why the skin was developed the way it was. One of the biggest discussion points was surrounding his run animation and why the team didn't veer in the direction of something totally new.\n\nAdditionally, I did want to ask for more context around what you're describing because these skins use the same run animations, but after loading them up in game, it appears there's a small difference -  the arms and how they're swinging. Base Blitzcrank's arms are looser and swing more freely, as opposed to the skins where they sway closer to his body because of the skin's model design. So, the *run* itself is the same, but the arms swing a bit differently because of the design of the skin, particularly the drill arm.\n\nI'm more than happy to raise your concerns to the team, and it's something we can keep in mind for skins in the future. I'm not sure we'd be able to make the Lancer skins' arms swing like base Blitzcrank's, though, because of the drill that he has on his right arm; the model and rig isn't built to swing much more freely like base. ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"TurtleSaurusRex","date":"2018-04-11T19:34:22.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cant we all just be friends :'), this is a place of love and bug fixing.

How I have played pong to eq to halo to wow and everything between.  I was on a team invited to the national Halo tournaments. (ranked 3rd in state of TN)  My age group have paved the way for all of gaming.  I spend money on games and we are the gate keepers to our kids spending money on games.  But I deleted it because all I get is mocked and attacked on these boards.  \n\nI don't care what you do anymore.  This will be my last post on these boards.  I have over 30 years in gaming experience and seen all the different issues that have came and I have never seen such a hateful and lack of intelligent community before.  Incapable of thinking outside the box.  Can't realize that maybe there are other perspectives than there own.  This is because WE (my generation) made every available at your finger tips on demand.  You never had to learn to watch or build up or research things.  Just google it right????  \n\nIts insulting I can raise an honest issue I have without talking about balance.  Without saying change the skin or walk.  Just please fix the motion sickness issue.  and get down voted and cast to the side.  Hey, I guess 99% of you don't have this issue so screw the little guy and GET GUD!!! (low play things seem to have this issue with Riot) Riot has created this hate and only listen to the kids and collective minds of them.  Who's money do you think they use to pay for it?  Who pays for the internet?  the computers?  Because I can tell you when I was in college my parents helped.  Your target marketing niche which would be people like me.  \n\nWhere is your base model for balance?  You haven't even defined what balance is.  Where is the game plan or model you are working the game toward?  You can't even make up your mind on what classes or subclasses or roles you want.  Your whole long term plan, what is it?  What is the marketing of this plan.  You have no real bars standards set.  How can you work toward balance and exciting game, if you have no standard to work toward?\n\nSee I come from a generation where games were hard.  No online walkthrough.  I have spend 10,000's of dollars into gaming.  I don't need you or some kid living at home to tell me that I'm not getting sick.  It must all be in my head or I'm lying.  I don't need to be laugh at, made fun of, or stress out on thing I'm sure I have a decade or more of knowledge on.  Sure I'm not always right but your custom experience and community is one I can do without.  Lets be honest.  You don't care about me and wouldn't listen or response if you didn't get paid to.  I'm ok with that, its just business.  And its nothing personal.  But at the end of the day you are going to do what ever you want to do.  Be damned of past knowledge or experiences.  This is the millennial way.  This is the way of every new generation.\n\nI prefer just not to read the idiocy of the boards and Riot.  No hard feels against you at all.  The hive mind just isn't for me.  I prefer expression, creativity, and new / different ideas.  This board nor Reddit is for that.  Its for hive mind and control narrative.  Don't worry about passing it on. I'm just not going to play the skin.  Lesson learned not worth buying skins just use base models.  My voice has been silenced.  Good luck on your endeavors and where life might lead you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2018-04-11T19:13:02.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, after looting both skin during the last event bag, that walking animation really make them subpart in the blitz skin option, clearly behind battleboss, iblitz and pilltover (would have prefer no engine at all to be more cohesive)\n\nWhile i understand clarity with skin is important, I kinda regret that sometimes this clairty is drop without consideration of gameplay impact (the best exemple being nighbringer yasu ult animation who force you to learn the new patern of the skin if you want to be able to land optimal chain cc while you are not the one who chose to play with that skin in your game)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
