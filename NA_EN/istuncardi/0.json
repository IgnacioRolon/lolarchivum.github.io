Those TT days the account was playing an inhuman amount of games. On 9/1/19 over 30 games were played. \n\nHaving a very bot-like name then changing it when the gap has ended (and changing it to something that taunts the number of accounts you have was just a cherry on top IMO).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFrankly, I don't believe you in the slightest with all of those adding up.","replies":[{"poster":"IStunCardI","date":"2020-01-10T01:28:18.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I dont care if you believe me or not.

They are then sold to people who got permabanned but want to continue to ruin ranked games and aren't willing to level an account to 30 with non-ranked matches themselves.
