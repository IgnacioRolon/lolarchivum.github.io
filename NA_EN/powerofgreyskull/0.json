You should be able to disable the ambient noises while in the SR lobby by muting SFX.  This was the same bar you used to increase the sound.  Muting the SFX there should not impact your in-game experience.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"powerofgreyskull","date":"2017-05-31T15:49:09.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that would mute the sounds that I want to hear;  queue pop/ban time/other invites","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-31T15:55:55.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fair.  In this case, my suggestion for you would be to let your voice be heard and share your feedback to the client devs at our [client discussion boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion).  Since this doesn't appear to be a bug but more a suggestion, let them know how you feel about adding an option specifically for muting lobbies.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"powerofgreyskull","date":"2017-06-04T18:27:20.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do. I got the same result from LudusBonus on the support team.
