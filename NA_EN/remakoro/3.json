You know - one that does not get shit on by almost every dash or skill and hits your through \"UNSTOPPABLE\" or spell shields/black shield. \nYou CC them - they finish all their queued actions and only then decide to get stunned. Even if dash aint unstoppable it just keeps going as if nothing happened. \nI almost could not believe my eyes when i saw that Rakan stops if you CC him during his dash. Thats was so... FRESH. I remember things like that happening when i just started playing in season 4. And for 2 last years i hardly remember even single dash that would care to stop after you CC that m@$%@r","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-17T18:23:55.604+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats the point of slows with all these dashes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zed genius","date":"2018-07-17T17:54:40.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Shields are true, they are flat out hp shields","replies":[{"poster":"remakoro","date":"2018-07-17T17:58:57.268+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"im pretty sure they can get even more truer. \nIm pretty sure CertainlyT can make that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ALORFEC0CK","date":"2018-07-17T17:52:54.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed.. and everyone is getting dashes so hows the cc supposed to matter?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-07-17T18:26:21.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree; buff {{champion:40}}.","replies":[]}]}
