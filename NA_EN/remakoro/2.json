In reality they giving you freelo by trolling enemies or actually carrying you just as often as they troll you or carry enemies. But its fine with you cause its freelo, right? \n\nPlat 5+ is less than 10% of player base. Dia 5+ Is less than 1%\nI dont have actual stats for how many high elo players actually enjoying smurfing but lets say 100%\n\nHow 1% of players manages to invade and ruin every game in low ELO - to which 70% of players belong, while they also have more games on their main accounts than you?\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nYou are crying about smurfs as if they have some kind of unfair advantage but they do not. They playing the same game as you, using same items, runes and champions. \n\n*BUT HURR DURR THEY HAVE MORE HOURS PLAAAYED*\n\nOh really? Do they? Some players in bronze have more hours played than many in Plat+. And they still sitting in bronze without any idea why. Does not seem like amount of hours played gives you any advantage by itself.\n\nYou are crying as if they robbing you of your agency but you had none in the first place. You are playing coin toss because you have literally no idea what you should be doing at all. So you actually have absolutely no impact on the outcome of the game. Thats why every time you end up at mercy of those that do know what they should be doing. \n\nAnd last but not the least... \nIn ANY even a bit competitive or team game, sport or similar activity - football, volleyball, tennis, chess, marathon, sprint, go, shogi, airsoft, RTS, FPS, any kind of martial art, the best, fastest, most reliable way to get better is to have someone stronger, more skilled, more experienced than you as your opponent. Even simply watching and may be imitating someone like that would allow you to improve tremendously. But actually experiencing complete wreckage yourself really lets you see what you are doing wrong. Every mistake becomes apparent, your wrong moves actually get punished, your bad habits get exploited. And then you can see where you should improve.  One match with someone better worth hundreds or even thousands of those with your peers. Some people willing to pay actual real life money to get such opportunity. \n\n*BUT BUT IF OPPONENT IS TOO STRONG THEN IT WONT BE USEFUL AT ALL!*\n\nYes. Thats absolutely not true. That does not apply to games where you have to use your head at all. And applies only to some degree to physical activities. Yes after getting wrecked by professional player kid from primary school hardly will be able to see where he was wrong because fundamentals of his opponent were that much better. But even then. He can sit down and see. HOW they were better? Why nothing of that he did could be effective? Mb i was too slow? Too short? Not accurate enough? What his body looks like? What kind of training he doing to be like that? What his stance looks like? How does he throw? After even one glimpse of real thing he will be able to find countless possibilities to get better and get advantage over his peers. \n\nAnd you, after getting matched with someone better than you, come to forums to cry about that, instead of looking for a way to improve. Absolutely, fucking, disgusting.\n\nImagine kid running home from the street with snot dripping from his nose and crying to his parents\n-Mom-person! Dad-person! We were playing soccer and some kid absolutely wrecked us! UAAAA! THATS SO UNFAIR! Pls do something that he wont ever come to our playground!\n*mom and dad look at the kid a bit worried and then ask him*\n-What happened? Was that an older kid? Was he like, breaking rules? \n-No! He was of the same age and played abiding every rule! But he was way too good! Pls beat him up so he wont ever show up!\nAnd at this moment parents will look at their kid and think - &quot;god, what have we done wrong? How did we get such spineless little shit?&quot;\n\nYou are that kid.\n\nSome madman on forum compared smurfing with beating up elderly. But that cannot be further from truth. You are in the same conditions. There is no elderly and no one in disadvantage. \n\n*BUT HURR DURR I DONT WANNA IMPROVE I JUST WANT TO CLICK CLICK AFTER THE WORK/SCHOOL. I HAVE LIIIFE*\n\nThen dont cry about rankeds. You clearly deserve whatever you have in such case. If you willingly giving up any possible agency you could have in the game then you cant bitch about having no impact on its outcome.\nNo matter what happens, even if riot will &quot;fix&quot; smurfing and trolling and DC and AFK and make matchmaking absolutely perfect - you gonna be playing coin toss. \n\nYou are just bad and dont want to improve. \nForsaking will to improve is the same as giving up on living. Its the same as being dead. \nDead should not speak. Dead should stay silent and let living enjoy their lives. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reWj4flXVD0","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-06-11T11:39:14.215+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"the way i see smurphing in this game is the same as allowing pro athletes to compete in elementary school competitions.\n\nit might be fun for them and their viewers to destroy a couple of fourth graders aswell, but it can hardly be considered fair.\n\nmost of the players in the lower devisions are still learning the game. having diamond to challenger ranked players fuck around in those divisions to generate twitch and youtube views is actually pretty disgraceful.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-06-11T11:45:41.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jYLWihA7,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-06-11T11:39:14.215+0000)\n>\n> the way i see smurphing in this game is the same as allowing pro athletes to compete in elementary school competitions.\n> \n> it might be fun for them and their viewers to destroy a couple of fourth graders aswell, but it can hardly be considered fair.\n> \n> most of the players in the lower devisions are still learning the game. having diamond to challenger ranked players fuck around in those divisions to generate twitch and youtube views is actually pretty disgraceful.\n\nyour argument is a double edge'd sword.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-06-11T11:48:48.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZiLess,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jYLWihA7,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-06-11T11:45:41.415+0000)\n>\n> your argument is a double edge&#x27;d sword.\n\nin what regard? \n\nthe entire ladder sysem is created to separate people by different skill levels. players fucking around in games with skill levels far below their own messes with the entire concept.\n\nthere are people who argue, that playing against higher ranked players is an opportunity for them to learn how to get better at the game.\n\nbut a silver level player whos getting stomped by a master level player will probably learn as much as a pre schooler in a theoretical physics lecture. learning is a gradual process.  players in lower divisions who are still learning the basics of the game and struggle with concepts like csing wont understand why they got stomped, and its not like the guy is trying to explain it to them.","replies":[{"poster":"remakoro","date":"2018-06-11T12:04:09.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you actually will try to learn you will be able to do it. \nEven by looking at stats you will be able to guess why he stomped you.

The highest rated player in our club was only 1480. \n\nI did go on to win my first tournament, but it was because I was matched with players who were within reach of beating.\n\n**Scenario 1.** You are rated 1300. You lose to a Grand Master. \nThe grandmaster kidbitzes with you after the game. \nResult: sure you'll learn a little and if you take the GMs advice. You might improve, if you understand it. \n\n**Scenario 2**. Same situation, but this time the GM doesn't explain it. You review the game and draw the wrong conclusions. Very little actionable experience is gained here.\n\nAnd in both scenarios you actually knew your opponent was a GM. \n\nIn LoL you don't have that luxury. It's quite possible that you got stomped by a significantly better player yet if you're nnew you assume their at least in you elo. Additionally,  very little if anything is learned from being stomped like that. \n\n\nBecause there are so many things wrong with their play that they can't begin to understand where they went wrong.\n\nAnd it's very rare that any player let alone a high elo Smurf takes a new players under their wing to help them to become better. \n\nThe LoL experience would be better if Riot could reduce or eliminate Smurfs all together.

The smurfs are the kids put in A division soccer going to C division and kicking the enmy team in the nuts, and it is moronic to belive that the C kids not liking this means they are not taking an opportunity to improve. Improvement is learning how people AS GOOD as you or slightly better play then improving beyond that to git gud, what you said has some truth but generally ignores not all people in all situations are able to learn from a stomp.
