You can dodge, kite, and outplay the guy now just as much as he can mistime, misposition, or just straight up fucking miss. Before, WW just automatically landed on you by being close enough with R. Sure he sticks a bit, because his diving tool is on a semi-long cd. What's he SUPPOSED to do?

And in the case of Skarner, I suppose we can say he has 1 spell that can be considered a balance problem; but then again Zoe has 3.\n\nOn the topic of E as you brought up, I'll list you precisely why Zoe's E, especially on release, was completely busted. it had:\n\n* Okay damage when hit\n* it \"slows\" the target for 2 seconds. I'll get to this\n* it then stuns the target for another 2 seconds (if not attacked), so a total of a 4 second CC\n* the slow/drowsy used to have a slow that's a maximum of 70%. So it was basically a 2 second root that transition to a 2 second stun when leveled.\n* the stunned target then take the next hit with an maximum of double damage\n* the spell's range is also doubled when going through terrain\n* if Zoe fails to land her E, it will become a trap that is wide enough to completely block jungle paths, for 4 seconds. The trap applies the spell effect to anybody that walks and dashes through it.\n* if Zoe hits her E,  all of the previous effects barring the trap component would apply, it would also partially reset the ability's CD. The spell already had merely a medium level CD for all of this, but no, it also needed a reset apparently.\n * The reset component also used to trigger on ALL targets, so even hitting minions would give the partial reset.\n* Lastly, Zoe's E also used to be UN-CLEANSE-ABLE as part of its INTENDED feature.\n\nTell me how that's not busted.\n\n....\n\nAnd again, there's her \"Unstable Portal\" W, which is self-explanatory. And her Q exhibits almost all of the problems old Nid used to have, especially after level 6 with her ulti.\n\nZoe's design itself is fundamentally broken. It's pretty crystal clear.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2018-07-18T20:52:48.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Do you realize how we can see it through another lens?\n\n> * it then stuns the target for another 2 seconds (if not attacked), so a total of a 4 second CC\n\nThe CC is not as effective as a regular stun because it lets you reposition, and prepare your cleanse. You can also blink, dash, zhonya, shield, heal preventively because you *know* she's going to attack when the stun kicks in. Plus, the stun stops as soon as you take damage, requiring good coordination, and no use of DoTs.\n\n> * the stunned target then take the next hit with an maximum of double damage\n\nThe spell deals only its full damage if sufficient damage is dealed afterwards. Otherwise, it just deals half damage.\n\n> * the spell's range is also doubled when going through terrain\n\nThe spell has a limited range when not going through terrain, forcing it to be used in a less reliable way, and then needing movement abilities to reach the far target.\nThe projectile is also not that fast, and has a pretty telegraphed cast animation.\n\n> * if Zoe fails to land her E, it will become a trap\n\nThe spell lands a trap that is instead automatically proc'd if the projectile hits mid-course.\n\n> * Lastly, Zoe's E also used to be UN-CLEANSE-ABLE as part of its INTENDED feature.\n\nThe CCs were considered as separate, but cleansing was still easier because you had a 2-sec window to react to it. Now you can cleanse the drowsy and negate the sleepy altogether.\n\n> And again, there's her \"Unstable Portal\" W, which is self-explanatory.\n\nThe RNG is very much controlled to avoid abuse (like the \"no-teleport\" rule), and it's pretty clear what's going to happen. The shard is visible for everyone, and you can know what spell she has.\n\n----\nZoe was problematic at first, but nothing that some tweaking couldn't resolve.

The kit was balanceable (albeit OP) and it has been balanced.\n\nHer E is the lesser evil in her kit; the fact her \"lesser evil\" is only solvable by slashing out almost 2/3 of the ability after launch is already pretty telling.\n\nBut the biggest evil is her W. Her W will NEVER be balanced, in the same way how Unstable Portal forever ruins Hearthstone.\n\nShe is either use-able and straight up becomes OP, and even if she's not she is still an excruciating annoying pick to play against for a myriad of reasons (her Q,W,E are all extremely annoying for her opponent to deal with, so that's like her entire existence itself). Or she has to be balanced to be intentionally underpowered and irrelevant in general, which ofc, is a very clear sign that the champion's design is incredibly off.\n\nHer design is broken to the very core. She will never be remotely balanced, as a matter of fact. The only way to truly balance her is if Riot completely remakes her, given unlike other designs that have warranted reworks where mostly it's about 1 core ability in the kit being broken and fundamentally un-balance-able, her entire kit is that way. \n\nZoe was a mistake. No doubt about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-18T20:35:15.273+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wolfeur,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VQOVWG1z,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-07-18T19:45:21.636+0000)\n>\n> * Zoe: balanced\n> * Caitlyn: balanced (well, as balanced as ADCs can be)\n> * Graves: balanced\n\n\nDo we play the same game?\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"feintfiend","date":"2018-07-18T17:10:28.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Unironically agreed this game can't have a mordekaiser laning against new Akali, make 99% of champions mobile and phase out point and click abilities so skillshots make up 90% of all abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-18T17:56:37.635+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=feintfiend,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VQOVWG1z,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-18T17:10:28.345+0000)\n>\n> Unironically agreed this game can&#x27;t have a mordekaiser laning against new Akali, make 99% of champions mobile and phase out point and click abilities so skillshots make up 90% of all abilities.\n\ntfw current Morde was actually designed by CertainlyT\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[{"poster":"remakoro","date":"2018-07-18T18:02:42.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its funny cuz Kalista was designed by him as well and she could fuck up morde 10 times out of 10 with no chances of retaliation for him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-07-18T17:12:10.553+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I disagree.
