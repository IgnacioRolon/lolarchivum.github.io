Less people know about it - the better. So whole post became kinda muddy.\n\nSo you rather make a short post to farm upvotes than something well thought out, because people don't know how duskblade works and you don't want them to know about it?\nwhat?\nI'm pretty sure everybody knows about the duskblade passive, it's the whole identity of the item.\n\nAlso your post didn't really look like you wanted to \"discuss\" the passive of duskblade.\nThat was just \"Let me complain about duskblade, farm upvotes and downvote everyone who disagrees\" kind of post we definitely already have enough of.\nDon't tell me you actually wanted to open up a discussion with that kind of wording.","replies":[{"poster":"remakoro","date":"2018-07-07T15:09:28.194+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">Don't tell me you actually wanted to open up a discussion with that kind of wording.\n\n I wanted and i actually did.

Before that assassin had choice - to clear ward or ignore it. \nIn first case you lost vision from it but got yourself some time while he was at it. In second case ward would at least stay alive for some time giving you information. \n\nPassive that tells you where enemies have vision without having to waste red trinket is just OP.\n\n>isn't just suggesting to remove something that would fuck over an entire class.\n\nSo having something that fuck ups every other entire class for some of which warding is sacred duty is okay?\nAnd removal of it wont impact actual dmg from from assassin and therefore their ability to be useful in fights. But will give people more counterplay.
