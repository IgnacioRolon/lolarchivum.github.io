I used the skin boost and everyone on my team was able to select a skin and promptly thanked me for it. But on my end the Skin Boost button continually said processing and would not let me select any skins. (I was using Morgana if it helps) After the match it did not show that I received any IP bonus though I do not know whether I actually received it or not. I was wondering, if at all possible, I could receive a refund for this. (Even though I will just spend it again on another skin boost haha) I simply feel cheated on the transaction is all.\r\n\r\nI apologize but I do not know how to recreate the problem. A possible idea could be a connection issue on my end. My internet provider (Wide Open West) has occasional spurts that drop the internet, sometimes nano seconds and sometimes for half an hour. I do not know if one of these small spurts happened at this time but it is just one possible idea.\r\n\r\nA side note when I used the skin boost there was 25 seconds left in the champ selection before the final 10 second countdown.","replies":[{"poster":"DontHassleDaHoff","date":"2015-08-06T18:36:39.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ikilledbamby - can you do me a favor and send me your game log.
