This results in me getting curb stomped in lane without learning much of anything. Its got to the point of me about to quit trying to learn how to lane and be a one trick support .","replies":[{"poster":"bloodybadger1","date":"2017-09-09T09:23:38.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its mostly because most plats and diamonds play norms for fun and play ranked more seriously so they end up having lower match making rating and get placed with you. or it could be that your winrate in norms is high and it is just placing you against better opponents. you shouldnt worry about it though. keep playing and practiciing in norms. otherwise, if you just dont want to keep getting stomped in norms without one tricking support then play ranked flex instead. that queue is generally not that serious until high elo anyways. its basically a joke queue right now unless you have an actual 5 man team and are planning on playing in tourneys or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-09T07:03:26.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals have their own MMR.\n\nAlso, not everyone treats normals the same, alot of people just troll in them to have fun.","replies":[]}]}
