Of course, I&#039;m the kind of person who believes Zamasu did nothing wrong and that Firefly is highly overated, so take with salt I guess. \n\nThis rework, however, is like a billion times more logical than my solution. \n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/8/82/Fusion_Zamasu_Ring_of_Light.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161030063122","replies":[]}
