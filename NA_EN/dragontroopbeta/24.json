There are 4 types of Washed Up Reviewers that cycle in even measures and last for 10 seconds: Spoony, Angry Joe&#039;s, Linkara and Film Brain. Spoony will warn Nostalgia Critic of enemy champions in the fog of war moving in his direction, Angry Joe will disagree entirely with his well-founded opinion and face the opposite direction at all times, blocking all incoming criticism of Man of Steel, as well a single projectile. Linkara will block power Nostalgia Critic&#039;s Bill!, increasing it&#039;s defensive capabilities by 50%. Film Brain will fear any target who is facing Doug that wasn&#039;t the target of Doug&#039;s spell for 0.5 seconds, because he is freaking creepy.\n\nQ - Gun-toting\n\nPassive: Nostalgia Critic fires his gun in a random direction when his movement is impaired, dealing damage to any minion it collides with, or innocent champions who have not been in combat for at least 5 seconds. Hitting a minion will not summon a Shameless Cameo. \nActive: Nostalgia Critic fires his weapon in the target direction 3/4/5/6 times, inconsistent in it&#039;s path. Champions hit by this ability are slowed, and the amount of the slow increases depending on how much health they are missing. \n\nW - Bill! / Bum Rush\n\nNobody can get enough Bill! Nostalgia Critic can introduce Bill! to both Ally and Enemy Champions by casting him onto an area, and he will then wonder the nearby area looking for people to amaze with how he is Bill!, adding a stack of Fabulous. Fabulous&#039; effect changes depending if it is an ally or an enemy who came in contact with Bill! Bill! can be cast on Nostalgia Critic, and doing so will reduce the cooldown by half. If Bill! enters by being cast  on a wall, he remains there for up to 45 seconds, and surprises any enemy who happens to run into him. \n\nRecasting Bill! on a wall will instead  cast spawn a Bum, who will slow enemies who pass by the area by (insert amount here). Clicking on the Bum will spend 25 of the enemies gold in order to get rid of the Bum. \n\nCritic gains armour and mana regeneration while near Bill!\n\nAlly - Bill! inspires the target with every time they meet, permanently increasing their Movement Speed by 1.\nEnemy - Bill! will greet any enemy he comes in contact with, charming them and reducing their vision range substantially. Can&#039;t get enough Bill! For each stack of Fabulous, the range which Bill! will go out of his way to greet them increases.\n\nE - The Sequeling \n If Nostalgia Critic is effected by a spell that has hit him or one of his Shameless Cameos in the last (insert time here), he can immediately leap to that target, granting it a shield if it is an ally and giving it a % damage reduction. If that target happens to be an enemy, Nostalgia Critic will instead place 2 walls behind the target, creating a funnel point, and displacing enemies it collides with. \n\nR - KICKASSIA\nNostalgia Critic summons all of his Shameless Cameos to the target ally, which last for (10/20/30) seconds. If the target dies during this duration, Nostalgia Critic will ~~save their careers~~  respawn a clone of themselves that they may control at any nearby Bill! or Bum that lasts up to 15 seconds.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/UdW9U4SD4sk/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nCritic goes well with:\n- Lux (instantly charges up his passive with her W)\n- Ezreal (W hits him to charge his passive in lane.)\n- Jayce (Walk through his gate thrice.)\n- Caramel","replies":[]}
