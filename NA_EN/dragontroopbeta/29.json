For something so small, they hurt a hell of a lot, and get around really quick, so you&#039;re never safe near the walls. One time I tried to squish one under my foot, and he just crawled out and flew away. On top of that, whether they use their flashy speed or not, they always find a way behind you to sting you in the back of the neck. They grow up quickly, and reproduce very effectively. And some bees are very, very toxic.\n\n- Too Much Damage\n- Too Fast\n- Much Toxic Bee\n\nPlease nerf Bee Stings.","replies":[]}
