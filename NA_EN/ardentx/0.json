Why? I have like 6 hextech keys rn, cuz I never gotten chest before. Is this only bug for me? If it was like that this whole time, I would've gotten about 30+ chests. I also never remember getting S- or above at yasuo AND getting a chest. I never got one, yet it says I did. This is extremely enraging. Riot, if I'm right, fix this fast. I want BE, and I dont want bs happening to my account, for the second time.\r\nI never got the BE from the runes, and my IP at the end of the season.\r\nIf this is the second gigantic problem I'm facing, I want you staffs to manage and solve this problem as soon as you can. \r\nYou guys made this game absolute trash after the preseason update tbh. Complete bs.\r\nThat was why I couldn't get as much blue essence as others... smh","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-07T04:31:42.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to check up on your runes first, since it seems like you might not have understood how that rune refund was meant to work. It looks like the runes you bought didn't qualify for refunds due to when they were purchased (being discounted to 1 IP) or they were bought after the cutoff date. Check out [**this post**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/lEF4iRjk-blue-is-the-newip-click-here-for-faq) for all the details on how those refunds went down.\n\nAs far as the mastery chests you were talking about (the 4 a week), what people are referring to is your ability to get a hextech chest as a reward for playing a champion you *own* and having someone get an S- or higher in your match. You don't automatically get them each week, but you have a chance of earning some chests that way. You can also get capsules from leveling up.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/de90d5fe4a40709df802a664eeef10a6.png","replies":[]}]}
