I f***ing swear, I cannot do ANYTHING about this. I can't verse ranked players, especially Gold-ranked players.\nRiot? At least balance the team out, like\nBlue team: 4 unranked, 1 gold-ranked\nRead team: 4 unranked, 1 gold-ranked.\nThis is simply just a waste of time if you make it this way.\nHow am I supposed to do ANYTHING about this?\nI got no skills (Yes, I'm unranked. Wtf do you expect from me)\nand I'm always the one who is versing the ranked people, not others.\nI'm sick and TIRED of these games with other players yelling at me for \"Bad\" laning (I'm good at laning in unranked level, not a RANKED level. Just letting yall know.).\nTrust me, I win most of the games that is unranked vs unranked, but I always lose the unranked (my team) vs unranked (4 players)+ ranked (especially gold).\nRiot really needs to fix THIS first, before making IP and blue essence to one whole thing.\nJust balance it out, bro. It's nothing hard to do.\nIs it THAT hard to balance things out and program that?\nI don't think so.\nIt can be solved extremely easily by using the \"If\" phrase.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-03T02:55:50.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know it may not feel good to think you're being matched up against players that *might* have a higher rank, but first things first: you're playing normal and not ranked. Someones Ranked tier does not play into normal matches, since you're not playing in the ranked queue. It looks like that match actually only had 1 ranked player in it, which isn't too shabby considering there's a good chance that *HIS* MMR was low enough to match yours. \n\nKeep in mind that rank doesn't play a 100% role in choosing teammates or opponents in normals, but it pays more attention to MMR. Take this as a sign that you might actually be as good as a Gold player already!","replies":[{"poster":"LuvCheese","date":"2017-11-03T03:15:49.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"but he just said he ALWAYS lose against gold players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ardentx","date":"2017-11-04T19:57:28.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, if their win rate is same as me, their win rate is base against gold players, not unranked players.\nThat's what I mean by unfair.","replies":[]}]}]}
