My issue is, when i would play on my main account i would not get any sort of ping spikes or game delays or disconnections. However, since i had recently hit level 30 on my newer account i would go to play a game and within the first 20 minutes i begin to disconnect over and over. It would give me a huge lag of 400-500 ms and either be able to maintain the game play or i would get disconnected. Other times it would just completely stop my character from moving until i reconnected to the match on my own. I cannot seem to find the answer anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-18T19:18:16.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some pretty major connection problems ranging from potential packet loss to a complete disconnect.   The game needs to have a constant connection to the game servers, otherwise you can have issues like that.  Your best bet would be to go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  Hopefully that will smooth things out!","replies":[]}]}
