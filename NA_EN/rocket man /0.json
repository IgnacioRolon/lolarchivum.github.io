{"poster":"rocket man ","date":"2017-09-19T04:57:54.562+0000","title":"Question about shop reset and previous shop.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, as we all know a lot of the 'My shops' open were quite disappointing due to the discount bot messing up according to Riot. I had one skin that I wanted to buy which was striker Lucian for 525 RP, just so I could have every Lucian skin, and in hopes that next shop that I could get a chance to get heartseeker Lucian, the skin that I really want. I just wanted to ask if I contact support in regards to buying the striker Lucian, will my shop still be reset or will it be hard reset and I'll get new skins. Lucian and Trist were the only champions I played a lot of out of all the champions I got in my shop. Also, in the post from Riot regarding the reset, it said limited skins won't be available? I'm pretty sure heartseeker Lucian is limited, so is there no chance that I get that skin in my shop (I saw a few other people got the skin in their shop but I assume that was the bot messing up).\r\n\r\nHoping a rioter or someone more informed than me can answer. Thanks!\r\n\r\n(Posted this on the OCE boards but was told I might get more answers on the NA boards)","replies":[{"poster":"Darkeus","date":"2017-09-19T17:53:39.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah because I had this same issue. My \"Your Shop\" was pretty awesome actually so I am not sure what the issue that got it disabled was. But I had Lunar Wraith Morgana as one of my offers and I was going to by that in a week or so. Now it is gone and probably won't be back so I will be making a ticket soon it seems. \n\nWhat was the actual problem that happened? i seem to not be able to find an answer to that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-19T17:14:48.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get new skins, reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

You should contact [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) ASAP if you want a certain skin from your previous \"My Shop\". As for limited skins, I am unsure, although legacy skins were available during the previous \"My Shop\" a couple months back.","replies":[{"poster":"rocket man ","date":"2017-09-19T11:59:52.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wrote to them hours ago pretty much saying what I said here, awaiting a reply.
