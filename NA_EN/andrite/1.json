No worries, you won't get any penalties if the game crashed and you're free to queue back up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teph","date":"2017-09-04T19:08:08.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this problem too and I received a leaver busters for 20 minutes for 5 games, I have sent a bug ticket to riot and asked them to remove the ban because of the bug.
