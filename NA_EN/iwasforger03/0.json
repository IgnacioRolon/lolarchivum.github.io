In it, no matter what I tried my keyboard shortcuts would not work.  Nor could I successfully register the shortcuts to different keys.  I tried exiting and reconnecting to the game mutiple times, until I was so far behind it was laughable, and still never got them to work.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what happened.  this is not the first time my shortcuts haven't worked, but each time before this, I could fix the problem by exiting the game and reconnecting.  That didn't work this time.  I would really appreciate some help to fix this, if possible, so it doesn't screw me over again.  Please?\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T15:09:07.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to say what's causing this, but it sounds like there could be an issue with your game files not syncing properly to the game server.
