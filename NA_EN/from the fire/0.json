My main account was recently stolen. By recently, I mean it's been four days. At first, I requested a simple password reset. It stated that I would need to wait a good five-or-so minutes, and I would receive an email---never did. I tried again. Still didn't. So I put in a ticket. When I tried logging in again, I couldn't. Someone changed my password. I directly emailed them. Still no response. The email I was using was an AOL account, and I've had some issues in the past with AOL services (emails not going through), so I attempted to make an open-ended ticket with a Gmail account of mine. This time, I got a verification email back almost immediately, and it said my ticket was placed. The main thing I saw on this ticket was that there are an unusual amount of tickets lately, and I would have to wait a while in order for it to be answered. Now, I've submitted tickets before to Riot and other game companies. I've never had to wait two to three days for a response back. And, even if there are that many tickets, shouldn't those with \"Account Stolen\" in the subject get priority? Granted, I only have 20 RP on the account, so not much damage can be done aside from possibly deleting my friends list or disenchanting all of my Hextech Crafting stuff. But it _truly_ bothers me that someone is out there with my account, different password and all, and I'm sitting here waiting for a possible response from Riot whenever they feel like it.\r\n\r\nI know Riot gets a lot of garbage from the community. I don't mean to pile onto that, but it should _not_ take this long to recover an account I've put 1500+ hours into. I even sent an image of an email receipt I got for a RP purchase. Is anyone else waiting an absurdly high amount of time for a ticket response? I need this resolved asap.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T21:49:03.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tickets are typically responded to in a first-come-first-served basis.
