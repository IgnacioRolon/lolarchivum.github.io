I'm helpless, it's been a few days and Riot support has not resolved my situation despite the countless requests that I've sent. I would not be writing here in the forms had your Riot listened to me. After falling for the scam, I received an email detailing a purchase of $150USD of Riot points within my account. I panicked and immediately called PayPal to cancel the unauthorized purchases. I changed all of my passwords for my email and for my League of Legends account as soon as possible. After reporting my situation several times, I did in fact get an email saying that your support was looking into my case. After a of couple hours, I get an email stating the following: \r\n\"Greetings xoblite98, Actions that have been performed on your account are in violation of the League of Legends Terms of Use. Due to the severity of this violation, your League of Legends account has been banned until Mon Feb 22 22:22:22 UTC 2100\r\nRiot Games Player Support\"\r\nI was confused as to why I was called \"xoblite98\" since my League account has always been **Noobasuares**. I tried to log into my account only to get a notification telling me that I was banned permanently. I have no reason to be banned permanently, I have never committed any offenses before and had never had my account boosted. The hacker hadn’t even played any games on my account, so being permanently banned (fourth offense) is completely unjustified. I go straight to Riot support about the problem and sent multiple request to unban my account. I was the victim in this situation, and it is unfair that my own account got banned due to someone else hacking into it. I'm disappointed that Riot would jump to conclusions without good reason and not listen to my situation. After sending multiple requests, I checked non-stop to see whether or not support commented a solution to my situation. To my surprise, I saw that my ticket was \"solved\" but when I check within the ticket, there was not a single response. It has been 2 days, and I have not received any messages about the reason for the ban, how to get unbanned, and I still do not have access to my account. I have put time, effort, and money into my account and frankly, by banning me Riot taking away the money I’ve spent on this game. I would appreciate if I could get some help sorting all of this out. Thank you. \r\n(I’ve linked screenshots to use as evidence and to prove my authenticity below)\r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/540ed55c220d747198637a268bd6fbbe\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/0503d8015f5352bfde0fa53d8444a8c3 \r\nhttps://gyazo.com/43319e003602e271c8b2843a36756b12\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/e96120fb76b11e181d3f6631846ca9ae\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/04c0e4866d2aebbadcc512caa27aa1df\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/a60bc60dfa494121fa53e735347cd2c6","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T00:37:39.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We cannot address account suspensions or recoveries on the boards.
