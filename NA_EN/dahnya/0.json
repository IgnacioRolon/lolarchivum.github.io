HELP","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am using a MAC book pro OS X 10.9.5. Okay so a month ago i downloaded LoL on this MAC with absolutely no problem(patch 6.18/19). Jumped right into ranked after download finished. so last week i deleted LoL off my applications and the next day i tried to re download it off the website. Thats when it started crashing/freezing, I tried a lot of things over the past 4 days and noting just same problem over 4 days. It just says \"step 2/2 updating league(like 4gb with 4500mbs/s) but when the 4gbs are done, it just says applying patches with no information of how much gbs are left and how fast its downloading. Just \"applying patches\" It goes up but always just stops at a different number every single time i try to install. Once it stopped at 99% for like 3 hours until i just restarted.\r\nI just want to know how I can play LoL TODAY because its my only day off and my wife isnt home! I also want to know why this is happening if just last week i was playing lol on the same network and computer.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T21:23:10.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The patcher needs to connect to our patching server to download files and update it to your PC, but is being blocked.  Go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot your network and restore access to the patching server.  Make sure to select Mac for instructions specific to your OS.  Also, unless you receive an error it's important to let the patcher continue its work.  Closing it prematurely can cause it to scan all of your game files for corruption before proceeding with the update.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"ebrithil779","date":"2016-12-21T02:40:02.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem here.
