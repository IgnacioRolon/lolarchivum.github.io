This will then allow Riot to adjust the specific stats of those 5 or so champions that abuse it individually, and allow for more specific tuning on any other champions in the future. Now, it *is* true that equating spellvamp to AP ratios is a bad analogy, but there is a reason it was used, and I think I might be able to explain this. Lifesteal only applies to auto-attacks, which are most AD champions' primary damage output. Mages' primary output comes from their AP ratios. The thing is, AD doesn't have different auto-attack ratios depending on the champion, all AD is given equally to the champions that build it, and therefore, lifesteal ratios can be balanced based on items. However, since mages have different AP scalings, spellvamp is a little harder. It can't really be balanced purely on items, because each champion receives a different benefit from it. That is why _Holy Malevolence_ is suggesting that the fix be applied on the champions' end instead of the items.\n\nWhether or not this should be done is not something I will assert. I think it would  be cool, but I am not sure how much it would help. It could even allow for mages to be given better spellvamp ratios down the line, especially on AoEs etc. But I can't really say if the benefit would be worth the effort, that isn't my call.\n\nI literally just restated everything _Holy Malevolence_ already said, in my own words.

The issue is with those few champions whose kits synergize with spellvamp on a whole different level from everyone else.

This was brought up in the board about Vlad's \"mid year mage update\" - the fact that Vlad's existence essentially forced Riot to nerf spellvamp to the point that it is relatively useless on anyone but Vlad, Cassiopeia, and Akali. Riot Stashu said that they planned to change Vlad so he can't abuse spellvamp as much (which might let them buff spellvamp again), but that's really just a \"band-aid solution\". \n\nThis suggestion provides an easy way to keep spellvamp viable for ALL champions and bring the \"abusive\" champions down to healthy levels. With the example of rageblade, Riot could nerf the 4-5 \"abusive\" champions so they are no longer oppressive, but then those champions would likely be useless without rageblade - forcing them to build it if they wanted to be viable and impactful. On the other hand, they could nerf rageblade, but that would probably end up making the item itself useless (similar to what happened with spellvamp).\n\nAdding in a \"spellvamp ratio\", as suggested by the OP, means spellvamp will affect every champion differently. It would be like adding a \"rageblade effectiveness\" stat (just as an example) to each champion. Rather than nerfing the champions' power, having to wait for a major update to change abilities, or nerfing the stat across the board, spellvamp's effectiveness could be tailored to each champion. \n\n\"Is spellvamp more effective on this champion than is healthy? Or does it not fit thematically on them? Ok, we'll lower it's effectiveness for that champion's abilities!\" Or \"Does this champion need help with their survivability? But we don't want them to be more tanky? Well, we could improve their spellvamp ratios so they can survive longer under certain conditions!\"\n\nBam! Easy way to regulate spellvamp while still keeping it viable for most champions. Although, having a separate ratio for every ability might be a bit much - but at least having an individual ratio for each champion would make a huge difference and add another \"lever\" (as Riot likes to say) to help balance the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Holy Malevolence","date":"2016-03-19T16:46:15.057+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"\n\nExcept with ranged AD's, it's a static lifesteal stat for a static damage stat.\nAutoattacks are all, essentially, the exact same thing.

It would be extremely unhealthy because of AOE, DoT, and short CD abilities. If abilities had spellvamp ratios, then more items could be given spellvamp to distinguish them from the others because there wouldn't be the risk of Vlad building up to 100% spellvamp and becoming an immortal demon...\n\nFor instance, Zhonya's is the \"defense AP item\" (lots of AP, some armor, and it's passive). It could include some spellvamp as well so that it feels a little better as a defensive purchase (to give it more \"presence\" while the passive is on cooldown - like how Luden's Echo has bonus movespeed). It would open up many more options for items that just can't happen now.\n\nAre there ANY other stats that are only given by 2 items? I think that in itself shows that something needs to change with spellvamp. It would be like having lifesteal or critical strike chance only be given by 2 items. Or - this might be more similar to spellvamp - have 2 items that provide Energy or Energy/5 - basically useless stats except for the 4 (?) champions who use them. \n\nHmmm...

Of course, adding extra items as well is even more work, and needs further balancing on top of just making the concept work... and if you do all that and finally reach a state where everything is balanced? You've successfully changed some portion of mages to be sustain mages because they synergize well enough with spell vamp for it to be in their optimal build.\n\nAlternatively, removing spell vamp means Vladimir's damage and healing can be adjusted independently , Morgana would get a real passive, and assassin Akali could be allowed to build something other than Gunblade as her first item. I don't know if that's necessarily an improvement over what we have right now, but it seems like a better result to me than what you're proposing, and requires a lot less work.","replies":[{"poster":"Holy Malevolence","date":"2016-03-20T16:39:42.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except they already have code in place that alters the amount of spellvamp a champion can get.\nFar as I can tell, worst case scenario is that they have to modify two files with additional inputs.\nThose files being \"Single target\" and \"AOE\". Mind you I don't know what the code currently looks like, but that's the most difficult reasonable situation I could forsee.\nSaid additional input would change the spellvamp values for an ability from the standard 1.0/.33 associated with single target/AOE abilities to..... Y'know....\nWhatever spellvamp ratio they so desire.\nThat's if they didn't build the specific returns into individual abilities already. In which case the change would literally be effortless.\nAnd, ignoring what's reasonable and not, worst case scenario with the most ridiculous spaghetti code? Make overarching champion spellvamp ratios. Takes a tiny amount of effort and directly modifies the amount of spellvamp a champion gets from an item. Maximum amount of effort necessary?\nMinimum.\nThis, realistically, should not be even slightly hard considering they already have the infrastructure in place.\n\nBasically, yeah.\nOnce in place, at worst, they don't change anything.\nBut if they ever decide to actually do anything with spellvamp?\nAdd a new item?\nRebalance a champion to make more use of the stat?\nThey'd be able to do so without risking game health. Because if they tried to make spellvamp relevant and Vladimir got out of line-\nSomething that's happened ***multiple times***-\nThey'd be able to nerf his spellvamp ratios and make it work instead of scrapping the project because Vladimir breaks it.\n\nAdding spellvamp ratios would, in fact, allow you to deal with spellvamp items without risking game health. But, realistically, no. It's not the sources, it's plainly the champions. If it was the sources, Riot would've been able to make it work by now.\nThey haven't. Because if you make a spellvamp item, it's going to benefit Vladimir much more than anyone else. This isn't just me making a baseless claim. It's happened multiple times before.\nThe reason why spellvamp is in the state it's in? Where you generally get it on Vlad and Akali, occasionally on a third champion like Cass, and would definitely never get it on anyone else?\nIt's because the champions who can use it do so so much better than the entire rest of the cast and there's literally no way to make an item to do anything about it.\nThe only thing you could **possibly** do is modify the champions.\n\nAnd all the while, you'd be deleting a stat that has massive potential for improving the game because, quite frankly, you're simply too lazy to try and utilize an easy and neigh guaranteed to work solution. Yeah, it'd be easier to just scrap it.\nWhy not do that with everything? Kid's a bit of a problem, throw him out. Dishes are dirty? Why bother cleaning them, it's easier to throw them out. That's really a way to make the world better, eh?\nJust assume something's too hard without even trying and, instead of fixing things, throw them out.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2016-03-21T06:20:33.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, it's always two things.
