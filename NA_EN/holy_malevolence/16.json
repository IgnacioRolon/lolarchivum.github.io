That´s how math works.\n\nthe only reason Crit is still in the game is that a lot of people don´t understand how probability does actually work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-09-27T15:26:02.501+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's funny that Riot considers Anivia and Karthus able to do crits. There's nothing random about those crits, they can't be boosted by crit damage modifiers, but they're still effected by crit reduction modifiers (really Riot, that's low). Something more like these crits could be another alternative to the current system.\n\nHonestly, the only reason Riot has given for why crits should stay that holds any water is \"crits are fun to get!\" Yes, but they're terrible to have used against you. We've all been at the point late game where an ADC is killing people in two or three crit empowered auto attacks that happen in barely over a second. Much counterplay, so fun, wow. Glad they have a resource that prevents them from doing that again instantly to the rest of my team... Oh yeah, they don't. Just stun them? My stun was on the way to them when I died, you know travel times.","replies":[]}]}
