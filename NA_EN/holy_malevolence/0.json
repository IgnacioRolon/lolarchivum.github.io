Single target burst champions become overpowered, and AOE champions for the most part struggle to do anything in comparison. In order to keep the single target burst champions from ruining the game as a whole, AP would need to be kept weak to a point where every AP champion who wasn't primarily a single target oriented caster was neigh useless.\r\n\r\nThis is circumvented by giving abilities AP ratios.\r\nWith AP ratios, you can give transfusion a .6 AP ratio, bouncing bomb a .65, mark of the assassin .9, crescent strike a .7, and if any AP champion is too good with AP, you can nerf their AP ratios.\r\n\r\nYou should very easily be capable of doing the same with spellvamp.\r\nGive every ability a spellvamp ratio, and get rid of the notion of AOE abilities simply getting one third the amount of spellvamp. Then, release new, good spellvamp items. And if a champion like Vladimir or Akali or Udyr or what have you uses it too well, nerf that champion's spellvamp ratios.\r\nYes I mentioned Udyr.\r\nYes this would allow AD spellvamp items.\r\n\r\nThis is a basic change, and it's long since overdue.","replies":[{"poster":"Funster","date":"2014-07-17T16:45:38.302+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is NOT a basic change! This would require hand tweaking of over 400 abilities (add another 100 for passives). That's a pretty serious undertaking. Even if the workload were a non-factor, I believe this would go against some of the principals of League of Legends due to just having another form of bookkeeping by needing to know every individual skill's ratio for an item that may or may not be purchased.\n\nI don't have any better ideas though. I think Spellvamp can be really good, but no one is willing to drop 2500 on {{item:3152}}  as there is really no room for it when you are basically required to use some combination of  {{item:3174}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Holy Malevolence","date":"2014-07-17T17:02:13.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Eventually it'd require modification of a good number of abilities.\nBut is that any different from AP?\nTo start, literally no balance change would be required. Set every AOE ability to .33, and every single target to 1.0. Now you've got spellvamp ratios, and doing so is very simple.\n\nThe change itself is basic. Balancing thereafter's somewhat more complex, but better to be capable of balancing something than naught.","replies":[{"poster":"Kyant123108","date":"2014-07-17T19:48:33.984+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats still a major change code-wise. Any change that affects all aspects of a program (such as modifying every champion) is a big change and depending on their code structure it may not even be possible to do this. Ability ratios are built into a champion's kit while spell vamp is gained from an item and applies the spell vamp to a champion - any champion. From a champion perspective, AP ratios are internal - something that is intrinsic to the champion. Spellvamp is external and foreign, which will possibly cause issues during implementation. It would not be as easy as copy/paste the code into every champion because they all likely have very specialized code to account for all their unique abilities. I am a software developer so I can attest that its not as easy as you might think to modify programs on such a large scale. Thats why software developers are paid so much.\n\nAlso, lots of AP champs don't build spellvamp simply because they don't need it if they can burst you down in one combo, so they go for the single combo. Akali and Vlad have their pool and shroud to hide in, making the sustain mesh well with their kits, but for akali I don't think the spellvamp is the reason she gets the gunblade.\n\ntldr; Its easy in theory, but its hard in reality. I don't think spellvamp needs a buff - AP champs have  long range to compensate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-07-17T19:06:50.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea, and i'd upvote if i could(damn bug...)\n\nHowever, it's a massive work cause u would need to rebalance ~400 skills and some new items, so it would be suited as big change for a new season i guess\n\nI also feel like we need a cap for lifesteal on aoe, atleast vs minions(like rene Q got, or deminishing returns on each target beyond the first), otherwise clearing a wave would grant evt to much health while dueling a champ would still be unrewarding(spellvamp wise)\n","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-07-18T01:43:00.358+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"We pushed a fix and you should be able to vote now.

She tries to line you up with the minion wave so she can get a large amount of sustain from hitting you and all those creeps with her ult, which usually turns things in her favor.  Now imagine... Syndra doing that to you, or Ziggs, or Orianna, fighting you at or near a minion wave and destroying your dueling potential because they can suck up a few hundred health on demand from any local creep wave or camp.\n\n\n\nI think that could be fixed by making single target spells heal instantly, and AoE spells heal over time.  The healing could be 100% instead of reduced, but absorbed over X seconds so it doesn't become a giant spike of health all at once.\n\nVisually, it could be represented by a weaker version the green swishies that come from monster sigils lingering on the character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2014-07-18T01:36:46.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could do some massive reworks OR you could just add some decent spell vamp items that actually are decent late game (beyond JUST giving spell vamp) and have balanced amounts of scaling (idk what that would be balance team you figure it out).","replies":[{"poster":"Holy Malevolence","date":"2014-07-18T02:09:13.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"But you can't add decent spellvamp items while Vlad's in the game in his current state.\nIf the item was good on anyone other than Vladimir, it would be overpowered on Vladimir.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2014-07-18T03:00:41.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a good point.

Single target burst champions become overpowered, and AOE champions for the most part struggle to do anything in comparison.\n\nArea Effect skills should predominantly be used for their Area of Effect. Which can hit multiple targets in an area - and with minions and team-fights, you're doing something wrong if you're just hitting one guy with a wide chunk of AoE skills.\nThe AoE reduction on spell vamp isn't there to shaft AoE champions - it's there to prevent it from being fundamentally broken on AoE. Spell Vamp is reliant on the damage a champion deals, which means targets with no MR (minions) are naturally going to see greater vamp returns. If you harass with an AoE skill that manages to hit an enemy champion and 2 minions, you're much better off than a champ that used a single-target skill against an opposing champion.\n\nAnd single-target isn't what defines who uses spell vamp. Vladimir and Mordekaiser are very much AoE champions.\n\nThe major treand I've noticed is Mana. \n\nEvery champion that feels good about grabbing spell vamp has no mana. Or rather, they don't need to spend mana to benefit from it (in the case of Nunu and Jax). Vladimir, Mordekaiser, Kennen, Akali, Rumble, Jax, Nunu, Katarina.\n\nSpell Vamp kills your mana sustain in exchange for health sustain for the majority of the early game. And going OoM is seriously bad if a champion is so reliant on abilities they went for spell vamp over life steal.\n\n> This is a basic change, and it's long since overdue.\n\nThat's not a basic change.\n\nBut it's not a terrible suggestion.\n\nI'd go something more universal with it though, like *on-hit effectiveness*. Which is an ability field I've been playing with in my own game creations.\n\nSpell Vamp isn't that useful in general on a wide range of ability-heavy champions just due to their play style, so making a universal change just for a stat that is fairly lackluster isn't an economical use of time and resources.\n\nHowever, on-hit effects have the potential to give something useful for everyone, and the current 33% reduction on AoE doesn't do a solid job at addressing the incredible veriaty in abilities.\n\nSome things like Akali's Crescent Slash currently just do not synergize well with spell-hit effects, where others like Singed's Poison Trail abuse them so heavily they largely force the most minor spell-hit effects from being created.\n\nAn on-hit effectiveness field would allow things like S3's Blackfire Torch to exist in a manner where they don't bump champions like Singed, Amumu, and Teemo to the top of the tier list while feeling lackluster on many of the burst-casters the item seemed to be geared towards helping, and such a field could allow champions that abuse spell-hit effects to be nerffed directly, rather than forcing nerfs on items that make only a handful of casters capable of even using the item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"March of Dimes","date":"2014-07-18T04:22:32.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think yours would be a very difficult change and I think that, if your problems are 1 or 2 champs, that you'd do better to fix those champs rather than change how a stat works on *everyone else in the game*.  I also don't think burst healing is going to be a problem, as most of the champs who burst are either on full health when they do it or don't care if they heal because they already made their contribution.  If anything, I imagine reset assassins would become problematic, as they'd be the exception to those cases.  \n\nI would like to see spell vamp in a better place so manaless champs could actually exercise an itemization advantage for being manaless.  It's only fair because their kits are already weakened for that fact (consider how manaless kit CC compares to CC on mana kits, how poke is weaker/blockable, how the other resource systems limit those casters lategame).  I support a fix to spell vamp, I just don't think you need to create all new ratios to do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Holy Malevolence","date":"2014-07-18T11:05:21.437+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It will always appear to be one or two champions, until it gets fixed.\nRight now, Vlad would abuse it.

I also think it *should* be better on manaless champs than on the others, because manaless AP itemization is pretty weak compared to mana itemization.  Want a lot of AP & health?  You're stuck on Rylai's while mana casters can go RoA or Seraph's.  Want CDR & AP?  WotA's not good atm, spooky ghosts/banner/Nashor's are all gimmicky on most champs, DFG is the only generally solid choice & it's much better on single-target mages than AOE.  Spell vamp *used to be* the stat that made up for this (and mana itemization used to be weaker), but now there seems very few advantages to being manaless.\n\nAlso, I really don't believe those champions would be problems.  Akali's problem was her passive & its interation with the giant ball of stats that was gunblade.  It's the problem of making hybrid itemization worthwhile on non-hybrid champs meaning that item is too good on the hybrid champs it's intended for, not a problem of spell vamp.  Vlad was able to stack revolvers, that's no longer the case.  None of the rest have ever been problems *because of their spell vamp*, and I really don't see anyone past Vlad/Akali being a problem (maybe reset assassins or Ryze/Cassie, but I'd prefer to wait and see rather than roll out an entire new set of ratios that Riot'll have to later balance).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-07-17T18:36:12.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe there could be one spellvamp item that takes a cue from Ahri's passive and be a fixed heal amount (either per cast or per foe hit).","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoloDragoon","date":"2014-07-17T17:59:48.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Spell vamp as a whole has always seemed dull.
