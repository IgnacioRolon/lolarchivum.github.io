Typical queue and people except for one person. He was mad about something that had previously happened to him but he did not allow us to know what it was or how we could help. These events i will tell you of all happened in one draft mode champ select. He, as i said before, was mad about something. He came into champ select and the first words he typed were, and I quote,\"I&#039;m just gonna feed on purpose this game.\" Now this was followed by, \"I am done with you kids.\" Me and the other people on my team asked him what was wrong and if we could help and he waited till it was his pick and said, \"I can&#039;t top gg.\" i was trying to help so i asked if he could mid. He said no, and i then asked what he could do. He replied by saying, \"AFK and feed,\" my team was trying to make the most of this and asked him to afk. I then asked why he was acting the way he was. Him having previously called us kids i was wondering if he was acting dumb or if he was younger and poutier than we were.\n\n       I am bronze III, I am not proud of it and i plan to try and change it. This does happen more often than it should in this ELO. I feel there should be a way to vote out of a game if the vote is 3 to 2 to leave and find another game. This would be a one team decision as only one team would have the problem, hopefully. I had to leave and lose LP in order to stop this game from happening so my team would not lose LP. If there was a system in place to exit a game and find another less people would get mad at draft mode, more people would be happy about the fact they can stop people from coming to there game and feeding or afk&#039;ing after first blood. Over all i think a system of this sort should be put in place and riot don&#039;t even try to take this and make it so both teams have to agree because you know that if one team calls for it the other team sure as I am bad is gonna say no so they can get a free win. Now that i have stated what I have to say I hope riot does see this and make the decision to add it in to there game asap.\n          If riot does see this, and chooses to not implement for some reason, i would like them to post a statement here that is from someone more important than a moderator or a support staff of their site as to why they will not add it and what it is that would cause this to be a bad idea. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                           Sincerely,\n                                                                                                                                                                                           KnightSlayer27","replies":[{"poster":"Fried Noob","date":"2015-05-05T03:16:11.901+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've said it before and I'll say it again, if you give people a free out in champ select, champ select becomes horrible for everyone.

I would worry that the system would be used to dodge champs you don't like if it didn't restrict it to before champ select (ie sej not banned and the other team picks her, let's vote out), and if it was restricted to only available during bans but then gone once picks start, then trolls would just start raging after bans when first pick locks.\n\nAlso it could be used to enforce meta (and you can't tell me that Naut support or something weird like that wasn't at least viable before it was played in LCS) and just vote out of any game someone on your team picked a champ you didn't think was strong because they main it and practice it a lot and are better on an off meta champ than something more standard.\n\n(Also unless you're in diamond clamping, or your promos, the little LP loss for dodge isn't that big.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Matthias9119","date":"2015-05-05T03:46:46.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, any such \"vote dodge\" would be widely abused for competitive reasons.

I think what Riot's trying to do instead, is either remove or reform as much of the toxic behavior that makes people want this sort of \"vote dodge\" feature in the first place. Now, we're waiting for the Tribunal to reopen (Soon™), but it's entirely possible the improvement from that will be noticeable. If that is indeed the solution Riot is going towards, a vote dodge feature is something they'd only do once they've admitted defeat trying to remove/reform toxic behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticRaven1","date":"2015-05-05T20:20:02.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything gets abused and this is one thing that would help more than be abused","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-05-05T01:05:51.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Paragraphs are your friends, and you're not allowed to report other players on the boards.

It happens due to the game screwing them over too much in too short a time.\n\nI've had extremely bad losing streaks that weren't even my fault, and believe me I have gone into games extremely angry and ready to give up before the match even starts. You just get defeated and don't care anymore... but you can't stop playing either... so what happens instead is you go into games expecting your team to suck, and so you just figure \"might as well just troll instead\"\n\nBecause sometimes this game is so frustrating to play that I think I'd rather be trolling it than actually trying to win in ranked. At least I'd get some fun out of a match that way. I get no fun out of being grouped with 4 people who have 50 IQ combined and all have huge egos and refuse to work together or listen to anyone.
