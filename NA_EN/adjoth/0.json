Just play the game.\n\n You want to practice in normals and others want to play them in ranked. Nobody is going to be happy so RIOT has done the right thing by allowing people to whine and bitch and cry and sulk and w/e the hell entitled players want when they come to these boards and rehash this same stupid ass argument over and over and over and over. Get a life, play the game and in a few weeks it won't matter anyway. \n\nBasically,  get over yourself and deal with it because that is exactly what you will do in the end.","replies":[]}]}
