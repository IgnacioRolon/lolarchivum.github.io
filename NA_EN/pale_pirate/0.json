They are both highly upvoted and  I believe they deserve to be addressed.  I have about 6 friends  I played league with for 2-3 years that have quit since 5.16 and their decisions to leave have varied from the introduction of keystones, the non-stop class updates, and the introduction of well intentioned but misguided items like devourer and old rageblade.  I know the loss of 6 players doesn't mean much to Riot, but it means a lot to the individuals whose friends no longer think this is a game worthy of their time.  \n  \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Tm3LWPlF-a-statement-to-riot-games\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Eu7nbuRR-remember-when-we-had-a-mastery-tree-that-allowed-us-to-make-decisions\n\nOne of the best moves you've made for game health in the past two years is the removal of devourer and gutting the rageblade changes (tank yi anyone?).  I think the new keystones fall in this category of \"the game would be better without them\".  The above posts have a great discussion on why a chunk of the community feels this way.  At the end of the day game health should trump \"oh this would be cool to have\" and the new masteries continue to mess with the balance of this game and add to damage creep.  The speed of changes in the game make it so there are a couple months out of every year where the game feels like its in balance and the rest of the time you're trying to ban or dodge the really annoying crap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2017-01-19T03:55:31.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm wondering if you can go more in depth with support changes (maybe in a separate thread). I know there's a lot of conversation going around about how we did AP scaling utility in season 3, which supports now don't really get to participate in with the current meta items. \n\nIt would be nice to see these changes reverted, or at least re-evaluated, in my opinion. By doing that, we may end up making the support role a lot more popular. This topic does a pretty good job about bringing up some of the main issues. \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/inKdEdne-ap-utility-scaling-on-supports-has-become-almost-pointless","replies":[]},{"poster":"HongChongDong","date":"2017-01-18T22:46:51.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2zANtsH6,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-18T22:28:04.089+0000)\n>\n> Thank you!\n> \n> Link to the blog for anyone interested that hasn&#x27;t seen it below.
