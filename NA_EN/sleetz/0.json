This basically has to be solved between Rito and banned players - the fellow players on those boards not only don't have any power - we can just as well be deceived (I mean, it isn't exactly hard to say that you did nothing wrong).\n\nRegardless, if this is in fact wrongful ban then I hope you will get unbanned soon.","replies":[{"poster":"im really sorry","date":"2015-09-30T19:47:29.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey I am glad that I see someone explaining what's going on with my account.\n\nI have questions.

Because he may \nwin or lose, and won't be able to promote quickly. Actually if some boosters fail on boosting, it is not called \nMMR boosting because it fails.\n\nAnd in my case, in this May, my friend played on my account and used third party programs.

Did you try to make new lines manually?\n\nAnd I get what you're saying, but you should try talking to Riot about their policy on such things, as users can't really help you, especially since you were more or less rightfully banned (even if you didn't realize this at the time).\n\nI would really take some time and sent a ticket to Riot, but I doubt they will change their mind now (they may however give you insight on what's okay and what's punishable for future reference).\n\nAnd on another note - I disagree with your stance about ranked games. Even if your skill level is close, or the \"booster\" couldn't win games it still hurts the competitive nature of League (just because you weren't the one that played that ranked game) - this shouldn't be a problem if it's literally one or two games, but if it happens more often it should be punished.\n\nThat said... I do believe that the punishment should be scaled to the level of the offense. For example, someone that got only a few games played by another players (especially if he didn't move in the ladder) should be just rolled back, get ranked restriction for a couple of games and a warning, rather than removing past and current rewards along with a ban.\n\nHowever, I presume that Riot's detection of those things is not accurate enough to create a system like that - which is a pity.","replies":[{"poster":"im really sorry","date":"2015-10-02T04:27:14.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL Thank you.\n\nYour words helped a lot, Thank you again.\n\nI think the tribunal could be better if they ban boostees immediately, not wait for several months.\n\nRiot says that they don't ban boosting accounts unless they are 100% sure that the account is offensive.\nTbh, I have seen many complaining they got banned wrongfully and in fact they all boosted. Some of them\nis just lying while others misunderstood something (like me I never knew they would ban accounts that offended \nlong time before)\n\nI'm going to delete my discussion.  I never meant to lie. My case is a little different. It's just like a friend says they will ranks on your account and you just let he go. It's quite normal, I mean I've seen many of my friends doing this.\n\nOK no more blame shifting. So far riot's detection is accurate. They might need to work on their punishing system.\n\n(I really think the 2-week ban is too long. If someone gets banned, the punishment that stops him from doing it again is \"permanent ban if you dare do it again\" not \"a 2--week ban\". I would say the effect will be the same if they change the duration of ban to a day rather than 2 weeks.)\n\nNever mind riot will never listen.
