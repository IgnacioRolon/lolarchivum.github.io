I'm going to be fair, here. I can see why he's not getting a first strike border, that's perfectly fine. But at the very least, I'd think he deserves an icon since those are completely seperate from anything to do with first strike stuff, and as the 1st and oldest project skin, I think he deserves atleast a little love with the release of his PROJECT comrades so he's not entirely excluded.\n\nThat's atleast my thoughts on the matter.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VasilisGreen","date":"2015-09-08T14:25:12.559+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"and i instabought it when it came out!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Sleetz","date":"2015-09-08T14:26:25.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Same here!
