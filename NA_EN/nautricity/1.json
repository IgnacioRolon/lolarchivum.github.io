To argue against/for a certain type of video game character based on human history is pretty freakin' dumb, not to mention fallacious as all heck. Men have had just as raw of a deal as women in general, if not worse. Women, regardless of social standing, have always been considered a protected class whereas men are an expendable class. \"Women and children first\" sums it up nicely. This status as a protected class, however, comes at the expense of freedom. It is like in Islamic countries today; believe it or not, women are pretty privileged in their everyday life. Muslim women do not work because they aren't allowed to, it is because they don't have to - the husband is supposed to provide for the family and even give her an allowance to spend on herself. \n\nThat is the kind of deal women, apparently, have been willing to strike with men through-out history, simple as that: trading freedom for privileges and security. This is not oppression, far from it.\n\nAlso, sexuality *is* power. Braum looks powerful *because* he oozes male sexuality out of every pore of his body. Similarly, Nidalee projects an aura of power because she oozes female sexuality. If you look at \"lewd\" fan art of Nidalee it is almost exclusively **femdom **in nature, lol.\n\nY'know, being an alpha male/female? The very definition of projecting your power onto others.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndGamer11","date":"2016-04-08T13:21:27.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most likely so that they can send the same files to everybody.
