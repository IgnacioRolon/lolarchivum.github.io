A day or so of block would make them think twice before making false accusations about one's behaviour in a match.\r\nAnother thing, the credibility of these reports should only need ONE report.\r\nI have had tons of people reported with valid reasons, and I never expect an answer, because it never happens.\r\nI was reported myself for bad behaviour once, and since there were more than 2 people doing it, I got my punishment, that is fine, no biggy.\r\nSo I was told that for a punishment to actually occur, more than one person need to report a person. This really should be changed.\r\nFor my third point, could we have a two-week ban on people who can finish a game and decide not to?\r\nI see what many people might say, because there's two sides of the coin:\r\n-Con: He is a member of the team, and he represents it, by throwing the game and making us lose in the end.\r\n-Pros: We have spent a considerable amount of time and effort in our game, just to see it being childishly thrown off by someone who deserves more than a two-week ban.\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T22:31:42.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time a single report may not be enough to have someone's account flagged. When it's said that a single report doesn't hold much weight, essentially it means that we won't take immediate action just because of a single report. If we receive multiple reports of the same actions, then that will give us a heads up that we might need to investigate what's been going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Vashtrel","date":"2017-08-01T13:58:40.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in a way, a person could be as bad as he wanted, and get away with it because he would only have one report?\nAlso, I have a serious question: Why do the forums exist? From what I know, Riot doesn't listen to whatever players have to say in Forums.\nI mean, I have seen the forums as a tool for learning, but besides that? Rants and whatnot. I also think Riot could use some ideas and suggestions, but im sure the reason they won't is being sued ?? like, for skin ideas since someone else made them. Although it wouldn't make sense, since they would be bound to accept it because they posted it here on free will.","replies":[]}]}]}
