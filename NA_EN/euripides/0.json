Whenever I even watch a replay for a maximum of 60 seconds, my computer freezes, and I am forced to restart my computer. When I try to record, the FPS is smooth for ~5 seconds, then it starts hitting 5 FPS, then freezing. Is anyone aware of any solution to this? I can give my computer specs if need be.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T00:42:30.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running Windows 10?
