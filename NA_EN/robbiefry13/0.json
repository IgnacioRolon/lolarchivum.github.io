Then boom vialble champ for mid and Support.\r\n\r\nInstead I fear they are going to rip away his abilities that make him so effective in team fights and focus on solo laning. in effect just another AP mage. . . That has a meaningless tank tag on it","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-02-28T20:10:35.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Galio has a garbage kit at the moment. It's so chaotic and has no theme whatsoever - he needs a complete overhaul. In fact, nothing about his kit is that memorable outside of his ultimate, and like Urgot, he's got a lot of conflicting aspects of his kit (He does melee, yet he has ranged spells, yet his ult is close range, what?). Anything they do to make him modern and give him a cohesive, functional kit will be better than what he has now.","replies":[{"poster":"RobbieFry13","date":"2017-03-01T03:41:26.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His \"Kit\" is pretty cohesive if you actually are interested I can explain it to you (TBH I'm pretty sure you aren't so I'm not gonna bother).

If they adjusted only those things left the rest the same I would be ecstatic!!\n\nThe only thing mildly cohesive about his kit is his defense boost, as it complements his passive and his ultimate. Otherwise, his kit is a mess. For starters, he's building AP and MR, and his mana and spell are so awkward that he's just horribly executed. If he's supposed to be a tank, he doesn't offer anything that an actual tank might use to have an edge - things such as consistent CC or inherent shielding. His burst is bad, he can't actually CC or disrupt outside of his ult, so he's not a tank at all, just a worse version of Vlad or Swain without all the benefits that make them work.\nIn order for a kit to be functional and cohesive, all of the parts have to work together. Take Lissandra for example. Her Q is her poke on low mana and CD and a slow. She uses E to get into the fight, then uses W to keep people still, then R on herself of her enemies to stun and burst. This is a cohesive kit, because all the parts flow together for a singular purpose. Even Yasuo has a cohesive kit. Galio just doesn't. He's a relic from an age long, long gone, and he's too general and not focused enough to be successful. Some people can make it work, yes, but that's learning how to deal with a flawed kit, and doesn't actually speak to the cohesiveness of the kit.","replies":[{"poster":"RobbieFry13","date":"2017-03-02T05:20:40.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah but you see it is actually the opposite of what you think, Galio is too Focused, so his success is limited to a specific group of champs that his Cohesive kit can destroy even with its antiquated drawbacks.\n(I'm not writing a build for MOBA Fire so I am not going to get into Item specifics)\nIn lane vs {{champion:84}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:50}} Use your Q to poke, and when your opponent is less than half health hit them 1 more time, then E while they are slow Close the Gap, Auto then W on your self (This will get you through any abilities or disables they might try, If they are cocky (and they usually are bc most people think of Galio the way that you do) they will usually stay bc they think you over played, Either way they are screwed when you fire your ult (if you are lucky they didn't try to peel so you can save your {{summoner:4}} and since Galio is so bad at clearing farm there are usually a few minions running up the damage that you will fire back.  Usually after the second time the JG will start Camping you so you can fall back to the turret and wait for them to dive and give you a DK or they will get pissed you wont die and start to Troll the other lanes.\nIn team fights you should know a that Galio is a tank and like all tanks you have to build to make it most effective.  When people build him {{item:3041}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3135}} it's not going to work, and yes this is also when his passive is less beneficial, however, his E and W shine.  It is awesome to initiate a Team fight with your W take a shit load of Damage peel and Cast Bulwark on a teammate who is jumping in behind you, they take Damage and you heal, then you dive back in & fire your ult.\nSo basically if you are willing to accept that Galio is a counter for AP Melee/AP DoT champs in lane and a Secondary Support tank in Team phase his Kit totally works and would work even better if they updated a few minor things.  Instead it sounds like they are just going to make him a generic AP Champ that is Tanky  and then instead of at least having a niche where he is successful he will either be Gimmicky and interest will fade quickly (cough*{{champion:83}} *), or become the Poster Gargoyle for the one Trick players that never think about team comp or counters and just wanna build a glass cannon & KILL, KILL, KILL!!  Neither of which interests me.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-28T20:02:36.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IE Make is already extremely easily-hit and strong Q into a click-targeted ability, so it becomes 90% of his power budget and turns him into another champion for disabled players that only have one finger, like annie?\n\nPlease no.","replies":[{"poster":"RobbieFry13","date":"2017-03-01T03:34:20.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if all you did was make the Q auto lock and change nothing else, it would still have a longer cool down, shorter range, higher mana cost and less cc effect than most of his mid lane peers have for similar abilities so I don't think it would make him Master Yi of the Mid lane.  \nBesides My Preference would be just to widen the AOE, since this is primarily what Galio needs to clear farm, I don't think it would be so bad if he had the same Range  and circle of effect as Cho'gath's Q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-02-28T19:57:10.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their focusing on making him a midlane tank.
