If you are robbed at gun point it is't 100% your fault. Horrible way to answer this question imo. Just mention ticket and leave it at that, suggest better passwords.

The database grows as users successfully crack hash or salted hash. User could of been victim of Social Engineering,  Virus,  Keylogger,  logging into open wire-less computer cafe' stores. I mean I can name thousands of ways I can get your password. I just wouldn't say something could be 100% his fault, he may of been a victim of his other account being sold (i.e Yahoo 400 million accounts information downloaded) He may not of been notified and the person who comprised his account saw it in that fashion as well. If I had your e-mail address more than likely you signed up for a site that has been hacked, more then likely I can pay my 10 dollars a month subscription to these databases and fu-k your life up. It seriously isn't that hard to realize account computerization is no longer a user error issue. This is an issue that is beyond the scope of fault.","replies":[{"poster":"LordYeven","date":"2016-10-23T14:28:11.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Social Engineering, Virus, Keylogger, logging into open wire-less computer cafe' stores\n\nArguable whether this is your responsibility or not. E.g. you would never login into your online bank account on a public wifi without using a VPN under your control. And social engineering can also be avoided. \n\n> if I had your e-mail address more than likely you signed up for a site that has been hacked, more than likely I can pay my 10 dollars a month subscription to these databases and fu-k your life up. \n\nHow so? Okay assuming you get my email and a hashed+salted password. Let's even assume you somehow got the clear text password out of it (which is really hard). Now you have the account data for a site. Great, but my LoL password is different from every other password.\n\nYou can also change your password every x month. And cracking an SHA512 hashed password for every entry in these databases you mentioned is really really time and computing power consuming (and you rely on people using the same password everywhere).\n\n  \nYou might be right that there are rare circumstances where it isn't your fault, but in most cases it is. I assume that a very high percentage of these cases are simple free RP phishing sites.","replies":[{"poster":"PreShot","date":"2016-10-30T00:12:56.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LordYeven,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=P2mZP9XN,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-10-23T14:28:11.886+0000)\n>\n> Arguable whether this is your responsibility or not.

So I am going to give you a link to an article of a guy who wanted to know how people get hacked and if it is really easy. His information that was taken was not only his Passwords (which he wasnt a victim of phishing)  but the information obtained would of ended his career. Had he not asked to be hacked, an individual could of ruined his career. So please go to school and understand that in the realm of computers anything is possible. \n\nhttp://www.networkworld.com/article/3038790/security/cautionary-tale-what-happens-after-daring-elite-hackers-to-hack-you.html\n\nMy only suggestion is that you understand blaming someone for hacking is extremely unethical and you should talk to an ADMIN and get information how simple it is to be compromised. I dont like making people paranoid but the only way you are safe is on a closed system. Because I am sure you as a person posting on this site, would be very simple to prove you wrong. Don't be stupid and ask to be proven wrong. Read the article, learn, and moving forward be respectful. Specially if you don't know the whole story, I have already seen Riot employees lift bans on people who have been hacked, who had people do similar things as this person posted and it be reversed. Don't be a dick plan and simple.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrQwerp","date":"2016-10-02T20:20:50.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh this is probably a shitpost, you can gift someone right after adding them, they need to be added for a certain amount of time (maybe a week?)","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2016-10-03T01:17:44.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was 2 weeks, and now its 3 days I believe.","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2016-10-03T01:19:47.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752964-Gifting-Guide-and-FAQ\n\n> The player receiving a gift needs to have been on your buddy list for at least one day.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2016-10-03T01:22:51.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn they changed it again?
