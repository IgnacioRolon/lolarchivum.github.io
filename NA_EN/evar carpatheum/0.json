I bought the Calvary Sejuani skin while it was on sale for 675 RP and I had 1340 in my account. I was charged twice for it I think. Because 675 + 675 =1350 and it says -10. So yeah. My picture wouldn&#039;t load, but if you need proof I&#039;ll try again. Thanks for any help or an explanation! :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-06T20:24:38.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThis is likely a visual bug. If you try logging out and logging back in, this should resolve the issue.\n\nIf you were actually charged twice, please submit a ticket to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests) so we can take a look at your account and make any necessary adjustments. :]","replies":[]}]}
