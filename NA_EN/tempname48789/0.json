The other player reported me and my account has since been perma banned. It was only the second time ive ever recieved any punishment on the game. My first punishment was a suspension for a inappropriate name that got dealt with rather quickly and this was back in 2015. There hasn’t been a single incident since but instead of getting a warning or a chat ban or anything of the sort I just got flat out perma banned. So back to the question at hand.\r\n\r\nIs it too easy to get perma banned?\r\n\r\nAlso if anyone knows any way I can get it reversed then please let me kno","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-09-12T02:14:21.523+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My researched understanding of the system is that you cannot receive a behavioral permanent ban for a chat offense unless you've already had a 14-day ban, and the 14-day ban must be _somewhat_ recent. You're a somewhat infrequent player, so I can't just point out a 14-day gap in your history and call you a liar. \n\nIf you're being straight with us, you should open a support ticket. Your story, taken at face value, should end with you receiving a 14-day ban and being on your last chance, not a perma.","replies":[{"poster":"TempName48789","date":"2018-09-12T14:01:31.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya I’ve never recieved a 14 day ban or a chat restriction of any kind it was just straight to a perma ban","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-09-12T17:08:22.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure it isn't a ban pending another name change?

All you gotta do is:\n1. Don't be toxic\n2. Don't respond to toxicity\n3. Play the game until it ends (don't troll, AFK, or intentionally feed)\n\nAnd even if you do all 3 of those things consistently in every game you play, it will still take you over a month to be permabanned. If I were in charge of it, trolling and inting would be instant permaban. AFK can be forgivable, but if you were displaying toxicity in chat and it was obvious that you rage quit instead of just having internet problems, you shouldn't get any leniency. Minimum of a 1 month ban, possibly a permaban. If it seems like it could have just been internet problems (and Riot can probably put systems in place to track internet usage on your computer), then it's a bit more forgivable with just some low priority queues. I don't think you should be permanently banned for going AFK because your internet cut out. However, doing so in ranked, even with just internet problems, should be harsher punishment than in normal games.","replies":[{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2018-09-12T01:43:55.948+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":16,"body":"If I were in charge of it,flaming would only be a chat restriction","replies":[{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2018-09-12T16:57:41.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it's you, I don't doubt it one bit.\n\nThere was a time a few seasons ago when it was like that...when CRs stacked.
