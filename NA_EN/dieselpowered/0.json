The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system would only mark you after multiple leaves, and not a single game.  It's really important to resolve whatever is causing you to disconnect or leave games, and in this case I'd recommend a wired connection if possible.  Let me know if you need any help in resolving that!","replies":[{"poster":"DieselPowered","date":"2017-03-01T07:21:28.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesnt happen anymore tho, and ty for the reply (kinda late ik, have not been online on the forums for a while)\ngood to know, i will carry this newfound knowledge with me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"two 0p","date":"2016-10-12T14:55:17.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol try being me I am sick as heck and yet I am end up in it from trying to poop and ....
