Also since I'm not a Riot employee, I'm not as prone to feeling attacked by your post.\n\nTrust me, an employee is going to see your introduction and say, \"fuck this shit I'm out\" before ever reading what your actual concern is. If you want them to pay attention to your concern you have to reign it in, at least long enough to make a persuasive post. Attacking them is not going to communicate your concerns effectively.\n\n> When shit like this pop&#x27;s up on my Newsfeed i CANT make intelligent decisions sorry i act rationally\n\nI mean sure, but before you assume everyone has gone insane maybe take some time to think about why they might make changes. Riot doesn't buff things for no reason. Those champions are probably having some difficulty functioning right now and Riot wants them to be viable.\n\nOne experience getting stomped by a Yi who was probably smurfing is not good grounds for assuming the champion is actually OP. Yi is a stat-stick, but as things are right now he's a bad one. I hope that if Riot is making changes to increase his viability that they also make sure there are still plenty of ways to try to out-play him, but the changes are not set in stone, they only just started testing things on the PBE. In all hope they will catch any ridiculous problems before it gets released.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-01-20T00:03:48.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FeeNeeX,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5nNYpMAi,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-19T23:56:27.465+0000)\n>\n> sorry but Are you on Drugs??\n> i was Gold 1 last Season and i was getting 1 shot by a Yi on his ult with 3 items as a Nasus with 250 stacks and 2 armor items at 15 min\n> You call that weak?\n\nso... last season somehow means something about how he is right now? and you somehow think i care about you getting \"1 shot\" by a Yi with no actual info on the game itself? \"2 armor items\" i highly doubt that but sure.
