If you don't believe me read the lore again\n\n\n> Listen, i can respect your dedication to the champion but i don&#x27;t think you explained the situation well. What i just read feels like a mix between old lore, current lore and headcannon.\n\n\nYeah sometimes i over exaggerate and i go off point YES my explanation is OLD NEW AND HEADCANNON and how i want things to be but i never quite understood why they changed the lore. it was much better the way it was except with some modifications.\nAnd also i only care about 1 champion out of the 145 that league has \nI couldn't care less about the rest.They don't personally interest me and i don't like them\n\n\n> While i personally prefer the original Leona/panth lore, the new one is honestly fits into the big picture better. (Diana&#x27;s didn&#x27;t change that much tbh) The old lore as much as you might love it is no longer canon. \n\n\n> Sure Lintu Puck left out some details, like the fact that diana was raised in the solari temple, but everything they said follows the current lore and they gave the most important parts of it.\n\nYes maybe they did but they didn't cover the whole story of these two \n\nAnd btw where the hell are the aspects anyways do they have a face or they are just gods giving power to worthy Mortals Making them Demi-gods","replies":[{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-06-24T21:13:33.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> C'mon men Use a bit of your Fantasy two girls that lived on a mountain together for god knows how long ( Diana was a baby when she was found and Both Diana and Leona look like they have the same age so i assume they were raised together ) don't you think its safe to say that they are \"sisters\" not Blood sisters But as two girls that were raised together trained together and so on?\n The lore doesn't give you everything in this game after all\n\nThat's exaclty my point, the lore clearly shows leona lived outside of the solari long enough to participate in the tribe's fight against the spirits/and whateverthefucks that roam targon AND in a trial by combat. Let's say the rakkor were as hardcore as it gets she'd be like 10-12 years old at best.\nAside from that it's never stated they had any contact in the temple. Leona's lore clearly states that Diana is known to her as a troublemaker but nothing more is given.\nand using a bit of my fantasye would lead to a Headcanon.\n\n> if i was in her position i would've done the same. They are liars and and they have some serious tunnel vision these elders of the solari and not only that they destroyed an entire civilization just so they can be the dominated force and have no Rivals and be able to rule targon without anybody Questioning them\n\nYes they allegedly erased the lunari. How long ago isn't clear but probably a long frickin time ago, those elders most likely weren't the same guys anymore. Aside from that she still attacked the people who run the solari, the common warrior priest probably doesn't know what diana knows so to them she's just a murderer, a criminal.\n\n> And don't forget that in that room was Leona As well and she fell unconscious after Diana's Outburst And she could easily kill her but she didn't for unknown reasons but i suspect some of them and she just left. If you don't believe me read the lore again\n\nDiana's lore states that she was appaled by what she had done in her fit of anger and thus fled, she most likely wasn't planning to check on the person with the best chance to beat her there.\n\n> Yeah sometimes i over exaggerate and i go off point YES my explanation is OLD NEW AND HEADCANNON and how i want things to be but i never quite understood why they changed the lore. it was much better the way it was except with some modifications.\n\nBecause it forms much more of a complete story now. all targon stories connect somewhat, I personally hate Panth's new lore (don't play the champ so not that big of a deal) but I think Diana mainly got an update that clarifies her position in the world better. Let's be real, in diana's old lore Leona wasn't even mentionned. And vice versa in leo's case.\n\n> And also i only care about 1 champion out of the 145 that league has\n> I couldn't care less about the rest.They don't personally interest me and i don't like them\n\nremember those elders with tunnelvision? \n\n> And btw where the hell are the aspects anyways do they have a face or they are just gods giving power to worthy Mortals Making them Demi-gods.\n\nAt this point idk anymore, with the whole space magic going on. i'd like to believe the golden boy was an aspect or the old lady in diana's case.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2018-06-25T09:48:13.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a really big misconception to people who haven't read all of LEONA'S lore.\n\nWhilst understandably Diana's lore is a little more eyecatching.\n\nThe ending of Leona's lore changes her perspective on Diana.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2018-06-24T15:50:19.106+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana absolutely destroys Leona.\nSo it'd be pretty horrendously 1sided lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-06-25T12:12:47.950+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't their lores change so that Leona just wants to talk with Diana now, and Diana wants to unite the Lunari and the Solari?\n\nI'm just saying, their old lore they were enemies.
