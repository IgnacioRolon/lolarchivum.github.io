New voice-lines and Taunts with Leona Taric and Pantheon and other Champions\n3. Bring Moonflair Spellblade Into Summoners Rift {{item:3170}} \n4. Revert Her Ult and her Shield DMG back to when Diana was released and buff Her Passive by 5% =&gt; (You are buffing Yasuo RIOT so you have **no excuse** on this)\n5. Make her Ult have **AOE DMG** \n6. **(This is a BIG TOPIC)** Since Diana&#039;s W (Her shield) is the only defensive mechanism she has available and nothing else make it so that the more enemy champions you have nearby you the higher the **AP RATIO OF THE SHIELD AND DMG GETS** Or just have the CD of the ability start when i press E not when all orbs Detonate \n_=&gt; I&#039;ll elaborate further down this thread as to why this needs to become a thing (But if you are a Diana main you already know why)_\n7. A Chibi figure to the store along site some Merch like other champions have\n8. A Diana Emote (Because Reasons)\n9. A Legendary and Project Skin   \n\n>THE REASONS I BELIEVE THE IN GAME MODELS NEED TO BE UPDATED **(PROOF)**\n\nThis is PROOF of how much attention Riot Gives to Diana\n(I bet my life on the fact that they haven&#039;t updated anything on Diana since 2012)\n**Keep in mind am talking about the quality of the 3D IN GAME MODEL HERE**\nhttps://i.imgur.com/oSLBh0Q.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YzIb6QL.png\n^^^ **In these 2 i cant even see her eyes (Can you?)**\nhttps://i.imgur.com/eDky3Hh.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mYEmgeo.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9LOC2gY.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/I6M0TWM.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0khjKBi.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zhEM1jw.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KIswAJd.png\nRiot what the hell is this?\nhttps://i.imgur.com/FICQRs4.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/45RwvWB.png\n\n**Riot lets be true to one another for a moment here \nWe this (Pictures Above) IN GAME content you mean to tell me that A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY AND THE #1 MOST PLAYED GAME IN THE WORLD CANT Deliver Better Quality then this? (SERIOUSLY?)**\n\nAnd am just BARELY scratching the surface here Am not even going to mention \nother body parts or other stances and the fact that she has ZERO facial expressions because i don&#039;t want to overfill this post\n\nBTW here are some examples of GREAT 3D MODELS i found online \nhttps://i.imgur.com/j22cfks.jpg \n^(Look how clean this looks compare to yours Riot?)\nhttps://i.imgur.com/B3WP0lj.jpg \n(In the lore it says she has the PUREST white hair so the creator might went with that in mind) \nhttps://i.imgur.com/brbGMZh.jpg \n(This looks like an HD version of the Original skin)\n\nAnd before you say anything i will just post this\n \nNew champion Zoe looks CLEAN in comparison to Dianas 3D models \nand this is just the BETA VERSION **AND SHE ALSO HAS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS** \nhttps://i.imgur.com/gQALQt7.png\n\nSo yeah i DO BELIEVE she needs a heavy Duty **IN GAME UPDATE**\n\n> **THE SHIELD UPDATE**\n\nSo this topic i believe needs to be addressed because its super frustrating when you main a champion such as Diana that she Is an all in Do or Die champion and you want to kill the ADC in the LATE GAME Team-fight and all the enemy Team Dives you and you have nothing to protect yourself with i mean think about it every other champion in League has some sort of escape like Jump ,Wall, Freeze, Stun or something Diana Has NOTHING she&#039;s just an 1 SHOT BURST ASSASSIN that goes in to clear out as many champions as she can and that&#039;s it so am like &quot;am okay with that BUT give me something i can sustain myself in 1vs5 situations that i ulted the ADC and the whole team appeared for the bush and i cant escape&quot; \nSo i figured\n**LOWER THE COOL-DOWN AND SCALE THE AP RATIO OF HER SHIELD BASED ON HOW MANY ENEMIES YOU HAVE AROUND YOU WHILE OR BEFORE I USE MY SHIELD OR MAKE THE CD START ONCE I ACTIVATED THE ABILITY NOT WHEN ALL SPHERES DETONATE** \nThink about it \nDiana is a Diver at her core with no escape abilities (No windwalls no Tornado no Shields building up while doing the most basic thing in the game &quot;moving&quot; NOTHING) just one shield and that&#039;s it\nSo according to my thinking and my humble experience with Diana that&#039;s the perfect solution i can figure out for her with her current kit\n\n> **LASTLY A MESSAGE FOR RIOT **\n\nPlease take into concentration what i just outlined here as my overall opinion as a 400k Diana MAIN AND UNDERSTAND THAT DIANA AS A CHAMPION HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL and also PLEASE if you are gong to Create a Legendary skin for Diana {{champion:131}} please do an event Like Riven and Yasuo had and have Leona {{champion:89}} as her Rival :) \nhttps://i.imgur.com/z6p07FB.jpg\n\n> Heck even here it's my Idea for the Event \n\nSOLAR Eclipse Diana\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZDrojJK.jpg \nLUNAR Eclipse Leona\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kN27gKs.jpg\n\n> HOW DIANA ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE\n \nhttps://i.imgur.com/w2NRnGi.jpg \n**( OPEN THE IMAGE AND CLICK ON IT TO ZOOM IN AND LET THE MAGIC UNFOLD )**\n\nIf you have anything you want me to add in this thread please write in the comments below\n\n> Thnx for Reading guys.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ihMlFMH.jpg\nBtw NONE of these art is mine Just saying.","replies":[{"poster":"Giant of Babil","date":"2018-01-19T16:21:07.205+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't it be Solar Eclipse Diana and Lunar Eclipse Leona, considering the fact that during a solar eclipse you can't see the sun, and during a lunar eclipse you can't see the moon.","replies":[{"poster":"DianaIsMyWife","date":"2018-01-19T17:02:54.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=13nardran13,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lbg8cAtZ,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2018-01-19T16:21:07.205+0000)\n>\n> Shouldn&#x27;t it be Solar Eclipse Diana and Lunar Eclipse Leona, considering the fact that during a solar eclipse you can&#x27;t see the sun, and during a lunar eclipse you can&#x27;t see the moon.\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} Hmmmm.......\nYou are Actually right am gonna change it now :)\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-01-14T22:24:04.087+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No no no please, old Diana main here too.

It&#x27;s so nerdy but I respect that, I can be the same way at times. It&#x27;s cool to see all your ideas and that your speaking out about it. I&#x27;ve played a little Diana here and there, and I agree with what you&#x27;re saying. I hope Riot does take a look at this because I think most people can agree a visual update is due, your kit changes sound pretty reasonable, and a new voice over would be nice.\n\nWell i am a nerd but one with a life :)\nBeen passionate about 1 champion is okay i think \nBut thnx for your nice words \nI hope they do it as well :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Retrøspect","date":"2018-01-14T18:35:25.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I logged in to upvote, because this deserved it lol \nI hope this gains enough momentum for developer attention (probably won't but I hope it does) \nI think adding an escape into her kit somehow like being able to R to allies or something like that would place her back into the meta, she just seems to be an all in for ADC type of champion but with all the shields and heals in this meta she's been kicked to the curb since she can't really complete her job anymore.
