All very well done skins\n\nLeona: Pool Party and PROJECT are pretty much her only decent skins and those are beyond old\n\nShe deserves these skins to herself\n\nAlso when they made these Leona skins the theme was just eclipse but when they showed both concepts and asked for Leona testers to choose one, there was so much love for both Riot made both","replies":[]}]}
