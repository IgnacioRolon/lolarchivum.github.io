I'd rather have it delayed a split than not working. You have always had problem with these watch and earn things. Just make us play games or have a \"watch your teams live games or VODs\" tasks instead (your description actually sucks)*\r\n\r\nPS. I hope this is fixed soon. It's just so frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Pnutt","date":"2019-06-10T04:04:49.819+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Confirm you are watching on the LoL Esports site and logged on to the correct account\n\n2) Go here: https://watch.na.lolesports.com/rewards\nand click \"opt out of rewards\".
