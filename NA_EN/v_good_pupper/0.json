Every single one of them has over tuned stats, glaring gameplay health issues, and incredibly low skill floors for their outputs.  There is not a single Juggernaut that comes close to healthy.  \r\n\r\nThe reworks were just tacking on stats to unhealthy and failed champion designs in hopes they would brute force their way to success.  In Mordekaiser&#039;s case, they recognized his kit was so unhealthy that they tried to cover it up by making him an ADC, even then brute forcing it.\r\n\r\nThe Juggernaut reworks were lazy and failures.  There was no attempt to fix the champions in any positive way.  They just tacked on stats and prayed they would see play again.

If you want to complain about juggernauts then you about 8 months to late.  At the time of their release they did admit soon after that they fcked up and then proceeded to nerf garen, darius, skarner and mord back in to a balanced state.  It took a while but all garen, darius and skarner are all fine champions now.  None of them are unhealthy for the game in their current state.\n\nMord has a whole other set of problems due to his rework itself kinda being messed up but riot still already admitted that and have looked for feedback on him and are probably going to change him again eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-04-03T11:54:19.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, I'm still not convinced that \"stay away from them or you will die and you can never kill them so don't bother trying\" is a healthy design.\n\nBecause that's what those guys feel like to me if I'm playing a squishy champion, especially a short-ranged one.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-04-03T13:41:45.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanky, slow-moving duelist is a healthy design.\n\nBeing a squishy champion vs anybody with high base damage is asking to get stomped.

It's a theme that not many games have tried. They basicly are lategame AD damage dealers. \n\nWhat worries more is how many champions they are going to label as a juggernaut.

Some of them are to mobile to be a juggernaut while others have to much focus of their damage in burst damage. Than we have Aatrox with some strange attackspeed scaling what make it really difficult to define it's class.\n\nSince the juggernauts is the first item class that is officially defined in the game it's kinda hard to tell where we should drawn the line.\n\nCurrently the official juggernauts add the moment are: {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:72}}","replies":[{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2016-04-03T14:07:38.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're missing Volibear, Trundle, and Mordekaiser on your \"official\" list.

Some champions do better against others.  The same goes for champion  classes and roles in general.  Squishy short range champs aren't supposed to do well against equally short range tanky champs.  \n\nJuggernauts have pretty clearly defined strengths and weaknesses you can play around no matter which side you are on.  They are all short range, lack mobility and cc.  \n\nTheir biggest weakness is that it is hard to get to you, especially if there is any kind of slow or stun in your kit.  They have to make up for it buy either playing smart (hiding in bushes, outflanking etc)  or rely on their team to get you in range for them (get sej ultied and then they can just walk up to you)\n\nThey are also easy to catch out and gank top lane, however on the flip side most of them have something that will allow them to 1v2 if they can pull it off (darius 5 stacks and ultis, Illoi ulti, Garen w to mirigate damage and survive long enough to get away or ulti)\n\nOn a side note:  This probably wasn't intentional given how long ago voli was released but have you noticed that he fits pretty much everything a juggernaut has?   He is relativly low mobility (got the same sort of speed up as garen with flip instead of silence), is tanky as fuck but mostly brings his damage to fights wtih w and r.  He even has his passive as the 1v2 ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best KhaZix Void","date":"2016-04-03T09:17:37.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because usually riot doesn't admit to things that aren't true.","replies":[]}]}
