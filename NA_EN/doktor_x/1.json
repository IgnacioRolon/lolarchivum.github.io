That is only enough to take two champions to 6 or one champion to 7. I have nine level 6 mastery tokens: 3 pairs and 3 singles. So unfortunately, I cannot bring 3 champions up to 6. \r\n\r\nYes, I know I can get random champion shards for IP, but I am saving IP for buying champions I don&#039;t own.\r\n\r\nI propose a new system:\r\n\r\nTo get Level 6 on a champion requires one of the following:\r\n2 Level 6 tokens and the champion permanent\r\n2 Level 6 tokens and the champion shard\r\n2 Level 6 tokens and 500 blue essence\r\n4 Level 6 tokens\r\n\r\nTo get Level 6 on a champion requires one of the following:\r\n3 Level 7 tokens and the champion permanent\r\n3 Level 7 tokens and the champion shard\r\n3 Level 7 tokens and 500 blue essence\r\n4 Level 7 tokens\r\n\r\nThat way, those of us who are IP or blue essence poor can still level up our champions. It will just take a bit longer.\r\n\r\nOn an unrelated note, I think it would be a bit nicer if instead of Level 6 tokens and Level 7 tokens, it was just S-, S or S+ tokens. Then you could save your S and S+ tokens earned at level 5 for getting level 7.","replies":[{"poster":"Jetridder11","date":"2016-06-22T17:46:33.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fucking love the fact that I can finally spend my IP again on something.
