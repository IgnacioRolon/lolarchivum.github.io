Two days of sending email back and forth i got this email from a different rioter. Then i completed the steps that he asked me and sent him back an aswer that i have done everything. And now two days later still no response whatsoever. And i just really want my account back. So i wanted to ask why did they stop sending me email because before if i send them email i got response in 6-7 hours but now i has been almost 3 days.
