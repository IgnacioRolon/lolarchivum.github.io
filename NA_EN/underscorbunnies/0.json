Not only this, but we should also make individual threads about the champions we plan to &quot;rework&quot;, so that the community can provide feedback on both of these, so that we can create the most ideal situation. Of course, the communities&#039; (The Boards community) response to this, is to make tons of threads on basically saying the same thing:\r\n\r\n&quot;AHHHHH THEY BROKE THE GAME FUCK RIOT OH NO ZEDS EVEN MORE OP LOOK AT HOW BROKEN THIS IS MID LANE IS THE NEW SUPPORT HELP MY LIFE IS OVER FUCK EVERYONE FUCK EVERYTHING I CAN NO LONGER PLAY MID LANE MAGES ARE IRRELEVANT AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH&quot;\r\n\r\nThough seriously, these changes don&#039;t even EXIST yet. There&#039;s no real way to figure out exactly how it will interact with each champion and the midlane meta in general, without actually seeing it in action. Not only that, but from what I can tell, Riot added some decent (albeit maybe not as good as raw mana regen) alternatives on ways to gain mana without backing. Not only that, they also tweaked a bunch of other items, with things that I&#039;ve seen people begging for for ages. CDR on more mage items to make building more convenient? Check. Making Zhonyas slightly less pricey? Check. \r\n\r\nSo how about we all just calm down for a bit, give some constructive criticism on what we like and dislike, and wait until we physically see how these proposed changes and items function before we freak the fuck out and go on a witch hunt, k?","replies":[{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2016-04-08T00:15:46.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"they do not listen to community feedback\nthis will go through no matter what happens\nthey are only looking to make things new and fresh because this game no longer pulls in new players near the numbers it used to \nwhen they think they can fix this by shaking up the game\nthis however just drives away old players and aggravates the problem further \nI typed this way to make sure you can read each line and understand what I am saying","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeoBrawler","date":"2016-04-08T00:53:47.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you mean.
