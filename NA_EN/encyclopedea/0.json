I was hoping for models because it makes measurements a little easier due to being able to remove the angle of incidence, but I should be able to work around that. I don't suppose anyone just happens to know the default (aka unhacked) angle of incidence for League? (just for bonus accuracy)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-11-18T05:38:29.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't wait to see it! Best of luck to you!

We were supposed to be working on this for several months, but, like most cosplayers, we ended up procrastinating and finishing it 7 hours before we left for the con..... Most of the work was done over a month, with like 6 hrs/week for the first 2 weeks, then ramped it up to 12/week for the last 2 before the con. We put in maybe 15 hrs of work before that, but I really don't count that cause it was mainly messing around and we didn't use anything we made during that time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-11-18T02:34:17.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"56 degrees. :]","replies":[{"poster":"encyclopedea","date":"2014-11-18T05:09:26.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!
