The problem is; on my other account I had a few skins and ward skins, and it would be a waste of money if I just let them be on my alt. I can show you evidence of me logging onto that account, confirm it's mine and show you the skins. Unless there is a way to merge my accounts ( so I get the levels, Icons, loot, etc. ) I would love to get the skins moved to my new account.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-29T22:36:10.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't merge or move content between two accounts.
