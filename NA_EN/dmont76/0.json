You cannot do it. \n\nYou always ask players to provide SCREENSHOTS THEY CANNOT PROVIDE. Getting that screen shot requires TAKING CONSTANT SCREEN SHOTS JUST IN CASE YOUR SYSTEM FUCKS UP. That screen shot cannot be taken WHEN he finds out he did not get the chest. Why you ask such things NOBODY CAN PROVIDE. \n\nTHis is like when I found out my game logs contained game logs you did not have, you asked me to provide PROOF that the game existed, as you cannot ADMIT that YOU HAVE TO INVESTIGATE YOUR SYSTEM FAILURE. I cannot provide proof of game to you if your logging system does not contain it, as it is YOUR LOGGING SYSTEM which failed and YOU TRUST IT WITHOUT CHECKIGN IT EVEN IF PROVIDED PROOF IT IS FLAWED.
