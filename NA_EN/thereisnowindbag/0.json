We(Berto and many Inven users) thought it means we take 2 less damage from Champion&#039;s basic attack and Monster&#039;s basic attack.\r\n\r\nAt first we thought it as a problem of ambiguous Eng-Kor translation process. But we found that the English tooltip looks ambiguous too (at least to us). So I ask here... Is it a intended or just a bug?\r\n\r\nPlus(a result of the experience), as a result of this mastery, you can still recall while debuffed by &#039;Deathfire Touch&#039; unless &#039;Deathfire Touch&#039; damages you more than 2 per second. Thank you.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/kj4xLep1lxI","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-12-01T08:27:09.803+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for mentioning this, looks like Tough Skin's reducing all champion damage (that isn't true damage) by 2, rather than just the stated basic attacks. I'll follow up with the team that's been working on masteries tomorrow, that's either a significant amount of unintended power or a tooltip that really undersells the mastery. \n\nAlso, on the off chance this reaches him/her, my thanks to Berto as well for spotting this and investigating it.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-12-01T10:58:54.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought i already posted this bug/interaction somewhere but im not sure.\n\nI don't think it needs changing, 2 is such a low number anyway. Besides with DFT making dot mages very strong a little bit of countering is healty i think.\n\nIn casse you did not know {{item:1054}} does the same thing, It also blocks damage from dots. \n\nPerhaps these are bugs you want fixed. \nBut It could also be used as a passive in a new defensive item, rather then nerfing the DFT mastery or the champions whom abuse it in conjunction with {{item:3151}} an option to build some defenses against this might be more helpfull.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2015-12-01T09:15:11.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this is true and will be fixed, would it be possible that you assumed the Mastery's strength to be amicable even though it was stronger than intended?
