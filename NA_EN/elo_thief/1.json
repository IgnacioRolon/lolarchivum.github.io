And then you have Morde who starts 13 hp pots and rushes revolver/tabi/sunfire/FoN and nobody can fucking damage him. Zed needs massive buffs imo\n\nActually, a lot of mages who rush Hourglass have less damage and no mana for sustain. Zed already has easy waveclear and endless sustain, so he can apply incredible pressure in lane and avoid ganks quite easily. If you have trouble with him, it's because you play his ultimate only. I had a game where I was bard, I hit the enemy mid laner 3 times while zed hid nearby with full hp. The enemy laner had 30% hp, too much for braum, but if Zed came did one auto for stun, and then a couple more (+ any skill) would have been kill. He was sitting watching me defend myself for a while before the enemy decided to run after i landed the 3rd stack, so i know he wasn't on cd for all his skills. After enemy ran what was his excuse for not helping \"I didn't have ulti\"\nPeople that pick Zed for his unstoppable ultimate, are gonna bitch about Zhonyas blocking it, but fast building Zhonya hurts mid lane mages, and since when can Zed not ultimate the ADC?\n\nZed can be countered, but who should be able to be, like everyone else, but he counters MOST mid laners, which is why so many noobs pick him first. I had 15 games with 14 losses, and each time Zed or Kata was first pick mid. It happened at least 10 times to be honest, but I was shocked at the frequency of the bronze picks even if it was silver 2. Zed is not as over powered as people say, because he can be stopped, but he does not need buffs, not at all, since he is still such a safe pick and reliable champ. Only a noobs pick him because he is SO powerful, that the get owned. He is this seasons master yi, people that can't play pick him for easy kills but lose the game\n\nAs for needing gold fast, he outtrades almost every other mid at level 1, why is he in such a rush, considering that he can proceed to out farm, stay in lane longer to continue to farm, and swiftly roam. He earns gold faster than most mid laners, so it doesn't matter if he (like ALL assassins) needs to build gold fast - since I notice that if they don't get the first kill or a kill within first 8 minutes they tend to fall behind, but Zed is one of the few assassins that can farm well (unlike Kata or Akali that NEEDs to get those kills)","replies":[{"poster":"rebound2","date":"2015-04-20T15:10:21.917+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"...","replies":[{"poster":"Elo Thief","date":"2015-04-20T16:56:38.029+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrYorky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g5nAIxwy,comment-id=000300030001,timestamp=2015-04-20T15:10:21.917+0000)\n>\n> ...\n\nThis isn't a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2015-04-20T21:51:27.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elo Thief,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g5nAIxwy,comment-id=0003000300010000,timestamp=2015-04-20T16:56:38.029+0000)\n>\n> This isn't a joke.\n\nThey think its a joke because they just want TF/Lux/Anivia every game so they can continue to collect elo.

Go post your opinion in them instead. You're saying that TF, Anivia and Lux are not seen much because of champions like Zed. You're trying to prove my point wrong for some reason, even though it is incredibly easy to tell that I'm joking around. (I thought Ionic Spark Shen would give it away more than it did)\n\nAt least GD can tell an obvious troll thread out most of the time. Most people on G&B take everything really serious for no reason. Did you honestly come here and expect a response from me saying, \"Well you're right, but here is why you can be considered wrong too\" \n\nThe reason I asked if you read the whole thing was for that reason alone.
