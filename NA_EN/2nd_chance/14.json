I think it's relatively fine for the drill itself to be intercepted, as that's the intended gameplay, but stopping the guaranteed chain kill via projectile blocking feels like it's deriving occasionally major gameplay consequences from a tech quirk, which feels exploit-y.

It's the same kind of screwy situation as Yasuo previously being able to block Soraka's Q self-healing, just because the effect was being carried by a cosmetic projectile from the target to her.\n\nTo a larger extent, this I think represents one of the more long-term costs of projectile blocking as a mechanic, because it means any tech you implement, including purely cosmetic effects, automatically has a gameplay component attached to it when it's in projectile form. Suddenly you have to start asking yourself what that projectile represents, and how it has to interact with projectile blocking if that so happens. In this case, this means projectile blocker champions gain the ability to double-dip on countering Urgot's ult, simply because the guaranteed kill recast is conveyed through a projectile that should normally be completely unstoppable. It technically makes sense within Riot's own tech, because the chains are a projectile, but in practice the interaction feels really bizarre and unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-07-28T03:12:17.696+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The weirdest thing about all of it to is Yasuo can destroy the projectile that Illaoi's E fires after she kills his spirit.\nBut he'll still end up cursed? \n\nIt makes no sense and there's no consistency with that shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2017-07-27T22:35:28.151+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You pretty much hit the nail on the head in terms of how I view it.

When I initially played him I actually thought the chains were already attached to the spike and you just reeled the target in.\n\nMy personal solution would be to patch Windwall and Braum shield to not block cosmetic projectiles (Soraka, Urgot, and I wonder if Kayn passive is affected) as well as Taliyah ult and Vel W because they aren't really \"projectiles\" but are effects travelling across the terrain.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LXII","date":"2017-07-27T22:23:50.771+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to chime in and say thanks for making yet another exception to the \"the only way you survive his ult is if he dies\" rule that was very clearly stated to the players on reveal.\n\nAs it stands Vandiril made a video that was like 10 full minutes of stuff that already defies this very bold lie we were told, why not add a little more?\n\nI don't understand the \"HAHA WE MADE IT 2 PROJECTILES JUST FOR FUN!!!\" path that you took, and because of that you opened up a world of counterplay to an already weak and underwhelming ability.\nHell it's a missable skillshot to begin with, does next to no damage, AND isn't even a guaranteed execute when the threshold is reached anymore. \n\nCan we just get a new ult?
