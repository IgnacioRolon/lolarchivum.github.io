And I was thinking how cool it would be to buy this chest and get random things inside!\r\n\r\nSo what is &quot;hextech mystery chest &quot; and what do you mean by that?\r\n\r\n- Well, it is a box with random items inside it ( something like figures, codes , t- shirts.. )\r\n\r\nWhat we can get inside that chest?\r\n\r\n- In that chest you can find three different packages. Each package contains random things from RIOT and each package consists of various things. So you can enjoy and be happy with things inside that chest!\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between chests?\r\n\r\n- Each package consists of various things, first one ( MIRACULOUS ) contains fewer things inside so it&#039;s the cheapest, the second one ( ENCHANTED CHEST ) contains more things and the third one ( UNIQUE CHEST) is the most expensive and it contains most valuable things like special skin. Each package is special in its own way, but we wanted each package contains similar things so there is a little difference between the boxes! \r\n\r\nWell how is that worth, i can buy skins and other things in game too!?\r\n\r\n-Well, in this box you can find a multiple things to equip IRL , also in UNIQUE chest you can find a UNIQUE Skin which won&#039;t be released in store, and a lot of great stuff for you and your account!\r\n\r\nWhy &quot;UNIQUE&quot; skin is not in every chest? \r\n\r\n- A UNIQUE chest is more intended for collectors and players who love rare and legacy skins! it contains UNIQUE skin which you can only get in this way and because of that the value of skin will rise , that&#039;s why this box is special. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading this! \r\nWhat do you guys think!? Is it possible riot will make it one day? Do you think people would like to buy it? Do you think there is enough stuff inside? \r\nPlease let me know! also if you have any ideas , post it here! \r\nif you have any questions, feel free to ask me.","replies":[{"poster":"Slashing Katana","date":"2018-11-15T19:28:36.693+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the idea!
