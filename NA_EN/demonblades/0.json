They currently use the in-game skins to create classes/origins for champions. They won't make NEW Skins just for a gamemode where they are already wearing skins for a different purpose. \n\nVayne: Uses her Arclight Skin to appear Noble, hence why she is part of the Nobles.\n\nDraven: Uses Gladiator; not sure why he's got that as he's a Blademaster / Imperial. Guess it suits blademasters better?\n\nTwisted Fate: uses Cutpurse\nMiss Fortune: uses Captain\nGraves: uses Cutthroat \n\nThese are all Pirate themed, as they share the Pirate class.\n\n\n\n\nJayce: The newest addition on the PBE will be using BOTH his Base skin and his Fullmetal skin as he is a shapeshifter and swaps between the two. This is a new one as it's able to show they can use multiple skins in one.\n\n\nSo they wanted to use skins in this mode but in a more original and creative way then how they are presented in other modes. They've also mentioned wanting to include Odyssey, Dark Star and Cosmic skinlines too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PikemanDim","date":"2019-08-02T10:06:17.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it would be a good idea but I don't think it will be implemented. Main reason is being able to notice what champ it is at a glance. If anything they might add a system to change the look for just you but that could be a cluster fuck and cause issues.","replies":[]}]}
