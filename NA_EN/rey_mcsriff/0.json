This never happened with the old client.  I like keeping the league client open, but would still like if my monitor when to screensaver and then turned off after I've been inactive.\r\n\r\nAnyone else experiencing this and/or know how to fix it?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T18:52:24.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's an interesting issue, and recommend posting about it on the [client discussion ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)boards.
