Fast forward 6 months and she finally is interested in playing, but unfortunately all I remember about the account is the Summoner Name and the password to log in. I didn't want to sign her email up for something without permission, and I already have an account on my email, so I created a new Yahoo or gmail address which I've forgotten. I submitted a ticket, but I'm not sure how much Riot will be able to help. Any ideas on how boned I am on the recovering-this-account front?\r\n\r\nAlso, I would just make her a new account, but the first thing I did on the account was grab an Amazon starter pack, which is no longer available. She knows I did that for her, so she'll be bummed if the account doesn't come with the starter perks.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nYour Dude","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T18:06:42.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and our account team can help you out.  Keep in mind that account sharing is not something we support, so it might be difficult to verify the owner of the account which is something the team takes pretty seriously.  Ideally, your girlfriend would have created the account on her own and I would recommend still doing that if possible.  We'll respond to your ticket as soon as possible!","replies":[]}]}
