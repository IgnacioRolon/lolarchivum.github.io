You already tried some great steps to troubleshoot this, so we'll likely want to grab a traceroute for both the time when you see the issue and another when you don't have the issue.\n\nYou can run a traceroute using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) and plug in the IP Address 104.160.131.1 then run a trace for 5 minutes. After that time has passed, export your results as a text, then paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this.","replies":[]}]}
