They are very rare, and I've only seen them come up when a new region becomes available and not as sales or prizes.  An account can transfer to another region through the in-game store, but we can't bypass the cost.  Hope that helps clear things up, and I wish you the best with whichever region you choose!","replies":[]}]}
