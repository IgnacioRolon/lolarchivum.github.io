After maybe like 3 minutes the loading screen showed up with no one connected, then said I had connection issues. I did not, because my brother(who was playing at the same time) did not have this issue. So I quit the loading screen and tried to reconnect._ The same thing happened, except this time the white screen wouldn't load into anything, and it made my Mac not respond making me have to shut it down, and never enter my ranked game. I am in the process of e-downloading the client. **Anyone else experiencing this by any chance?**","replies":[{"poster":"Goethe","date":"2017-05-05T19:31:58.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got the exact same problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-05T20:36:24.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even though another PC might be able to use the net fine, or even yourself, it doesn't make you immune from reaching specific services.
