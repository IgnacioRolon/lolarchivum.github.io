I can navigate everything else in the client just fine but I'm no longer able to click the \"Play\" button. I get the same error after relogging and I even tried doing a full repair. I'd rather not reinstall the game but I think that's where I'm at now.\n\nEDIT: If I'm invited to someone else's game I can play just fine but I can't start any solo games nor create a lobby to invite others.\n\nEDIT2: After finishing a game that I was invited to the problem goes away and I can make my own game. The problem returns when I relog.\n\nEDIT 3: [Why is there six slots?](https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15874966_1412478572097969_4488618380698576071_o.jpg?oh=0a8935a40052474e29193e1e01913b1b&amp;oe=591084C6)\n\nEDIT 4: I logged in on my friend's computer and everything worked fine.
