While neither of us ever truly mastered Fiddlesticks, we've both played him on free weeks, and we've dreamt of truly carrying with him one day. Indeed, it was even our goal for one of us to venture into the LCS as Fiddlesticks mid, to showcase what an amazing champion he actually is.\n\nWith Fiddlesticks temporarily disabled, we've found our dreams in shambles. We have nothing to talk about anymore, nothing to bond over. Our relationship is in serious distress.
