Couple days ago i noticed that you updated the &quot;Latest Updates&quot; on the Client Update website, as i was scrolling down i see the whole (lobby/pop-up/champion select) [video](https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/LCU/2016/april/r2pl/video/BlindPick_Animatic.webm) and i wanted to suggest something that might make the new client look way more &quot;EPIC&quot;.  |\n---\n\n       | |\n|-\n| | \n|      |||||| I was thinking about it for some time and i&#039;ve come to terms that this would look so cool experiencing it every time you wait for the pop-up/champion select/..  to &quot;start&quot;. As i was improving this idea i thought that in order for this to work, client must be permanently full windowed. Ofc i might be wrong since i&#039;m not a dev of the client or something.  | {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n---\n\n       | |\n|-\n| | \n| {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}     |||||| My idea was since the Alpha Client &quot;&quot;&quot;will be permanently full window&quot;&quot;&quot; every time we get the match pop-up/champion select/loading screen and then in game, why not make it look like we&#039;re travelling to the (League&#039;s world). I&#039;m saying this because when i saw the new champion select it made me feel like it (takes you) from the real world to the champion select, the whole idea is to make it look like you&#039;re travelling from Real life to League&#039;s World. Here&#039;s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z786fBq5e4&feature=youtu.be) that kinda shows what i mean. Ofc if Riot does this thing they will make it look way better than this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z786fBq5e4&feature=youtu.be), this is just to show you what i meant and i thought i should share my idea with you guys. I hope you like it and **Please take this post seriously.**  | \n|\n|\n\nCheck the video: [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z786fBq5e4&feature=youtu.be)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-05-18T22:36:47.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a player, I liked what I saw.

Additional screen real estate/resolution is extraordinarily valuable, especially for social features.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"yolabas","date":"2016-05-13T13:14:20.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like a good idea... but might not be that practical to implement. It's possible to be really resource intensive (animations are generally more intensive than static images - would have to make sure it's stable for all regions - need to make sure that if the animation fails, it doesn't bugsplat or kick you out of the game - and need to make sure can run on low tech without adding to loading time of the game).\n\nAlso, like with the April Fool's \"everybody is Draven,\" I know a lot of higher level people who grind games because they're competitive and want to get better who found it annoying and distracting (yes, the solution was to toggle that feature off). Things like \"loading videos\" would only make the wait to get from joining queue to on the rift feel longer. A \"tunnel into Runeterra\" type experience might only be cool the first few times and annoying the rest.","replies":[]}]}
