I literally never go afk in games and was having a bad day outside of league. The blitz also inted and trolled until I went afk. I am fine with the chat restriction (it honestly makes you think before you type toxic stuff), but am I no longer eligible for the end of season rewards? I have played league for 3 years and have never been banned and I cant find any concrete answer anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe chat log I was given with my 10 day suspension:\r\n\r\n Game 1\r\nIceBaerg: ..\r\nIceBaerg: how\r\nIceBaerg: are you so bad\r\nIceBaerg: blitz killed himself on purpouse\r\nIceBaerg: well now he is trying to steal cs\r\nIceBaerg: plz repior\r\nIceBaerg: im not putting up with that guys bs\r\nIceBaerg: yep\r\nIceBaerg: report blitz\r\nIceBaerg: as you should\r\nIceBaerg: sure am\r\nIceBaerg: had to put up with trolls for 3 games in a row\r\nIceBaerg: im done for now\r\nIceBaerg: he killed himself and got me killed twice\r\nIceBaerg: and then proceeded to take as much cs as possible\r\nIceBaerg: and?\r\nIceBaerg: why should I have to put up with that asshole\r\nIceBaerg: its 1/8\r\nIceBaerg: and that isnt because I afk'd\r\nIceBaerg: 3 mins til we can ff\r\nIceBaerg: not going to mean much\r\nIceBaerg: me joining the game doesnt change the fact that blitz is trolling\r\nIceBaerg: and the fact that he doesnt deserve the win\r\nIceBaerg: and brand too plz\r\nIceBaerg: so why arent you guys surrendering?\r\nIceBaerg: just wasting your own time\r\nIceBaerg: look if I was still trying to play blitz would have trolled harder and I would have died more giving the other team more cs\r\nIceBaerg: he isnt trolling only because im afk\r\nIceBaerg: im not the one who inted to make his adc go afk\r\nIceBaerg: im not being toxic \r\nIceBaerg: its a dick move on my part to go afk but its way more of a dick move to troll and make that adc go afk\r\nIceBaerg: if someone comes up to you and shoots you and you shoot them back whos at fault\r\nIceBaerg: he sure as  hell did","replies":[{"poster":"Quackas","date":"2017-08-29T18:21:04.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lobbying for reports is considered harassment which falls under verbal abuse.
