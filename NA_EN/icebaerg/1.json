I have been regularly honored by my teammates and haven't been toxic at all. Is it normal to take this long to get back to level 2?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T20:30:25.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may be a bit, yeah.  You recently came off of restrictions, but are making great recovery!  I looked into this for you, and you are in fact steadily gaining honor.  It's not a rapid rate, so you'll want to continue playing honorably and you will get there.  Stay consistent!\n\nConsidering  the restrictions to be unreasonable might not be a beneficial mindset.  You should also hit up the PB team through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so they can give you more context, and not stall your honor or your experience with other players.","replies":[]}]}
