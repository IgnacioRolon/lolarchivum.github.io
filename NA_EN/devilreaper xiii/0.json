It gives you the most raw health, health being one of the greatest defense item because after reaching 100 armor or magic resist, the rest has diminishing returns. Then the warmog's heart passive is what makes warmogs so broken. Being able to soak up a ton of damage is already insanely useful to a teamfight, but being able to flash or get out of combat for a brief second and regen within a matter of seconds to rejoin the fight is insane. It's like garen who does a lot of damage, tanks a lot, but if you don't kill him he can just regen within a few seconds once he gets higher levels of his passive.\n\nPeople saying braum with warmog's does no damage have never been hit by braum as an adc. Sure, braum is not going to burst you down in a few seconds like a zed would, but blow for blow the braum will hurt you a lot especially if you aren't ahead. If you aren't ahead, he will beat you 1v1 and even if you are ahead, you lose for focusing the tank because while you are attacking the tank, their adc and mage are probably killing your squishies. This isn't just braum specifically. Almost all champs scale well with tanky bruiser items. Garen will still do good damage to squishies while building health and resistances with little damage items that are also tank aka black cleaver or titanic hydra etc. Darius has always been known to deal big damage but also be beefy naturally and generally tanky. Irelia same thing. Unless their adc is fed it's hard to take down tanks/bruisers and even if you do take them down, you lose a lot of health fighting them since you are naturally squishy but also lose out on the fight for focusing their tank. But if you ignore them, they can kill you a lot faster than you can kill them because base damage on abilities will always hurt adcs and squishies because base resistances dont help much against base damage of spells. Biggest problem is tank/bruiser items are meant to help you survive longer, but also make you deal more damage because you live longer to attack more and it doesn't cut down on your natural base damage from attacks and abilties. I played tank fizz and i shitted on a fed twitch 1v1 easy. I had warmogs, thornmail, adaptive helm, spirit visage. My base damage along with ignite is more than enough to kill twitch. If we don't all in, I still win in small trades because my q w alone will outburst anything twitch does and twitch is naturally squishy while im building tanky so im hard to kill but also doing lots of damage to twitch.","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2019-07-19T14:22:52.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quite a large response, yet has absolutely nothing to do with the discussion.

Does Thornmail also reflect damage mitigated by other armor (like guardian/noble), or the knight synergy?
