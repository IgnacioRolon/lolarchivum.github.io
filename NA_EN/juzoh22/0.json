Ban appeal?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"So there&#039;s going to be a lot of text, because I do tend to type a lot. Firstly I will say that, I do curse a lot, but there&#039;s a reason for the filter inappropriate language right? If you don&#039;t want to see curse words, etc then just turn that on. (Which is automatically turned on, which I turned off because why would I have that on?) I do want to apologize for these late nights of playing when I might of gotten mad over somethings, but you still have to some what consider the actions of my team mates, which lead to this point. It&#039;s not like I am going to go into a game and right at the start curse at my team mates for no reason. And I know I should try to get better and stay more calm, but in all of these games my team were really toxic towards me and like I said most of these were late night games (which is the only time I get to play) when I tend to get easily mad, especially when 2 of these were my promo games. And trust me out of the many games I play I am usually really positive and I did try to be positive in some of these games, saying stuff like good job even if we had argued and said we can still win this. Even doe those aren&#039;t huge things and aren&#039;t anything that would save my account, I still hope those will some how show that I am not always just full tilt and toxic towards my team mates. And in many of these it wasn&#039;t even my team that I was calling names, etc, but it was the enemy team. (Even thought it isn&#039;t right, I was talking in team chat so anyways the enemy team didn&#039;t see that I might of called them &#039;&#039;bitches&#039;&#039;, etc.) I WILL SAY the most inappropriate thing I said was &#039;&#039;neck yourself&#039;&#039;, and even that isn&#039;t that bad considered what my team mate told me after the game, but still I am sorry for that and I don&#039;t want to start blaming my team mates and enemies for my actions, because I am the reason that I am banned and I need to change, and hopefully if I get a second chance I will be better and try to stay positive what ever happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nJuzoh22: afl\r\nJuzoh22: ?\r\nJuzoh22: y\r\nJuzoh22: lmao\r\nJuzoh22: more damage tab pull\r\nJuzoh22: not pull imean\r\nJuzoh22: LOL\r\nJuzoh22: OAOPGSGDOKSGDO\r\nJuzoh22: OPPS LOL\r\nJuzoh22: FUCK\r\nJuzoh22: ryze what\r\nJuzoh22: still\r\nJuzoh22: imma ward blue\r\nJuzoh22: then gank bot\r\nJuzoh22: yi\r\nJuzoh22: com\r\nJuzoh22: fast\r\nJuzoh22: yi\r\nJuzoh22: yi\r\nJuzoh22: idiot\r\nJuzoh22: wtf\r\nJuzoh22: i said\r\nJuzoh22: come gank\r\nJuzoh22: ??????\r\nJuzoh22: do u not read chat\r\nJuzoh22: I know\r\nJuzoh22: mf\r\nJuzoh22: dont push\r\nJuzoh22: wave\r\nJuzoh22: let them push\r\nJuzoh22: yi gank bot\r\nJuzoh22: auto minions\r\nJuzoh22: stop\r\nJuzoh22: we freeze wave\r\nJuzoh22: stop\r\nJuzoh22: yeh\r\nJuzoh22: i know\r\nJuzoh22: i said freeze\r\nJuzoh22: wait\r\nJuzoh22: wait\r\nJuzoh22: ffs\r\nJuzoh22: what a mess\r\nJuzoh22: why even go attack there\r\nJuzoh22: do u not know how to freeze wave mf\r\nJuzoh22: cmon\r\nJuzoh22: watch out\r\nJuzoh22: ulti\r\nJuzoh22: mf\r\nJuzoh22: the fuck u mean\r\nJuzoh22: I mean carrying this bot and mid so much\r\nJuzoh22: mf u should watch high elo streams\r\nJuzoh22: then u will learn that there are 2 types of supports\r\nJuzoh22: roaming support\r\nJuzoh22: and lane supports\r\nJuzoh22: i am a roaming support\r\nJuzoh22: u dont know how to play safe?\r\nJuzoh22: ryuze\r\nJuzoh22: ur not doing anything\r\nJuzoh22: dude\r\nJuzoh22: again\r\nJuzoh22: jeez this elo hell\r\nJuzoh22: mf ur a bad adc\r\nJuzoh22: renekton\r\nJuzoh22: we gotta carry\r\nJuzoh22: no joke\r\nJuzoh22: these guys are rarted\r\nJuzoh22: shut up mf\r\nJuzoh22: no ones in bot\r\nJuzoh22: idiot\r\nJuzoh22: mf\r\nJuzoh22: I main support and bot\r\nJuzoh22: idiot\r\nJuzoh22: baited to what? lmao\r\nJuzoh22: ur the one with 3 deaths?\r\nJuzoh22: x) what\r\nJuzoh22: ur a bad adc\r\nJuzoh22: not really\r\nJuzoh22: so bad mf\r\nJuzoh22: yeh\r\nJuzoh22: cuz u do nothing\r\nJuzoh22: I DO MORE DAMAGE THEN UR DUMBASS\r\nJuzoh22: amazing team fight\r\nJuzoh22: so good\r\nJuzoh22: ?\r\nJuzoh22: what\r\nJuzoh22: ?\r\nJuzoh22: actually could of gotten penta feelsbadman\r\nJuzoh22: get it then\r\nJuzoh22: GO\r\nJuzoh22: FAST\r\nJuzoh22: nice farm mf\r\nJuzoh22: LOL\r\nJuzoh22: ?\r\nJuzoh22: is g\r\nJuzoh22: i am an escape artist\r\nJuzoh22: why didnt u do it before?\r\nJuzoh22: 10 cs per min\r\nJuzoh22: is a goal\r\nJuzoh22: ur cs is garbage\r\nJuzoh22: mf\r\nJuzoh22: u cant blame ur support for ur shitty cs\r\nJuzoh22: i am not going to farm for u\r\nJuzoh22: LOL\r\nJuzoh22: not my fault u suck at farming\r\nJuzoh22: what 2v1?\r\nJuzoh22: FUCKING PUSHM ID\r\nJuzoh22: IT IS THREESH\r\nJuzoh22: ALONE\r\nJuzoh22: WTF\r\nJuzoh22: U GUYS DOING\r\nJuzoh22: i am bout to have a stroke watching my adc play\r\nJuzoh22: ???\r\nJuzoh22: xayah is good\r\nJuzoh22: u should be thanking her thresh\r\nJuzoh22: carried ur arses in bot\r\nJuzoh22: see my adc stats\r\nJuzoh22: FUCKING USELESS MF\r\nJuzoh22: Like i said\r\nJuzoh22: fucking uselses\r\nJuzoh22: yeh lol\r\nJuzoh22: or lg\r\nJuzoh22: shut up mf\r\nJuzoh22: what are u? like 6 years old?\r\nJuzoh22: stop crying\r\nJuzoh22: grow a pair\r\nJuzoh22: how\r\nJuzoh22: yi\r\nJuzoh22: please\r\nJuzoh22: LETS GO\r\nJuzoh22: GO GO GO\r\nJuzoh22: ez baron\r\nJuzoh22: they not any where near\r\nJuzoh22: free baron? ty\r\nJuzoh22: yes?\r\nJuzoh22: ty\r\nJuzoh22: ok?

We are all the time &#039;&#039;what the fuck&#039;&#039;, &#039;&#039;fuck that&#039;&#039;, &#039;&#039;why the fuck&#039;&#039;, etc. So I mean can you really blame for that? I suppose I should probably try to not say it as much huh... And I never said anything racist or actually something that could offend someone. Maybe &#039;&#039;bitch&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039; neck yourself&#039;&#039; might be something that can offend someone. But I really doubt anyone actually got offended, and considering how much I got disrespected and there being no consequences towards them I find it odd. And as the reasoning for my ban said &#039;&#039; Review found your in-game comms extremely inflammatory and offensive, your account&#039;s been permanently suspended.&#039;&#039;, I can agree with the &#039;&#039;extremely inflammatory&#039;&#039; in a way when I told my team mates to shut up or I called them bitches or when I said fuck you. But I really still don&#039;t see what might I said was that offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you if you actually took the time to read the text I wrote and glanced at the in game chat log. Like I said before I am really sorry to who ever got offended by what I said, and I hope to get a second chance to reform myself. \r\n\r\n{{champion:555}}","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2018-12-21T23:43:20.084+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You had a second chance, your 14 day ban.

That is the point of permabanning though, while it won't work on some people in general people who have a lot of stuff on their accs will feel bad for losing it all, which sort of ''encourages'' to reform to not have the same stuff occur again. \n\nLowering your report level takes a long while, there is no estimation for it but it certainly takes hell of a lot of games.\n\nI'd say take a break from League. Do some fun stuff for a week or two at least. and come back refreshed with a fresh mindset.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"World peace plz","date":"2018-12-21T23:58:35.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Were you even playing those games ?

Inciting self-harm, racism, and homophobia are all zero-tolerance and based on that alone you really don't deserve to get your account back. If I could look past everything else you've said, this is the one thing hanging me up. It may not be a big deal to you but it's definitely not socially acceptable to say things like that. You know what it could lead to and you know it's not right.\n\n As for everything else: You had multiple chances to reform and didn't act on them. I don't think many players deserve appeals in the first place, and this is one of those cases. You were insanely negative all throughout your games, calling out scores, calling people useless, calling people bitches, ragging on people's scores if they were negative, the list goes on and on.\n\n You can start a new account, but even before doing that I would suggest taking a break from League because nobody wants a player acting like this on their team.","replies":[{"poster":"Juzoh22","date":"2018-12-22T12:58:15.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I have to agree with a lot of the things you said, but especially the ''neck urself'' compared to something like ''I will fucking find you and kill you'', is pretty mild and I said it after the player even left the lobby so it couldn't have lead to anything.
