These script bot accounts are ones that are sold for around 5 dollars to players that were banned. Riot wants you to be inconvenienced by this and they want botter accounts in their game modes which is why they have the policy of banning accounts and forcing level requirements for game modes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-12-10T15:11:37.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's quite a predicament for co-op vs AI.\n\nIn PvP, leveling scripts are likely to lose, so human players can in theory win more than they lose, increase their MMR past what a script could attain, and then no longer see any more of those scripts. Co-op vs AI, however, doesn't have MMR at all - which makes perfect sense, given that one team is always of a preset \"skill\" level anyway. It just takes five players and sticks them together, whether they're level 1, level 100, or taking a break from their LCS scrims. It is thus not just a problem for new accounts, it's a problem for anyone who wants to play the mode at all.\n\nI went through your match history and counted 15 leveling scripts (I considered the AFK to be a script, as it was likely just broken) in 9 matches. That's 15 out of 36 accounts, or about 42%. To underscore the severity of this figure, that number (0.42) to the fifth power is the frequency with which a match is _entirely_ populated by bots: about 1%. It would be bad enough if 1% of co-op matches had _one or more_ leveling scripts in them. Of course, you won't personally see these matches, but they're around.\n\nUnless a scripter is dumb enough to script one account 24 hours a day (which I have seen before and managed to get banned via support ticket), it can be hard to detect this stuff reliably, without false positives, and without causing scripters to improve their tactics/scripts. Still, it'd be nice if Riot at least acknowledged the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"smerfkungfu","date":"2019-12-12T00:52:38.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"scripters just buy accounts for like $2 so they can script as much as they want to get repeat when banned sadly nothing we can be done to combat this other then banning them at ip level then just just use a vpn so in the end your just playing cat and mouse","replies":[]}]}
