I picked this song because I thought it symbolized when you do pick a role or champion that isn't in the current Meta and people just rage and yell at you but you plug your ears and you go, \"La La La!\" and then you carry them! So don't be afraid to try new things but at the same time don't rage at people and stay calm and remember to always have fun!","replies":[{"poster":"Dragon Fang Shot","date":"2014-08-24T23:07:23.450+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I absolutely love jungle Diana.

Meta doesn't seem to matter much to the pros but when you get people who want to be a pro and follow the meta thats when it gets to this way. Went and faced a Yasuo with a Swain the other day. Loved the out come. Yasuo has proven a really good match up against a lot of **meta** champs but because of my ult and abilities he couldn't even scratch my turrent. Took 2 to 3 ganks with sometimes more than 2 people to get me, lol. I mean Swain is OP but he is weak to most other champs like Ahri, Malzahar, Veigar, etc. So it was just too funny to see him put up \"Swains ult needs an nerf\" more than once. True though his ult is crazy but it drains his mana drastically. And to think his ult was no better with the constant wind gusts and ults he did i had to use mine more than wanted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thatgirlsarah","date":"2014-08-25T08:23:19.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome video!
