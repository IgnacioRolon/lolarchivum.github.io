This should force your entire in-game chat to reset, allowing your Chat window to appear in its default location.  Follow these steps very carefully:\n\nNavigate to the following location of your League of Legends installation:\n\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\[Latest Release Version]\\deploy\\DATA\\menu\\hud\n\nOnce inside the \"hud\" folder, you should see several different files, such as chat.ini.  Make sure to completely delete all of these files found in this folder.\n\nThe next time that you load into a game of League of Legends, your chat box should appear normally!  If you are still unable to see it, even after double-checking you completed these steps properly, then please do not hesitate to let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"360 ooga booga","date":"2016-07-16T01:10:23.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I followed your instructions but in the DATA folder there was no Menu folder or Hud folder/file.\n\nIs there any other way ?
