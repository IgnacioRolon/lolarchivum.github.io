I guess I am not the only one who is getting hurt by this. Generally, players stop swearing with such things quite quickly. However last match I had a dutch guy in my team, Anieshuli, swearing with the dutch word for cancer. I told him I knew what he was saying, because I&#039;m dutch too. I told him to stop calling out cancer, or kanker, for what it&#039;s called in the netherlands. But he refused. So well, I gave him a reason to stop. My mother died of cancer recently, and it&#039;s still very painfull evry time I think of it. Sorrowly, this player was big enough of a jerk to not care about it. I reported him in the end, but as we all know, that does nothing. I don&#039;t know what to do with something like that. It can&#039;t just be. However there&#039;s no way of punishing people like this either. So back to the title-question: What do I do? I hope someone knows. Goodbye.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-01-31T18:53:34.018+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trust me, reporting does something.

These kinds of conversations among team mates should be brought to justice compared to swearing casually or like I said in a competitive fashion. I don't mean to sound too morbid but I wouldn't be surprised if one day someone did just off themselves from a LoL game. I'm not saying the blood will be on Riots hands but I am saying that it's not impossible to tweak the robot and act harsher on death threats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-02-01T04:49:51.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cant the message that someone got reported show up more often? \nin my last game i had that \"i hope you get cancer\" guy and after my report i was waiting for the message to appear telling me he got banned but nothing happened.\n\nif you would \"save\" my report and lets say if this player gets banned in the next 48h the message would appear that would be great!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrisisEchoes","date":"2016-02-01T03:33:18.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naming and shaming op.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-01-31T20:09:17.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny sometimes because sometimes the feeder on the team is just the guy getting punished the most by the enemy team and isn't the person making the horrible call that gets everyone massacred in the reoccurring snowball.\n\nA lot of the worst players on a losing team are instatilt ragers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokedAlmonds","date":"2016-01-31T15:43:00.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What makes you say nothing happened.
