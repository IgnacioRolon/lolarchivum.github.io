You gonna look like the biggest scripter ever, was this intentional? No, but its the way skillshot and the champs are made. Its retarded fighting a good player who knows how to land every DANG cast. Idk if its just how skillshot champs are made to be but its kinda obscured. Does anyone ever felt this before? getting their A%# whooped by champs made like that?\n\nPeople that say every champ is skillshot, not all are, like nunu, pantheon, mordekaiser, darius.\n\nLike real skillshot champs like ezreal, velkoz, brand.
