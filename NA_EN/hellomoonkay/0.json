The only thing I can get out of it, is that they want him to be the most toxic support ever. You took away his movespeed and a lot of his burst that allows him to exist in a solo lane, mid especially. You said it&#039;s bad gameplay that he punishes the enemy team for doing well by taking their carry, and now you make it last even longer! He NEEDS another champion in order to use his w, meaning he literally gets no use out of it until AFTER he kills someone with his ult. To top it off, now the immobile ccless dueler has to hit his q THREE times in order to deal it&#039;s actual damage. Considering his target is the adc, and almost all have some sort of escape, or cc, this will never happen, meaning he is completely reliant on his team.\r\n\r\nThe only conclusion is that you&#039;re telling me to go steal cs from my adc by pretending to be a support, and hoping the other lanes are strong enough,  with CC to be able to help you steal the now fed enemy adc. That is literally the exact opposite of what a Morde player wants, and the exact opposite of what you already said you wanted for the character. \r\n\r\nYou somehow made changes even worse than your past attempts when you wanted him to build health for damage. I&#039;d much prefer to have that change, because at least Morde would still play like Morde, just with different items. If these changes go through, I see pretty much no reason to keep playing league, since over half of my games I play as Morde. You destroyed my other favorite champ, Veigar, after I bought the legendary skin, please don&#039;t ruin my main since I discovered him back in the Vladamir patch!","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-08-07T23:51:33.261+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't want him to be a support.\n\nThey want him to replace the ADC in bot lane, with someone supporting him.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellomoonkay","date":"2015-08-07T23:53:18.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NemeBro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=a3mEXogd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-07T23:51:33.261+0000)\n>\n> They don't want him to be a support.\n> \n> They want him to replace the ADC in bot lane, with someone supporting him.\n\nDid they actually say that, or is it just funny?","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-08-07T23:59:25.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hellomoonkay,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=a3mEXogd,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-07T23:53:18.747+0000)\n>\n> Did they actually say that, or is it just funny?\n\nYes, they said that.\n\nThey want Mordekaiser to be the stand-in for an ADC bot lane, with a support.\n\nFor some reason they decided to nerf almost everything about him in the process.","replies":[{"poster":"NapaIm","date":"2015-08-08T00:12:17.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NemeBro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=a3mEXogd,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2015-08-07T23:59:25.764+0000)\n>\n> Yes, they said that.\n> \n> They want Mordekaiser to be the stand-in for an ADC bot lane, with a support.\n> \n> For some reason they decided to nerf almost everything about him in the process.\n\n\"They\" you mean Bradford \"CertainlyToxic\" Wenban.\n\nI think I know the real reason he is behind the morde rework.

Everything about it is a huge contradiction.\n\nHe needs to farm, but now it's impossible to farm alone because Q isnt aoe, and you can't even use w, along with nerfed damage on E. You make it harder to kill the enemy to use his ult, but increase the reward, leading to either you completely dominate with him, or you will be useless all game long, which is fun for no one.  And I can't even say anything more, I'm just too upset.

It takes longer to hit, but seeing as Mordekaiser builds {{item:3116}} on his AP and {{item:3078}} {{item:3742}} on his AD builds, it's not -that- hard getting it to apply. It also does obscene damage, but I think it needs to be toned down and some damage returned to his E, because even with a good chunk of AP it feels very weak. Try getting a {{item:3100}} on AP Kaiser; he can get a lot of damage added onto his combo if you weave the sheen procs \n\nW feels so bad to use I refuse to level it at all until level 13. I'm not taking him bot.\n\nE is basically just a filler skill because CertainlyT wouldn't be allowed to remove it without Mord players getting more pissed than they already have. \n\nI don't know why they're making his issue with his ult even worse. Too much power is locked in it, and then they go and put MORE power in it.\n\nOverall this rework just falls flat. Especially with the fact that they take him bot and then when he finds a build to circumvent being kited to fuck-all, he gets his movement speed nerfed, squishier early, etc. Being bot makes zero sense for his identity and it doesn't even mesh with the rework that's trying to force him there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellomoonkay","date":"2015-08-08T00:12:34.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that does change it a little bit, but my points still stand that he needs his movement speed, even beyond just the magnet. And you know everyone on your team is gonna get mad when you pick adc Morde, or w/e you want to call it. My main concern is that I've always loved him being the 1v1 king, even if they pick a supposed counter, like Kayle, it's always possible to use your high movespeed to do a lot of mind games, constantly moving around and making sure they only hit your shield. I'll try out the new Morde as carry on the pbe, and see how it goes, but I still have a lot of doubts. I would be fine with the changes mostly if they gave his 15 movespeed back.\n\nIn fact, just give us back Creeping Death, except with the experience buff still intact, and his movespeed, and make it so that rageblade and gunblade don't cost so damn much, and there's a small chance this could work out with the ad ratio on E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"stuartk11","date":"2015-08-07T23:52:37.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of ADCs can avoid most of your Qs damage pretty easily.\n\nBy walking away with their higher movement speed.\n\nDon't you love picking a champion to actually not play the game.

Otherwise, cause I know you will still play the game, then that means in everyone's eyes you are acknowledging they are right and they will clean the sweat out of their foreheads and will simply move on like nothing ever happened.\n\nThis Morde is utter shit, and this update will doom him forever. This updates is just making him worse. Like I mentioned in another thread. Updates are to make things more balanced and better, not butcher an already awesome and fun to play champion.\n\nOld Morde is hell fun to play as hence why I'm a main since S3. New Morde is not fun. Being handicapped is not fun, being bitchslapped relentlessly and helplessly is not fun.\n\nI need to know what makes the New Morde better than the old and more fun to play as. Yeah, nothing.\n\nThis is a mass scale downgrade update and there's no reason to play as him anymore. Saying this is his new healthy home is the stupidest thing I've hear in a while.","replies":[]}]}
