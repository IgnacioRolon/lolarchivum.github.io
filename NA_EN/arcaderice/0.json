Everyone surrenders (it has a delay) and you last-hit the enemy nexus. The camera would hover for a second on their nexus before rushing back to the team, saying that you lose. A pretty fun way, actually. Did it last Christmas, where you would give free wins in ranked with your friends and say \"Merry Christmas\" afterwards.\n\nAnd yes, I'd completely understand if they would report me for actual disgust to what I said, I'm just hoping for a chat restriction instead of a 14-day ban.

Typing any form of hate/offensive speech, even in the context of a joke can get you banned. The AI doesn't have a sense of humor, it only sees the words you type. \n\nEdit: I would also recommend keeping any overly vulgar banter out of the in-game chats.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcadeRice","date":"2018-12-16T01:44:29.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I guess you're right with that.
