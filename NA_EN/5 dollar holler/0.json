For instance, some people really hate toxic players. Would I prefer not to encounter one? Yes. But I personally am able to just press the mute button and get on with my life. Not a big deal to me, I've played games long enough that I'm numb to 15 year old kids screaming in caps.\n\nThere's no one button that resolves someone who leaves the match and you're in a 4v5.

That's way worse to me, but on the other hand I know players who assume the best \"well he must have had to run outside because his dog was hit by a bus.\"\n\nThis is why it varies on circumstance. This may be entirely true for you, but there are players out there who would rather have someone leave and know the game is likely a write-off than mute an abuse-spewing asshole and know that if they win they've given that guy a win. Sure, you still play to win, but it deflates the victory somewhat. Additionally, sometimes someone *does* have an emergency -- I don't leave games much but, when I do, it's almost always cause something awful game up IRL. While I appreciate that's really unfortunate for the other players in those games, does it really make me a worse addition to the *League* experience than someone who harasses their teammates?\n\nMaybe you say yes. Maybe you say no. Maybe you say yes, but *only for that game*.

I dislike leavers, so I'm always conscious of my queue behavior. I don't play ranked when it's thunderstorming. I don't play unless I'm certain I'll be free for the next 60 minutes. When my PC was encountering some stability issues, I didn't play ranked at all until I resolved it, same when I lived in an area with a shaky connection, didn't play ranked for a few months. The result is that I've never left a ranked match early over the several years that I've been playing.\n\nOf course, if I had a true 911 type emergency that can't be foreseen, that can't be planned. However, I also suspect the majority of people who leave are doing so less because of emergencies and more because of things like getting called for dinner and they knew in advance they didn't have enough time to play (real example that a teammate stated in chat before leaving 15 minutes into the game).","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-07-28T14:30:30.652+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=5 Dollar Holler,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JfgNq6zy,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-28T14:19:51.857+0000)I dislike leavers, so I'm always conscious of my queue behavior. \n\nSame, but somethings things happen.

Because they subscribe to a twisted idea that inting is somehow more intentional than INTENTIONALLY ignoring reasonable criticism of your play, just because all you care about is doing what you want over playing for your team. What's worse about these kinds of players is that firstly Riot doesn't put any effort into a system that would penalize them for misconduct. Secondly and lastly, bad players are worse than even AFKers since AFKers at least give you a chance to funnel XP to less teammates which in lower elo gives a slight chance for you to carry. A consistently bad player however, will be constantly providing enemies with more resources while also depleting yours without being impactful.
