Double check your client options and make sure it's set to run at the same resolution that your pc is set to and that should work!\n\nIf that doesn't help, we can try resetting those config settings back to default by following these steps.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"KitKatGaming12","date":"2017-11-02T04:22:37.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi again! thank you for helping but sadly it didn't work, when i made the resolution the same as my pc it didn't work and had the same problem, when i tried deleting the config folder it still didn't work. is there anything else i can try? or is my computer not compatable with league of legends?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T04:28:35.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm I'm sure it's not that you're pc isn't compatible.
