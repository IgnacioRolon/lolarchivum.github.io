Eventually NEO tires of the game, and sends Agent Smith flying with a swift and powerful kick.\n\nWouldn't it be great, if a bully was attacking you, if you could actively block or deflect every single punch? Every single attack? Without ever hitting back? The 'real world' doesn't work like the matrix, unless you've studied martial arts your entire life (maybe not even then). But LEAGUE can work like this. NEO dying is like that first barrage of toxicity. But then, you just hit the MUTE button and now you're like NEO coming back, stopping bullets, and effortlessly BLOCKING all incoming attacks. That's 'true' DEFENSE. \n\nYou might point out that our hero NEO gets to fight back with that wicked Lee Sin kick that sends Agent Smith careening down the hall, and Neo ultimately wins the fight and continues on to the sequels. And you'd be right. And YOU get to do that too! REPORT that offending player. That's the kick. It'll up their chances of being punished. That's winning the fight.\n\nLike Agent Smith and NEO, you and the toxic player will probably be back for the sequels (i.e. playing more games of league).

Everything that you'd _have_ to see to be able to understand it and know whether it's good or bad is stuff _you can't see_.\n\nAnd lastly, you may not need to be an artist to know bad art, but you kinda do need to have a degree of understanding of coding to know faulty code when you see it.
