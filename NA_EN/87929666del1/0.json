Every game I suffer from time to time lag akin to ping spikes, but my ping stays in relatively normal levels so I know the screen didn't freeze with ping. Sometimes I lag for 5 or so seconds this hasnt happened before EVER! ive been playing for 2 years its this related to the problems you been having ?? The disruptions caused by the live maintenance? Are you still having issues? beacause during that time i did not have any issues at all after the small update i got this wierd non existent lag with normal ping","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T22:22:52.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it sounds like you're getting some crazy packet loss.  :(  Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) on these impacted games so we can get an analysis of your specific case.
