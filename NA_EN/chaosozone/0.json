Every time I go to update to the beta client, when I load the game, send me to a \"Send an error\" screen, and It says \"Re-install the Alpha client.\" Every time, I have re-install the game, and sit here for a few hours waiting for it to download. If anyone has any idea how to fix it, Id highly appreciate it, because no one else has this issue.  Thanks in advance for anyone that has advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T03:46:13.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error crops up if there was an issue with the patching or upgrade process. You should be able to resolve this by first heading to your installation directory (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and deleting the file named **LeagueClient.exe**. After deleting this file, launch League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (right-click, *run as administrator*) and then attempt the upgrade process again.\n\nLet me know if this worked!","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosOzone","date":"2017-02-24T04:12:21.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That worked! I thank you so much! Now, will I have to run it as an admin everytime, or should It be fine running it through the client?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-26T23:10:29.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be best to create a shortcut for the admin shortcut, but you're clear to launch the client normally until you run into an issue. ^.^","replies":[]}]}]}]}
