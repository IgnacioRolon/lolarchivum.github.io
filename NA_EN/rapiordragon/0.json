For me, the particles were barely visible, but when I turned it up, my client keeps on crashing and it will not reload. I keep on pressing reconnect, but it just keeps on reporting the same thing over again.\n\nRight now, I am just asking for anyone that could help me fix it or help my graphics go down from outside the game cause now I cannot play a game of League at all. My name is RapiorDragon if anyone can help me inside the game.\n\nThank you for whoever helps me on this XP.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-22T02:03:25.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those graphics settings miiiiiight not be the actual problem here tbh. We've had a few issues with ghost games lately, which happen because the game never tells your client that the game finished. Since your client thinks you're still in a game, it tries to reconnect you but there's no game....cue sad loop.\n\nThese ghost games will clear up after enough time, but sometimes they can take 2-3 hours or longer in extreme cases. Have you been able to get out of this loop yet?","replies":[{"poster":"RapiorDragon","date":"2017-09-24T02:23:47.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's been like 3 days since this happened and I tried to use another computer and logged into my account. I entered practice tool as a test and I got into the game no problem!\n\nI'm not sure if it's supposed to last this long, but since it worked on another computer, does the ghost games only happen on one computer the originally played on and crashed on for the ghost game and doesn't effect other computers.\n\nWhen I last played, I tried to raise the effects qualities, but it suddenly crashed on me. Then you know the whole story of when I try to reconnect afterward, I can't even enter the game saying there's a bugsplat or something.\n\nI've tried troubleshooting and lowering my fps, but it isn't working. Please help me more. I'm sorry if I'm being an annoyance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T00:48:27.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird.....if this was truly an issue with a ghost game then you would *not* have been able to play on a different pc. You may actually be right about the graphics settings messing things up, so let's go ahead and test that as well. Run through these steps, and let me know if this helps any better or not!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"RapiorDragon","date":"2017-09-25T22:43:47.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
