I have played so many games, for well over a month now, and  have seemed to not get any key fragments. I have saved up around six chests, but i never get any key fragments. Ive been waiting quite a long time and have still yet to get a fragment. I know you have to win games to get one, but ive won a lot of games. So is it an extremely low drop chance, or am i very unlucky?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T03:33:51.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually don't have to win games to earn key fragments, but playing with others in a premade actually *slightly raises your chances* of a drop. The droprate for key fragments is actually more of a curve rather than a line, which means that your chances of the next drop are decreased by every single drop, exponentially. This droprate resets approximately 30 days after the first fragment dropped. More about this in our [**Hextech Crafting Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).\n\nYou should start seeing some keys fairly soon, after taking a look at your account and the last few key fragment drops.
