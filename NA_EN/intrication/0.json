Please check your internet connection and try again.\"\r\n\r\nObviously you can't play without internet, but here's the thing. The Internet connection was fine!!!\r\n\r\nAfter repeatedly trying to login and out of the game, i kept getting this error. Finally, decided to restart the computer because once the client seems to bug like this, that's the only solution. After restarting, the game starts working again. As i get into the character screen, the game dies again. But this time, it's because the team did a remake, leaving me in the end screen. while this is fine, its not fine that i lost 14-LP for not being able to connect. It also doesn't matter that its a low amount of LP for this. The reason being, the fault isn't on my end, the fault is on the creators end. \r\n\r\nRiot what am I to do about this and how are you going to fix this?  This is not the first time this has happen, and it's very frustrating and irritating especially since the community is fairly toxic. Please do something about this. Please. \r\n\r\nIntrication","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-05T22:13:18.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds super frustrating, and it sucks you lost some LP as a result.  :/  For now, I don't recommend queuing for any games and sticking to custom games while troubleshooting this.  \n\nI know you say your internet is fine, but actually it sounds like you have a pretty unstable connection that's failing to download assets (black screen) and reach the game server.  Before anything else, I highly recommend going over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.
