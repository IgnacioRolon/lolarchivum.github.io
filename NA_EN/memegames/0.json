I don&#039;t think I deserve this ban, but  there is something that Riot should fix. Matchmaking, harsher punishments to trolls, and auto fill. \r\n\r\nNow why do I bring up auto fill? It&#039;s because every other game when I get my role, people either beg or force their way to steal my role because of autofill. Sometimes, like adc roles, people who are autofilled adc tends to lock in a mid lane. For example, I was going to go Annie mid but the adc banned Annie. I was ok with that because I had other champs to play, but then he or she decided to lock in Yasuo. I&#039;ve seen some Yasuo adcs before so I let it slide. But when it was my turn, this Yasuo then tells me to go adc (which I don&#039;t play). So I got pretty tilted and tried to go adc which didn&#039;t work out and we lost the game. When people cry about it, they always complain about it saying we are going to lose because they didn&#039;t get the roles that they wanted, creating a bad mindset in game for others. \r\n\r\nRiot should implement harsher punishments on trolls. In bronze/silver, many people tend to have a little too much fun and troll the team. Someone would run down mid or sit at base dancing. People like these needs an instant week ban. Toxic players are created from trolls. Many people can agree to this. The main reason why someone is toxic is most likely because someone is trolling. If Riot tracks down trolls, I guarantee, a lot of toxic players will be less common than now. Personally from playing this game and other MOBAs, this is probably the most toxic community out of all of the others. \r\n\r\nMatchmaking can affect gameplay too. There should be a 3 league rank gap for people to duo in. For example, A silver 3 with a bronze 1. Not a silver 5 with a bronze 4. This messes up match making and also ruins gameplay for the lower rank duo and others around. The lower rank duo will not learn anything by being carried while losing lane and sometimes will not understand how certain elos play. Having this 3 rank gap will certainly effect others with better gameplay and equally sided matchup. \r\n\r\nIf Riot takes the time to do the 3 rank gap, have harsher punishments on trolls, and fix autofill, this game will become less toxic and a more enjoyable game.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\nI would like to know your opinions on Riot&#039;s ban\r\n\r\n-**MemeGames**\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}\r\n\r\nEDIT: Most of these games were filled with trolls and other toxic players.","replies":[{"poster":"ElementalPixel","date":"2016-12-28T04:04:50.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"I think your ban is unjust, Riot never bans the trolls. #UNBANMEMEGAMES","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-12-28T04:11:56.578+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"They didn't even go over why they were punished.
