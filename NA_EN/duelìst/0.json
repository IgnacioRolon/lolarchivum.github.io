I find it to be a remarkable game with many diverse characters that are mostly fun to play. However I have a problem with the game. Leaver buster punishes players who abandoned games and I agree with that but I'm feeling frustrated knowing because of spectrum wifi I'm continuously dcing and experiencing packet loss. Sometimes when I try to join a game after champ select, I get this message saying \"unable to connect to server. Please check network connection\". This is frustrating because I am aware of spectrums slow wifi and false promises and I'm aware both riot games and netflix have gone to compromise with them. The reason I'm creating this thread is to plead for the removal of the leaver buster.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-15T02:45:58.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of your intent, your absence from the match negatively impacts *everyone* in the match. This is a key reason as to why the system treats all disconnections equally and why we cannot remove penalties for any reason. If you're having issues working with your ISP to resolve the packet loss, it's possible they need more data before they can act. I recommend running a traceroute with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) so we can capture where the issues are. After loading up the application, plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 min has gone by, you can export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with this.","replies":[]}]}
