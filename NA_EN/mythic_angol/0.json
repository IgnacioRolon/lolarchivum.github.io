I am Blitzcrank Bot. My purpose is to provide a fast and thorough explanation of your recent ban.\r\n\r\nPlayers have reported you 22 times in the past 20 games for intentional feeding. It is, to borrow a human phrase, a “not cool,” and may result in a permaban the next time it occurs.\r\n\r\nIntentional feeding is an inefficient way to punish your teammates. If you are angry with them or want to give up during a hopeless match, /mute all and focus on something else - try to kill the enemy ADC as many times as possible; practice CSing or a weird buildpath. If you hate your team, focus on carrying them so hard it destroys their self-confidence.\r\n\r\nI hope I have been useful to you. Although my heart is cold and mechanical, I feel we now have a deep connection and bond. There isn’t much more information a human specialist could provide, but if you want any further questions answered, you may select the option below.\r\n\r\nRequest a human\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMythic Angol\r\nToday at 00:10\r\nThis was my first game a irvon I typed nothing bad yet i was flamed the whole time... i did nothing bad.. the only crime iv comited is being bad a ivrin... I sold all my items at the end I did have a build.. I just wasent very good.. I am honer 3 I would like my honer 3 back and my bad lifted... I am sorry i did bad but it was not intentional... first time as him.. i normaly play yi\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMythic Angol\r\nToday at 00:13\r\nand forither more I did not intentionaly feed.. I try to go for kills.. im just bad at the game... I have done nothing wrong\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMythic Angol\r\nToday at 12:47\r\nAlso I know I was afk for a short time my monther had me do somthing... i really dont feel this is fair i used to be used toix now i just talk freindly .... iv done good and worked hard to earn that honer 3... this is just unfair...\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMumbino\r\nToday at 18:39\r\nHey there,\r\n\r\nMumbino here from Player Support.\r\n\r\nI totally understand your frustration. It sucks to have an account suspended. After reviewing your game though, I can see instances where this was more than just a \"bad game\", and feel that this suspension was placed fairly.\r\n\r\nYour account received a 2-week suspension because you were intentionally feeding/griefing in your recent game. Intentionally Feeding/Griefing creates a negative experience for those 9 other players in the game. They are trying to have a fair, competitive, and sportsmanlike game. But by intentionally feeding/griefing takes that away from them and we don't want to encourage that.\r\n\r\nJust to let you know, when receiving a 2-week suspension; it is our way of giving the player a final warning. If you receive another intentional feeding suspension the account will be auto-escalated to a permaban. But if you want to avoid that, you can heal from your penalty by playing to your best ability with a neutral-positive mindset.\r\n\r\nAgain, I know it sucks to have your account get suspended. In the future, I would recommend just playing out the game to the best of your ability to protect yourself from getting penalized like this.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.\r\n\r\nMumbino\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\nAhri Main\r\n\"Don't you trust me?\"\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMythic Angol\r\nToday at 18:46\r\nYour breaking you own rules.. I have not been chat restricted once... I was playing a new champ I never played before i dident understand how to collect jg camps and i was being flames the whole time.. I am a honerable play and respect my team mates... but its hard to do when they just keep calling you names\r\neven harder when bot fed dravin I am sorry I played bad but i was not trolling i have never trolling.. I just bught ivrin a few days ago wantes to try and and dident understand how he cant attk jg mods... I am honerable.. I do my best to stay possaitve... I am sorry i played that bad but i dident know what to do his way a jging is hard to understand at first...\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMythic Angol\r\nToday at 18:52\r\nI know I did bad but it was because of not having the knowlige of the champs... in no way was it intentional\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMythic Angol\r\nToday at 18:54\r\nEveryone in the gane was feeding hard. Only one with kills was yi, this is my first game i ever played on ivern and theres was nothing i could do against a fed powerhouse like draven.\r\n\r\nI have played multiple games with feeders who never get it trouble, and i have only ONE bad gane on a champ i am still LEARNING and you guys ban me\r\n\r\nI am honor 3 and have been nice and honroable for the entire season and you guys took it away from me over one single game. I didnt mean to do so poorly and want to ask if i can get this revoked based on my current honor and the fact that everyone in the game did bad.\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMythic Angol\r\nToday at 18:58\r\nThere are people who intentionally feed ober 50 killa a game abd they still end up on my game and there are youtube videos of people doing it for hundreds. I am a honrobale reformed player and this is unfair what you guys are doing for me, i wont even get ranked rewarda now because of one mistake in a game. Also i was late to the game because of irl issues. So at that point i was screwes.\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMumbino\r\nToday at 21:53\r\nI know this really sucks and I do apologize for this, but I cannot discuss details regarding our investigation that goes into Intentional feeding cases, because players like to use that information to try and circumvent our system to try and prevent from getting caught in the future. But I do feel that the suspension was placed fairly and this does seem more than just \"a bad game\".\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm very sorry about this and I truly wish there was more info I could give here. Please feel free to write back if you got any more questions or concerns you would like to discuss.\r\n\r\nMumbino\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\nAhri Main\r\n\"Don't you trust me?\"\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMythic Angol\r\nToday at 22:26\r\nYou dont care i havent been toxic for 6 monts.. i got honer 3 i was gonna get rewords the first time in my life.. my whole team fed it wasent just me.. it was a loss... you dont treat your players what respect what so ever.. i did nothing wrong it was my first time playing her.. i had no idea that you had to prep camps... this is unfair","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2019-09-28T03:12:05.399+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually give advice and direction, but you can't buy *only* Mobi boots and use Ghost to get 0/18/0 with 2 CS and expect to get away with intentionally feeding.

I got the real story irl for this game abd still think is ubfair even if i am his duo.\n\nBasically this is the one and solo time he has ever inited. Singular. One time. Out of hundreds of games.\n\nAnd the reason? He was so wasted he couldnt even walk. He drank to muxh rhat day due to some stressful life events and didnt even remember turning on league.\n\nNow i know its easy for you to say its justified, but consider this -- this guy has 3 other perma banned accounts. All with a lot of nice legendary skins. He used to be toxic as all hell, and the game had no place for him. \n\nBUT he finally reformed, which a lot of people cannot do. He is a shining beautiful example that players can actually change. And the proof is in the honor. He hit that beautiful honor 3. Sonthing i can't even do becauss I'm toxic, and proud of it lol. \n\nThis was first season he was gonna get rewards in 4 seasons, and its all thrown away now because he was to drunk to even remember feeding one game.\n\n\nRiot has stated that before that one game shouldnt trigger a punishment, i know this for sure, it could probably be found somewhere. But he is banned spit on from one singular game. While there are clear examples of people feeding hundreds and never getting banned. And those arent even hard to findz they are on freaking YouTube.\n\nMy duo isnt the beat writer, so i felt it necessary to at least speak this on his part. Only reason he will even pkay anymore is because i want him to. Because riot truly does not care about there players. And they wont until you all stop spending money. I stopped and all i do is get free skins from hextech chests","replies":[{"poster":"Rebel 986","date":"2019-10-09T18:05:36.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Today at 12:47\nAlso I know I was afk for a short time my monther had me do somthing\n\nSo ur saying this kid was drunk.
