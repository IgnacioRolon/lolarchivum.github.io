So if one of those Krugs wiggles between two targets rapidly, you can expect it to hard reset pretty fast. This will have the largest impact on duo-lane partners who like to balance monster damage between them but will also affect long-range junglers who use the camp aggro range reset to take even less damage.\r\n> \r\n> GO BACK TO YOUR HOME! Jungle monsters will 'hard' reset after 10 soft leashes ⇒ 5 soft leashes. Refer to the above context when we say \"leashes\" because it gets a little complicated.\r\n\r\n{{champion:60}} \r\nElise has 2-5 spiderlings that tank jungle mobs for her. If she engages a jungle mob and that jungle mob oneshots all 5 spiderlings, won't it hard reset as soon as it targets her? If the mob is bouncing aggro back and forth between her spiderlings and her, it'll happen even faster. \r\n\r\nYou literally buffed Elise to help her out in the Jungle in the same patch notes, so you know that she's having trouble. \r\n\r\nWas this an unanticipated side effect? Did players test this?","replies":[{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2015-01-15T17:11:54.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"soft reset ≠ killing something.\nread the actual texts pls. monsters soft reset when they reach the edge of their leash limit ~500-700 units from their origin OR if they constantly switch targets without actually hitting the target.\nElise players usually auto-spell in range form, then switch immediately to spider form for LS. Elise won't be ranged long enough and far enough from the camp to force any kind of reset at all.\nOverall Resetting is location dependent. Killing will not result in a reset. the spiderings will be autod so that target switch will not count.\n\nIn case you're still confused, there are 3 monster behaviours that are taken into account:\n1) Monsters target the nearest target. \n2) Soft reset means if the monster won't be rapidly healing and the monster can be re-aggrod on its way back to its origin.\n3) Hard reset means that the monster will rapidly heal and can not be re-aggrod until the monster have returned to its origin.\nRanged champs can take advantage of 2 by sitting at the edge of the leashing range. the monster will then soft reset, but not heal because it's a soft reset. laners can also take advantage of 1 by alternating aggros; usually in this case, laners can avoid damage entirely by alternating who's closest to the monsters. The soft reset counter will return to 0 if A) the monsters hit the target once B) the monster hard resets.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Love","date":"2015-01-15T17:27:26.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't say switching targets without killing someone.

(that's what juggling means) It's been like that for years. Unless they're changing the way it works. This forces ranged champs to tank the monsters more.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Love","date":"2015-01-15T18:11:16.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate you taking the time to explain it, but the text doesn't say that.\n\nYou said \"read the actual texts pls.\".\nThe text didn't say anything about the monsters not resetting if you're still in range.\n\nThanks for the clarification though.
