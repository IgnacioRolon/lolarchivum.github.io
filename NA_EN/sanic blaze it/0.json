Amazingly enough this helps more than you would think.\n2) Make sure the channel the router is operating on isn't crowded (just google \"Wifi channel analyzer\" or something along those lines).\n\n\nThose were the two mains issues I had with my wireless adapter. Ever since updating to the newest driver at the time I haven't had an issue.\nHope it helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T23:04:53.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you experience disconnections when you're not connected to WiFi, but instead are connected via Ethernet to your router? This could be an issue with your wireless adapter, the WiFi antennae in your router, or your router entirely. Switching to a wired connection would be a great first step in troubleshooting this so we can find a permanent solution for these disconnections. \n\nLet me know if you noticed any difference on a wired connection.","replies":[]}]}
