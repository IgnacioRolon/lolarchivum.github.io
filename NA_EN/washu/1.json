I know I'm bad an video games, and life in general so at this point I don't see any use in me playing ranked. For a boarder to rub in faces? And while I may be called a noob, or scrub, or shit for my inability to have enough skill to climb, I honestly don't care anymore. I'm tired of keeping up to patch notes and changes to the T, who to ban, who's instantly OP because a pro says so, and what streams to watch because I want to climb. I'm already taking 18 hours in college and I get enough homework as it is. I don't need any more homework, chores, or responsibilities on top of that. \r\n\r\nSo what are some reasons you guys left the ranked scene?","replies":[]}
