That was great news for me, since I was waiting nearly six months for them to come back. I created an account and downloaded the launcher, playing a game of league while I waited. When the game was done, the patching and everything for the PBE launcher was also done, so I tried to log in. I got the message, \"Username or password is incorrect. Please try logging in again. If you have forgotten your password, click here.\" I re-enter the credentials only to have the same failed screen. I did what any reasonable person would do and tried to recover my password and username after forgetting them.\n\nFast forward about ten minutes and I've requested for my username twice, both times waiting about five minutes for the email. I never receive one, so I send a ticket (amateur with this kind of stuff because this usually doesn't happen). I log-out to create a ticket about my account needing to be recovered. That's a stupid thing to do, making people log out of the account that's usually automatically logged on just so they can recover said account,  but it gets worse. I fill out the information the best I can and submit the ticket. I wait patiently and when I receive the email confirming my ticket was submitted, I open the link to view it. There was a 404 error about the whole thing. I've heard about this happening on tickets that were months old, but never have i heard of it happening to brand new tickets. I decided to fix the issue myself if the system wouldn't let me contact the devs who cold help.\n\nSo now I tried to manually change my information. And here is where I found my main problem now. I checked my password then missclicked on change email, and saw that it wasn't my own email hooked up to my account. Instead, it was one ending in bu29002@163.com. I figured out this is a Chinese email site, but that's about all I know. I am American and can not even read Chinese, much less translate everything about the website, but form what I can tell, my account has been compromised by someone from China. This wouldn't be a huge deal if it was an alt account, but this is my main honor five account that I've spent nearly one thousand league of legends games on, and I'm not going to let that time go to waste. I created a ticket for that (somehow they are sent to my email, so I guess the system works differently) and tried to view it as well. The same thing has happened, and I got another 404 page not found error.\n\nThe entirety of my LoL account is at risk right now and I can't even create a support ticket to get help. I don't even care about PBE anymore, as long as I can get back my account. Just a fair note, I have access to my account as it is right now, but I am scared that I won't be able to get assistance with recovering my username or password some time in the future.\n\nEdit 1: TL;DR: Someone using a Chinese email has been able to change my account's default and linked email to their own. I still can use my account, but I am scared I will eventually need to recover credentials and I won't be able to.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T21:36:44.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the detailed info here, though I'm sorry for all the hassle you've gone through.  The email change is super suspicious, so I recommend updating your passwords and info on your email address and live accounts.  The error you might be seeing can happen if you are not logged into the account, since tickets are private.  \n\nIn this case, specifically fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) which will allow you to input an email address you do have access to.  This will go directly to our account team who can help update your info, email, and recover the PBE account.  We'll get back to you via email as soon as we can!","replies":[]}]}
