Meta, depending on who you ask, is either \"Most Effective Tactics Available\" or simply an abbreviation of \"metagame.\" META is largely self-explanatory, but it refers to what THINGS are strongest in the game's current state, where \"THINGS\" can be anything from a strategy to a team comp, and so on. A \"metagame,\" on the other hand,  refers to the facets of a game that aren't part of the games systems or mechanics, such as which champions are in vogue, what items get built most often.\n\nNow, the difference between those two is generally semantic at best, because the THINGS that are strongest will usually be the things that are also in vogue, so to speak. Not always, mind you, but they are largely one and the same.\n\nThus, when someone says \"that's an off-meta pick\" what they're saying is \"that's a pick not commonly seen in play.\" And the reason people don't like off-meta picks is that they usually don't work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-30T23:12:55.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let me give you a small and kinda obvious secret:\n\n#ScrewTheMeta\n\nDespite what people think, the meta isn't based completely on champions that are broken, a vast majority of meta champs are like that because someone in LCS picked and stomped with that champ at one point.

The only exceptions are champions with literally only 1 basic ability usable in that circumstance (Soraka jungle, I can't think of any other.

Champions that fit the best strategies or are overpowered are what are in Meta.  The Meta only applies to people Plat and above where players of adequate skill and knowledge can actually take advantage of the Meta.  The Meta does not exist to players below Plat where the players do not have the skill nor the knowledge to use and abuse the Meta.  Take Super Smash Bros Melee for example.  Fox is the best character in the game having lots of options but requires such precision and tech skill so those options are not available to 99% of the player base where as Kirby who is the worst character in melee has very limited options but is very easy for non competitve players to use so he seems strong to them.  If you don't play Smash Bros at the highest level you can not take advantage of the weaknesses or strengths or the cast so they all end up being strong.  What I'm getting at here is if you are playing below Platinum then you are not in the Meta so your teamattes have no reason to complain which they shouldn't anyway because you feel comfortable with your Cho'Gath pick.  Try your best to ignore the players hounding on you about the meta and just play the champs that you feel comfortable playing with and if you are playing normals and not ranked they should just shut up and stop taking them seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-11-01T04:20:46.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"platinum is still trash since it's still solo queue where extremely rigid champs like Katarina and Garen can still go legendary.\n\nLook at challenger 5v5 and above for examples of what the real meta is.

Just ignore all the kiddies crying about meta, and do what you're comfortable with and what you know works for you.\n\nWhat all these theorycrafters forget to include is that everyone is different, plays differently, and reacts differently. Where one person loses horribly with a Cho supp, the next person absolutely dominates, and gets their ADC 10/0 in the first 10 minutes.\n\nSo, in short, just do what works for you, and laugh at all the close-minded sheeple that try to push their meta into your face. ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2015-10-31T01:18:26.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, avoiding the obvious question, who thinks it's smart to have cho'gath bot lane?
