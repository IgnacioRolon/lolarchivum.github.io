Sharing mid means that there's a lane probably being forced to 1v2 (at low player levels since few people jungle without proper runes and masteries) and the person on mid gets lower xp and gold, which is something that person usually needs a bit more than they rest of the team to be effective.\n\nNow, buying offensive items and spamming damage abilities isn't a good way to go about things, especially since most champions are more nuanced than that. I implore you, if you see a champion you want to try, look up their Champion Spotlight to get an idea of how they're supposed to be played. Some older champions have outdated spotlights (the old, ugly map might be a tell), and if they do, I encourage you to look up a more recent guide.\n\nUntil then, I suggest you try Garen or Annie, for and AD and an AP champ, respectively. They're both offensively-focused champions with 3 damaging abilities, are simple, and fit fairly well with how you currently play. Just keep in mind that Garen also needs some defensive items as well and that Annie really only needs like one, but is really squishy, so you have to mind where you're standing so that you don't get jumped on or otherwise melted by spells.","replies":[{"poster":"allenmark00","date":"2015-11-26T01:16:14.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I tried and liked Garen back when I first started (although he's somewhat boring to me), but ever since I've been at the mercy of the free champion rotation, I basically have no choice but to try out random champions and buy the ones that I like.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T01:35:20.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get Tristana, Alistar, Garen for free if you want.

It'll give you a leg up during the game, if nothing else. Eventually, you'll find someone you like. That's when I recommend you shell out a bit of cash so that you can continue playing that champion.\n\nYou can also look at the champion list, find dudes you like the look of, look them up in more detail, and figure out if you like the look of them. That might end up in some dud purchases though, so I'm not sure I'd recommend it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-11-26T01:04:27.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=allenmark00,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u3MxAsuP,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-26T00:25:58.570+0000)\n>\n> I thought an support tank meant that it was tank that was good at distracting enemies?\n\nSupport tanks are support champions whose main focus is to assist teammates and they just happen to be tanky.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-26T00:23:10.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll learn where everybody fits as you play and watch others.

The typical setup is a ranged champion called the ADC (Attack Damage Carry) and a second person called the Support. The ADC will be given all the CS and kills if possible. The Support will let the ADC get all that to make him as strong as possible, and his job is basically to harass the enemy, ward, and protect the carry. Braum supports very well due to his ability to shield his team from missile attacks and CC the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"allenmark00","date":"2015-11-26T00:37:25.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_Tries to use an support-oriented champion as an lone-wolf berserker like Nasus or Darius, constantly dies because there's no one to help. _","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KÅ‚edGod","date":"2015-11-26T00:27:45.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bot lane is a ranged champion and a support champion lane sense most ranged champions have little to no escapes if they get caught out","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-11-27T22:33:41.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't play a champion like they're not meant to be played and expect good results.

Braum duo'd with a decent ADC is going to be extremely dangerous. Braum without a decent ADC is just going to be a 3v5 with two hangers-on. Braum reaaaaally feels bad to play from behind.

If you think your ADC isn't going to be good, either take a support who will be forgiving to him like {{champion:201}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} or pick someone who transitions to a carry role like {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} . Both options are better than going for Leona or Taric who want to be aggressive but need the ADC's assistance to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"allenmark00","date":"2015-11-26T01:23:10.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would like to point out that I only bought {{champion:31}} and {{champion:11}}. which means that I'm basically at the mercy of the free champion rotation.
