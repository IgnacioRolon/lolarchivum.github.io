So tl;dr my ex got me banned about 3 weeks ago (not perma) . We had a fight and he decided to ruin my life and get me perma but lucky me riot only gave me a 2 week. I was just wondering if i will still get my plat border ;( i worked so hard for it. Plus I had over 300 honors. It's all gone. Will I still get the victorious skin and my border ?

At the moment, nothing to do but to wait for announcement and of course never ever share your account again.
