I was just wondering if it was possible to rank back up in the new honor system. I've been getting multiple honor also x3 honor and x4 honors. I'm a reformed player that never uses chat only for information. I deserve what I deserve. I just wanted to know if I could ever get a fly lvl 3 thingie. Thanks for your time {{champion:201}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T22:13:41.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're at Rank 0 currently, you'll need to work your way back up through Ranks 1-2 before you'll reach 3. But with enough games played and honors gained you'll still be able to get there with enough time.","replies":[]}]}
