My computer (Windows 7) had to reset for an update in about 10 minutes, so I delayed to 4 hours. Right after that, I started playing a game, then the stupid computer just reset!!!!! For an update! then soon after it came back on, I tried to log in, but the attempts came up, and it went from the first attempt to the 3rd attempt in a matter of seconds ( shouldn't it take longer when the server is down?). then i realized that something was wrong with my computer. The servers are just fine, and i get the login error. I tried all the TSL on Internet explorerer, Hextech repair, etc. ANY SOLUTIONS PLS????????","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T18:50:47.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something with your network might have changed and blocking a connection to the login servers from occurring.  If you used the HRT, see if automatically configuring firewalls can help.  I also suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure everything is setup accordingly.  Hopefully, that will get things fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
