The pack automatically defaults to using the parent skin, not a chroma. I've attached a screenshot of Pool Party Leona's chroma pack in champion select to give you a better idea of what I mean. \n\nIf this isn't the case, please feel free to reach out!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZACKandATTACK","date":"2015-06-08T22:06:31.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last week, I was having the same problem.
