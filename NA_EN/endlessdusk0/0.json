This will be very wordy and poorly typed, however I'll summarize all of my points at the end. Also, I'm going to be quoting a lot of sources and not providing links, if demand is high enough, I will compile everywhere I've gotten info from (however most of my sources are from forums and such which would be a pain to link to.)\n\nTo begin with, they killed it simply because \"Player count dropped\" during the last two weeks of NB being up. Obviously with the end of an event the player count of a spin-off mode will drop. However, I've read around the forums and the league reddit and I've found that people were burnt-out, had to played ranked, annoyed at the balance of the mode, or that they'd only played it for the event to begin with. Obviously the event would inflate player count and the event missions were VERY repetitive and relied heavily on RNG, which a good amount of people have cited as why they stopped playing the mode.  The minigames and their prizes were also a nuisance, some would guarantee a victory or a loss for a team.  It'd ruin a game or even someone's day to lose a match because they win every mini game only to get blessing of blitzcrank and battle sled while the other team wins a minigame that heavily favored them that rewards them with battle catapult. These things and the mode being poorly balanced as it was a _work in progress_  probably did lead to a large drop in player count near the end of its 6 week run.\n\nMy issue was that the mode was said to be a **WORK IN PROGRESS** which is why I stopped playing it near the end of its life. Nexus was very poorly balanced, some champions were broken, some rewards were useless or game ending, minigames were unfair and unpredictable, but Nexus was a work in progress. I played the mode, enjoyed my time, but found myself annoyed when the other team would always be champions I knew would end up broken once on fire and the first reward they get from a minigame was the battle catapult. Obviously I wanted to play more but I knew that it was unbalanced and I'd likely have a bad game since the mode was a **WORK IN PROGRESS.** So I stopped playing it, like many other people did, because we were told that it would come back, likely after being fixed. But they didn't fix it. They waited 3 months to announce that data they likely had for 2-3 months was enough information to not release it as a permanent mode. They didn't ask any of us \"why did you stop playing near the end?\" or \"did you enjoy the mode?\" They just killed it off.\n\nWhy is it such an issue to decide with that data that Nexus should be killed? \n\n* They never asked us.\nHow hard is it to make a poll? Send out an email asking what we liked or didn't?  Is it difficult to talk to the people who spend money on your game?\nAny league fan site such as the reddit or the forum had top threads that day about how upset people were about Nexus being snuffed out. I know it's common for people to be upset about changes made, but for the news to take 3 months of absolute silence and for it to be influenced solely by the number of people playing a work in progress at the end of the cycle is just upsetting.\nJust ask your community what they want. I'd rather live in a world in which Nexus was killed off since 90% of league players hated it.\n\n* Not every mode will appeal to everyone.\nWould you guess that a mode that's different from the base game would have less players than the base mode? The idea of an alternate mode is to ensnare people who would otherwise not play your game and keep them spending money on your game that they would otherwise ignore. Nexus was very different from other modes, and obviously people that only wanted the Winter tokens or whatever would play matches that were faster. Did Nexus retain newer players better than other modes have in the past? Did older players leave quicker than others? How long did ranked players stick around?\nA mode that doesn't appeal to ranked players and the more serious gaming crowd is a better thing to release than something that only the ranked and long time players enjoy since you're widening your audience.\n(Edit) Keep in mode some people exclusively play ARAM, URF, and other modes simply because they enjoy the game but don't enjoy the regular modes.\n\n* The trend of trying to find the goose that laid the golden egg is damaging.\nCancelling a mode because of it's low player retention is sad. Side stepping any community involvement in the decision is pathetic. Riot clearly just wants to release a mode that's on par with Fortnite and the mass appeal it has. Expecting the mode to grow when it's undoubtedly broken and unfinished is asinine and the exact same thing that indie devs do on steam before cutting and running with the money. Show some merit and let people test the full version before you decide it isn't a worthy investment.\n\nTldr;/Summary:\nRiot releases a buggy, broken test mode with repetitive missions and RNG heavy gameplay that they promised would be worked on. Riot realizes the mode isn't the second coming of our lord and savior Fortnite Christ so they wait 3 months before executing the mode citing \"you didn't love it enough.\"","replies":[]}
