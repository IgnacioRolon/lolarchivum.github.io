Is there any way to fix this? I can't do anything with it cause it happens so often.\r\n\r\n----\r\nProblem #2\r\n\r\nAlso, a completely other problem that I really need help with is resting my controls 100%. At some point I went in to some .ini and changed things up with controls and I think that's starting a problem where I can't move at all but the game is still going.\r\n\r\nPlease help quick. If this is not allowed here please forward me somewhere I can post this.

If you're running Windows 10, this is most likely caused by the Windows Game Bar, which has a *Game DVR* feature that has caused crashes and freezing for some players. I recommend ensuring this feature is disabled by working through [**this guide**](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).\n\nAs for your input settings reset, you can resolve this by deleting the **input.ini** and **PersistedSettings.json** files from within the **Config** folder while you have the League Client running in the background.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
