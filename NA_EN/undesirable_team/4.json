It&#039;s a long range high speed nuke that easily follows up to a one shot.  On top of this, she gets cooldown reduced every time she puts an enemy to sleep, which results in it being very spammable.  In addition to this she can miss it, and have a trap that lasts 4 fucking seconds.  To relate to this, {{champion:164}} ult lasts 4 seconds when at level 16.  My suggestion to this would be to nerf it (obviously).\r\nHow?  \r\n-Nerfing the trap.  Even though this thing gets popped by minions, it&#039;s still pretty bullshit to play around.\r\n-Taking away the cooldown reduction for hitting it. It has a low cooldown for such a strong ability anyway, why have it?\r\n-Base damage.  60 Damage (+40% AP) is kind of stupid at level 1.  This makes your E-Q combo do 106% AP damage + 40% AP True damage +\r\n 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220  E Base damage + 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220  E Base True Damge +\r\n 45 / 75 / 105 / 135 / 165 Damage.\r\nHer damage can easily one shot an adc from a huge distance, even if she is behind.

Anivia Q can damage and stun multiple enemies.  Anivia stun is not interupted by damage.  Zoe E base damage 0-60(*2) higher than Anivia Q and second part does true damage rather than magic.  Anivia E range is 275 more than Zoe's though Zoe's gets extended by a wall.\n\nAnivia Q provides superior mid-combat cc and nearly equal damage (higher if Zoe E is procced by something weak).  Zoe E provides better catch potential and single target burst.\n\nAnivia E compared to Zoe Q: Cooldown 3.5-2.25 seconds shorter.  Damage difference is difficult to tell for mid-fight (can't get full Zoe Q damage), but Zoe Q has much higher potential damage.  Anivia E is targeted while Zoe Q is a skillshot.  Anivia E has 150 lower range.\n\n Zoe E has superior one-shot potential and hits a small area.  Anivia's E is more reliable and can be cast most often in a fight.\n\nBasically these are two different sets of abilities with Zoe's having superior catching capabilities and one-shots while Anivia's have superior mid-fight capability.  Also Anivias absurd mana cost is mostly on her ult (her Q too, but that only gets expensive at higher ranks and she maxes that second).\n\nFinally (hopefully you read this far), Zoe's E and Q have more counterplay than most skillshots.  If you fail to proc the second part of her E, the damage is fairly low.  Q also has to travel a significant distance to build up damage meaning you have to either predict where they will be at the end of that flight or have them cced for the duration.\n\nOther poke abilities are generally fire and forget, like Vel'koz Q (that can fork off at any point, increasing the odds of landing) and Xerath Q.

I've picked them up at level 3 several times and it's just brutal for the enemy laner.\nE could stand to have a few changes.  \n- Traps duration on the ground should be cut in half, 4 seconds is entirely too long.  If they want the duration to remain, the hitbox needs to shrink.  \n- Refund on champion hit needs to go, it isn't really needed at all.

I still traded with her because i managed to get my full combo off but it was annoying. \n\nExtreme case though given she needed to have max cdr for this, but still annoying. I also dislike it's a special case with black shield, can't prevent the sleep if black shield is applied after the bubble hits but before the sleep, also you can't cleanse the drowsy debuff. Pretty dumb since fizz's ult knockup can be prevented from a black shield even if the fish is already attached. Makes this spell inconsistent with other spells like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Even","date":"2017-12-03T03:22:00.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, its very frustrating because often times dodging the ability ends up with you being trapped, or getting hit by it the instant it turns into a bubble.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-12-04T03:10:52.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The strength is going through terrain, not missing and getting a trap.
