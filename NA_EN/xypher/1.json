I think they just didn't make this as her VU cause they've stepped away from the old \"traditional skin\" concept. Maybe this is why they posted that thing earlier too about why they're stepping away from the idea of traditional skin. The only thing i'd hate about not having this as her base skin is that the ingame icon will still be that lame old base splash art.

White reflects light like no other and is dramatically impacted by hues around it. Her hair in her splash is actually reflecting the colors of her chair and outfit (you can see the violet, pinks, and slight golds). As for her model -- in the art world, white hair as a standalone is commonly shaded with blue to give it depth, since shading it with gray would make it flat and dimensionless. Since Ashe's model is obviously not the static  2D splash, and league has no dramatic lighting engine, it wouldn't be able to have the colors you see in the artwork.

I disagree with it being her 'default' mind you - she's a bounty hunter by default, one who it is confirmed uses sex appeal as a weapon - \"make em think with their guns and they'll forget their pistols\" - and that works. Plus her new model looks a little more plausible (and a ton better than the old) - but this is her in the future perhaps. A somewhat older, more settled, more powerful figure - not *Miss* FOrtune but *Captain* Fortune. And the model isn't quite as good as the splash in this case.\n\nTHat said, this splash is gorgeous and its a bold, fitting reinterpretation of the character.
