The eggs have 1 life point and when attacked they break open and decide the next dragon type (you can take a wild guess which egg represents which type of dragon). Either team can attack any egg. If no egg is attacked within 15 seconds, the next dragon is random. \r\n\r\nDragons now have a new anti-effect against champions that have slain dragons of their type (This also works theatrically)\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\nInfernal Drake deals %700 increased damage to champions that already have an infernal drake\r\nOcean Drake Heals for %70 of damage it takes over 5 seconds against a champion that already has an ocean stack, that is attacking it\r\nMountain Drake Takes %70 reduced damage from attacks\r\nCloud Drake Has increased attack speed (or some other powerful gimmick)\r\n\r\n(These are example numbers and examples of anti-effects, but you get the idea, they make it much harder to secure) \r\n\r\nThese changes will Force players to first get the dragon, then decide which egg suits their comps the best and their opponent's comps the worst, while also intentionally avoiding eggs of dragons they already have. Teams that get the second drake that didn't get the first one, can purposely select the dragon their opponent's have, knowing it will be harder for their opponents to get that second dragon, and making it easier for them in the process.\r\n\r\nMore advanced strategies can also exist, like stacking infernal with an early game comp, regardless of the second dragon difficulty, or picking a late game ocean drake in an attempt to not lose a lead. The point is players get rewarded for killing dragons by getting to pick the stakes of the next dragon fight, and leaving RNG at the door. In 50-50 Dragon fights, there is also an exciting 50-50 fight for the eggs.\r\n\r\nAs riot gathers data for the eggs that are being picked, they can then buff/nerf/change the dragons and even their effects to encourage more variety, based on the statistical feedback from players in real time across different elos. Adding attack speed to go with movement speed to the Could Drake effect, or Armor to the Mountain Drake effect, might be one of a million possible changes that can make sense in the future.\r\n\r\nThe best part about the changes is that the RNG of the drakes is almost completely removed, aside from that first random dragon, adding a sense of skill to the dragons.","replies":[{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2019-09-05T13:00:52.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/rankings/drakes\n\nYeah.. wonder which one poeple will choose...","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-09-05T13:46:25.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Titanium70,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iRJjPwjY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-05T13:00:52.116+0000)\n>\n> https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/rankings/drakes\n> \n> Yeah.. wonder which one poeple will choose...\n\nTo me that more cuts to the point that RNG dragons is kinda bullshit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ApologyAccepted","date":"2019-09-06T05:33:38.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, if people start over choosing a drake, the next patch will be a buff to other drakes or a nerf to the chosen one.
