These eggs have 1 lifepoint and when they are attacked, they open and all others are destroyed. The egg that is selected/opened becomes the next drake that will appear in 5 minutes. If no egg is destroyed in 15 seconds, the next dragon is random.\r\n\r\nI really like this idea because it removes all of the RnG from the game (besides the very first dragon), and encourages early dragon control. It also works well enough theatrically.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome teams may benefit from certain dragons more than others, so the current state of the game should favor the team with more skill, not the team with more luck\r\n\r\nIf you don't like the idea, consider how you would feel if this was the way dragons already spawned. Would you change the game to make them all random?","replies":[{"poster":"Dasdi96","date":"2019-03-17T00:08:01.188+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except everyone will choose infernal drake. It is by far the most overpowered drake because it makes sure the other team will lose, even if they manage to stall to late game because of the amount of stats the drag gives, especially if combined when elder. A lucian with 1 infernal drake will outdamage a twitch/tristana with none in teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"ApologyAccepted","date":"2019-09-05T08:02:55.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I updated it here! https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/iRJjPwjY-changes-to-dragons-and-their-eggs-no-more-rng","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ApologyAccepted","date":"2019-03-18T05:38:33.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks everyone","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-03-17T00:00:25.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good idea... let's have 3 infernal drakes every single game","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-17T00:05:34.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZephyrDrake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wweVJT04,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-17T00:00:25.571+0000)\n>\n> good idea... let's have 3 infernal drakes every single game\n\n\n\n~~3~~\n2","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-03-17T00:11:49.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Galaxyburstz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wweVJT04,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-03-17T00:05:34.532+0000)\n>\n> ~~3~~\n> 2\n\n2? sorry but no 3.
