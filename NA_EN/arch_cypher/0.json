As I was looking through her skins something seemed off; Headhunter  Caitlyn (who I do not own) did not appear in her rotation of skins. I realize this is a pretty minor bug, but I thought I should still report it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-27T19:56:35.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up!
