Considering I'm using my keyboard to type this, I don't think it was an issue with my keyboard. Also, I use the default setup (Q-W-E-R) so it's not a result of me changing keys either. It also certainly isn't because of my ping, as I live right near the NA server.\r\n\r\n I don't want to start another game as I don't want to lose due to something that is out of my control, so any help on the matter would be extremely appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-01T03:42:20.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm my first guess is maybe your keybinds didn't load correctly from the server or possibly got erased entirely. Let's try to give those a quick hard reset using the steps below.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
