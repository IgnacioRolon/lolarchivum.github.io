What happened exactly is that the summoner on the opposing team selected and locked in their champ, and it switched over for me to pick my champ, however, the client got stuck switching to my turn to pick, so I was just staring at a screen with Dr. Mundo and 0 seconds left to pick, with no button to lock in my selection, and no ability to change the champion I was picking. I clicked all over the screen hoping for something to happen, but nothing did. Just Dr. Mundo's stupid face staring at me until the game was disbanded and I got an almost 6 minute wait timer to start a new game. And then got warned for dodging.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-13T22:55:24.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that happened, and the culprit could be for a few reasons.
