This game is taking way too much of my time and it is stressing me out more than I am having fun. Not only that, but it is going to get in the way of college, social life, work, and a healthy lifestyle. I had a blast playing this game for the last two years and at least can have the pride to say I reached diamond. I feel as if my time is over with league and I am wondering if it possible for you to ban all 4 of my accounts?  \r\n\r\nTheir summoner names are AdamSchnegro, Ramdawg, Ramdawg Millionaire and small gigantic. I can pm the actual account names and passwords to a Rioter if that is necessary. Thanks for the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-23T01:58:40.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you stuck with us for so long, and while I hate to see you go I think it's admirable that you're doing this in preparation for school and such! \n\nIf you would like to put your accounts on hold in case you decide to come back, we can do that. Or if you want them permanently deleted we could do that as well. The best way to get that done though will be through a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). It kind of sucks, but you will need to send us a ticket from each account that you want to be deleted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-05-23T01:29:05.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Adam,\n\nFor security purposes do not send them your account passwords. If you would like to be banned you can submit a support ticket and ask them to. This article here explains how to do that --> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202647784-Account-Deletion-FAQ\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[]}]}
