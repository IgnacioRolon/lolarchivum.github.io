It has limitations of corse, for me the store is useless because of a session cookie which can&#039;t save in the webview because the api does not support that, it was worked about 6.0 but since then that changed. An other issue is sometime with switching desktops and using GUI features the game canvas freeze. But in most of the time it working fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-08-19T20:07:59.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This looks promising, I should give it a try.

I've found that installing vcrun2015 fixes the alpha client. You still need the --no-sandbox argument. You can install vcrun2015 in your wineprefix with these commands: \n\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks\nchmod +x winetricks\nWINEPREFIX=/home/[user]/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/[league install folder] ./winetricks -q vcrun2015\n\nof course you need to change the [user] to your home folder name, so in my case it was /home/krash/.PlayOnLinux\nthen you change the [league install folder] to your League install location that you named with playonlinux. so in my case the full string was:\n\nWINEPREFIX=/home/krash/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/League ./winetricks -q vcrun2015.\n\n\nmake sure you keep your caps and everything\n\nIf anyone needs help with Linux gaming you can always PM me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-08-19T20:25:53.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even linux wants sandbox on lol, it seems...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meriipu","date":"2016-08-11T22:17:50.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it is the chromium toolkit-something sandboxing that does not work too well with wine","replies":[]}]}
