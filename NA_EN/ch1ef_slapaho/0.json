The common theme between the three games is that I lost LP every single time. I, along with my teammates, were punished for the malfeasance of one person. This is the only thing I dislike about Leage of Legends, but it happens so frequently that I really can&rsquo;t even stomach the game anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is why LOL is losing players to Fortnite... this incredible masterpiece of a game is actually managing to lose players to that steaming pile of garbage Fortnite.\r\n\r\nIt frustrates me so much because the solution is so simple, people that leave, afk, or troll in ranked games should be barred from playing ranked at all. Obviously there won&rsquo;t be permanent consequences on the first offense, but if someone gets reported by their whole team for leaving, game after game after game, they should simply not be allowed to play ranked anymore. \r\n\r\nIn addition, in games where a member of your team leaves, the game should be nullified, just like a remake. And LP should neither be given nor taken from either team. Sparing the innocent from punishment.\r\n\r\nAnd that&rsquo;s all there is to it.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-22T20:51:12.327+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not possible.
