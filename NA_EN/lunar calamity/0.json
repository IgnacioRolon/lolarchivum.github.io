Ask anyone that plays as MF, the worst thing you can do if you are even going to consider using your ultimate is to use it when you're close to any champion. \n\nI wouldn't say she's the worst ADC right now, though she does leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion, she has two things going for her:\n\nShe is a pretty strong lane bully. Once you master the Q bouncing, you can destroy your lane opponents simply by the crit bounces. \n\nShe's pretty solid at roaming, considering she gets a mobility boots passive when out of combat.\n\nBut the one thing that I just don't understand for the love of god is why the frick does this passive get deactivated by minion hits?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-09-14T01:07:13.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do people hate it?

There will continue to be no reason to pick her until they change it to how it was. It makes absolutely no sense that building AD gives her more magic damage, while building AP gives her more phys. It makes it impossible to get the right kind of pen on her. Even when at FULL STACKS the damage from W is completely terrible when you consider that ADCs will be critting for 600-800 late game. An extra 200 magic damage after you've attacked 5+ times doesn't matter whatsoever.\n\nShe has poor mobility, no cc, mediocre range, and they removed grievous wounds which was the only thing she had going for her. She's easily the worst ADC in the game at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-09-14T01:04:28.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:96}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:81}} tired of people saying that her scaling sucks when these 3 ADCs do the exact same thing with AP doing Physical and AD doing Magic. It makes her impossible to counterbuild. Even if she's behind she'll still do more damage than other ADCs since tanks or bruisers can't itemize vs her unlike other ADCs.\n\nThe point of her W passive is to make her outtrade all ADCs early - mid game, which she does. Even then she already builds crit chance, so if she's hitting you for 600 - 800 damage an auto attack, add an extra 200 on that.\n\nShe actually has more mobility than a lot of ADCs, some like Ashe, Kog'Maw, or Twitch have none (Twitch has a crappy MS buff that's countered by auto attacking him once before he even uses it). On top of that she has a pretty strong slow, and she actually has one of the highest ranges in the game taking in consideration her abilities all have at least 650 (Caitlyn AA range) to 1,400 and her auto attack range is standard.\n\nShe has a lot going for her, one being she has one of the highest damage outputs for all ADCs, and her early - mid game is insanely powerful. She has a lot of strengths and even statistically she does better than most ADCs.","replies":[]}]}]}
