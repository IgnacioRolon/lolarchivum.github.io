Closed the game and later tried to reopen to play and I have not been able to connect since. I've been trying for at least 4 hours. I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice. I have went through most of the troubleshooting steps. DNS stuff the 8.8.8.8//8.8.4.4 thing, I've synced my cloak. I've tried as administer and even IP Helper. Still I'm having issues, anything at all would help. Although I've probably tried it.","replies":[{"poster":"Finalr","date":"2015-09-03T15:56:10.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I submitted the request!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-09-03T09:21:04.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can wrangle the logs listed on [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) and send it to us through a [Player Support request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), our tech dudes should be able to duo with you on troubleshooting from here!","replies":[]}]}
