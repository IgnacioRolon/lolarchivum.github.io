As Sylas, I got first blood and backed, and he teleported into lane, got no items, while I got items, but he was a level ahead, should I have not backed there? I was 50% health and thought I needed health. From there he just kept bullying me in lane and when I tried to trade, I did practically no damage (He had no MR), if it was the right option to back, should I have gotten armor or more damage, potions or what? Hoping I can get some tips, ty and gl on the battlefield. ^^","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-06-06T02:18:19.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well picking a top lane fighter rather than a mid lane diver helps in a lot of match-ups. You'd likely see similar issues as Akali or Zed. But as Sylas, you also basically don't have an ultimate since Aatrox's isn't very good for him. \n\nWhen you get first blood like that, stay if you aren't too low. Since a level 1 or 2 kill doesn't net you the xp to be worth missing a minion wave. Or at the very least, clear the next wave before backing.\n\nWhen fighting him, if it's gonna hit just take the first Q since it deals the least damage. Save your dash for making sure he doesn't land the third, then retaliate. \n\nAnd I wouldn't be so sure he had no MR. It's a lot easier for a bruiser top to bring the two MR runes than it is for a mid laner who needs the damage. Alongside that, what items did you start? Doran's or corrupting? What did you buy on back?","replies":[{"poster":"oUwU","date":"2019-06-06T03:26:23.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started with a Doran's ring and when I backed got an Amplifying Tome","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-06-06T07:27:04.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You usually want Corrupting Potion first on him, especially with how well it works with his passive. \n\nAnd if you survived with 50% HP, you definitely don't need the little bit of HP from Doran's.\n\nLastly, if all you can buy on back is an Amp Tome, don't back.
