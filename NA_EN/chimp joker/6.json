But instead of Damage you are rewarded with Gold, still the concept is the same you are rewarded with something completely uncounterable and without strategy. The enemy can not do anything about the Bonus Damage from those two runes and they can't do anything about the Gold you get from Klepto, similarly you don't pay for either nor are you forced to make a decision based on the circumstances. You simply hit your abilities and get free rewards. The Gold is just like the Damage you get from Electrocute, Dark Harvest, Predator, etc. but in a different form.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-11-26T22:51:45.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need more “game breaking” runes in the style that inspiration does. Doesn’t add damage but adds more utility, or maybe even very low damage with the trade off of a fairly reliable effect.\n\nIt could be general keystones/runes that have the Inspiration theme of “game breaking/rule bending” or Riot could go in the direction of the Odyssey Augments, like 2-3 unique keystones/augments per champ that is balanced towards the champ’s top playstyles or builds. \nThey don’t add a lot or any damage but they bring unique utility effects and interactions. This might be easier to balance because instead of changing runes because one person abuses them, Riot can balance the numbers of an overpowered champ’s kit. \n\nThis wouldn’t cuck users of a rune just because one champ abuses it easily, and the game won’t be as snowbally because there isn’t a ton of damage that comes out at lvl 1 just because of the keystones and runes.\n\nSorry for the initial giant wall of text, I tried searching for a place to break it up before I posted it but couldn’t find a good separation of ideas to create a break.

The only reason some of these outdated champs are even viable is because there are runes that help them. Without runes you're banking on riot balancing the champion pool well, which they've shown to be pretty bad at.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hügö","date":"2018-11-27T17:27:10.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes better without runes reforged, but the old runes would make it better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbsoluteMadmann","date":"2018-11-27T15:38:10.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should do what Dota does with Talents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkTree1","date":"2018-11-27T10:46:50.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they refuse to diversify items and want epic flashy outplays as soon as possible instead of them being gated behind item purchases, so runes are the best we have for game-to-game diversity right now (even though people take the same runes and build the same items every game with no real difference but y'know)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArfBarkBoof","date":"2018-11-27T02:11:46.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jøkèr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=blEhlbQO,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-26T18:22:16.956+0000)\n>\n> It just seems like less of a headache to not have runes than to have them.

Take the player Risti, for example, He's a Garen OTP and he has maybe four rune pages he'll use based on whatever champion he's facing. Against Singed he'll take Glacial Augment and rush something like {{item:3800}} for the massive AoE slow in team fights.\n\nThen you have what Valve did in Dota 2. Adding personalized talent trees that unlock at levels during the match and allow you to choose between two options ( Usually damage versus utility ). While this idea sounds good in practice, you have absolutely bonkers stuff like Brewmaster having a max level talent that gives him 435% crit damage on his E and 80% per auto to crit during its duration.\n\nIt all depends on how you view Runes, really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-11-26T19:57:44.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like it if every rune was moved into Inspiration and all damage was removed from runes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cptn Han SoloQ","date":"2018-11-26T19:48:57.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be way easier to balance but if it would be the same fun for people who play 1 or 2 games a week?
