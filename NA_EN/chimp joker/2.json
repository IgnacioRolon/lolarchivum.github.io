Most supports have a form of CC that can either cancel his CC or simply CC the enemy ADC\n- While he shields and heals, he doesn't give any form of buff to his ADC or bring damage himself. Most of the time, simply focusing the enemy ADC should win you the trade.\n\nRakan scales pretty decently and is great at picking people off mid/late game, but if all we're talking about is laning, I think the only thing that doesn't counter him are passive lanes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hrbrt","date":"2017-04-27T18:12:36.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a lot of fun when i play thresh against him.

Her W renders him and his 'dashing' nature utterly useless and keeps him from bouncing in and/or out. You can either choose to w him early to stop him from going in, or wait a bit and keep him from escaping, giving an easy pick just for being near him. Even later, her E can be used to shove him off your team while he's ulting, or just ult him up or away, but it's generally better to save those for bigger enemies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfinator","date":"2017-04-28T02:50:42.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think {{champion:44}} is a pretty good counter.
