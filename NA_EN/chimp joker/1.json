I always thought that he was an out-of-place, cool, unique kind of champion featured in the game. I just couldnt play him because I dont like top lane and even if I did play top, there were better champs to play than him. After seeing his rework, however, I was drooling rainbows while having thoughts of how fucking metal this new incarnation of the champ is. So cool that I think that it overshadows Kayne. Something like this has never happened to me before.\r\n\r\nBut this does get me thinking. If there were some champs available right now that never existed until Riot decided to give them a teaser/champion spotlight, what champion do you think would hype you up? E.g. Let&#039;s Diana was never in the game at all. Then all of a sudden Riot teases this champ. Even with her current kit, I think that I&#039;d be excited.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-07-11T21:04:57.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you.... you realize that only new champions and relaunched champions get reveals, right?","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-07-11T21:06:28.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's means what if they'd never existed, would you get hyped for them if they were teased nowadays.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-07-11T21:18:41.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt anybody would have been awed by Nunu if he was released today, no matter how much they could try to hype it.","replies":[]}]}
