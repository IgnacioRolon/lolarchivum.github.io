I haven't been banned or toxic in those 3 years. I'm frequently reporting bugs and taking surveys. The closest thing to a ban is when the new client crashes in champ select and I have to wait 5 mins. Now there has been 3 champs that I've played ALOT of Taric, Aatrox, and Brand, yet they all have been in the PBE and I thought you accept people that play a lot of a champ that's being reworked? If Galio (my main) goes into the PBE and I still hear nothing then I'll take it as a yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-24T19:40:52.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An application isn't lost or forgotten.
