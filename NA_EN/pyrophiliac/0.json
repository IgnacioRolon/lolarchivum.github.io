I went ahead and took into your account and I was able to confirmed you were permanently suspended for something else entirely.  Make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) over to us and we should be able to explain to you the nature of your suspension.\n\nAs for your comment about leaving, we completely understand that life can get complicated and crazy.  This is why we never punish players for leaving a single game. We only apply penalties once there is a pattern of consistently leaving games.  Sometimes this is caused due to matters beyond your control, but you are still ruining the gaming experience of up to 9 other players when you do.\n\nI hope this makes sense!  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrophiliac","date":"2016-05-24T22:02:50.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im just puzzled since it seames like after 2 game left one being an acident and one do to private maters iv got a year ban i was just starting to enjoy this game and beable to play with my friend that are level 30","replies":[{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2016-05-24T22:26:25.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try reading what dArtagnan said one more time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
