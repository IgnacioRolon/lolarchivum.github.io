That's something they're still discussing if they want to have or not in the future, and even then, it'd probably just be recolor skins.\n\nGenerally, Riot gives a bit of time before releasing skins, anywhere from a few hours after a patch goes live, to even weeks in some cases (I don't expect it to take that long though). \n\nGiven that they recently put out the Samsung set, they probably will wait a bit before releasing the cards set, maybe to reduce strain on the shop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SQUAIDZOID","date":"2015-05-21T05:19:29.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does anyone know the release date for this skin?","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-16T00:04:08.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not currently released yet. \n\nAll skins for a patch will show in the Champion Details Page, even if they're not available just yet.","replies":[]}]}
