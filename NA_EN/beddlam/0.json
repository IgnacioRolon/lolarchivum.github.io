The last set of nerfs knocked him all the way from LCS perma-ban to bottom of the pile in both top and mid. Will he still see tweaks to get him into a better spot, or are you guys just going to leave him in his current state for a while as he is lest disruptive UP than OP? Do you think he can be brought into a good place through simple numbers tweaking, or will something need to change about his mechanics?\r\n\r\nI know you have a lot on your plate right now with Skarner and Garen, but as someone who really enjoys Ryze, I&#039;d love to know what the current thoughts on him are. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T21:09:17.620+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the balance team  wants to be confident he's not still too strong for top end players before tweaking him into a better spot. As someone with a personal investment in Ryze due to having worked on him, I would like to take that look before worlds, because I think he brings some different stuff to top lane (carry top, magic damage, anti-mobility), but even I am not 100% confident the guy is super weak despite a LOT of the data seeming to suggest it. However, data also suggests that with player experience, he's actually not all that weak. I know a lot of people think he's a brainless no-skill champ, but the data doesn't actually seem to reflect that.\n\nOne of the things I did when working on Ryze was I tried to go really hard on his strengths and weakness, namely his in-passive versus out-of-passive states. I've received a lot of criticism for that, and some of it's probably well-deserved. Anyone active on the boards a few months ago probably saw threads like \"What idiot at Riot thought chain root was a good idea?\" Well, it was mostly me. With Ryze's update, I was taking a really large amount of his consistent power away, and the high uptime on Rune Prison during his passive was something I gave back in return. The main problem I did not anticipate was that W max could be a thing, and so I addressed that, but when I did that nerf, I buffed his Q at the same time since he otherwise seemed weak. It turns out he was still strong without W max, and so he remained a balance problem.\n\nTo be completely honest, I'm not 100% sure if he's balanced or weak now (I have a hard time thinking he's too strong, but who knows...). I'll probably talk to the balance team about him in the coming weeks before worlds to at least get a solid evaluation, so maybe we'll see something then. Feel free to ask for an update then. I might have something more definitive to say.","replies":[{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-08-18T03:49:55.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have whats more or less an essay on Ryze [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/oRhBxn5B-why-ryze-is-both-underpowered-and-broken-and-how-it-can-be-fixed), it got quite a few views and a good discusion on Reddit.

It means a lot to players to have some idea what is going on with their favorite (and at times, least favorite) champs. I really enjoy playing Ryze even in his current state where I feel like the 6 sec stack timer makes him a little weak.","replies":[]}]}
