I'll admit that her early game damage is so lackluster it's pathetic, but she snowballs so ridiculously hard it's almost aneurysm inducing. If she was gated by cooldowns I would be okay with her but she's not. She's not as forgiving as Zed but she's much more frustrating to deal with. IMO her damage reduction needs to go, if it's going to stay that way other assassins like Talon and Diana should get something similar, because as it stands you can't win a trade with her if she's even a hair ahead of you. Plus she's all point and click and as I recall people were bashing Veigar because he's point and click, so it's a double standard in it's own way.","replies":[{"poster":"WeFlyNoLie","date":"2015-03-10T13:53:29.174+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"If I have to mid and I'm against {{champion:55}}, my answer will always be {{champion:3}}. \n\nShe wants to harass?

Dispositioning CC can be countered by his SECOND gap closer. Neither of these are defendable by Kat.\n\n> Anyway, the fact is you DON'T need that much for Katarina to gank successfully.\n> \n> 1.

Are you saying that any gank is bound to work because of the above scenarios?...because they don't.\n\nAlso, how often have you played Kat mid? In order to CS you need to combo, which always puts you in poke range. If you're not poked as Kat constantly, then your opponent is bad and you're going to lose anyway. Try using her some time, and see how often you're at full health.\n \n> You make it sound like ALL conditions are required. However in reality, it only takes 2 or 3 of them to easily gank as Katarina. Hell, a successful teleport can ignore all other conditions you mentioned.\n\n**All** conditions? So if you don't have full health and you're diving a full health leona,  morgana or soraka, or thresh, or blitz, I'm sure you'll be successful. I'm sure you'll also severely hurt ez, quinn, corki, tristana, caitlin....\n\n> Isn't it applicable to all champions? You don't assume Katarina is fighting on her own. Her teammates actually exist.\n\nKatarina requires a lot more work to do well. It requires a lot more misplay for her to stomp.

Now you pull out Karma to fill that X. Did you even read?\n\nAt this point your comprehension is GED failure worthy. I never referenced a counter. Any player in the game, I guess barring you, knows that Karma versus Katarina will STRONGLY be against Karma because she has no method of stopping Death Lotus. I was insinuating that any champion can win against Katarina and prevent her dominance if played well. \n\nIs there any champion that Kat counters hard? \n\n> You making a lot of assumptions without realizing it, is the reason why it becomes quite pointless to argue with you. Your team surely are always premade dedicated to counter Katarina, I assume?\n\nAgain I made no assumptions, you did all of it by referencing the wrong player.

I feel like shutting her down proves all the people with terrible mechanics that she isn't that strong. If I fucked up and lost its my fault not Kata's. Because if I had stopped her ult I would have won.\n\nHell if she wins against me its because she out played me. I understand her kit. Hell she was my first main back in S3 until I stopped playing her when the damage CC mid lane became extremely real.\n\nThe mechanics in this game in the low elos have gone down so much since then. In B1 S3 I was getting teams that focused Kata, blew up ADCs but just didn't make good decisions when behind or ahead. Now its like a bunch of monkeys slamming their fists on the keyboard getting caught flaming and then blaming the entire team. At least before it was poor decision making not a lack of mechanics. Mechanics are so key to this game. And it's just gone down the drain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-03-10T09:37:14.726+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":20,"body":"She takes skill to use.","replies":[{"poster":"ßongs","date":"2015-03-10T12:27:10.982+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jelly Mac,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tgq0i2yr,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-10T09:37:14.726+0000)\n>\n> She takes skill to use.\n\nskill?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-03-10T12:23:30.967+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"you mean reflex?\n\nOr rolling face on keyboard?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aww Kat","date":"2015-03-10T12:25:39.256+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jelly Mac,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tgq0i2yr,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-10T09:37:14.726+0000)\n>\n> She takes skill to use.\n\nlol?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ApexInTheCircle","date":"2015-03-10T09:06:10.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"I think that if you're going to have a champion that has resets they need to be balanced around that instead or it just being tacked on an already powerful kit, IMO it's like if Talon killed someone he got a reset, and it's literally the exact same thing except I've seen Kat's that do not require their ult to complete destroy soemeone.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-03-10T13:55:02.476+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"You say that like Kat's kit without resets would not be the most pathetic kit in the game","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-10T14:47:25.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"It wouldn't be, at all.\n\nThe only thing it would do is encourage her to actually try and get the full duration of her ult off","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-03-10T16:12:39.286+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Which is impossible against a team with a brain, but ok, you keep telling yourself that","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2015-03-11T00:22:11.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:105}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:7}} \n\nnuff said","replies":[{"poster":"mikemcparty","date":"2015-03-11T02:09:44.133+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"you didn't say anything. you just linked some champs. add something constructive or don't add anything.","replies":[{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2015-03-12T01:43:13.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you talk very toxic add something constructive or don't add anything.\nit was a fukin joke, wasn't meant to be constructive.","replies":[{"poster":"mikemcparty","date":"2015-03-13T04:32:01.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where was the joke?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ryvaku","date":"2015-03-10T16:55:13.670+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath and LeBlanc are more boring for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venetia Sylver","date":"2015-03-10T14:17:31.842+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there's also Malzahar.

I feel like it would be a lot easier to balance Katarina for all ranked if she were gated somehow and couldn't just spam abilities.\n\nTip for people looking to dig their way out of bronze: she's the queen of low ELO. If you picked katarina mid lane every single game, chances are that in 90% of those games people would not think to lock you down with their CC until it was way too late, or would waste so much time trying to lock you down that they would ignore the rest of your team in team fights and waste all of their CC on you. \n\nOr the enemy mid laner won't ping when you're missing. Though even if she does, her bot lane will probably just ignore the ping anyway. Bronze games are chaotic, and she thrives in chaotic situations.","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2015-03-10T21:50:52.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"two things one, Katarina is banned almost every game if you try to play at lowish elo, two the idea for her, riven and garen is that for them you can focus solely on improving either mechanically(riven) or strategically(Katarina) or can have a tank that can be played by anyone and is easy for new players to get used to.

As it stands I think every mana based champion needs some slight mana regen buff or at least a maximum mana buff across the board.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
