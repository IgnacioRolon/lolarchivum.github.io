I understand that as a private company you can punish anything you want and the first amendment in America doesn't matter, but do you really want to be known as an authoritarian anti free speech company? If players need to be protected from something as innocuous as \"GG EZ\" then we've reached a point where coddling them isn't going to help. Especially when there's an incredibly effective way for easily offended players to block/mute people who say something they don't like.\n\nBy no means am I defending players who cross the line with death threats or anything like that. That's legitimately breaking the law and it should be punished. However, \"GG EZ\" and other similar trash talk, which is a part of every competitive game in the world by the way, should not be a major concern for anyone. At some point it has to be on the easily offended to either grow a thicker skin or use the mute feature provided by you hard working people at Riot for this exact purpose. Remember everyone, sticks and stones may break your bones, but words can never hurt you. Everyone should've learned this simple fact from their mothers when they were kids.","replies":[{"poster":"Ypherion","date":"2016-08-22T20:31:01.849+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not too worried about, in this context, censorship.

Hockey (I'm Canadian) has a boat load of trash talk during the game, but that doesn't stop them from having, and using, a rule that severely punishes unsportsmanlike conduct.  Also, trash talk happens almost exclusively during play or outside the game asynchronously (i.e. trash talk someone during a press conference).  Rarely if ever is it at the beginning or end of the game.  I don't know of any sport where it is acceptable, upon winning, to walk over to the opponents and tell them it was an easy win.  If you look at other sports, especially globally, the degree of trash talk that is acceptable is much much lower.  Look at badminton, tennis etc.  And then as we go to games, take a look at what is ok in competitive board games.  Not a lot.\n\nLeague has it's own version of trash talk that I think is perfectly fine.  If someone flashes their champ mastery emote after killing me, or outplaying me, that has some effect on me but it's totally within reason.

The question is whether the behavior is a net positive for the game as a whole once you look at how it makes every player in the game feel/behave.

Some of it, like \"gg ez\" or \"uninstall fucker\", are not positive and should be treated as something to be removed from our community.","replies":[{"poster":"Darksyde","date":"2016-08-22T21:59:43.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ypherion,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WuiG5a1Y,comment-id=001600080000,timestamp=2016-08-22T20:31:01.849+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m not too worried about, in this context, censorship.

Some of it, like &quot;gg ez&quot; or &quot;uninstall fucker&quot;, are not positive and should be treated as something to be removed from our community.\n\nOn the point of trash talk in other games being limited to press conferences, I beg to differ. Have you ever watched an NFL game? The players get in each others faces and talk shit to each other all the time on the field. In fact, sometimes the confrontation comes to violence which is basically the only time the refs will actually step in and lay out some type of punishment. The random scuffles and chest beating that happens generally goes unaddressed by the officials, this would basically be the equivalent of someone calling the other team noobs in league. Thankfully League of Legends has an environment where no real harm can be done because physical violence isn't an option and words can't hurt you.\n\nAs for your \"safe\" trash talk, with all due respect, I think your version of trash talk belongs in pee wee football leagues. \"I'm gonna crush you\" sounds like something an 8 year old says trying to sound tough. Someone saying \"You suck\" shouldn't be considered \"over the line\" unless your line is miles away from the average person's line for reasonable trash talk in a competitive environment. \n\nI'm a huge advocate for free speech in every arena, whether it be in the legal arena being protected from the government, or in an online arena like social media or here in gaming. I see the loss of freedom of speech and expression as a huge negative which I don't think you've factored into your \"net positive\" calculation. This calculation gets even easier for me when you factor in the mute feature that anyone has readily available with literally two inputs from their keyboard/mouse. It's the simplest and most effective fix for this entire situation. People get to say what they want and express their opinions and ideas, and people who are offended by those ideas can quickly and easily remove them from their gaming experience. Everybody wins, at least that's the way I see it.\n\nI feel like this generation somehow became the most easily offended. The group of people most easily crippled by words. You'd think it would've been the opposite because we all grew up with the internet lol. I don't think adults need safe spaces or carebear zones. We don't need padded walls, kids gloves or training wheels. We just need to grow up.\n\nP.S. - I hope this conversation doesn't get me banned lol. Another problem with over policing is a lot of your playerbase starts to live in fear of stepping just an inch or two over the incredibly precariously placed \"line.\" ","replies":[{"poster":"Ypherion","date":"2016-08-22T22:46:38.186+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, I'd be really sad if players were in fear of posting opinions on the boards.

We need to create a culture where the greatest number of players can enjoy their experience (note I didn't say \"have fun\", because there are contexts where that's not realistic).  For players who don't enjoy significant trash talk, trash talk can ruin the experience.  For players who enjoy the banter, it's just less fun, hopefully not ruined.  I'd be concerned about players who play only for the trash talk...I doubt they'd be satisfied staying within reasonable bounds.\n\n> As for your \"safe\" trash talk, with all due respect, I think your version of trash talk belongs in pee wee football leagues\n\nTo some degree, this is fair.  My examples are very tame.  That said, consider that many players are in the early to mid teens.  Every organized sport I was a part of at that age heavily emphasized the difference between acceptable banter and unsportsmanlike conduct.

I don't want to censor players, except for certain extremes, well beyond the nuances we're talking about, where we as a company feel like we need to make a stand.  For the most part players should say what they want, and then deal with the consequences.\n\nFreedom of speech to me is the right to send messages I wish to, by voice, text, interpretive dance, whatever.  It does not provide protection from the consequences of said speech, especially in cases that do not involve government oversight.  If I go to a busy sandwich shop (I'm hungry..) and start a loud rant filled with hate speech, threats and other content deemed unacceptable by the community in and around that shop, I'm not going to get out without consequences.  They could be that I'm simply judged by everyone present, I could be told to leave, perhaps I caused people to fear for their safety so they call the cops and I'm arrested.  It's unlikely that handing out ear plugs (everybody muting me) would be a satisfactory resolution.  Yes, that's hyperbole, please don't take it literally...\n\nIn League, we want to offer tools for players to act when the speech of others offends them.  Players rarely see each other twice, so the default IRL social consequences are absent.  Asking a player to leave is not tenable due to the nature of the game.

Historically this has not been true, and there have always been social consequences to speech. Though what speech was unacceptable has changed DRAMATICALLY.

We don't want to punish people for every little thing.  We don't want to nanny players.  We want players to be able to provide meaningful negative feedback to those they find are impacting their game to offset the absence of the traditional, implicit systems that exist IRL.

When talking about consequences for speech and how it relates to free speech, I observe your right as a company to censor whatever you want, because you're not the government. Also, I agree that speech and behavior should obviously have social consequences even if there are no legal consequences, but in this context social consequences would be coming from your peers and not the establishment. In this scenario, Riot Games is the establishment, you're basically the government of the league community. Receiving punishment from you would be the equivalent of receiving punishment from the goverment in real life. \n\nFor instance, a permanent ban in league is basically the video game version of life in prison. I think most people who the system deems as \"toxic\" are fully capable of accepting social consequences for their speech. Things like retaliation from other parties involved, being muted or being excluded from a group. These are what I think of when I hear \"social\" consequences. A punishment coming from those in power, the establishment or government of league, is not what comes to mind. \n\nYour comment about reporting being equivalent to calling the cops in real life is actually quite an apt comparison. Saying some mean words to a stranger in real life won't get the cops called on me because in real life people don't crumble under the weight of a nasty comment. Somehow on the internet the opposite is true, people can't give up their right to be an asshole quickly enough if it keeps them safe from words on a screen. Again, I think everyone should have the right to be an asshole, and of course I have the right to mute them or not associate with them ever again which would be the social consequence of their actions. I would never call the cops on them though, until they do something severe of course.\n\n\"Muting alone is not enough, and probably never will be.  Since there's no negative feedback to the person who is being seen as offensive, they keep going.  Why would they change?\"\n\nMy question is, why should they change? If the mute feature acts as a wall between the player who is easily offended and the offending player, why does the offending player need to change? I think the easily offended player could deal with some thicker skin, but I'd never force them to change. If they want to give power to words on a screen then by all means they can get offended and immediately mute anyone who says anything negative to them. I believe words can only have power when you give them power, they can only hurt you when you let them. However, when you have this built in wall to keep those words out then even the easily offended can take the power back with one click of a button. Also as you hinted, what's seen as \"offensive\" is highly subjective and I guarantee you that you can find someone who is offended by anything, even your safe trash talk from earlier. At this point, who becomes the soul arbiter of what is and is not offensive? What's the upper limit of offended players that you're willing to live with? Set the bar too low and everyone is in danger of being banned, set the bar too high and it's the wild west you're so afraid of where everyone can say anything. How do you find out where to draw the line with the ever changing culture. Will the line ever need to be moved? Could \"GG EZ\" be too offensive now but totally okay later down the line when new trend develops that's perceived as being worse?\n\nOn a related topic, and one that ties in nicely with the sandwich shop analogy, the issue of trolling seems to be a much more important one in my mind but it feels as though Riot cares less about it than the \"toxicity\" which can be almost entirely solved with the mute feature. Unfortunately, there's no mute feature to stop intentional feeders, trolls, or afkers from ruining games but it never gets the same spotlight that nasty words and unsportsmanlike conduct does. Back to the sandwich shop, I see toxicity the same way you do in your analogy, someone yelling mean things in a shop and being asked to leave. I don't think threats or hate speech are covered in this situation as I'm not arguing for that to be allowed in league, by all means ban those people who threaten others or spew bigoted hate speech. However, the trolls, feeders, and afkers who ruins games are basically the equivalent of a maniac coming into the sandwich shop and bashing the place up with a baseball bat. It's on a whole different level from toxicity in terms of the damage it causes to the game but as I said it seems that it doesn't get the spotlight as much. I'd like to know from your point as a Rioter, do you think it's easier to be banned for overly toxic chat messages or intentional feeding and ruining games?","replies":[{"poster":"Ypherion","date":"2016-08-23T06:22:47.954+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Want to give a quick reply before I call it a night.\n\nI think we agree about social consequences being the appropriate response to mild-moderate negative (subjective ofc) behavior.  However, where we differ is that I don't believe that an online community like League inherently has the same capability for consequences as more traditional circumstances.\n\nAt the very least, a huge swath of core human psychology and behavior is totally skipped: the automatic, unpreventable interpretation of the physical expression and body language of others.  If I yell at someone at a pick up basketball game, or even say something disrespectful that I thought was fine, I'm immediately inundated with feedback from every person I see.  This type of interpersonal empathy having no impact is quite literally a sign of certain social disorders.  Unfortunately, by having players hidden behind networks and screens, every player is saddled to some degree with this deficit.\n\nI think it's important to compensate for what is lost during interactions with physical presence, because of the inherent lack in the digital space.   There needs to be ways for quick feedback that can trigger an empathetic response, and also ways to mimic the more persistent social consequences that occur in real life (e.g. people get asked not to come back if they've offended someone and/or a group).  Muting is one such tool, but it just isn't an effective measure.  It fails to provide the feedback we're missing by the nature of the digital space.\n\nOn your point about feeding/trolling etc.: holy balls is that behavior infuriating.  We have systems in place to act on it, but the truth is that so far it has been much harder to reliably differentiate trolling/feeding from a bad game (yes, going 0/10/2 in a game can be just having a bad game) that it has to separate highly negative chat from banter or idle swearing (which we're fine with).  We are punishing players who blatantly troll, but the systems simply aren't as effective and to keep from falsely punishing people we have to let a higher percentage slip through.

As an active of member PB&M boards, I truely care about the behavioral systems. More than gameplay (what do I know, I'm a Bronzie). So let me come at you with some questions / concerns / opinions / discussions.\n\n--- \n1) People frequently post there about \"WHY DIDN'T THEY GET PUNISHED\" and my standard response is \"Riot is working on improving the visibility on behavioral systems, but probably won't see it until the new client is up and running\". \n\nPeople would see some peace when I say that and they are glad that Riot is working on it, but Should I stop telling people that?\n\n---\n\n2) I know you can't tell us anything in regards to up coming features, but Lyte back in the days said that he didn't want to display \"How close are you to being punished\", as the toxics will see that they will be punished soon and back off, thus dodging being punished.\n\nPersonally, I think if the toxics did back off for a period of time for the punishment scale to decay, the game would benefit from a period of lesser toxicity.\n\nThink of it like what Harvey Dent said to the Mayor of Gotham in Batman - The Dark Knight movie. Removing the small thugs off the street for 3 months, will keep the place clean for 3 months and still be worth. \n\n---\n\n3) What do you think if the system showed \"how close you are to being punished\", \"punishment decay scale\", and a \"toxicity level\". Probably using text / colors as a visual scale instead of numbers.\n\nWhere if you tell others to kys and drink bleach the \"toxicity level\" and \"how close you are to being punished\" will sky rocket. The decay would be something like \"50+ games remaining to decay into good standing\", similar to the hextech rewards, but with more visibility. \n\nIt'll also tell you what your next punishment level is based on your toxicity level, as we know that extreme verbal abuse / hate speech can skip punishment tiers. I get so tired of those people saying \"I didn't know my next punishment is a permaban, else I would have stopped. Rito please give me another chance\" when they clearly didn't read their emails (not that it helps when that warning is the last sentence of the email).\n\n---\n\n4) What I see alot of people talk about when they post \"BRING BACK THE TRIBUNAL\" topics, is that they either think their punishment is unjust (and want to be judged by others) or that they actually want to see visibility that they reports / actions are contributing (they want to punish the ones getting away). \n\nI'm going to ignore those whom think their punishment is unjust, but focus on those whom want more justice, or at least they want to be able to see more justice. \n\nTantrum / Lyte  / WookieCookie (Can't remember whom) did say that they didn't want to spam the ones supplying the reports with notifications that someone got punished. Personally, I want to see that my reports are doing something and I am contributing towards the community, and I don't mind getting notifications when someone I initially reported does eventually get punished. \n\nGranted maybe the notification spam would be so high that in due time, whenever I log in, I'll see that notification everytime and maybe people will just eventually ignore it. But in combination with a system with better visibility, I think alot of those notifications will be highly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Ypherion","date":"2016-08-23T20:26:13.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"WHY DIDN'T THEY GET PUNISHED\"\n\nThere's a couple reasons for this:\n1. We don't do a great job of surfacing punishments.  We don't rely on bans as much as we used to because it causes a bunch of weird behaviors, like creating smurfs to kill the time. So a player could still be active after being a jerk, but they may be in a low priority queue for a certain number of games, or chat restricted.\n2. We tune our systems to avoid false punishments as much as possible.  The inherent trade off is that some people get away with some crappy behavior for a while.  They nearly always get caught eventually.  In cases where they aren't, we try to learn from them and improve our systems.\n3. Not all behavior merits a punishment from just one game.  It's easy to believe that if they are a jerk in your game, they probably are every game, but this actually isn't true in the vast majority of cases; players can vary a lot in their behavior from game to game.  I still fall victim to this thinking all the time, even knowing the \"real\" circumstances, so I empathize with the feeling that the player got away with it.\n\n> \"How close are you to being punished\"\n\nI was actually just talking with another designer about this this morning.  I agree that getting them to back off for a bit would be good.  What I don't want is to give too much information that will allow players to tailor their behavior to just barely avoid punishment.\n\nWe're talking about some kind of feature that provides an idea of how you're doing, gives you more immediate feedback etc., but it's literally in the realm of discussion at this point.  There's something compelling in the space, but definitely a lot of nuances to figure out as well.\n\n> tell you what your next punishment level is based on your toxicity level\n\nPunishment is no longer perfectly mapped to previous punishment level.  More severe behaviors may accelerate it.  That said, I think it's fair that players should understand the potential consequences for their actions, and that right now it can be hard to find.  I'll bring this up the next time I talk to the right team.\n\n> I want to see that my reports are doing something\n\nTotally agree here.  We might turn up the cadence, though it's not my call ultimately, or we may want to go with a different system.  There may be more value in a periodic aggregate feedback system rather than a per-report one.  Not sure, TBH.\n\nRE: too much spam, given the current levels of (valid) reporting we see, I wouldn't be too worried about this _once Honor is in a better state_ (SoonTM).  Even if we're not spamming, I'm not a fan of biasing the general experience to focus so much on negative moments without celebrating the good ones.  I think it paints a really bad, and also inaccurate, picture of player experience and has a risk of being a bit of a vicious cycle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2016-08-22T19:48:49.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It could work for the younger players that don't work their way around the filters as often or just the newer ones. Ofcourse, older players that are toxic can get around it but they are also more susceptible to getting punished for prolonged negative behaviour, am i right?","replies":[{"poster":"Ypherion","date":"2016-08-22T20:32:24.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think younger players would be less likely to be the cause of adaptation, but would be very quick to mimic whatever becomes popular.\n\nTo be clear, it's not that it wouldn't work to some degree, it's that there are likely better places to focus our development bandwidth.","replies":[{"poster":"Boiled Triangles","date":"2016-08-22T22:09:05.370+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if you made it so if a player says something like \"gg ez\" or \"kys\", nobody sees it except the player who typed it, and the game does not give any indication that the message was filtered. Additionally, don't even tell the playerbase this so that most people won't even be aware of this. This way, the negative messages get filtered, and many of the toxic players wouldn't even know they have to work around the filters and come up with a new phrase. Think of it like shadowbanning certain phrases.\n\nJust a thought.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-08-22T19:26:15.241+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"In devils advocate mode, what about the occasional legitimate uses of \"gg ez\" where someone is legitimately saying good game to an ezreal?","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-08-22T19:34:49.028+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say GG ezreal then instead of using a term thats regarded by most as negative.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
