More slayer oriented.\n\nIf you look at let's say shyvana, she uses her ult to get right in the middle of the enemy team and then she dishes out loads of AOE damage with her W, E and dragon form Q.

The duelist is more oriented towards ignoring the enemy team (ex: Irelia's passive making it hard to peel her the more enemies are around her, Wukong gaining tankiness in a similiar manner) or denying them an access to their target (ex: Xin and Camille ult).\n\nGood examples of divers would be {{champion:254}} {{champion:102}}  {{champion:120}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:62}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-12-27T15:39:23.362+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Divers\n\n\"Divers are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class.

Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets\"\n\nThe key difference is that skirmishers are more dps based while divers are more bursted based. And skirmishers usually have more freeform mobility while divers is more straightforward (Divers mainly use their mobility once in a fight to engage.

All of those being nerfed simultaneously would make her gutter trash.\n\nAdditionally, her ult is fine. I cannot express to you how many people I see who just run to the edge and sit there when she ults them, while their team watches. First of all, attack her. If you know you're dead, at least beat her up a bit. Secondly, your team should rush in on her when they can, it doesn't keep them out. Making her ult blinkable/dashable/flashable would defeat the whole purpose of her ult. It would basically mean that immobile champions are 100% screwed by her and that any champion made or reworked after 2014 will ignore her ult entirely. It's not a \"broken\" mechanic that it shuts down mobility - Cassiopeia's Miasma does the exact same thing for as long as you're in it, and it's a basic ability. Camille's ult does no damage on its own, unlike Jarvan's, so it needs something to distinguish itself.
