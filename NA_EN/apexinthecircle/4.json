With a  {{item:3165}}  I will get almost if not all the minions from a minion wave to begin with.

Silver 1 is still very bad though.\n\n>if you are an adept veigar player as you suggest, then you know what matchups to play him in or not\n\nI literally played him every single game. from p5 to d5 it took me 50 games and I had a 16 game win streak at one point and a couple of winning games before 18 minutes. Theirs unfavorable matchups but veigar is able to win every single one. Only until you get into high level 5's does he face issues. Dabox also got to top 10 challenger playing only veigar so matchups don't really matter.\n\n>also notice that I said harass whilst farming. It is possible to do both\n\nIt's very possible, and I do it all the time, but the mind set isn't for stacking your Q. Besides canon I only farm Q because it's more easy to last hit with. Focusing on farming your Q drains your mana like crazy. THe most optimal build path used to be no mana items and dfg rush but they took dfg out so it's not that bad to build morello nomicon now.\n\n>if they have strong early game, sit back and farm more than you harass\n\nThis is really irrelevant. It doesn't really matter how strong their early game is you can still win it and harass them. He has a point and click Q which makes this possible so if you're good at juking it really pays off.\n\n>Also way to be humble there. oh I am amazing, you should listen to me.\n\nCan't remember if I was going for humble because I kept boasting about myself but I am amazing at veigar and you probably should listen to me.

There are not only downsides to all these things :P\n\nTrue but you can't just expect them to literally nerf 2 of his skills and expect turning something into a skillshot to make everything better. I honestly do see the upsides to it being a skill shot, checking bushes, seeing if blue is up more chase potential. But the downsides outweigh the good (IMO). It force pushes his lane which opens it up for ganks, and combined with the nerfed E it literally cuts his survivability(which let's face it, outside of his stun was extremely low) to an even lower level. If his stun was such an issue why not change it 4 seasons ago when he was released. \n\nIt's 4 years later and people are just now coming out of the wood-works opposing his E saying that it's problematic. The real issue here is that he counters mobile champions in a mobile heavy meta where not getting his is the name of the game. Turning his E into a skill shot just enforces this notion ontop of his E nerf and ontop of his R nerf.\n\nSo why is Zed, Akali, Katarina,Ahri and Yasuo allowed to be so safe while still retaining the ability to burst someone down. I mean Zed can 100-0 you with little to no counterplay. So why can't Veigar, someone who has no sustain and no mobility .","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-17T07:00:21.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"The only nerf I find to be ridiculous is the scaling on his ult being cut.\n\nThe E nerf was going to happen eventually, we all knew it.\n\nRevert the ult nerfs and I think this would be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Auron","date":"2015-02-17T14:35:44.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Remove the target's AP ratio, THEN we can talk about increasing his base ratio.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-17T16:09:35.804+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Uh no, that would remove the entire purpose of playing veigar.\n\nI could just take Annie and do his job with 100% more success if that was to happen.\n\nThe AP ratio nerfs need to be undone.
