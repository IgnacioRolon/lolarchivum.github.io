Constantly monitoring your positioning with your stars is exhausting. Its not rewarding like normal poke is, and it just feels monotonous. You land a Viktor E and you feel like a king. You sit there and land an Aurelion W and you feel more like a sawblade as you slowly whittle them down (if they let you). And IF you can even land his stun (which appears to miss a lot more than it should based on the animation), you aren't rewarded with anything more than a 1-1.5 second stun, which isnt enough time to take advantage of your W because you still have to keep them at a particular distance! With most champions, you can get in front of them or beside them so its much harder for them to escape you.
