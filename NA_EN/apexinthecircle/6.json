U have a QSS on ur Q, essentially, and when you dont use the Q properly or too early, there isnt a point and you die. A lot of yi players engage ganks with Q and either end up taking turret dmg, or die without any successful gank unless the person is below 25% hp. The propper way to gank with Yi or any big gap closer champion is to first walk up, without using your mobility, wait for them to flash, or get away, then use your mobility. You can use Yi's Q to dodge so much and outplay so well its unbelievable the amount of mechanics a right click champ has. I once outplayed an adc who was autoing me in my W when my Q had a 5 second cooldown. I waiting for my W to stack my passive, and waiting for my Q to go to 2 second cd (i was at 15% hp mind you) I then flash up to her, get my passive auto off, Q, then auto attack with E enabled. I dont know how much of this you understand but i hope you do.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Thingamajig","date":"2019-04-23T12:12:05.238+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":4,"body":"You can't deal with his true damage but you can deal with his physical damage\nthats why the counter to vayne is armor instead of health\nyou are going to resist more damage from vayne with high armor values than high health values\nofcourse you need a middle ground so other champions don't melt you instead\n\nand yes highlander immunes all kind of slows including Fear Charm and Poly\nthis includes atk speed slows \n\nCC is the best counter to YI and as cowsep throws fits every game Zhonya\nany way to make him stop playing or extend your life counters yi\n\nAlistar alone can shut down an Yi completely\nA fiddle fear alone denies Yis full highlander\n\na long time ago i had an Yi OTP repeatedly against me like 3-4 games straight\nhe smashed the first 2 games without an effort\nthe next games i kept picking fiddle into him and saving my fear for him alone\nand he was completely useless","replies":[{"poster":"Sillae","date":"2019-04-24T02:37:31.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ornndyr2k19,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EIjEuE7k,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-04-23T12:12:05.238+0000)\n>\n> You can't deal with his true damage but you can deal with his physical damage\n> thats why the counter to vayne is armor instead of health\n> you are going to resist more damage from vayne with high armor values than high health values\n> ofcourse you need a middle ground so other champions don't melt you instead\n> \n> and yes highlander immunes all kind of slows including Fear Charm and Poly\n> this includes atk speed slows \n> \n> CC is the best counter to YI and as cowsep throws fits every game Zhonya\n> any way to make him stop playing or extend your life counters yi\n> \n> Alistar alone can shut down an Yi completely\n> A fiddle fear alone denies Yis full highlander\n> \n> a long time ago i had an Yi OTP repeatedly against me like 3-4 games straight\n> he smashed the first 2 games without an effort\n> the next games i kept picking fiddle into him and saving my fear for him alone\n> and he was completely useless\n\n\"cc counters yi\"\n\ncongrats you have cracked the code\n\ncrowd control is definitely the only thing that should counter a champ because crowd control is only effective on a small number of champs and yi isn't in his q for the majority of each of his fights\n\n\nwait","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2019-04-24T03:22:10.569+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While cc is effective on everyone, it is not equally effective.\n\ngetting stunned as mundo for 2 secs isn't as disastrous as getting stunned as yi for 2 secs. \n\nAs for your statement that he is alpha striking to dodge your cc and damage, I'll give you this question.\n\nWhy aren't you just timing your cc to hit him right out of alpha?

Yes, Yi gets true damage, and you can't reduce his attack speed, but it's a static amount of true damage, and he still deals lots of physical. Therefore building HP+armor *does* extend your life duration against him...he just does a lot of damage, so it may not feel like it.\n\nVayne on the other hand deals  % of your total HP in true damage.

And get rekt by a \"brain dead champ\" and realize all your try harding is useless without any actual skill or understanding of the game.\n> \n> Did you know I walked away from a Yi once? It was insane. He only hit me twice. Nerf walk speed Riot pls.\n\nthe biggest issue with yi is that he thrives in solo Q. i dont feed yi, but my team will feed him and i cant do anything because they will be tilted and not know to cc him and cc hi mafter he QSS. and the games over\n\nlck people dont feed the enemy jungler. its 2-2 like 22 minutes in. solo q its 14 mins in 22-22 aka he thrives.","replies":[{"poster":"SirHydro","date":"2019-05-08T01:51:11.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps the main reason I can't fully enjoy this game: My success is directly tied to the performance of four other strangers. And because of Riot's rules, I can't \"encourage\" my team mates to do better, because simply asking our lvl3 Eve to stop trying to invade Kha Zix will result in Eve feeling that she's been attacked and reporting us for harass.\n\nEvery game is nothing but Riot's algorythym struggling to keep you in a 50/50 win/lose ratio. Is it \"time\" for you to win? Riot gives you competant players and gives the enemy team 1 afk and 1 tilter. And almost always 1 person that while they try, they are just bad.\n\nIs it \"time\" for  you to lose? Riot will give you an afk and a Leona/Lux duo bot lane and pit you up against a player enemy team 3 whole tiers above you. I have very little control over any game's outcome, barely any control over my own performance. And video games are supposed to be fun. They're supposed to reward a player's skill expression. This game does not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aseraan","date":"2019-04-23T22:50:53.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please lemme join i have tales too:\n-like the time i flashed away from him AFTER HE  LANDED HIS Q and he could not follow me anymore what a brilliant idea\n-or the time i was using zony he q's on me and pops out like a total  stoog getting killed by my ignite\n-OR the time i was landing my CC skillshot E whit velkoz under myself  cuz as a yi main i know  where he will pop out  from the q and just straight  wqr ed him right after as he  sloged to the conclusion hes DED\n-or the time when  i literaly landed any kind of skill on him \n-or the time  when anyone in my team had any idea how to play the game  and not lose literally to any champ \n\nOh  gosh the tales for the campfire are the besties indeed.","replies":[{"poster":"SirHydro","date":"2019-05-08T01:47:14.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Listens to the good hearty campfire tales of the rift and nods with a chug of his ale*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2019-04-23T11:49:59.629+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"thornmail is also a joke of an item.
