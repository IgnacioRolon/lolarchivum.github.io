So if a Red or a forum moderator would like to explain as to why it belongs there that would be extremely helpful instead of just outright deleting the thread.\r\n\r\nthat being said I know it may seem insignificant but I myself am closing my wallet off until the bots are at least partially removed from Aram games, or any other game mode for that fact. It&#039;s getting disgusting and out of hand and I see nothing being done to ween it or stop it. The bot in my last aram was level 27 which means it&#039;s been doing this for sometime now.\r\n\r\n*Thread got removed again, and again I would like to know why this belongs on this board and not say gameplay since you know...It&#039;s altering gameplay.*","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-24T10:04:06.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya know, it is funny.

At level 30 I rarely ever see them. Like close to never, and I play a decent amount of ARAM. On a new account, I see bots more often. Still not a lot, but definitely more than my main account.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-25T02:12:18.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I play a tank in aram, I have a weird strategy that usually works out.

However the bots are usually pretty obvious, like not reacting to your team at all, they will full dive 1v5 and then not try to run away at all.. or they will run away way too late like when they only have 1 turret hit of HP left. You not staying with your team is just as bad as a bot who dives 1v5, and this is usually why one or the other team loses ARAM is from one person soloing too much. I'm not trying to criticize your play style, but you need to stay with the team especially if you're the only tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-25T10:08:31.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your \"dead giveaway\" that somebody is a bot is a strategy that people can employ successfully (as I do) then don't you think you might just be overly suspicious?","replies":[{"poster":"Forced Feed","date":"2017-03-25T10:20:16.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm talking about when they do what you're saying the entire game. If they do it 3 or 4 times it's fine, but when that's all they do all game is dive 1v5 every time they respawn then that's a dead giveaway it's a bot or intent feeding. You even said \"People see me diving the enemy team alone\", which whether that is a bot or not it deserves reporting because you're not working with the team at all. \nYour team would do better if you dove when they are around, just because it works out sometimes does not mean it's okay to ignore your team and try to solo. I understand as a tank in ARAM  you have to initiate and sometimes your team does not follow up with you, but that's way different than \"diving the enemy team alone\" as you said.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-25T10:23:23.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am though.

The time inbetween this is perfect, and it's why I have to keep making new accounts. I would make an ARAM only account but that ruins the random element for me.
