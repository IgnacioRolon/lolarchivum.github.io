Not for ethnicity or diversity sake, but rather that a team game can actually be a team game.\n\nIt's a false analogy.\n\nThe McDonald's workers are by contract meant to know and speak the official language of whatever, because they're providing a service as a business, which makes them by obligation meant to know the official language and speak it as a default option to their customers (secondary options would be applied if communication can not be established too, such as grabbing someone who can speak the customer's language from the back to the counter).\n\nBut no one is providing service that's contracted by a business to play with their teammates, so they are under no obligation to speak the official language.\n\nThe correct analogy is that: There is a community game of whatever where everyone is free to join, and this guy comes in while speaking in a non-official language, and everyone is looking at him funny until one guy tells him \"for the love of god, speak English\".\n\nDo you think it's justified?\n\nAgain, unless the teamwork is seriously being crippled, or that there is this dickbag who purposely goes to sabotage the team communication, otherwise there is literally nothing wrong if you don't speak the official language of whatever as long as there are using work-arounds like pings, or at least they follow the rest of the team.\n\nIf you have to have a team that all speak in the same language for clarify purposes, you can simply organise a premade.

Otherwise it's called comparing apples to oranges. Just as fried noodles and spaghetti are not the same deal even if they both use noodles, the 2 random scenarios of speaking a particular official language or otherwise is not immediately valid just because the scenes both involve the act of speaking. Again, analogies can only be drawn if the situation is comparable, substitute-able, or even identical contextually.\n\nAnd no, if someone says \"soz no English\" and you immediately assume they said so because they're some random dickbags wanting to sabotage the communication without any further proof, it's called a negative-bias, where you assume something or someone (and their actions) you can't understand or are not familiar with, to be against your interest by default. Which is an incredibly bad way of looking at things.\n\nThirdly, just because you might have never encountered someone who just can't speak English, or that they are so bad at it they don't like using it, or whatever personal reasons they may have but is not out to ruin the party, it doesn't mean the circumstance is not valid or present. After all, general statistics tells us that English speakers is only the 3rd largest population despite vast global uses, behind Mandarin and Spanish speakers, it's obviously likely for someone to encounter others even in English speaking countries who can either not or that they are very bad at English (and like wise for other official languages of whatever places that are more diversely populated). And there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nIn fact, there is nothing wrong with it if you just don't want to speak English, as long as the premise is not rooted in trying to disrupt the communication. Just as someone being completely silent, muting everyone at the start of the game etc are all valid personal choices (and no one is ever against it if someone were to make the call) if they use alternatives like pings and actually engage in team work, there is nothing to give a shit about whether or not the person behind a monitor really has an A grade on their most recent English/whatever-official-language exam.","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2017-04-29T17:17:33.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're going way to deep into this.
