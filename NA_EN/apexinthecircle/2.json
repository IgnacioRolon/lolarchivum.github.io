Bang another 10 lp lost and a 30 minute ban.\n\nGet on smurf and try doing a draft normal and I get \"an unknown error has occurred.\" and my client shuts down.\n\n\nSeriously my ping is fine my internet is fine, pinging the NA server nets me a 64ms ping with no packet loss, so I have no clue what's going on.  All I know is that I'm sitting 20 lp short because of a client bug splat that just started today.","replies":[{"poster":"HepoK","date":"2017-07-05T15:02:23.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problems but on EU west serveur","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T04:43:46.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats occur when a weird interaction happens with either your system drivers or hardware.
