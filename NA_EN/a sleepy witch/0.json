I also kinda help teammates gather cs, so they rarely ever fall behind. Oh, and ever since I started playing thresh my warding has been spot-on, resulting in KDA going up and opposing junglers being a combined 4 for 51 on bottom lane ganks in my past 10 games. \n✩ weaknesses: Back in the day while playing a game called \"Runescape\", I kinda had a bad experience with skype that resulted in me having to file a restraining order on someone and has made me not want to use teamspeak related things. The incident was kinda scarring, would rather avoid using those things altogether. In the actual game, my champion pool \"may\" conflict with other lanes, as I have a habit of running things like heca/lulu top and support kennen/trundle/shen/ekko.\n✩ time zone?: PST\n✩ how do you feel about voice chat?: Don't really care for it, look up\n✩ tell me a little bit about yourself, please?: Back in the day, I was considered one of those people who knew lots about the games I played but couldn't always make things work due to extraneous issues. When I started playing this game, the same thing rang true for a bit (as despite knowing the ins and outs of every lane and half the champions, I couldn't really do much with any of them barring shen/shaco). Rather than perfecting all of them, I've decided to focus on one genre and kinda be good at that, to be less of a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" and more of a \"jack of one trade, master of something\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azazyel Senpai","date":"2015-08-21T23:12:18.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ign azazyel senpai \nmy main roles is support and jg im best at peeling and with good communication I never fail to get my adc fed I also play passive top \nstrengths support my team and being reliable  \nweakness probably since im a supporter im not going to get very fed lol \n\nfor voice chat I use mostly Skype but could get ts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xayahs bich","date":"2015-08-21T23:08:59.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"✩ age: 18\n✩ SR or TT?: SR\n✩ main role(s): Mid>Jungle>Support>ADC>Top\n✩ do you shotcall?: yes\n✩ if somebody else is shotcaller, is that okay?: I will follow whoever is the leader\n✩ would you be willing to be a sub?: yes\n✩ favourite champions: Kayle, Talon, Veigar, xerath, Ahri, Urgot\n✩ strengths: I Ward a lot.
