For champs like Lux, that means you get off devastating lasers more often.  That&#039;s neat and all...\nBut how does the rune interact with champions that have access to R immediately.  I&#039;m talking Elise, Jayce, Karma, Nidalee, or, I guess if you really want to be inclusive, Udyr.\nFor Karma it might seem obvious, since the cooldown is fairly large still, but I just want to make sure.  Especially since, if you really consider it, you can in fact have up to 9% before minions reach the lane - though that is at the cost of not having it for level 1 fights.  Is that right though?  I just want to make sure.\nEdit: I also want to double check something for Karma really quick.  Does the extra 2% apply to the cooldown that is triggering it, or the next one only?  I'm doing calculations for both out of curiosity, and even if it is the latter you can have all 15% before 3 minutes, and have Mantra back up at 3:01ish.  With only Runes for cooldown taken into account.  You could even say that it is expecting the Karma to be AFK stacking this, since her passive lowers the cooldown for each ability and auto attack on a champ.  So it is actually faster.\n\nAs for the others, including Udyr - though he&#039;s a special case - their &#039;ultimates&#039; are changing forms.  And the cooldown is already small as is.  Does it just make it so you&#039;ll be able to switch between faster?  Or does it not work at all?\n\nSorry if these questions sound stupid and obvious, but I haven&#039;t physically played the game in 2 months, and haven&#039;t had a match on SR in almost 5 (that 2 months statement is for 1 rotated game mode.  Only one.  lol), so I am operating only based on numbers and memory of the mechanics.\n I&#039;ll admit though, of all of them, Karma is the one I actually wanted to ask this for, cause... I don&#039;t play the others at all.  lol  But I thought it would be good to find out for all of them anyways anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-10-20T20:29:04.809+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:43}} is the only one Im worried about out of the ones you named. With the others, it wouldn't matter too much and would likely just reduce their 1 second cool down transform cool down to 0.45 seconds max (0.4 with another rune). It does actually work on Karma last time I tested it by the way.\nUdyr doesn't have an ultimate, so it's completely useless on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Gen Nakazora","date":"2017-10-20T20:40:59.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I expected as much with Udyr, and I agree, the others hardly make a big impact on their cooldowns, but I just thought to ask on principle.  Who knows, maybe having the ability to change forms that TINY bit faster on Elise will work for better cocoon combos.  Or maybe Jayce will be able to speed through lanes that much faster with the extra movespeed from being able to transform just that tiny bit faster.  It isn't huge, like Karma would be, but it isn't totally pointless.  Plus, I'm just generally curious about stuff like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MarvelOtter","date":"2017-10-20T07:36:12.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is actually a pretty good point.\non some champs(elise, udyr, nid) i dont see it as a big deal. their cds are already super low\nwith karma it could be a problem early game, already having her ult-q makes early game damage pretty nasty, and now she gets 15% cd bonus cd off of it even before other champs hit 6?\nthe simple solution is to make it not apply until lv 6, or when you apply 1 point into it. the question is whether or not it actually is important enough to address. it might not be","replies":[{"poster":"Gen Nakazora","date":"2017-10-20T07:47:55.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was actually doing the math on it.  If you use Mantra at 0:00, so go lightning quick and use that ult immediately, you can use it 3 times before the 2 minute mark.  Minions reach bot lane around 1:45ish.  You can have Mantra back up after 3 uses by 1:49, give or take 2 seconds.  That means as the minions start hitting each other, you'll have 11% on the Ultimate Hat, which puts Mantra at 35.5 seconds (only adding in the 5% from Cosmic Insight.  No other source is being considered for these calculations for the sake of accuracy across multiple scenarios.)  That's almost 7 seconds off, and using it again after that will just bump it down further.  Getting 5 uses before 4 minutes in seems entirely possible.\n\nEdit: Yeah, I was off by about 2 seconds on that.  So, at 1:51 you have mantra for it's 4th use, and the first one available in lane with this scenario.  In other words, before 2 minutes you can have 4 of the 5 stacks for Ultimate Hat.  And that is reasonable.

I mentioned it in my edit to some degree, but Karma can get all 5 stacks for that rune and have it back up at 3:01... without counting any cooldown reduction from anything but runes.  Add in Ancient Coin's extra 5% at level 1, and you can cut off about 10 seconds of that.  That means around - and maybe even before - the time anyone in bot lane reaches level 3, you have that stacked up.  And the cooldown at that point is 32.13.  Almost 10 seconds off your level 1 mantra, which gives you so much damage on your Q for those early level trades.  105 base without the AOE detonation, .9 AP scaling without the AOE detonation, and if you add it in... 155 with 1.5 AP scaling.

This is ridiculously broken, as any fellow Jayce mains will agree that transformation cooldowns make or break many fights. This is just enough time to use all skills on one form, transfer to the other form, get all three skills off, and transform back with one or two skills already being back up, your q's for example.\n\nCan't wait to utilise this again in game. Hard carries are once more a very easy possibility with Jayce and other transforming champs like Nid and Elise. Karma is about to be mega broken also.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2017-10-20T22:20:58.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried it as Karma against doombots.\n\nAs far as I can tell, it's not worth wasting it to stack it up since it gets stacked up so quickly anyway and she's pretty well gated by  mana.

Again , I was against bots, so take it with a grain of salt, but my impression is that having mantra up is usually worth more than another 2% cd, especially since you'll cap that after 4 casts anyway (after the first immediate one in base) and since if you mantra Q two people in botlane it knocks 4s off the cooldown + another 2 for anyone caught in the second blast.\n\nAgain, Karma stacks it up so quickly that you might as well use the empowered ability while you're at it. And mantra Q gives her a lot of level 1 power.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
