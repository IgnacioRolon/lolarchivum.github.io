{"poster":"I Will Flash In","date":"2018-09-18T19:25:21.142+0000","title":"Few powerful options to counter Akali in the midlane","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Gameplay+","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}}  ** Has seen so much play recently, even competitively as showcased ![during this Flashback episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si9Mkq67blQ)  and according to [Champion.gg](https://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.banRate&amp;order=descend) she is the most banned champion this patch, people _FEAR_ that champion. In this post, I hope to give you few options to beat her in lane so she cannot take over the game.**\n\nFirst, let&#039;s talk about Akali&#039;s strenghts, and why she is feared : \n- Her shroud (W spell which makes her invisible), makes her invisible to _EVERYTHING_ and most notoriously, turrets, which means her diving potential is throught the roof. \n- Her Q which throws 5 projectiles in front of her and heal her if she has close to full energy gives her a good in lane sustain.\n- She takes very short trades in lane, and then hides in her shroud which has a shorter cooldown than before, it makes it very hard to win trades, and she can heal back up if you manage to chuck her. \n- Most importantly, her kill potential post 6 with E (Gap closing ability which help her trigger her passive, a stronger AA after she has left a certain area arround the enemy) and her R (it gives very good mobility and crazy execution damage on the second part of the spell). \n\n**Counters :**\n\n{{champion:45}}  is surprisingly good against Akali, his E stops all movement and two of his basic damaging abilities are not targeted, it means he can target her while she is in her shroud. This matchup will in my opinion revolve arround your E (which you should max second after Q for decreased cooldown and increased crowd control). The key is to not cast it unless she jumps on you, or play very passive when it&#039;s on cooldown since it&#039;s very easy for her to gap close. Arguably a skilled match up in your favor.\n\n{{champion:131}}  is emerging as a good in lane counter at the moment. You&#039;ll have comparable wave clear but you&#039;ll pack a much greater punch in short engages (in which Akali thrives) not to mention the shield from your W (which you should max because it&#039;s just too good against melee assassins). Also, both of your damaging abilities (Q and W) can hit her in her shroud. The only problem comes from the fact that Akali brings much more than you late game especially during teamfights and that she ganks better and towerdives better when she is roaming. If she plays passiv in lane and roams for teamfights, it&#039;ll be hard. \n\n{{champion:38}}  is very good against Akali. His ability to soak up magic damage gives him the ability to keep up with Akali&#039;s short trades pre 6 and his ability to escape makes him safe. He goes toe to toe if not better in roams and his late game is unravelled, sadely, most people who intend to play Akali midlane will ban this guy. \n\n{{champion:90}} is the clear winner for me, hands down. You will push much much faster (assuming you max Q) which prevents her for roaming. Your passiv is a pain for all burst champions and champions who rely on short trades in general, Silence is great also and has a comparable cooldown with her shroud so you should be able to hit it every time, and if she wants to towerdive you, just R when she shows up and that&#039;s going to be a very sad Akali. Also Malz is safe in lane, works well post 6 with all junglers. Every time I&#039;ve played this, it was a clear win.\n\n**General tips : **\n\nPicking up an {{summoner:3}} in the midlane is way too good against her, and generaly avoiding getting hit by her empowered AA, from her passive (which is easy to notice) is a good strategy. \n\n**Notes and ressources : **\n\n- To understand {{champion:84}} , I used Professor Akali&#039;s guide on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5a_MF-enuY&amp;t=1100s).\n- All champions I advised to play are those that I played myself against Akali (since I don&#039;t ban her in ranked and pre-pick her in ranked in all of my midlane games, I have some experience).\n- I play at a mid-plat, low diamond level on my main account.\n\nSome stats from [champion.gg](https://champion.gg) to try other match ups which can be interesting, and also to prove my point by statistics (yay statistics): \n\n- {{champion:84}}  wins **43.29%** of her games against  {{champion:45}} at Platinium + Elo, over **365** games.\n- {{champion:84}}  wins **38.29%** of her games against  {{champion:38}}  at Platinium + Elo over **717 !!** games\n- {{champion:84}}  wins **39.45%** of her games against  {{champion:90}} at Platinium + Elo over **403** games\n- {{champion:84}}  wins **48.85%** of her games against  {{champion:131}}  at Platinium + Elo over **217** games\n\nMatchup that I (or you) still need to try : \n\n- {{champion:84}}  wins **39.29%** of her games against  {{champion:136}}  at Platinium + Elo over **112** games\n- {{champion:84}}  wins **39.71%** of her games against  {{champion:99}}   at Platinium + Elo over **544** games\n\nI suspect {{champion:3}} , {{champion:78}} ,{{champion:55}}  to be good against her also.\n\nWhich champions have you tried against her ? Have you tried any of which I&#039;ve tried ? Did you feel the same thing ? Who else would you recommend ? Comment to let everyone know and thanks in advance for your insight on the subject if you do.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-09-21T21:32:59.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved!","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-09-22T02:27:36.540+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"counterpicking should never be a form of counterplay since you arent always gonna be picking last so when doing these kinds of post its better to post general knowledge which can be used on a majority of mid lanes champs or specific points for some champs rather than listing why some champs counter her","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2018-09-22T02:47:06.862+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU.

Assassins like {{champion:105}} , {{champion:238}} , {{champion:7}} , {{champion:91}} and some mages like {{champion:1}} , {{champion:134}} , {{champion:90}} make it almost impossible to cs when they reach lvl 6 as they can 100 to 0 you under turret. The assassins are so mobile that ganks are meaningless. So how do you play against them? let me know when you find out. What i do know is that assassins not so good in 5v5 so if you don't feed them in lane then you have a chance of winning.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadWooo","date":"2018-09-22T16:42:08.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a mage player I always had problem playing vs assassins.

When unique abilities are added and variety is introduced, it is natural for some champions to be better against certain kits than others.\n\nNow, it is possible for counterpicking to become so necessary as to hurt the game, when you must play one of a very small set of champions or you lose automatically.

While before counter picking gave you an advantage it did not nullify the laning phase. Previously (back when it was the forums) when people asked how to deal with champions they were given information like how build against them, how to space against them, and hop to abuse an opponents ability cooldowns correctly. At the present the \"Counterplay\" that is shown is always counter picks and does not provide the information that a player would actually be able to utilize if they are not the picked champion. This has become more and more the case since season 6 (maybe even earlier) wherein champions have less \"windows\" to deal with them outside of direct counters. \n\nWhile a necessary byproduct (as you say) was also true in the past Riot did decently well with having Counters be only Soft counters in 90% of cases. Exceptions being in ranged tops which they even said was a huge issue they wanted to correct, and they attempted to.\n\nAt the present we are at a point wherein champions are being played for how few options you have to deal with them instead of the options they themselves bring to the table.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-09-24T20:21:09.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kobold,realm=NA,application-id=ELUpwER8,discussion-id=pMwqAikT,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-09-22T02:47:06.862+0000)\n>\n> THANK YOU.
