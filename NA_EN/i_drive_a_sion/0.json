P.S. I am not Pawnce.\n\n\nBesides {{champion:161}} and maybe {{champion:201}}, depending how you view him, {{champion:157}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:429}}{{champion:421}}  are culprits for League&#039;s current lack of counter play and the increase in mobility/power creep for future/current champion releases/reworks/ability updates.\n\nI started playing around Zac&#039;s release back in March 2013. I learned the game pretty fast and got a pretty clear visual of what was the meta game at the time. I got a good idea of how champions were designed back then and that each champion felt unique in their own right and didn&#039;t feel like there was anything overbearing and that people really only banned what had little counter play at the time {{champion:107}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:7}} (had q silence) or what ever they felt like they didn&#039;t play well against.\n {{champion:38}} was probably the only perma ban champ at the time.\n\nBut then it felt like everything that we knew to be true about the game&#039;s game play philosophy was changing at the start of Yasuo&#039;s release and only got worse since then. {{champion:157}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:429}}{{champion:421}} have completely turned each of their respective roles into utter chaos on how they should be balanced. Each having more mobility, damage, utility, and less COUNTERPLAY to go against. These champs were easily the most broken AT THE TIME. Keep in mind this things were a lot simpler then. Instead of Riot reworking or fixing the unfun parts of each of these champ&#039;s kits, they shoehorn nerfs that do either too much or too little. Each have gone through an extensive amount of slight buffs/nerfs , and even an ult rework {{champion:421}}, over years to come and were always one significant buff/nerf to be pulled into or out of the meta.\n\nAnd because of refusing to fix these champs we in return get more like them in the terms of a class update/champ rework/ future champ release. With that, Riot sees the game to be ok now that every other champ is now brought up to speed with those five other champs. Except it&#039;s not since now there are so many champs now that have too much value in their kit and/or have less counter play in them. \n\nI&#039;m sure back in 2014, with champ reworks coming more often, most were certain that {{champion:90}} was definatly going to get one at some point. Instead in 2016 we got the mid-season mage update which completely broke and made malzahar&#039;s kit even worse to play against and it feels like he won&#039;t get a rework because the simplicity in his kit, mainly his R, keep champs like {{champion:157}} in line. Which is dumb in a balance perspective. \n{{champion:63}} suffered too and received more damage in his kit as a way to help compensate for a champ like {{champion:268}} being in the game.\n\nIn the ADC update in late preason 6 we got fun and interactive champs updates like {{champion:133}} and {{champion:104}}. Their kits have been getting buffs/nerfs like the five champs I mentioned earlier. {{champion:104}} has been getting more pushed around then {{champion:133}} but their overall mechanics have not changed and are still frustrating a lot of the time to play against.\n\nEven some of the tanks that got reworked or released since then have been outrageous in their design. {{champion:3}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:154}} All turned out to be game play nightmares and TO ME personally {{champion:154}} and {{champion:57}} only because the game was getting more and more ridiculous and how champion kits should be. Maokai is somewhat of an exception because his old ult was pretty bonkers in itself.\n I still don&#039;t know how updating Cho&#039;Gath{{champion:31}} was a great idea while keeping his easy to hit silence in his kit and that giving his ult hp scaling and can practically 1 shot with stoneplate. \n\nThere&#039;s even smaller examples that have overpowered certain champ kits like {{champion:5}} update and {{champion:106}} E displacement upon their initial patch release. Each getting more added to their kit only because newer champs can do more than them.\n\nThis year too is suffering from this balance philosophy too like with bruisers. Instead of toning support effectiveness for their adc and increased the counterplay for tank tops I think bruisers would have been fine. Instead we buff all ad melee&#039;s with Conquerer and now there&#039;s less counter play thanks to all this true damage.\n\nObviously there&#039;s been a lot of talk about what&#039;s been causing the increase of frustration when playing League that the most of the champs released in that late 2013- late 2014 are a major factor in that. There are some other things that I definitely think are contributing to League&#039;s lack of fun and skill factor but I feel that champ releases back then started killing game balance and since then overloaded kits are a standard because they have to keep up with previous releases/reworks. League champs right now just feels like they&#039;re fun to play but not fun to play against.\n\nI could just be blowing all of this out of my ass but this is just what I&#039;ve been thinking as to the causation as to why the game and it&#039;s champions are the way they are right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Iręlía","date":"2018-07-25T01:41:52.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just came here to say...\n\nRevert Skarner 2018.
