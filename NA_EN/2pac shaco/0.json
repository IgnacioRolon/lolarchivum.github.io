I began to notice that being punished was more related to the quantity of your comments in-game rather than the severity of what you said.  Also, if multiple people gang up on you (regardless if they are wrong or right) then you are going to get punished even if they are the issue.  \n\nWhat I find ironic is some of the examples... a top laner walks out into lane and begins to int dying 5 times in the 1st 5 mins... and when i ask him to stay back up and stop feeding, you get the typical response &quot;stfu&quot; or get called the N word or worse.  But that doesn&#039;t get one banned.  But apparently asking someone to stop feeding, or providing them advice like &quot;hug the turret since you are behind and farm&quot; and people claim you are &quot;flaming them&quot; and &quot;being negative.&quot;  It gets even worse when you get qued with a duo of friends who all begin shouting in all chat to report someone.\n\nSo, you can use racist terms, bad language, and generally be a child all day... and Riot doesn&#039;t say anything.  I have seen some names of people that are enough to ban in my opinion (mainly racist things like the N word, saying you mom should die, very derogatory terms toward females, etc.).  But if you give people advice that turns into a chat war with their friends, you get banned.\n\nThe hypocrisy is something that will eventually cause Riot to re-evaluate their process or get hurt financially.  \n\nEven better is when they show the player their own posting as a reason for the ban but don&#039;t show the entire conversation so there is no context to the conversation.  \n\nAlso, I have a few accounts.  The one that was banned was the lowest one at b5 / s1.  I have noticed that the lower the tier class, the more likely the ban.  In the upper tiers people that get nasty don&#039;t tend to report as often (I guess people in higher elo&#039;s have thicker skin?).\n\nAnyway, it made for a good sociology project in my college class.\n\nWould be interested to know other&#039;s thoughts.  I am an adult with the financial means to keep playing LoL so the bans don&#039;t bother me.  But I think of myself as a kid or young teen who has invested hundreds of hours and possibly a lot of money on an account, only to see this happen.  And then you wonder why some kids flip out... \n\nOh well.. .happy hunting!\nSigning out for good .. at least on this IP / Account.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-06-10T05:39:02.422+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Few things wrong with this, first off, 9 reports = 1 report.

People are generally more willing to listen to criticism when it's given in a mature and respectful manner and not filled with insults, raging and harassment. From [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&page=15#post48979094): \n\n>**I don't think that I should be punished for trying to give advice.**\n\n>If you have been hit with a punishment, that likely means that you are being negative in your advice towards others. As an example, stop feeding is not good advice. The negative connotation around feeding in this game makes you seem hostile and accusatory, and will likely cause more problems than it solves. On top of that, youre not actually giving advice, youre only telling them what not to do rather than HOW they can stop feeding. Better advice would be to hug your turret and wait for a gank or help bot snowball, Ill be fine once we get to late game.\n\n>Even if you are being positive or neutral with your advice, it is likely to be misconstrued as negative for a whole host of reasons:\n\n>* While in a Ranked game, we are likely more stressed than normal, which makes us more likely to lash out at someone, even if they are trying to genuinely help\n* We often associate our teammates with raging idiots rather than people genuinely trying to help us.\n* Text has no tone of voice, so because of the above, it can easily be misconstrued (we all have our stories of that time it happened to us, even between friends and family).\n* You are at the same elo, and as a result at about the same skill level, as your allies, and are therefore not in a position to give advice to them.\n* You dont know the mentality of the one with whom youre giving advice to.\n\n>I want to talk about the final point especially, as there can be any number of things going on behind the screen that you dont know about. They could be tired, or drunk, and therefore playing more sluggishly. They could be actual trolls, and dont care what you have to say. They could already know what theyre doing, but for whatever reason (going on tilt, tunnel vision, etc), forget to act on that knowledge or experience. Or they could be genuinely unsure as to what to do. In all but the last one, they are going to be less than willing to accept anything that you say to them. Even if someone means well when they tell me how to improve in the game, I often already know what theyre trying to say, and am already beating myself up over it. Telling me what Im doing wrong and how to improve merely irritates me even more, makes me more self-aware, and then mess up more as a result of over-thinking something.\n\n>If you are still determined to help others, then I strongly recommend that you only do so when they explicitly ask for feedback, in order to minimize your helping words to fall on deaf ears. I also recommend that you maintain a neutral or positive tone. Say what they did right before you say what they did wrong, and theyll be more willing to listen to you, as you will come across as a more balanced individual who can recognize the strengths in others as well as the weaknesses. Also refrain from doing so while in-game, in order to minimize the impact there. There is nothing inherently wrong with giving feedback to others, but, unfortunately, you do so at your own risk.\n\n>_Contributed by themaddscientist (link (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=48975593#post48975593))_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-06-10T06:21:22.742+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=2Pac Shaco,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AucuVsWa,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-06-10T06:20:32.053+0000)\n>\n> So how do people have racial slurs in their name then? so, they ban you if you speak them during a game, but don&#x27;t have simple filtering to stop racial slurs and other language in player names?\n> \n> Also, I do comment a lot in all games.

There were a ton of correlations to what is going on in society today.  So it was a good project.  \n\nWhen you have a mix of sensitive millennials who think the world owes them everything (e.g. the everyone gets a trophy mentality) and need safe spaces when someone says something they don't like.. combined with the anonymity of a video game... it is just a recipe for disaster.  Especially a free video game where there are no real consequences (except having to open a new account).  If you dropped money on an account, the ban would hurt more (and I am sure there is a correlation between people who blow a ton of money buying skins and what not on how they take a ban).\n\nThe big question is what role video games (and social media, the media, and other entertainment) have our the future of our society?  \n\nRemember when NWA did the \"F the police\" song and everyone in society wanted their heads back in the 80's and 90's with all the gangsta rap.  The establishment could control that to some extent, even though they failed in the end.  But with video games, who is the real establishment?  The company all too often.  There are tons of videos on Youtube of kids freaking out when mom takes away their games (World of Warcraft had the best one)... and then we wonder why kids today shoot up schools and act the way they do.  \n\nSo overall, was very interesting.
