Im still useing old client if that matters","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-29T04:03:46.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, have you attempted to use the new client?\nSecond, have you made sure your hard drive integrity is fine, and are you experiencing any other glitches or strange errors in other programs?","replies":[{"poster":"Azure Gamez","date":"2017-03-29T04:08:18.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i used the new client awhile back and it caused a lot more issues so i had to revert back to old client. and no im not experiencing any other problems or glitches with other programs","replies":[]}]}]}
