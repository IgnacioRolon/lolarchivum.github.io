Throughout my time playing league of legends I have cycled through at least 5 accounts, the former 4 accounts are perma banned. Obviously it is impossible for someone like me to keep their furious fingers from typing toxic filth into the chat so I have a favor to ask, a request of sorts. I want my In-game chat capability to be permanently disabled in order to prevent any further toxic behavior. This may seem like a strange request however I am at my ropes end (Struggling with depression and anxiety), and I no longer want to have to restart an account because of my attitude. Please consider this request whomever may read it, theirs not many things that I enjoy living life for, League is actually one of them, so I beg you to please help me. I was also just able to reach gold on this account for the first time in my league career which is a big deal for me, so on another note im wondering if my Ranked Rewards are still going to be awarded.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-03T02:59:38.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't go in and permanently turn off someone's chat, but I might still have a few tips for you. I'm a normal person just like anyone else on the boards, so even I get a little tilted sometimes. On my end, I don't ever want to lash out because it'll just make myself feel bad afterward, so when I feel myself getting there I either mute all, or sometimes even drag the entire chat box off the screen! That way, I can't see what's being said at all, and I'm not tempted to type anything back.\n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news as well, but since this account got a 2-week suspension after 8/22, this account is disqualified from ranked rewards =(.","replies":[]}]}
