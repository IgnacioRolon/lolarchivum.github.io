So I decided to investigate further and noticed in his games as xerath he did not miss an ultimate shot and was dead center every time. I also found on a play, he ults uses two charges to kill an enemy and a split second after an enemy appears from fog of war he shoots and it is dead center again when aimed. I would like this player to be punished and thought it would be necessary to ask if there is anything I could do to distinguish this player and he be investigated by Riot.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nA concerned player","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T21:59:55.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were in that game I hope you were able to report him officially through the post game lobby! That'll be the best way to flag his account in case he was actually scripting.","replies":[]}]}
