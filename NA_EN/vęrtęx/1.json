My problem is after champ select the screen becomes stuck completely black unable to tab out. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, troubleshot, restarted the computer, updated the mac os to sierra, but nothing has changed the situation and allowed me to play a game. I have tried pvp and custom games and they both do the same black screen. I have also tried two different internet networks that are reliable and have been used in the past to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-02T19:00:04.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like our tech team will have more than enough context if you've maxed out attachments.  :P  I can definitely understand the urgency though, and I may be able to help in the meantime.
