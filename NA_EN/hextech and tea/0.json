The pro scene... ( and Challengourds Xp)\r\nWHY?\r\nThe player base of League of Legends is in the millions. Most of us being in Gold and lower meaning we arent LoL gods that can make anything work. We pick our champs usually because we like them in some way. and because we have that affinity for them we spend time with them, learn their in and outs. What they&#039;re good at ect. only to then get slapped in the face by the balance team because some top 500 jerk offs in the pro scene are abusing the champion&#039;s &quot;kit&quot; or some broken build. This champion we liked is then nerfed usually over few patches so it doesnt seem excessive.\r\n\r\nCOUGH * Kindred , Camille , Lucian , Kalista , Shen , Tham Kench , Bard , Aatrox , Rek sai , Zed ... and the list goes on. and before you hop in the comment and say &quot;Uh, but some of these champions are op if played well&quot; or &quot; theyre super meta right now&quot; all these champions have failed to make an impact for a long time or a recent meta change has made them good. (Zed Luci these kinds yeah theyre strong now but were left in the gutter for a long while and only pros or very dedicated mains could pull them off).\r\nOnce again why? Why does Riot gut these champions ?\r\nI have no clue...\r\nThey keep releasing champions with broken stats on PBE and then barely edit them before theyre headed to live two weeks later only to then be nerfed and forgotten for sometimes years (Aatrox...).\r\n\r\nI refuse to believe riot is unable to make a balanced champion kit. You&#039;d think after one or two unbalance-able new champion kit fuck ups (kindred, Kalista) that they would put more time and effort into thinking of new mechanics that arent impossible to make healthy. Especially when you have the fucking PBE there to test shit. I dont think many of us would mind waiting a little longer if it mean having a new healthy add on to the game rather than a must pick or ban for 2 to 4 weeks. Only for that must pick to be gutted and no longer useful. On the PBE topic why is it that no one gets PBE access ? Everyone on Overwatch has access to their &quot;PBE&quot; that way everyone gets to test out the new stuff. (im 100% its money related since everything on the PBE is free)\r\n\r\nThis would also probably limit the amount of gutting attached with the pro scene.\r\n\r\n{Id argue that Riot should make patches dedicated to the pros that they could skrim on and such so the rest of us dont have to live through a bullshit power creep meant to decrease the time of pro competitive matches. Most games end under 15 in the challenger elo... THE FUCKING CHALLENGERS WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN THAT THE PROS STALL ON FUCKING PURPOSE. so power creeping wont change that. So please stop, Its so annoying to lose a game within the first 7 minutes because Graves and Friends got 2 kills and can now snowball the entire game}\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;m likely to boycott Riot and League of legends.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m tired of picking a champion and then live through the horrors of continuous changes and nerfs for months and slowly losing more games because of it. (I was a Kindred main... If you have played kindred since release you know what I&#039;m talking about. Same with Tahm ect)\r\n\r\nI&#039;m tired of seeing my new favorite champion get gutted because Riot doesnt care enough to actually try and find out where the issue is and to fix or edit it. Especially when there are literally hundreds of subreddits for each character with dedicated mains who could help riot balance these &quot;problematic champions&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo. Im going to go play overwatch for a while. The OW Devs listen to the players They dont only nerf according to pros (Ana is an example of that) and they actually reply to Meta and power creep concern posts. I swear Riot completely ignores this section because its &quot;toxic&quot; or whatever.\r\n\r\nIm sure they know why we&#039;re pissed and refuse to comment because they arent willing to change. So I wont be spending any more time or money on league and if more of us do they may change hopefully since I doubt they make most of their money on Pro games.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading if you did.\r\n\r\nI wish you all the best.\r\n\r\n/Rant\r\n\r\nPS~ I am not trying to single out Riot&#039;s balancing team I&#039;m sure they don&#039;t have much of a choice and Im sure the real issue is much deeper than the Balance Devs so Im not trying to witch hunt you guys.\r\n\r\nPPS~ Im dyslexic thats why my paragraphs are so weirdly spaced out. It makes it easier for me to read and proof read.","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2017-03-24T16:31:36.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I refuse to believe Riot is unable to make a balanced champion kit\n\nPrepare to be disappointed.","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech and Tea","date":"2017-03-24T16:56:00.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IKR XP but like why .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-03-23T20:37:43.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, I would recommend the good doctor, Dr Sona x Rubrick, to help you understand how Riot balances the game, as a very different opinion is presented there. \n\nSecondly, while I agree with some of your points, you are ignoring some upcoming changes. Rek'sai getting reworked, to make her fun to play, and not the cc-bot she is. Bard's has some good buffs on the PBE, that balance out his power, and make it overall better scaling. Kindred had a QOL change, that made her a bit better, and Kalista is actually not bad at the moment, due to a variety of changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech and Tea","date":"2017-03-24T03:44:58.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree. but its the timelyness that gets to me. and ignoring the community.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-03-23T20:49:35.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":" Maddened King ","date":"2017-03-24T04:30:54.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember Ghostcrawler posting a graph on the demographic he balances the game around, and that is the 4% of the game.
