Would I keep my summoner name or would it make me change it even if no one in NA has the same name?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T19:34:52.061+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"NA currently doesn't allow special characters, per our [summoner name](https://www.google.com/search?q=summoner+name+special+characters&rlz=1C1NHXL_enUS727US727&oq=summoner+name+special+characters&aqs=chrome..69i57.2916j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) guide.  When I say it's not allowed, we literally aren't able to modify names ourselves either to have special characters.  Transferring to NA would require a name change for your specific issue. Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"ICE MonkeyDLuffy","date":"2017-02-07T21:37:58.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi!
