To help rule out some possibilities, first make sure that you have the correct region selected.

I've run in to the same issue today. It started with the constant DirectX crashes to where the client would revert to a previous version. It was just moments ago when I got the same DirectX crash and the revert that I suddenly couldn't log in. I reset my password a few times in panic, but found out that others were having the same issues. I should also mention that I've done the Hextec Repair Tool as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-20T16:21:38.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you u sing an AMD graphics card?
