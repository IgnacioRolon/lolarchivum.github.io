So, as I tryed to fix my wifi, it took me about 10 minutes. When I got back on league it let me play like normal(We lost ofc) However, after the game ended, it said I have a leaver buster. Do I seriously get a leaver buster for an event that I had no control over?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T18:50:28.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you were able to get back in game!  For context, the [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system can mark a player as a leaver even if they return later, because all leaves still cause others an negative experience.  The system will only apply after more than just one leave, and regardless of intent.  Your best bet would be to play the required games without further leaves.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"dadrunkcheese","date":"2017-03-15T23:50:46.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=qWb7fUEh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-15T18:50:28.892+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m glad you were able to get back in game!
