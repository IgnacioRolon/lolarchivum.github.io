However, when i went to the purchase RP section, I tried to use purchase via credit/debit card, but requires a card number. However the Samsung Pay card does not show a card number, but instead shows the last 4 digits. What do i do?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-26T21:52:45.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that promo card was only digital and you never had a physical version of it which shows the full card number, you may not be able to use it. Gifts cards like that are entered like normal debit cards just like you tried, but you still need the full card number regardless. Your best bet may be to use the card at a physical store to buy RP cards if it isn't working out.","replies":[]}]}
