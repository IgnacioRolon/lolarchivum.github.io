Just today, my friends started playing again, which re-awakened my interest in the game. I decided to download all the needed updates and join in.\n\nTo my surprise, I was greeted by a permaban message.\n\n[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/W0Lgwu8.png)\n\nAfter scrolling down, I see logs from three games, logs that I'm unfamiliar with. While I could sometimes get angry while playing the game, it would never quite reach this kind of level, never with this kind of vocabulary, never with this attitude towards the game.\n\nSo, I try to figure out what could've happened, and then I recall that my password had been compromised a year ago, and posted publicly on Reddit.\n\n[Reddit Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/4avdew/what_the_fuck_0x_here_again/) / [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Clt0kfH.png)\n\nIt was promptly deleted by subreddit mods, and no other accounts outside Reddit had any unwanted activity, so while a number of people could have seen it, I didn't think much of it - it seemed to me that no one was particularly interested in going after my other accounts, as I was able to slowly change my passwords with no incident.\n\nBut I seem to have neglected my League of Legends account, as I still had to use the old password to log in. And it appears that someone did have a go at using it after all - either the original delinquent, or someone who managed to see the password before it was deleted.\n\nI'm sure that this change of behavior and activity could be easily compared against IP checks, so with that in mind, could something be done about that ban?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-09-18T17:55:44.503+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Open a support ticket.

If your account had been compromised, then you should be able to change all the security datas and then request it back. \n\nBut i do have to say this now...you should have been better safe than sorry, that you underestimated people's greed and desperacy was also your fault partially. If your datas were posted publicly you should have changed them in a heart beat. Remember, your security is your responsibility and yours alone.\n\nBut i myself am still convinced that not only will you not make that mistake again, you could possibly get your acc back. but as i said, you Need to talk to the support team","replies":[{"poster":"Sligneris","date":"2017-09-17T13:34:33.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By submitting a ticket, you mean the [Submit a Request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) option?","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-09-17T13:37:59.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sligneris,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=qwM58MiE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-09-17T13:34:33.857+0000)\n>\n> By submitting a ticket, you mean the [Submit a Request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) option?\n\nyep, that's the support link.
