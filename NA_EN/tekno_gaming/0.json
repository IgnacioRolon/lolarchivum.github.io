My only issue with this concept is that I think that for the amount of tank they get mid-late game, they do too much damage. They have a strong laning phase when played decently, and then late game they are monsters of tanks, dealing so much damage. I&#039;m specifically looking at Illaoi. While her E got nerfed really hard recently, she still does so much damage while being nigh impossible to kill at times, and picking up easy multikills in the process. I ask that the damage on the juggernauts (or at least Illaoi) get toned down, so that you don&#039;t have these tanks carry games. It also ruins diversity in the top lane, with the juggernauts dominating.\r\n\r\nSorry about complaining about a champion on the boards, but when I lose almost all games due to one champions ability to oppress almost every other type of champion, it starts to become irritating and feels unfair. Thank you all for understanding.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-07-23T03:07:28.980+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/gameplay-update-juggernauts\n\n>When you think brute force, these champions should come to mind: powerful, durable, immobile and melee. They’re League’s hulking titans who, come late game,** turn into super tanky carries who’ll pretty much destroy anyone foolish enough to get in their way.** The prototypical juggernaut is Nasus, the classic one dog late game wrecking machine. The archetypal raid boss can only do his thing when he’s in melee range, and his lack of gap closer means he often has to rely on allied speed boosts like Sivir’s On The Hunt or well-aimed crowd control like a Morgana binding to get close, but once he does, he unleashes the power of his trademark Siphoning Strike.\n\nthe problem is, that people still dont seem to understand juggernauts are supposed to be lategame carries.\n\nthey have one exploitable weakness, and that is that theyre kitable at every stage of the game. their high defense (usually through items) is their counterweight to this weakness.\n\nthey are the diametrically opposed concept to marksmen as carries. instead of kiting and trying to stay out of range while dealing damage, they want to get in your face. but just like marksmen need the aid of their allies to keep distance and help peel (or should.... even though we know this isnt true in a lot of cases), juggernauts need help of a tank or support to overcome enemy kiting and get close.\n\notherwise they deal damage like any carry. you should expect them to hit as hard as lategame marksmen and assassins.\n\n\nespecially illaoi is counterplayed by positioning, and isolating her from her tentacles.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-07-23T03:04:08.861+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's what they do.

Your best bet is to just avoid her as much as you can and either let your ranged allies deal with her, or wait until your entire team can pile onto her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2016-07-23T03:08:59.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Illaoi's E wasn't a nerf. it was a QOL change. As an illaoi main. it felt more like a net buff because they spawn closer, faster, and swing more frequently.\n\nAlso. the most played juggernauts i see all have strong sustain. Just buy grievous wounds early ({{item:3123}}) or go into game with ignite. They are not hard to counter at all. A top laner with ignite when I'm Illaoi makes 2v1's and 1v1s much more dangerous as you lose 40% of your sustain and i often just play safer just knowing they have it and I almost always take it when facing Darius, Nasus or Illaoi (I usually play {{champion:17}} or {{champion:45}} in that case).","replies":[{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2016-07-23T19:47:22.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Veigar doesn't really counter any of them top :/\nand Teemo doesn't really counter Illaoi\na professional Illaoi can easily demolish a pro teemo in lane","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2016-07-23T03:05:12.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Juggernauts have one huge exploitable weakness...
