When you purchase products online, they'll generally want the zip code that's attributed to that billing address as a form of confirmation and security. If you have issues with using a zip code, you may want to elect to using another form of payment such as Paypal, which may not require your zip code for purchase.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ha Seriously","date":"2016-08-29T02:10:53.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot!!!
