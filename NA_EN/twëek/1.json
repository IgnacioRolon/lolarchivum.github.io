Runeglaive gives her a way to deal with the awkwardness that is her E being physical damage. After having an clunky off-tank bruiser identity for the longest time, it finally gives her a way to itemize as an AP assassin. This makes so much more sense for her thematically and just straight-up makes her feel better to play.\r\n\r\nThe current PBE runeglaive nerf alone is a huge blow to Evelynn. That change on its own will knock her win ratio down, since it will once again make magic penetration a bad path for her.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, the massive damage nerf on her Q is absolute overkill. It makes tank Eve even weaker, and will remove any remaining chance of her being an effective AP-based champion. The compensation &quot;buff&quot; on her ultimate is an insult - no Evelynn player has ever thought &quot;boy I sure wish I could trade some of my damage for a tiny bit more slow % on my obscenely high-cooldown ultimate&quot;. Trying to shove Eve into being an engage/tank type champion is pointless because champions like Sejuani/Gragas/J4/etc all already do that better.\r\n\r\nSo this is my request - please leave Evelynn&#039;s ability numbers alone until you see what the effect of the runeglaive nerf is on her. If you absolutely must change her numbers, look at the 5.12 Shyvana nerf and use that as a starting point. She only lost a few points of DPS on her W and even with the release of sated devourer, her win ratio dropped marginally. Taking roughly 20 DPS off of Evelynn&#039;s Q at level 9 will destroy her.","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-07-13T16:00:08.500+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Evelynn is my main jungler.\n\noh wait sorry\nwas**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ch0c0lateJesus","date":"2015-07-14T07:42:55.552+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, wristslap nerfs are reserved for {{champion:64}} {{champion:238}} only.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-07-13T16:14:36.949+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did Shyvana's win ratio drop because of the nerf, or did the release of Sated Devourer make more people (who don't know how to play her) start picking her?\n\nI have to agree though.

You could also just upgrade your trinket at level 9.\n\nBut you're missing the bigger point that there are **many** champs who force the other team into modifying a build to accommodate their existence on the map. Some force you to carry pots all the time. Some force you to stack the crap out of armor and resist. And most significantly, tanks force you to build ridiculous amounts of pen and % damage.\n\nConsider Blitz. You have to build Banshee's. Whatever you planned on using that slot for is now taken by Banshee's because Blitz exists, along with the early boot-rush and keeping every bush warded 100% of the time.  Dr. Mundo, Vlad, etc. force you into a Morello's whether you want it or not. \n\nThe real problem is champs whose only true counterplay is \"you should have picked a different champ.\" Katarina and hard cc, for example. If every champ had hard cc, Katarina would be almost useless. \n\nEvelynn that's always visible is just free farm. It would be like a Master Yi that is squishier, can be slowed, without the consistent speed boost, without the untargetability, without the true damage, without the CD resets, without the healing, and without Alpha Strike's gap close.
