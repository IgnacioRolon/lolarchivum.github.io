I&#039;m looking for an excuse to brush the dust off and bring her out in ranked again. Was this buff enough to be worth it? I haven&#039;t had the chance to play her.","replies":[{"poster":"ZileanUltJesusOP","date":"2015-06-12T15:13:36.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, it was barely a buff. It reduced the damage on your w if you aren't autoing in the laning phase its slightly weaker but if you combo it with her e while autoing you obliterate people. Especially early it does a lot of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-06-12T15:15:24.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's definitely noticeable for me, especially with my clear times, it unfortunately doesn't fix her problem of being kited into the high heavens unfortunately.","replies":[]}]}
