I don't care so much about losing 3 LP from a normal dodge but the potential of being held hostage in a series games is ridiculous. I only had enough time for one crack at my promotion series to platinum the night that the queues were closing and the first game was a complete wash due to end-of-season trolls.\n\nThe suggestion of being able to vote-kick people in champion select has been around forever and hasn't really moved forward due to potential abuse cases but something of the sort should **really** be available if a player on your team is in a series game. An alternative, like having the ability to disband a champion select (provided you are in a set of series games) once for a given series would be such a relief.\n\n**EDIT: Some suggestions that have come up from other players:**\n\n**A means to deal with malicious players in champion select:**\n1.) The ability to earn \"dodges\" by playing a set number of ranked games without dodging. This isn't without problems - we know that Riot never wants to encourage leaving games, but we can't be blamed for wanting a legitimate way to be able to leave a series game when we get an allied player who has been going 0/20 all day with {{summoner:10}} {{summoner:12}} {{champion:11}} \n\n**General Champion Select improvements:**\n1.) Being able to re-queue up with a team that you'd been matched with, in the event that the lobby is dissolved by a dodge.\n\n2.) Reduce randomness in pick order for a player is dodging. An clear abuse case in dodging is doing so in order to get a higher place on the pick order - a player should not be abusing the system to avoid taking their turn at being last pick.\n\n3.) A report button available in champion select. **Yes please.** This would of course have to be heavily scrutinized. A report shouldn't count against you for something like a rare/unconventional champion pick.\n\n**4.) Only match players who are in their series with other players who are in series games.** Everyone should go in with something personal on the line. Longer queue times would be worth the guarantee that everyone is in these tense games and (probably in most cases) will try harder as a result.\n ","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-11-12T16:21:45.318+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've previously suggested earning free dodges every x completed Games without a Dodge.

If you get counterpicked, you dodge. It's free, no problem.\n\nIt actually helps trolls and bullies get what they want, because if they don't, they'll just dodge.

There's not a lot of gameplay ways to disrupt it, at most you can pick stupid Spells, troll with you champion pick, and misbehave in chat, but that's it. Riot already collects logs from Champ Select, they just weren't included in the Tribunal, probably because people there refer to players by their summoner names rather than champion names, and Riot wants the players to be anonymous while being judged.\n\nMaking sure players know the Champ Select **chat is logged and can be read by Riot** might help. Getting this across to all players is pretty much impossible, but a loading screen tip mentioning it would reach a lot of players.\n\nWhile not a solution to the problem in Champ Select, it's a common source of frustration: You get a good team, and someone on the other team dodges, and your good team is gone. **Being able to stay on the same team, where you might have agreed on roles and positions**, might help.\n\n**Keeping the Pick Order** would reduce the reward from dodging or getting someone to dodge.

There could be some sort of flag you can mark in your lobby that says something like \"If this lobby is disbanded, I would like to requeue with these players if they are available.\"\n\nIn regards to your other concerns - couldn't that be solved with a combination of it being difficult to earn dodges and a low cap on how many you can have at one time? Maybe also a longer dodge timer? Obviously it wouldn't make sense to earn them as quickly as ARAM rerolls because there's so much at stake. They would need to be unavailable enough that it's not feasible to take a \"mid or dodge\" approach, as you mentioned.\n\nAs someone who is pretty quick to dodge if I don't like the look of a team comp or whatever, I'm not sure something like this would increase the number of dodges that happen. In fact you might even see fewer - If I really dislike the look of our comp, I don't mind losing 3 LP.

Maybe 5 Games is too few,  but let's say you need 20 Games in a row to earn a Dodge. You're not getting mid 20 Games in a row. Even if you like 3 roles, odds are you won't make 20 Games in a row if you Dodge when stuck in one of 2 roles you don't like.  You also aren't going to use a free Dodge because someone wants shen support or talon jungle or anything else that's simply not meta. Your only going to dodge and reset your counter when it's a really serious issue. You might not even Dodge a terrible troll if you're at 18/20 accumulated because you don't want to start over. So I'd say 20 is too high (let's say cap is 2) but 5 is too low. There is a middle ground where you can Dodge trolls but it isn't worth dodging anything off meta. Trolls also would probably not earn dodges as they won't get in to that many games. Although being able to report them (possibly if all 4 players report one person and no one else after game they don't earn a game towards their free Dodge). \n\nI really like keeping the pick order though.
