So Heartwarming.   \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time we gain even more insight in the Freljord.  The Yetis, the nature as to how Lissandra recruits some people (lol I&rsquo;m also glad that she doesn&rsquo;t come off as outright cruel... tho I&rsquo;ll admit I haven&rsquo;t read the new lore [if there is a new one for her] but if it&rsquo;s similar to the old one she isn&rsquo;t really displayed as outright cruel if I recall properly)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe model (and abilities) capture &ldquo;a boy and his friend&rdquo; amazingly well while still retaining several aspects/references to the old kit,   When I first saw the model yesterday (Brazilian leak) I thought it was a goofy af champ again, which I was fine with, but I can&rsquo;t even really call it goofy now I&rsquo;ve seen the lore and kit.   Just looks fun xD.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat job Riot!!! ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Naut lmpressed","date":"2018-08-13T20:49:20.757+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it too! I never had any interest in the champion before the rework, but I am already feeling much more connected to the character. \n\nI love the new Freljord lore, but I think I have a slightly different interpretation of Lissandra's appearance. I think it is important that we are seeing her through the eyes of Nunu, a young, very impressionable, very naive, highly imaginative child. So his perception of her could be very different from reality. The story is written ambiguously enough that it could be interpreted that Nunu's caravan was attacked by the Frostguard, who killed the adults and kidnapped all of the children to raise them to be soldiers for Lissandra. Nunu could be in great danger and either unaware of it or unconciously repressing his fear. He is clinging to his old life, his flute and his mother's music, while the other children are being given daggers. Lissandra knows something about Nunu's mother's song that he doesn't yet understand, so she is gently prying to avoid scaring him away. The song probably contains some lost knowledge about the Watchers or the atrocities that Lissandra committed in the past. The relationship between Nunu and Lissandra seems like it could be echoing the way the White Witch treated Edmund in order to get information and loyalty from him in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis. To me, this feeling of peril makes the whimsical nature of Nunu and Willump's friendship even more heart-wrenching and beautiful. I feel like Willump probably understands the danger Nunu is in and will do whatever he can to protect his young companion until he is old enough to understand.","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2018-08-13T21:48:25.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol Yh I agree with Lissandra, what I meant was more like... we see reasons as to why people join her and reasons why they don’t see her as evil, in the old lore her cause isn’t seen as particularly bad (by the followers). It’s good we’re not expressly seeing a maliciously evil woman.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Robertsmash","date":"2018-08-13T20:20:52.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's really great stuff.
