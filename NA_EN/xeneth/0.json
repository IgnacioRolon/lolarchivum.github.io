We haven't been able to find a root cause for it. \n\nThat said, I'm a Nami main and frequently use the chromas. I've noticed that sometimes, if you have the Koi Nami chromas selected, the white box with the line through it (denoting you'll be using regular Koi Nami) is checked, which would make sense that you load into game. That said, we have seen issues where it appears that the proper chroma is select, and it's loading in as the base. \n\nI always make sure to re-select the chroma I'd like to use in game, and I haven't personally had issues with loading in with the incorrect chroma. (Crappy workaround for now, I know. D:)\n\nWe're still working on a solid repro of the issue, which will help us resolve the issue; it's affecting chromas in general, not just one particular chroma pack.","replies":[{"poster":"Xeneth","date":"2015-10-12T06:40:11.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to hear research is underway! Want purple fish mode so badly...\n\nFor your workaround are you referring to the team builder flow specifically? Like select a Koi Element in initial loadout, THEN reselect it in the team lobby for results?\n\nP.S. I'm a Karma main but I've been trying to pick up Nami because the poke oppressive style is similar but having sustain vs. shields seems better depending on the matchup. As a Nami main what would you say some of your worst and best 2v2 matchups are in lane?","replies":[]}]}]}
