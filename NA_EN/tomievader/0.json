From what I understand the melees that use it a majority of the time are Akali and Kass, but other than that everyone else uses it rarely or not at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Killer of Night9","date":"2019-09-20T15:50:32.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:36}} Jungle or {{champion:23}} mostly use this rune.\nMundo can't proc aftershock or grasp on jungle so FF got a lot of potential on him (sustain) and as for tryndamere, he can't stack fast enough conqueror to make it work and PTA isn't really that good.\nFleet give him a decent amount of MS without give up the precision three for chasing people while they're running away (the ms steroid).\nProbably phaserush would be better on him if he actually got a realistic all in combo rather than spin + AA\nSometime even {{champion:157}} {{champion:150}}(even tho he is half ranged) {{champion:75}} (has used it for a good amount of time).","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-09-20T12:23:05.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use it as a bottom lane Mundo and occasionally on Taric for the movement speed to help line up stuns.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2019-09-19T18:16:37.886+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because melee champions got a better keystone , Conq , Some use PTA , and assassins use Electrocute , the only way to make it have it's identity is by overbuffing it which will make it broken so everyone takes it which is a big no","replies":[{"poster":"Tomievader","date":"2019-09-19T18:29:29.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's also fair. We wouldn't want another abusable keystone.

A _Keystone_ shouldn't be interchangeable with a minor rune in any reality. \n\nThe idea to add celerity's old passive to it wouldn't be too out there would it? Shave off some of the heal for some dmg applied to it. It's the one keystone for precision that doesn't provide any offensive capabilities other than a small dash, a bad one at that.

It just doesn't mesh too well with how melees interact with each other. The trades Adcs most commonly take contrasts the ones of melees in severity. 2 Adcs might trade a single ability and a single auto each, whereas melees would unload all of their abilities and some autos. Since melees all-in more often, it is  riskier to attempt proccing fleet on the wave due to the threat of an all-in and more valuable to have a stronger all-in.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomievader","date":"2019-09-20T13:23:07.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I was suggesting adding the old celerity adaptive damage to give it some use in all ins.

Fleet Footwork is guaranteed by the first basic attack but it will never allow you to increase you DPS.\n\nThe reason why you see the likes of Yasuo, Akali, Kassadin, etc. taking FF is because they don't fully commit to 5 attacks/abilities one and only one champion in most stages of the game since their AA reset combos aren't as quick or full like Darius, Morde, Jax, and Irelia. \n\nAs a matter of fact Yasuo, Akali, Kassadin, Fiora, and the likes have a distinct attack pattern: get close, cast an ability, basic attack, retreat. Or may commit. But that's still only 1 or 2 offensive abilities used.\n\nThe other champs like Darius, Morde, Jax, Irelia, go all in with abilities and can net a lot of value with Conqueror by: closing the gap, basic attack, CC, basic attack, ability, basic attack, ulti or some similar variant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-09-20T03:26:12.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, it only is nerfed for ranged vs minions, which is noticeable in a ranged vs ranged lane, but not much of a deal in ranged vs melee or actuall skirmishes and teamfights. \nWhat's more, ranged have acces to{{item:3094}} which charges it 25% faster and heals of towers and they have an easy time fitting {{item:3095}} into their built which increases heal and speedboost by 35%, so ranged with gear actually gain alot more from it than most melees. \n\nI would use it more on melees if it scaled less of ad and more per level, or if the ms boost lasted longer on melees and if melees would charge enrgized faster with AAs by default.\nI also feel like the last nerf to it's AP ratio was to much, befor that i used it on diana, fizz, ekko and kassa, now it's really just for the bad matchups.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomievader","date":"2019-09-20T13:32:01.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of melee getting energized faster inherently.
