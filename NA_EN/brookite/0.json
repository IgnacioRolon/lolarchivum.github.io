During champ select I get \"disconnected from chat\". I attempt to reconnect but then I am unable to lock in my pick.  The timer gets stuck on \"0\" on the opponents pick before mine.  I have a thirty minute wait now until I can play.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-17T20:42:27.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"General issue here is just that you're disconnecting from the game intermittently.  My guess is that it's happening other places as well, it just doesn't affect anything when it's happening outside of champ select.  I'd check out our [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) page which has steps to fix the most common causes of connection errors that we see.  Let me know if it helps!","replies":[]}]}
