This clarity ranges from circles in abilities/items, like Ornn&#039;s E/Redemption, to rectangles and other markers such as Kayn&#039;s W and Ivern&#039;s Daisy knock-up. Additionally, Riot has been known to ADD clarity to a champions kit, such as after Zed came out and the X was added so players would know who he was ulting. \r\n\r\nSo it baffles me when animation cancelling still exists on a number of champions considering it goes against the Riot mantra. The biggest offender is naturally Riven, though others like Renekton definitely abuse this too. \r\n\r\nThe new Janna PBE changes explicitly mention how the CD on her shield is changing to allow better opportunities to trade in lane. Trading in lane being the important part- how can we effectively trade with a Riven in lane if we&#039;re not sure what spells she still even has up? In the same thought, how are we supposed to know which spells are up if we can&#039;t see them being cast, since they&#039;re being cancelled?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Riven is considered a Skirmisher by Riot&#039;s own definition- &quot;...Skirmishers aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.&quot; Animation cancelling allows Riven to not only have reliable options of closing in, since she&#039;s moving so fast, but it allows her high-end burst damage. This definition likens Riven more to an Assassin or a Diver than a Skirmisher. \r\n\r\nEither way, it&#039;s clear that animation cancelling is a point of contention- look at Nidalee and Graves. Both had their animation cancels taken away. \r\n\r\nTl;dr- Riot needs to take a stance on animation cancelling for clarity and to allow better trading in lane. Should it be allowed, it needs to be brought back to champions that previously had it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2017-09-08T19:40:56.031+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Animation cancelling allows Riven to not only have reliable options of closing in, since she's moving so fast, but it allows her high-end burst damage. \n(...)\nLook at Nidalee and Graves. Both had their animation cancels taken away. \n\nThis seems like yet another case of people mixing up AA-resets and Animation-canceling.\nNidalee and graves both still have animationcancleing **just like everybody else**\nAnd animation-cancleing is not what gives riven that burst.\n-\n\n\n# Animationcancleing is just overrideing the BACKSWING of an animation with another command, AND NOTHING ELSE!!!\nThis means you stil have the full windup upt to the 'resolve point', so it's still perfectly possible to notice any spellcast despite it.\nAnd for AAs, it also has no impact on AS, what it does is allowing you to use the extra time for repositioning or useing skills in between AAs.\n\nWhat you and most others complain about in the case of riven(and nida) are AA-resets, which let you 'cheat' your AS.\nFor example if you have a 1.5 AS, the time in between AA-resolves is always 0.75sec, wether you cancle animations or not. However, some skills either soft or hard reset that timer. The most common example of that are empowered AAs loke Jax W or Nasus Q, which imidiatly grant acces to another AA. \nAn example for a soft-rest is ashe's Q, it used to fully reset your AA on activation, now it's a partial reset that puts the timer to 40% (so with our 1.5AS, it goes to 0.75 x 0.4 = 0.3sec, so the next AA comes 0.3 sec after useing her Q)\n\nNow what many people didin't know is that Nida had lot's of AA resets in her kit(the cat-W and boith for switches) that alowed her to clear insanely fast aswell as trade rather absurd early on if played perfectly well, and that's what was taken from her, not animation cancleing.\n\nIt's also what causes riven to have the fast burst pattern. Each of her Qs is an AA-reset(though not sure if full or partial right now), which is why riven can get the fast combo of. With out the resets, she could chain the Qs fast, but not get in AA's in between, which are actually the main source of damage for her thx to her passive.\nOn the other hand, without animation-cancleing, riven could hardly use the AA-resets as her Q animation lasts so long that her atackrate hardly changes, which causes the somewhat false impression that animationcancleing is what causes her to Attack faster.\n\nTl;dr - Animationcancleing is and always was part of **every single champion** and never was removed from anyone. What you mostly complain about are AA-resets, which are a different mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-09-08T21:21:57.647+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get what your are saying but even so I think Rivens fast combo should be removed.\n\nTheres a difference between a meaningful and intended animation cancel  such as E(Dash) into R(Ult activation) or W(ki-Burst) into Q (Broken WIng) .\n\nAnd unintended side effects such as how rapidly clicking around during Broken Wings gives you control of Riven again 0.03s earlier for no specified reason. I think the latter is a bug Riot was browbeat into trying to transform into a feature.\n\nRiot should lock Riven into her Broken wing animations because its ridiculous the damage variance you can get sometimes. I want to keep Riven \"highskill cap\" just as much as the next guy but it has to make sense how you go about it and it needs to be something that players can understand or something  stated in the controls maybe even something players can learn by simply interacting with the character like how Azir can Q mid E for extra range! It should NOT be a  romanticized exploitation  like how Smash brothers melee fanbase treats their various little glitches . I dont think having the Quick Combo is healthy for the champion overall and it just makes properly balancing her a pain.\n\n(inb4 comments complaining about me just \"wanting to make Riven easier for noobs\" or something)\n\nAlso yes I am aware that riot has attempted to normalize the Quick Combo in the past but I'm just not okay with it on a design level. Its just a weird little byproduct of the older LoL engine/coding and its  more trouble than its worth to keep around.It was never intended so why keep it around for all the headaches and controversy it causes?","replies":[{"poster":"The steam life","date":"2017-09-10T06:05:43.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But she is balanced she isnt too strong at any level of play.

Some champions like Illaoi, Kayn, Kha'Zix and Rengar are specifically given animation locks to prevent them from chaining abilities too quickly, while others, like Riven or most marksmen, are not only allowed to cancel their animations, but are specifically balanced around them doing so. This isn't really a question of fluidity, as Rengo and Kha are both assassins, and should therefore be very fluid, so it's more just an issue of certain champions being given animation cancels just because they feel good, or because players have gotten used to them, while others have those same cancels removed or denied for counterplay reasons, even if one side of the argument could easily be applied to the other. As such, Riot needs to take an official stance on animation cancels, and _even if they do decide to let only certain champions cancel their animations_, they need to give us a definitive enough reasoning on the matter that we can clearly evaluate the consistency of its application.\n\nPersonally, I am completely against animation canceling, as I think it's a form of what I'd call empty difficulty in League. Just like empty calories in food contain energy, but no actual nutrition, empty difficulty in League would be mechanics that pose a challenge to the player, but do so without adding any real interaction or gameplay with them and other players, be they teammates or opponents. In this particular case, animation canceling is empty difficulty because it only relies on the player's own ability to identify the point at which an animation can be canceled, and successfully cancel it, and can be achieved literally just by playing a lot of Practice Mode. In fact, many Riven tutorials instruct the player to practice animation canceling and wall-hopping in Practice Mode (or, if the tutorial is a little older, a one-player custom game), and so push the player to master much of a champion's difficulty curve without at all interacting with others. This is not a healthy way of learning to play a PvP game, and for a time was a core reason why Riot didn't want to release Practice Mode in the first place. In a game that already has a very high skill floor relative to most others, additional, extraneous difficulty is not something League really needs, and when it gets particularly severe (as is the case for Riven) it creates really big disconnects in quality of play across mastery, which itself leads to balancing difficulties.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tychusfindlay918","date":"2017-09-08T18:04:14.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius would be kinda trash without his trademark AA > W > Q\n\nIf you take those anim cancels away on a champ that is already struggling, I'd expect buffs elsewhere for sure.\n\nThe AA W anim cancels in particular for darius are the only things that allow him to even hope to trade with champions like jax, I'm already seeing a couple matchups getting totally fucked with anim cancel removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2017-09-08T18:28:36.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's not an animation cancel, that's just an auto reset.
