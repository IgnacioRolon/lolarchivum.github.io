Typical money hungry corporation. \"Hey it isn't the support team's fault that Riot is greedy.\" Of course it's not the support team's fault, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a cash grab. Riot is worth over a billion dollars, makes tons of money daily because people love the skins, and is still slow to fix client issues, etc. I love the in-game experience and enjoy the game as a whole, but Riot is an evil company. Coming from someone who develops for a job, your client is terrible. Sure you switched to Electron from whatever Adobe shit you were using, but it took Riot a very long time to write an interface that's really just a glorified website bundled with it's own Chromium instance--and all the underlying client connection issues, etc. are STILL THERE. If the client disconnects, it never reconnects; it just says \"Attempting to reconnect\" and then forces you to restart. I highly doubt it actually does anything to reconnect. I don't have the energy or dedication to make my own MOBA, but Riot should seriously reconsider this Blue Essence deal: don't you make enough money off a super-loyal player base?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-08T19:12:15.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":28,"body":"Blue essence is now rewarded through leveling up, and no longer after a match.\n\nThey are also available with honor and mastery as well.
