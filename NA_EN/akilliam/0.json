I' ve been trying to have a summoner name change but aparentely it is unavailable. However, i searched for it in the profile menu to see if there is anyone using it, i also tried searching on Lolking, but there wasn't anyone. I understand there have been some changes that restrict summoner names but mine doesn't include anything \"offensive\". I wanted to change it in Drakely. Any explanation?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T20:43:02.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm yea that is strange. Drakely definitely isn't offensive, and I don't see no one currently has that Summoner Name. Go ahead and reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we should be able to help out there.","replies":[]}]}
