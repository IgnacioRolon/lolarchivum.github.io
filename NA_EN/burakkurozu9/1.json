Implement a temporary Ranked ban, so they can still play normal and aram, so that I can stop getting the 3 people that keep dieing every minute after repeated pings, chat, and wards in every single one of my games. It's cumbersome when I can help win my lane, Bot Lane, hard, but it doesn't matter since my top, mid and jungler likes to run it down every minute. Just letting these 4FUN players play ranked is really, really frustrating. Like I don't care if I lose a close game or by some mistake that generates a lead mid game. But losing in fucking champ select feels fucking horrendous.","replies":[]}
