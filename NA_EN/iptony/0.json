During champion select I was not playing attention and I picked Rengar mid because I thought I was jungle. My team tried to warn me about it but I wasn&#039;t playing attention at all. During the game not a single person was toxic about me picking Rengar mid. Even though I fed a Fizz about 5 kills until the laning phase was over, the only thing that came from my team mates was encouragement. Later during team fights I picked up a few kills by cleaning up fights and started snowballing. We were looking to win the game by sieging their mid tower. I then made a mistake by being caught and made my team lose a team fight and an inhibitor. Still, not a single person said anything mean to me. Soon, the next fight came up and I was able to assassinate the enemy adc with my teams help and then we ended up winning the game. \r\n\r\nI did not play well this game at all, but even so I still had so much fun and this was probably one of the games I enjoyed the most.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-24T04:37:27.044+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Games where everyone is just being friendly and chatting with each other are the best.

Not quite so in practice. Too many things that can't be accounted for. People getting better at the game over time, some people get better faster than others, new patches push some people up some people down, new players and smurfs alter the balance, trying new champs, people not getting their best role. Emotional states are yet another thing that influences it, so you would expect people there to be some difference.
