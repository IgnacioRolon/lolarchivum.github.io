We like that Lee Sin's got a pretty steep mastery curve that really rewards practice, but it's a bit too extreme, making it really hard to put him in a good spot balance wise (if he's balanced in top tier play he's very weak for the average player, if he's at least tolerable for the average player he's probably too dominant in top tier play). They will add a bit of power to competitive Lee Sin play too, we're looking to avoid too much of a buff there though.\n\nAs far as the specific changes go:\n\n* Ult now deals damage to people hit by the champion knocked back based off the bonus HP of the champ kicked. If you can Insec well, this isn't going to be a very appealing play generally. If you can't however, and are regularly using the ult just to get enemy divers out of the fight for your team this will offer a bit of extra power to try and optimize. Will be some niche cases where it helps out in high level play as well, we expect those situations to be pretty niche though.\n\n* Energy restore from passive now frontloaded onto the first auto attack (20 first auto then 10 second auto, instead of 15/15). This buff will help out both new and experienced Lee Sin players, expectation is it'll be significantly more useful to newer players though as they learn energy management and when to weave auto attacks in between spell casts. A frequent source of failure we see from new players is constantly trying to weave in 2 autos per cast, even when that's a really poor idea or, at the other extreme, running out of energy frequently. Giving people room to learn and grow's great of course, we'd like to get some signalling in there to encourage people to consider 1 auto per cast more often when they're first learning though.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-08-07T06:23:22.997+0000","up_votes":118,"down_votes":19,"body":">These are buffs intended to give power particularly to players who aren't amazing at Lee Sin. \n\n\"We want to reward Lee even when he fucks up\"","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-08-07T06:57:26.553+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":14,"body":"\"Instead of actually balancing him.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-07T07:34:39.992+0000","up_votes":67,"down_votes":21,"body":"'Balanced for who?' is one of the questions behind this work.

She's a tank who's already suffering after an incredibly overkill set of nerfs and she's not getting any armour buffs.\n\n>Cinderhulk changes make it a buff early/mid while being hardly different late game.\n\nIn practice it works the opposite way for most tanks. Your mid game's so weak that you don't really care about the small increase (It caps at +90 HP if you're not running any other HP at all) and you just end up losing out on HP late game.\n\nPersonally when I play a tank I'd much prefer 50 extra HP at lv 16 to 100 at lv 6. You need as much late game power as you can get on tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-08-07T11:11:07.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are upping the base HP by 100, this is a massive buff for it, by late game you get less then 100HP shaved off your 3500 total, you won't even notice the difference.\n\nAnd {{champion:113}} isn't suffering she got knocked down a peg and is still seeing high play, and high ban rates.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-08-07T11:24:55.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're upping the base HP by 100, but Cinder multiplies it's own HP, 25% of 300 is 75 meaning ATM Cinder gives 375 HP, on the PBE it gives 460, which is a 85 HP difference, assuming 0 HP from runes and masteries.\n\nWith 2k bonus HP there's a 100 HP difference,  old Cinder being better, but some tanks (like Sej) stack more than 2k bonus HP quite often.\n\nAnd Sej is suffering, she's not even a competitive pick any more.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
