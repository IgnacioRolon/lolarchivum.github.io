So are her eyes green or blue? \r\nI'll include a picture of my WIP. The whole reason I started to draw this picture was to send it to Riot asking them to donate like 30 RP for the Sun Goddess skin, then I discovered I was 243 points short, so...................... oh well. I'm going to finish the picture any way, as soon as I get her eye color.","replies":[{"poster":"YuanLinL","date":"2014-08-30T19:34:09.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats really good woah","replies":[{"poster":"Pasithee","date":"2014-08-31T01:44:37.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you!
