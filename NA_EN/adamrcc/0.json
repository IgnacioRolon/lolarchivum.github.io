The new meta means that since objectives are extremely important you have to pick champions who have early power spike, do good damage in early game and have strong lane priority and waveclear. Thus, games will be explosive, full of kills and shorter and champions may get items faster through the sieges and teamfights rather than old style of league..\nI personally love this new league version 2.0. Some people (people who have time, may prefer the old way of league).\n\n So it is not only going to be lane swaps and dragon/bot lane meta. Therefore, elder dragon is truly late game.
