I applied for access to the, \"public\" environment about half a year ago now and I still haven't gotten a response.  I'd understand if I were to be turned down due to myself not being as experienced as other players, but I've talked to friends that are ranked from gold to master and they also have not gotten a response to their application. \r\n\r\nSo if we have not heard back thus far, should I take this as we've just been declined, or are the applications really backed up that much? Or are PBE applications just old news and if you have an account you have one, and if you were late to the party, GG?\r\n\r\nForgive my naivet√©, but I'm just curious. \r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T17:38:14.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't able to force an application through, but not getting accepted doesn't mean you were declined.  Players do still need to apply but we don't have additional information on how to get accepted beyond the[ PBE Faq](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/pbe-faq).  I know that you've been waiting, and all I can suggest is to hang tight!

I applied 2-3 years ago and haven't heard a thing. I have played a lot of the game, i've never been punished for anything, i hardly even dodge.\n\nI doubt they actually pick based on your champion preferences because A, i wasn't pulled in for changes on champions i play or for a new champion that fits my playstyle, and even if they did bring people in based on this it doesn't seem to me like they make any changes beyond numbers adjustments. (this is only from looking at pbe patch notes not milling about on the pbe forums, although i don't have access to the pbe forums so what's the point of that)\n\nThe only thing that really makes me mad is that they don't give you a response if you don't get in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crookz604","date":"2016-09-20T19:59:17.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thanks man.","replies":[]}]}]}
