Really the biggest advantage that new Darius has over old, is how easily he can get multiple dunks in a teamfight now, since his passive instantly applies full stacks of bleed (well that and the 40~200 bonus AD).","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-09-12T01:30:38.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if he gets a single execution, he would have to be fighting a team of potatoes for anyone to let Darius hit them even once in teamfights.

That said, mostly the point of Juggernaughts (and he fits the bill the best honestly, not even having a slow cleanse like Garen; or any speed boost at all for that matter in his kit), he'll have a hell of a time getting to someone who can kite him properly; but he'll obliterate them if he can get there.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Prospector Pete","date":"2015-09-11T23:18:48.504+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"How to counter Darius: Play him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acadiaum","date":"2015-09-12T18:00:30.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say Ganks, I've mained Darius for a long time so I have a pretty easy time winning lane, best thing to do is gank him hard before he gets any kills.\n\nIf you failed a gank and he gets away do not chase him to his tower, he will pull you and get a possible double.
