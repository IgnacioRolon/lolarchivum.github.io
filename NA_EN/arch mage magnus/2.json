Riot here with an incoming update to Kassadin.\nWe've decided that his ultimate ability was getting a little too overpowered, what with the range being slightly higher than flash and well, we can't have champs that move slightly larger distances than our patented abilities! So we've decided to make it so that Kass's ult is now a self-cast. Here's the update info!\nKassadin - R\nRiftwalk: Stand still. Then deal damage based on how far you moved while standing still. Moving 1 unit will increase your damage by 10000, but you cannot take advantage of this because you have to be standing still for it to work.\n> Hope you all enjoy this upcoming buff to Kass!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-18T20:47:27.251+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, i'm not a fan of Kass, but cutting his ult range almost in half is pretty stupid lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-02-18T21:39:05.692+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should just reduce his health regen to near zero and remove the mana restore on minions that aren't canon minions\n\nHis laning phase is fkin obnoxious right now because he can start with flask and 4 pots\n\nMake harass stick a little better and make him watch his fkin mana","replies":[]}]}
