I've been having fun with this one).\n\nIt's kind of related to Veigar's stun, but Darius's change was much more based on his oppressive laning, while Veigar's was based on the stun being the main reason people picked him as opposed to anything that should be central to his theme or fantasy.

There is a noticeable difference between a Tibbers from mid Annie and from support Annie (as one would expect), and I don't mind it. Support Annie is more focused on the AoE stun, while mid Annie brings both that and big AoE damage. I'm fine with Annie being specialized in the support role, even keeping her instant stun should that be where they try to place her her. It focuses her into bringing more utility and less pure destruction. But mid Annie with an instant stun that deals pure damage isn't exactly my idea of fun, or counterplay.
