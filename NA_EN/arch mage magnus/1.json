Varus is in an interesting spot balance-wise because he is pretty balanced, but he's also a jack-of-all-trades as a caster ADC hybrid. He can destroy the other team if he's having a good game but just as easily be the load if he falls behind at any point. I think what he needs is some quality of life buffs so that he can be even more fun to play as and still be fun to play against.\n\nOn the topic of mobility, I think Varus is good as an immobile ADC. It fits his identity and he has some nice cc to make up for it.\n\nHis Ult definitely needs a wider hitbox. It's infuriating when it looks like you hit your enemy but then it turns out you somehow missed. It would also be nice if the damage was higher, but I feel that his ult is used more for the cc.\n\nHis Q was supposed to be a more dominant part of his kit, and I feel like its a core part of his identity. It needs some tweaks to be more forgiving if you miss. I think it needs a lower cooldown. Someone here posted an idea that kills and assists should refresh the cooldown.\n\nHis passive lets him clear through waves quickly, which is great. I think it could use a couple tweaks to help fit in with his identity and help Varus out if he had a weak early game. This may be overpowered, but here's my idea:\n>>Living Vengeance\nOn a minion or monster kill, Varus gains 20% attack speed for 3 seconds. On a champion kill or assist, Varus gains 40% attack speed for 6 seconds.

Late game he can duel alot of enemies, mostly ADC's and APC's in addition to tanks thanks to his blighted quiver. Bot lane it's harder to play him with supports like Braum who block his damage and Thresh who hooks him whenever Varus casts Q because he's too immobile to dodge it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lt Cuddles","date":"2014-10-21T20:50:25.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"His E and ult can both be used to slow/lock-down escaping targets, and as ways to self-peel when you're being attacked. To fix his mana issues, just buy mana pots, or purchase and build up to this:{{item:3042}}, or better yet, get one of these:{{item:3508}}. The point of his ult is to *lock targets down* so you can auto attack/combo them to death, not to be some high-damage attack: that's what Q is for, besides you're an AD carry, all you need the ult for is locking your enemy down for a good sec so you can drop your Q + E + x amount of AAs on them, and with your passive in use after you kill a minion, it should be a breeze to snowball that passive in a teamfight. If you decide to buy more attack speed, it will stack with your passive once that kicks in from kills, decreasing your opponent's escape window, allowing you to eat through teams.","replies":[]}]}
