I&#039;m done being toxic, but it seems no matter what ever game plays out the same. 1 person will say something minorly rude, or even crack a joke. Another peron will rage at the first person and the arguement will persist all game. This is even in normals where it doesnt even matter if you win or lose. With that said, after 5 years of &quot;fun&quot; (the first two were great, then it fell off pretty bad) I&#039;m done with league. It&#039;s just not fun to play anymore, and whats the point of playing a game if your not even enjoying it?\r\n\r\nso I&#039;m looking for a new game to play, a free one that I can download or maybe even a browser game. Any suggestion would be good, not really looking for a MOBA though. I want full control of the game, something that all comes down to either how skilled I am, or how long i&#039;ve grinded. either or.","replies":[]}
