Today i tested it for him. The game is currently so new it doesnt even have a name but they have gone into intensive detail in terms of gameplay, they have 80 champs made, that of course are in desperate need of balancing.\r\n\r\nJust like in league the game begins with a ban phase. After that each person will pick there characters, champs if you will, they have 3 maps made up so far. 5v5, 3v3, XvX (up to 20). You control all the champs and they move across the board similar to that of Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy tactics where every individual characters have different moves. Each player has abilities that go on cooldown after use, to reset the cool down you roll a die at the beginning of the round and need to get either a 1 or a 6 to reset the cooldown.\r\nDamage is calculated much like in dungeons and dragons. E.x. character spins his sword and deals 3D8 to all enemies adjacent to him. (spin to win!) \r\n\r\nThe board is composed of a hexagonal grid, this leads to some epic mobility usage and teleportation or movement skills allow you travel far and quick. I thought it would be slow getting into combat but it was  surprisingly quickly played yet very strategic. Different pieces of terrain also provide buffs and debuffs as you stand on them. I.e brush makes you untargetable, moving through water costs more movement. Home bases worked similary to nexus in smite where it was also a character but now controllable.\r\n\r\nFor a bit more rundown on abilities, every character had two base abilities and one ultimate. The ultimate could be cast once per game only, but were typically very game changing, which is what you want from an ultimate.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I&#039;m not trying to adsertise the game its not even mine. But now that i&#039;ve given you the basic rundown of the mechanics of the game. what are your insights? Do you see things that could be improved or maybe you share my oppinion that cooldowns should not be a dice roll but have a turn based cooldown.\r\n\r\nWould love to know your thoughts so i can forward it to him to help him improve the game as much as possible.","replies":[]}
