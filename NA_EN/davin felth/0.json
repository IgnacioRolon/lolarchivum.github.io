The FPS stays consistently in the hundreds but once every few minutes, the MS will spike from 25-30 all the way to 600 or more. It also seems to happen when there is a lot going on in the game play (engaging in team fights as opposed to farming minions).  The usual visual cues happen: freezing, champions gliding, directing a champ one direction but getting no response...etc.  I have been playing the game on the same internet connection for the last two years, first on Mac OS, then recently built a new computer and now play on Windows. I have been playing on this machine since the tail end of season 6 all the way through the most recent patch. I have never had to change firewall permissions or anything like that to update or play the game. I have never even once experienced a lag spike before this patch in fact.\r\n\r\n**Attempted Fixes:**I completed the connection troubleshooting page and used the Hextech fixing tool - but to no avail. The tool did confirm high ping during my previous game, but when it tested the ping again it was very low. Not sure where to go from here... Any help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"BroadSlabber","date":"2017-02-14T01:03:52.500+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is good to know I am not alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Average Gerg","date":"2017-02-13T20:54:27.965+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.

I decided to reply here, to keep all your info and our troubleshooting steps consolidated here. Since you've already completed the connection guide and listed all your information here in a beautiful and easy to read format, I think we can move forward with troubleshooting. Thanks btw, this post was super easy to read and basically gives me all the context I could ever want from a tech issue post. :)\n\nWe'll need to take a look at your network routing to figure out if there are issues somewhere between your PC and our servers. Since you're on a wireless connection now, I'd like you to temporarily swap over to a wired connection (if possible) so we can ensure the test results won't be skewed by wireless networking conditions. If you are unable to temporarily move off wireless, that's okay, but it would be preferred. I'd like you to use a networking app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to grab this log. After loading up the application, just plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After the trace has been able to run for 5 minutes or longer, you can go ahead and export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you ran into any issues with this. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Davin Felth","date":"2017-02-13T23:07:47.150+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!

But, I run on Comcast in Colorado\nOS: Windows 7\nPatch: 7.3\nFirewall/Antivirus: Bitdefender, supplemented with Malwarebytes when I'm bored\nConnection: Wireless 5GHz network also tested it over Ethernet\n\nFixes tried: Reset router to factory and re-initialized it with full port forewarding\n                   - Hextech Repair Tool\n                   - Running league as admin\n                   - Using Cellphone as wifi hotspot (it's actually not bad when it's my internet's problem)\n                   - Running the UC Berkley tool from the support page (everything came up green except 2 things which were labeled minor)\n                   - Sweet talking to computer\n                   - Yelling at computer\n                   - Prayer\n\nNothing seems to have fixed it. After running the HRT, the spikes got worse and sit at an average of 500+ms of ping. Ran WinMTR for about 1/2 an hour while I made a cake. We'll see how the cake turns out {{champion:223}} \n______________________________________________________________\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %                                               |  Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|\n|                             192.168.1.1                                          -    4 | 1545 | 1495 |    0    |   29 |  480 |    1   |\n|                           96.120.12.225                                       -    5 | 1464 | 1393 |    8    |   45 |  492 |  195 |\n|ae-205-sur02.englewood.co.denver.comcast.net        -    5 | 1491 | 1427 |    8    |   47 |  488 |    9   |\n| ae-27-ar01.aurora.co.denver.comcast.net                    -    5 | 1499 | 1437 |    8   |   48 |  486 |   23  |\n|be-33652-cr02.denver.co.ibone.comcast.net               -    4 | 1519 | 1462 |    0   |   52 |  497 |   11   |\n|hu-0-12-0-6-pe02.910fifteenth.co.ibone.comcast.net -    5 | 1499 | 1437 |    9   |   49 |  486 |   18   |\n|                          75.149.228.210                                      -    5 | 1499 | 1437 |    9   |   26 |  487 |   10   |\n|                          104.160.138.35                                      -    5 | 1483 | 1417 |    9   |   50 |  401 |   40   |\n|          ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net                              -    5 | 1475 | 1407 |   28  |   77 |  646 |   37   |\n|                           104.160.131.1                                        -    4 | 1515 | 1457 |   28  |   50 |  501 |   29  |\n|__________________________________________|____|_____|____|___|____|____|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"CaptnMuttonChops","date":"2017-02-14T06:14:07.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also ran it while playing a custom game vs bots.
