We've consolidated a list of solutions inside our [Bugsplat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes), so I'd recommend giving those steps a try before we move forward with troubleshooting.\n\nLet me know if this helped~","replies":[{"poster":"I cant farm","date":"2016-12-10T01:17:48.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried every single step on that guide, and still nothing, thanks for responding though","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-11T22:33:02.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've seen some Bugsplat upon load-in if a change in displays occurred without changing resolution settings or resetting the input file. For example, you're using a display with a resolution of 2560x1440, then next week your monitor dies and you have to replace it with a temporary display that runs 1920x1200. If you tried loading into game directly after swapping, there's a high chance League will still be trying to launch into the game at 2560x1440. If this happened, your temporary display would not be able to run that resolution, so you'd see instant bugsplats until you swapped back over to the other display or reset League's intention to grab that older resolution.\n\nPlease let me know if you happened to change your display recently so we can work to resolve this.","replies":[{"poster":"I cant farm","date":"2016-12-12T13:56:52.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had gone to a friend's house and used his monitor where it did change the resolution.

The steps below will assist you with resetting the input file that's saved server-side.\n\nFirst, you'll  **log into the game** then navigate to your config folder, which should be in the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\n**Delete** these two files:\n>** input.ini\nPersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these two files, close the League client out, then launch it again. You'll want to hop into a custom match to confirm the change did anything and that you can reach in-game. Your hotkeys will all be reset to default, so be sure to make any custom hotkey changes before you hop into a real game.\n\nLet me know if this worked.","replies":[{"poster":"I cant farm","date":"2016-12-16T23:44:26.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!

away then reappearing and then when I got it to finish I tried opening again and it worked and I got into game around when first minion wave was mostly killed.\n\nand ill be honest im really pissed
