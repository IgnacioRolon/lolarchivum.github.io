{"poster":"eckener","date":"2015-02-23T18:19:19.669+0000","title":"A solution to the \"Spectate Faker\" Debate","subforum":"Esports","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear Riot Games,\r\n\r\nOne of the things I love most about Riot Games as a company is the company's propensity to compromise and commitment to the players that contribute to the League of Legends community. As one of your devoted Season 1 summoners, please allow me to suggest a diplomatic solution to the hotly debated \"Spectate Faker\" streamer. I recommend that the spectate feature change the name displayed above the champions and the names displayed in the scoreboard from the summoner's name to the champion's name. This change will accomplish the following: respect Faker's privacy from third party streamers; respect the community's creative endeavors and free speech; respect Azubu's contract with Faker to the rights of Faker's professional e-sports brand; and enable the community to continue to learn from high elo solo que games.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, Azubu's complaint against the Spectate Faker streamer is that Azubu holds a contract with Faker that Faker will only stream on Azubu's streaming website. As the Summoner's Code and Terms of Service indicate, Faker cannot sign the rights of his account or his games to Azubu since Faker does not own his own account. Riot Games owns all player accounts.  Riot Games also own all the games once the players start playing on the Rift. Faker owns his own image as an e-sports player. \r\n\r\nMy solution--changing the spectate mode to show only champion names--will take all private summoner names out of the spectate feature. Players will be able to watch high elo games while respecting the rights of said high elo players to have \"privacy.\" Players will still be able to learn from watching high elo games even if they do not know which high elo player is playing jungle Lee Sin or mid Zed. Azubu wishes to have the rights to Faker's brand, and my solution will give Azubu the right without infringing on community members to broadcast high elo games via the spectate feature.\r\n\r\nPractically, a \"spectate faker\" feature might not be as popular if players do not know for a fact if it is Faker playing, but we as a community maintain our freedom spectate high quality solo que games while respecting the privacy of professional players. Faker is a very mechanically skilled player, but let's not forget that the vast majority of us can still learn a great deal from MANY different mid laners. Can we--as a community--really complain if we think we are spectating Faker, but we are instead looking at another skilled Korean/EU/NA professional mid-laner? I know I could learn a lot from any professional mid-laner in the NA/Korean/EU LCS; I'd wager that most of you could as well.\r\n\r\nThis change would not effect streamers who broadcast their own games as they are not spectating themselves. Several streamers offer \"sub-wars\" where they spectate matches played by their subscribers. This feature will change their display; however, it will not adversely affect their ability to cast or offer analysis of game play as most streamers refer to players by champion name anyways (Trick2G and TheOddOne for example).\r\n\r\nThe only other party affected by my proposed change would be individuals spectating people on their friends list. You already know which champion they are playing from your friends list and if you have any questions, you can always whisper to them while they are in game. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Riot, I strongly urge you to take this compromise to the \"Spectate Faker\" debate. You will respect a professional player's rights to privacy from third party broadcasters, respect contracts made between professional players with their sponsors, allow community free speech and creative liberates, and allow the community to improve by spectating high elo solo que games.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nA concerned player\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: Riot does not have to force the spectate faker broadcaster to respect Faker's brand/personal identity. Changing the spectate feature to only show the champion names and not the summoner names will have the same effect while allowing players to spectate high quality elo games.","replies":[{"poster":"Myrddin","date":"2015-02-23T19:02:07.892+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"who cares","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-23T19:06:36.569+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't care, don't comment.

I believe that my solution will take the wind out of their sails to some extent. Riot will not tell them \"hey, you can't do that\" and take away their new toy. Riot will just change the spectate mode to \"protect player privacy.\" I believe that after the spectate mode is changed, the \"spectate faker\" trend will naturally die down as people cannot verify if faker really is playing. But players are given choices to make. We keep our freedom while protecting the privacy of a few individuals. I believe that this is an optimal solution.\n\nRiot Tryndamere was concerned with \"cyber-stalking\" and Faker's personal privacy. I believe that this solution will address Tryndamere's concern without drastically altering any rules in the TOS agreement.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-23T19:03:28.300+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is the specifically focused spectate of any individual player that is the issue.\n\nYour solution does not address that.

I watched the spectate faker stream a bit during worlds. Everyone who flooded the stream was always asking which account was faker's, etc. There were other streams that were re-broadcasting and the viewers were always asking/trying to confirm who was whom. If you cannot verify, then there will always be a little bit of doubt that will eventually make the games less interesting then say...watching QTpie stream his own games. I think those streams would naturally die off as the \"fight the man\" thrill dies away. It steals their thunder while allowing free speech.\n\nI would like to see the spectate games feature to have their average elo listed. I think that, combined with just the champion names would help people find high quality games. The problem with the spectate faker broadcaster, is that he is using op.gg, a website that uses the Riot client. I'm concerned that if Riot changes the specifications in which people can use the Riot client, then it will negatively impact those websites, which I find quite useful for my own benefit...I'm sure several others do as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-23T19:16:17.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think my suggested changes would impact sites that use the Riot Client.

I was thinking of giving players the option to search for 3-4 of their favorite top tier players...but this could also be exploited. Perhaps your solution is better.\n\nHere is my opinion on the two-prong Spectate Faker debate (I have not read the contracts and I am not a lawyer):\n1.  Azubu has a legitimate contract with Faker that Faker will only stream on Azubu. Azubu's contract with Faker only extend to Faker's behavior. Faker owns the rights to his image and whatever value added is created by him playing the game. **Faker; however, has a prior contract with Riot Games (as we all do) that Riot owns the game, the characters, the accounts, and the games created by people playing the game. Therefore, Azubu's contract with Faker does not guarantee that \"all faker content\" will only appear on Azubu. I am convinced that Azubu's DMCA holds no weight and Azubu was wrong to issue it.**\n2. Tryndamere expressed concern with \"cyber stalking\" and whatnot. I am not, personally, convinced that Faker is being \"stalked\" by people who are living on another continent who have made no threats or attempts at personal contact with him. However, I do believe that Faker has a right to his own image and the value added by him playing league. **I also think that we must establish who has rights to what before we can brainstorm as to how to protect these rights.**\n- Faker has rights to his own labor and the value added from playing league.\n- Azubu and Faker have entered into a contract, both parties have the right to enforce and benefit from their voluntary relationship.\nNeither party; however, have the right to the game. Riot does. And I am personally opposed to the idea that Riot interceed on behalf of private parties to be the economic hit man of Azubu.\n\nI believe that my solution (combined with some of the improvements you have suggested) will enable Riot to skate the issue and protect the rights and personal liberates of all parties present while protecting the privacy of high elo players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-02-24T19:28:04.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mates... for ones whom are not aware of the technical details of the matter...\n\nWhat is \"spectate Faker\" again?

That way you can watch faker without paying anything...  Of course this requires you to know real-time info on matches and the like but it could be done...\n\nAnd lastly... FAKER has been overrated for over a year now.  He wasn't able to do anything to get his team to perform in Season 4 and again in Season 5.
