It said I was already in a game so I restarted the client. When i logged on again I was stuck on \"reconnect\" screen, saying that I left a game, which did not exist anymore. I tried \"reconnecting\" but it only led me to a black screen, and nothing happens. Please help me fix this, it has been 2 hours.

If you're still experiencing this, restarting your pc can also help resolve this to force an update.  Otherwise, after a period of time it should resolve itself.  Hopefully, everything is good to go now!","replies":[]}]}
