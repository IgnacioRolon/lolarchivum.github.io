However, No chest was opened, and my interface was locked out from any interaction, clicking on the home button worked. and returning to the loot screen I had 2 chests and no key. I figured maybe it opened without the visual and I just don't know what I got or the resources were consumed without anything being granted. Thanks in advance :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-05-05T05:24:23.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It likely was an icon that got added automatically to your account from the chest.
