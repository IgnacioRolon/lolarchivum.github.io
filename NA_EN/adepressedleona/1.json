I love the weapon and armor, but her face and hair seem really strange to me. I was really hoping you guys would keep that eye make up she has in like every skin and the symbol on her forehead. This just doesn't feel like Diana right now without it. I also think something like pure white eyes instead of orange would make this feel better. Because right now they all just blend together.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-05T23:05:41.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her hair is still lengthy, part of it being a trail of fire/flames, as opposed to just solid hair.
