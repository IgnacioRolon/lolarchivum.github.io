Especially if you broke a dash and it's obvious which minon he's crawling to to try and dash away on again. you can wind up the Q and chase him so that he dashes right into your heal radius.\n\nanother idea is to start your Q engage by walking to the outside edge of the wave, either way is fine, and walking the battle away from the minions. you E and W allows you to keep him pulled and slowed if he wants to run. Your second Q should be up by the time your full rotation is through and you guys have exchanged. if you played right he's doing a walk of shame to minions to run and he's prime to heal from.\n\nAlso dont run damage focused runes and masteries on Darius. His passive and true damage Ult are all he needs for damage.  You're set with good health and armor runes and proper masteries as well as rushing {{item:1031}}  and {{item:3044}}  against Yasuo.
