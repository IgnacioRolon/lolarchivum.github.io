I'm not seeing the logic, and I don't buy your argument about it being intended as a nerf either. I think you're completely wrong on that point. Speaking as a Sona player, she's strong right now in everything except the absolute highest level of play. Her problem is that she's just boring as shit. At the very least, the PBE changes help that. I will take a nerf if she stops feeling like a ult bot past level 11, and if I gain some actual reason to skill her E before level 8 or 13. She can eat a nerf and be fine. She can't take another patch of being this goddamn boring.\n\n>Yorick's rework has been \"underway\" for literally years, I won't believe it's happening until it actually does.\n\nTwo things. First, as I pointed out, this is completely unrelated to Leona. Morde, Urgot, and Yorick will be changed by a rework team. Those teams are not involved with live balance. Leona getting changed means literally nothing for them. We could have a patch with no champion changes, and it wouldn't speed them up by a single second. A basic problem with Riot is that they split up into teams and don't trade workers or communicate properly between them. That's why projects are so unrelated to each other. That's also why it literally doesn't matter what the live balance team does, because the rework team doesn't give a shit and may as well work at a different company.\n\nSecond, it's happening. When they start saying \"next one up\", it has always happened. I get being skeptical of Riot, but at least pay attention to their patterns. When they talk about it as some vague \"at some point\" concept like Urgot, then there is reason to doubt. When it becomes part of the schedule, it's because they've finally gotten off their asses and done something, and they want to brag about it.\n\n>I listed the five that are arguably the most desperate in that regard.\n\nAnd I said why I think the entire idea that Leona getting changes is impacting them at all is nonsense. Whether or not they get help is completely independent from Leona. She could be getting work, or not getting work, and their status is completely unchanged, and their likelihood of getting help is also completely unchanged.","replies":[{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2016-06-17T19:18:08.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> She can eat a nerf and be fine.\n\nSpeaking as a Sona player with around 800 games more of experience than you in her, judging by your mastery points for Sona, no, she can't.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-06-17T20:17:06.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I've played well over 100 games of Sona, and I've played them at a gold-plat level.

She's winning as many of her matchups as she ever used to even at the height of her season 3 dominance.

She received _one_ direct buff (if you want to call it that) back in S5, where they normalized the mana cost on her ultimate at all ranks; all other buffs have been indirect (Windspeaker's Blessing, Athene's Unholy Grail) and benefited many other champions besides her. She dominates lower tiers of play because people have no idea what they're doing against her — she's so far out of meta that most folks never see her on SR — and don't understand how to punish her slew of weaknesses.\n\nHer design is monumentally flawed. as you said; as evidence of that, look at her actual champion and skill statistics, and then think on if she can survive another nerf:\n\nShe has the 4th lowest HP at Lv. 1 in the game, scaling up to the 14th lowest. On a champion that has to get within an uninspiring AA range to have an impact against her opponents. That's really bad.\n\nShe has base 325 movement speed and a single skill for movement speed that isn't even much of a boost.\n\nHer base values on all of her skills are incredibly poor outside of Power Chord, which requires she gets well within range of being destroyed to use. Q barely does chip damage with the projectiles, W does way too much on a single spell so it's not allowed to be strong at any of it, and E is almost unnoticeable as I mentioned. R has low damage, a low stun duration of 1.5s (Anivia and Aurelion Sol, for example, can achieve almost the exact same stun duration on a much lower cooldown), and a small projectile size that has a delay at its full length.\n\nShe has barely any AP scalings to speak of, which you'd _think_ would be there to compensate for the abysmal base values, but they're not.\n\nHer only hard disable is her ultimate, which is fairly low-key — in a game where supports are expected to either provide much more in terms of disruption than that, or **really** excel in one or two other areas to compensate.\n\nShe feels bad because her power levels are actually terrible and rely on punishing mistakes from her opponents, without Sona herself having anywhere near as much levity in making them.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-06-17T20:44:36.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">She's seen nothing but nerfs since her rework. \n\nYeah, justifiably. She was OP when her rework came out. I took advantage of that. I abused the hell out of enemy bot laners who thought I'd be weak because they didn't understand what the rework actually did.\n\n>She has the 4th lowest HP at Lv. 1 in the game ... She has barely any AP scalings to speak of ... Her base values on all of her skills are incredibly poor outside of Power Chord\n\nI know all of these stats about Sona just as well as you do. I'm well aware of her base damage, her squishiness, and everything else you cited. I have made my opinion while keeping those in mind. You throwing them at me isn't telling me anything new.\n\nAll of this shit, literally all of it, has been true since before her rework, and it has been true even when she was hands down the strongest support in the game. All this crap just means she's Sona. That's literally the only thing it says to me. Her bases have always sucked, her AP ratios have always been garbage, she's always been slow (330 is still fucking trash and that's the highest it ever was), and her E used to suck even more dick than it does right now. I can take you back to any point of her development and point to those same problems.\n\nAnd yet, despite that, she's preforming very well, and has been since her rework. So, yes, I think she can take a nerf right now if she had to. However, I'm not convinced the PBE changes are actually a nerf anyway.\n\n>She feels bad because her power levels are actually terrible and rely on punishing mistakes from her opponents, without Sona herself having anywhere near as much levity in making them.\n\nThe second part is true. She relies on punishing opponents, and that makes her feel like shit. However, when she gets even the smallest possible option for doing that, then she does very well, and her power is absolutely fine. Her reliance on enemy failures is a design problem, but in terms of raw power, she has no issue.\n\nHer problem is that she's a champion entirely based around gaining an advantage by punishing even the smallest laning mistakes extremely harshly, and then she turns into an ult bot. She has enough power concentrated into that design to be quite successful, but it feels bad because it is incredibly boring. \n\nShe needs design changes, and if those decrease her power a bit, she could afford that. I don't think they will, but even if they do, she'd be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2016-06-17T21:07:50.654+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> All of this shit, literally all of it, has been true since before her rework, and it has been true even when she was hands down the strongest support in the game.\n\nIt hasn't, actually! She received additional nerfs in patches [4.20](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/V4.20) and [5.1](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/V5.1) that caused some of her values as they are now. Her rework in [4.13](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/V4.13) increased her base armor but was also where she got her base HP nerf. So not all of it was true before her rework, no.\n\nShe also received the cursory mana regeneration rate buff that most mages received when mana potions were removed from the game, I also forgot to mention that.\n\n> And yet, despite that, she's preforming very well, and has been since her rework.\n\nAgain, that's strictly in the levels of play where people are bad at capitalizing on just how flimsy she is, how weak she is even when she gets the chance to utilize her abilities optimally in comparison to other aggression-capable supports, and how stupidly dangerous it is for her to actually get in range to do anything due to being such a squishy champion.\n\n> She needs design changes, and if those decrease her power a bit, she could afford that. I don't think they will, but even if they do, she'd be fine.\n\nA very large number of people disagree with you on Sona being able to survive any more nerfs, as I'm sure you're aware.  She could certainly survive the nerfs in at least Bronze to Gold-level play (up to Platinum is about where she can really skirt being annihilated from the match reliably at the moment), but pushing her further out of relevance at the levels where the game is played at its peak (and where Riot, by their own admission, actually pay the most attention in terms of balancing) is a bad idea.\n\nThe changes on PBE look more like game-scaling buffs than anything, to be honest, but at the stages where Sona sees play, she already scales very well. The reduction from her early-game has the potential to make her even less appealing than she already is — having a good late-game means nothing if you're dead before you get to use it, and supports aren't usually picked around being useful solely later on. They aren't really addressing her base design problems, which means either way she's still going to be jacked up. Kinda sucks. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2016-06-17T21:59:06.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Aka, everything under challenger, \n\n>I'm sticking with my \"up to challenger\" assessment. I'm pretty confident in that one. She's really doing quite well in diamond right now.\n\nDiamond and above is _usually_ where things get really hairy and people have the quick reflexes and extensive game knowledge to punish Sona for living, not just Challenger. Out of curiosity, where are you gathering your statistics? I'd seriously like to see them.\n\n> In practical terms, yes it has.\n\n5 movement speed sounds like a little, but it can make a _big_ difference — especially on someone like Sona, who can't really get around that easily. I felt that downgrade hard when it came.\n\nShe's also more vulnerable to getting killed early on now with the lower HP, and supports aren't known to bounce back that well. That'll probably still be the case even after the EXP changes coming, and _definitely_ the case on one as gold-reliant as Sona is.\n\n> A lot of people confound terrible design with a poor balance state.\n\nThis is true. Sona, Volibear, and Skarner all have evident design flaws (Skarner in particular had an entire thread from Riot discussing it not too long ago, after his most recent update). \n\nVolibear and Skarner are bad, just not in terms of strength.\n\nSona is bad in design, and as a result Riot's tried their damndest to make her bad in strength as well (unlike with other champions). Every time up until recently when they've talked about her, it's reaffirmed that they don't want her to be strong, because she'll automatically win if she is — and because of her design, that's pretty accurate.\n\n> This is where I'm going to have to cite \"everyone disagrees with you\". The main reason Sona gets picked is dominating a lane. Her scaling is really godawful, and that has been a major aspect of complaints about her.\n\nShe definitely gets picked to dominate a lane, but dominating a lane gives you an edge that you can and should leverage. If she gets gold, she scales with it hard, because (as part of her bad design) she's a support that _needs_ it. If she can't win lane, she suffers harder than almost any other support I can think of — especially champions designed specifically to be a support. If she can, she rolls with it pretty heavily.\n\n> I mean, who wants the E to be a one-hit range increase? I think it's fair to say that this change is coming out of left field.\n\nThat was something I hadn't actually seen before about thirty minutes ago and, honestly, the range increase is something she desperately needed to make use of Power Chord without immediately getting chunked down to 1/3 HP for it against anyone competent. If her E is still a speed boost especially (it'd be weird if she didn't get the ally-boosting one), that gives her very good hit-and-run capability with E > Q > Staccato Power Chord AA.\n\nI really don't know about putting it on Song of Celerity specifically, though. I feel like it might be better in terms of balancing to give each variety of Power Chord its own range increase scaling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-06-17T21:24:36.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Again, that's strictly in the levels of play where people are bad at capitalizing on just how flimsy she is\n\nAka, everything under challenger, and if we went by things that weren't good in challenger, then we're cutting out some 75% of the game's champions. She's preforming above the average at all skill levels except the very top (and even then, I don't have any numbers to say she's not doing well there, I'm just assuming). At some point, I have to call that strong. \n\n>It hasn't, actually!\n\nIn practical terms, yes it has. 330 movement speed is still very slow (particularly when her E used to be even worse before the rework), and the 4.20 nerf was decrease only relative to her increased post-rework damage. As for her health, you're leaving out the increased per level scaling she lost 20 at level 1 (partially offset by gaining 3 armor) and gets more by level 4, so I'd actually call her tankier now than she ever was in the past. I'm counting that as an increase to base tankiness, not a decrease.\n\nSo, one small nerf, one small nerf that is only a nerf relative to a buffed state, and one small buff. Ultimately, none of these were major changes. She has always been slow, squishy, and immobile.\n\n>A very large number of people disagree with you on Sona being able to survive any more nerfs, as I'm sure you're aware.\n\nA lot of people confound terrible design with a poor balance state. They're doing it with Volibear and Skarner right now. I can't tell you how many people will swear that I'm playing a bad champion when I pick those winrate-toppers.  A lot of people also assume that \"not competitively viable\" = \"bronze only\", even if the champion is doing fine everywhere except competitive play.\n\n>She could certainly survive the nerfs in at least Bronze to Gold-level play \n\nI'm sticking with my \"up to challenger\" assessment. I'm pretty confident in that one. She's really doing quite well in diamond right now.\n\n>The changes on PBE look more like game-scaling buffs than anything, to be honest, but at the stages where Sona sees play, she already scales very well\n\nThis is where I'm going to have to cite \"everyone disagrees with you\". The main reason Sona gets picked is dominating a lane. Her scaling is really godawful, and that has been a major aspect of complaints about her.\n\nThat said, I'm not actually defending her changes. I'm not very hopeful about them. All I'm saying is that I'd like more lategame power on her, and I do like that the changes at least aim at that. \n\n> They aren't really addressing her base design problems,\n\nThat I can kind of agree with. I'm not really hopeful, particularly after seeing today's changes. I mean, who wants the E to be a one-hit range increase? I think it's fair to say that this change is coming out of left field.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2016-06-16T23:29:43.710+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"I didn't know Meddler was the only person who worked in Riot, and so what he works on is the only thing that gets worked on.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-06-17T05:43:04.730+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except that Riot is always late and can't afford to waste time?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-06-17T01:00:14.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's not fun to play against though.

Incandescence sounds like a cool mechanic, but I have to agree with the other poster in that it seems to be fixing what isn't broken. She could apply sunlight with her autos, so once she goes in she has the Braum-like objectve of tagging enemies for sunlight damage, locking how often she can apply sunlight on the same enemy with incandescence (not her abilities). That way you could add something for Leona to do during her downtime without altering what she's about, which is super clean live.\n\nEDIT: Played her on PBE and I have to say these changes feel all wrong. On live, Leona is one of the best kill supports because she deals a ton of damage, low key. These feel like nerfs to what Leona wants to do, frankly. Less total CC time, less damage, off timings, etc. I really hope everything not incandescence doesn't ship, sadly.

Leona makes flashy plays with her abilties, and her allies can see this to know which targets to hit. Think about a huge solar flare or eclipse. \n\nHowever During a team fight No one pays attention to Leona's autos. They dont gather attention as much as a Leona Q or W. Therefore Sunlight should only be released by her abilties, not her Autos. \n\nIf you'd wanted to make it interesting you woulda made the SOLAR FLARE Last Longer (maybe apply sunlight to the area after the slow/stun). \n\nSince no one notices the leona autoing the sunlight passive feels a little meaningless. Leona's autos are great and thanks for encouraging new players to use autos during team fights. However it feels lackluster \n\nI felt like Leona DID have a lot to do between cooldowns. She could position, activate items, or engage on her enemies. I dont think these changes did much to change that.\n\nCheers just my two cents.
