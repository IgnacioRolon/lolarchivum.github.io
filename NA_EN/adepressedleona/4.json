I had no smite having just smiled wolves and the adc {{champion:18}}  was shoved into tower and at around 50%. The enemy adc was around 75%. I made the choice to walk away from blitz and b around second tower and let him die. He said \"eve ...\" in chat and nothing more. ( I explained to him I could do nothing to help and he left it at that). This is something that doesn't happen often and for example in at least 4-5 other times that game I went to help a ally being chased when I knew we could win the fight and turned and got a double etc. However a player should also know that its not always the right move to risk your life to most likely not let the other person survive.
