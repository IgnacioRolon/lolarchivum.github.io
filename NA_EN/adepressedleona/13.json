So, obviously, works for my ADC, but also for any AD really.  Obviously Bandit is more profitable for Melee.\n\nI got 18 in Ferocity (which Final depends on which Champion, if I'm Heavy Crit as in my Critical Carry I take Warlord's Bloodlust, if I'm more sustained Auto Damage without much Crit it's the Fervor of Battle, and if it's some other type then Deathfire Touch)... but then I go 12 Cunning.\n\nLots of options in Early Cunning.  Move Speed vs. Extra Damage to Minions and Monsters.  Then Longer Buffs, Bigger Biscuits or extra Damage when a Target is alone.  More Damage to Low Targets (Or Mana Regen, but I don't often get that one).  Which leads me to Bandit.\n\nSo I clear a Wave, pop a Champion for 3 (or 10 if Melee) free Gold.  Farming Wave, get the Free Damage when he steps up to last hit, and get rewarded with 3 (or 10 if Melee) Gold.\n\nAlso, it's broken.  \"Ally\" INCLUDES Minions.  So if I miss a CS, I still get 1 Gold... and if a Relic Shield is used, I get Full Gold, Full XP and 1 Extra Gold.\n\nSince Items Spikes and Level Spikes are the two major sources of Non-Out Play Power in League, I want all the XP and all the Gold I can get.  So getting the little 1 Gold Bonus on any CS I may have missed and any CS my Support might Relic Shield for me adds up a tad, but the every 5 Seconds of getting 3 Gold (or 10 if Melee) for Harass adds up super quickly.\n\nI'll give an example where this works really well.  While I do this on ADC, it can also work with Any Mid that uses Frost Queen... as poke to Champions/Turrets will also grant Gold up to 3 Times in 30 Seconds, with a 12 Second CD after killing a Minion.  So it's a bit harder to get the full deal off, but if you do AoE for Half Health of Minions, the Harass, then Finish Wave you'll be golden... like, tons of Gold.  24 for the 3 hits with Frost Queen up, and 3 every 5 Seconds (or 10 if Melee)... so between every Wave that's an extra 27 to 34 Gold for Harassing.
