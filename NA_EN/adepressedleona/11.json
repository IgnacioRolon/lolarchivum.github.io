I sometimes mess up though and get steamrolled, but that's entirely fair, seeing as I knew what I had to do  and still messed up or simply got straight up outplayed. \n\nIllaois kit is healthy because it actually allows you to make mistakes against her and get away with it during the laning phase, most champions have kits that give you some kind of room to make a single mistake and get away with it, albeit with lower healthbar and the need to either back or hide behind your turret. \n\nIt's the most obnoxious and toxic champs that have kits that allow them to fuck up against you endlessly yet you can barely punish them for it, but god forbid you make a single mistake, you will not only lose your laning phase, you will probably lose the game. This is the reason why I rarely play this game anymore, the difference in power between S-tier and balanced champs is no longer large, it's freaking gigantic thanks to the new snowball amplifying masteries and core.\n\nSwiftRage","replies":[{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2016-05-30T22:29:25.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen, keystones ruined the game","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ilt","date":"2016-05-29T03:46:23.623+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":1,"body":"have fun playing against this hsit{{champion:245}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:1}} \n\nwhile your team is like {{champion:163}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}}","replies":[{"poster":"CeexSett","date":"2016-05-29T09:12:16.247+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wouldn't exactly get {{champion:45}} in the same group as the others.\n\nNot even {{champion:8}} is worth a ban.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2016-05-29T10:16:20.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most of them are really personal bans.\n\nThe more legitimate ones are just {{champion:245}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:238}} but even then Zed and Ekko have become somewhat preference bans since now they're pretty reasonable but still frustrating and unfun to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Cache of Cash","date":"2016-05-29T14:28:53.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Lucian doesn't even really need a ban until higher gold/low plat ish","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-05-29T14:39:46.014+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"trust me, as a low elo guy, that fucker is in every game. and we too, want some goddamn variety in our games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-05-29T12:25:35.566+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have 0 issues playing vs {{champion:81}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:90}} \n\nmalz can be a pain the butt to deal with but thats hardly a new thing he has always been annoying like that\n\nif you have trouble facing him play syndra into him becasue malzahar now heavily relies on his voidling swarm for dps since he lost much of his burst \n\nYou can just use scatter the weak to nullify most of his damage, just a tip","replies":[]},{"poster":"Not Katarina","date":"2016-05-29T23:52:46.372+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:163}} :[","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Br4ndon","date":"2016-05-29T03:39:30.122+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is probably the most accurate description ive ever heard of champ select.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2016-05-29T09:55:57.841+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"You accurately described what I've been feeling this whole season.\n\nThe broken FotMs are far more numerous than they used to be. \n\nThere are also certain champions that naturally preform well because of the nature of a certain league.

I feel safe saying that Fizz is up there with Zed in the amount of dislikes he gets from the community at large. That doesn't mean you should stop playing a champion like Fizz or stop liking them. Balance is largely out of our control currently, but don't turn around and try to tell others to git gud. \n\nI myself was a Fiora main for years, and when her broken rework happened I still played her even though she got a massive amount of hate on the boards.
