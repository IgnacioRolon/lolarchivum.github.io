While symptoms are similar, it doesn't always mean it's the same issue.  For example, this post has had a mix of potential ISP issues as well as local ones.  I don't have control over ISPs and can't force them to do something.  What I can do is get logs from you guys to see what's happening and gain some context.  In cases where the ISP is the result, those logs can help investigate impacted nodes if you reach out to them.  \n\nWho is your ISP?  From the reports reviewed throughout the day and communication with our network operations team, we haven't found any issues with Riot servers.  What I am seeing though, is mostly cases where connection is degrading as they hop through their ISP nodes, before ever reaching Riot Direct.\n\nI know a lot of you guys are going through a shitty situation right now, and I'm doing what I can to figure this out with you.  Anyone who has been on H&S long enough hopefully knows I'm not one to sweep anything under the rug and call it a day.  Something is causing you guys pain, and I want to help.  I'm with you and feel it too.","replies":[{"poster":"Trdonja","date":"2017-06-22T20:48:15.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but how come it is only the connection to riot servers?
