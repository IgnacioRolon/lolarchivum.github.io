LiquidKetih Hype! He was fantastic both games, even if Piglet brings better mechanics to the game, I don't think a few extra CS and slightly better in game knowledge will trump the synergy he clearly had with Xpecial. Plus. he looked so good, I wonder if Piglet really is that much of a mechanical upgrade?","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-01-27T20:31:21.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xpecial is just really good at adapting to ADCs.\nYou could tell there wasn't the same level of synergy as some bot lanes (Rush Hour just to mention one).\n\nHe did great.

I'd prefer that they keep Keith as their ADC he meshes PERFECTLY with the playstyles of Xpecial and IWDominate.  I think Piglet would have issues.","replies":[]}]}
