However, until recently I had access to a better computer, and haven't patched on this laptop since May.\r\n\r\nToday I lost access to the better machine, and updated LoL on this one. The update seemed fine, but now when I log in, the client (almost) immediately crashes (stops responding to input, and after a while Windows reports it has stopped working). I usually get about half a second to click on things before it freezes; I've managed to do things like open the personalized store page or minimize a chat window.\r\n\r\nI've tried restarting the computer, but I'm not really sure what else to try. I also signed up for the alpha client in case that runs better, but I haven't been approved yet. Some people are counting on me to play later today, so i hope I can get this fixed soon! Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T23:39:37.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client may be disconnecting from our servers and causing the freezes and eventual crash.
