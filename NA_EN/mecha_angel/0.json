If that didn't fix it, it's possible that your connection to our servers is *unstable* and could prevent your patcher from reaching the login servers. In this case, I'd recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local network settings are compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
