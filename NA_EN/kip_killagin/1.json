Which is why they should raise it as their is already a precedent for doing so in the past with a much smaller amount that caused it to raise previously.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-01-31T01:48:10.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If we had the same percentage of bans as we used to, we'd have 20 bans.
