I really don't mind the weak points on her kit. I'm cool with E having a cast time, I am okay with Q being a harder to use lucian Q essentially, and I actually like strut a lot, whether it stays her passive or moves to an ability. Her damage is awkward however as far as scaling goes. Ult scaling is just kinda silly with too much ramp up time, and Q needs to scale with attack speed. You are literally losing damage late game if you ever use your Q and THAT feels like poor design. I should not feel bad about using my abilities.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-28T18:27:02.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Miss Fortune,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5VeOp6Xq,comment-id=0001000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-28T17:56:58.379+0000)\n>\n> It's use in a 1v1 is for the extra burst and instant auto attack reset.\n> \n> I don't know how you play Miss fortune but hitting her Double Ups even with the execute is really easy.\n\ndid you even read my post? I mentioned the AA reset. Double Up's Burst comes on the second hit, given that the skill doesn't crit by itself, In late game, your AAs have the chance of dealing more damage because of critical chance and IE, this is a FACT. You can and will see big numbers in the bounce if you kill the first target  sure, but there's no \"burst\" in late game when your AA can outdamage your first double up hit. Don't say you just have to use it for the bounce because it's not realistic. Chances are you're going to duel someone smart enough not to be around minions or dying targets, meaning you can't possibly take into consideration that Double up WILL get this bonus damage all the time in the late game.\n\nWhile being a \"buff\", it's situational. If the skill itself was changed to enable criticals in it's formula instead of this situational damage by execute you could factor it in late game damage. It's a beauty to use in lane when you master it but other than that it's just an AA reset outside Lane.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-07-28T18:35:26.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"MF's Q being allowed to crit?\n\n{{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}  {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-07-28T18:45:43.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically the 50% damage isn't a crit either, so if you could land those together... oh boy.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-28T19:07:18.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nono, Maybe I'm not explaining myself clearly.

(The fact that it goes through multiple targets instead of being blocked already distinguishes it from Lucian and potentially balances out his ability to move.)\n\nImpure shots is a big part of her identity though, or at least Riot wants it to be. It's not just a steroid, it's a HUGE part of her damage, to access her full damage potential you need to stack impure shots, Q applies impure shots, ulti applies impure shots and it's damage increases depending on how many impure shot stacks are in the targets hit.  In a perfect world where the entire enemy team has 8 impure shot stacks and sits like a duck as MF Ults, they get 1000 physical damage+384% of her AD as magic damage.\n\nHowever, the more I think about it, this whole new Impure shots mechanic became detrimental to her, here's why:\n\nAs the game progresses, R unlocks more impure shot stacks. On paper, this seems awesome because you keep gaining damage, however.....you have MORE conditions to get this boost. It's like oh here's a long ladder for you to access your true damage potential that doesn't benefit from you getting armor penetration or lifesteal. If you look at Sivir for example, On the Hunt's passive clearly aids Ricochet, it provides Sivir with MORE AS while ricochet is active so she can get off those enhanced auto attacks easier in a fight or a duel. With MF it's a counterproductive mechanich. This can be fixed in many ways and I don't know if Riot has tried them or not, but we get no feedback either\n\nImpure shots could be reworked in many ways to keep it in her gameplay. Off the top of my head:\nSwap Strut and Impure shots, Impure shots becomes her passive, her AAs deals extra bonus magic damage with a fixed AD ratio that scales up at lvl 11 and 16, stacking up to 5 per target the entire game. She Laughs when she reaches 5 stacks on a target for clarity. Strut's aditional MS keeps being a passive and the active is the AS steroid Strut can't be lowered below 35 for the 6 seconds.\n\nKeep Impure shots in W, R doesn't add more stacks, it just increases the AD ratio passively to 7%/8.5%/10% to reach a similar damage cap (it's currently 36% max, 42% max, 48% max). This makes her damage potential crystal clear and her ult's damage more reliable if she gets it off\n\nRework Make it rain to have it take into account applying Impure shots.\n\nYou're right though, when Vel'koz came out my immediate thought was that MF should be able to redirect the cone just like he does lol","replies":[{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2015-07-29T05:11:22.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what should be done is her playstyle and kit should reflect more to what she is doing while addressing the issues in the past.\n\nAn example:\n\n{{champion:21}}  **Miss Fortune**\n\n- Passive removed\n- Movespeed increased to 335 (up from 325 live servers)\n- New passive added: **Shock & Awe**\n\n**Passive - Shock & Awe:**\nShock: For every 5% of bonus attack speed you gain from outside this passive and outside Impure shots' active, you gain 0.5 points of flat Magic penetration. \nAwe: For every 1 point of flat Magic penetration you gain outside this passive, you gain 1.25% of bonus attack speed.\n\n\n**Double-Up [Q]:**\n\n- Changed to a skill shot\n- Bounce mechanic removed\n- Upon colliding with a target after it is fired, the projectile splinters into a spray of shrapnel onto the target and behind it in a cone dealing damage (Think of Lissandra Q and Graves Ult blended together on a smaller scale)\n- Graphic animation could be a (recolored/altered) version of the new Bullet Time textures for the explosion spray\n\n**Impure Shots [W]:**\n\n- Strut steroid mechanic removed\n\n\n**Make it Rain [E]:**\n\n- Mana cost reduction per level\nOR\n- Flat mana cost reduction\nOR\n- Applies Impure Shots' stacks\n\n\n**Bullet Time [R]:**\n\n- Autoattacking while channeling no longer cancels the channel of Bullet Time (Press [R] again to stop or wait until channel is finished)\n\n\nSo a Synapses:\n\nMF is nimble _enough_ that she is along side the speeds of Sivir {{champion:15}} , Quinn {{champion:133}} , Jayce {{champion:126}} , Lucian {{champion:236}} since strut is removed.\n\nNew passive doesn't stack upon itself, but is unique enough that it scales upon **what her kit currently emphasizes** on what she does.

And they take ranked games into consideration when balancing champions. The community even complains about this. The Ryze situation is proof of this, same goes for Devourer and it's shenanigans when it's sated. Haven't you noticed that, if a champion isn't picked in the higher elos they tend not to be a priority in balance? There are currently two exceptions I can think of\n\n{{champion:78}} \nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Poppy\nShe's a champ that hasn't been touched and the last QoL change she got was the direction of E tooltip. We KNOW she's in the pipeline for a full VU because of her outdated visuals and, in the right hands, broken kit. She has a 50% win rate. By those stats, you could say that Poppy doesn't really need a kit fix, yet, she's getting one. Why? because she has problems that need to be addressed.\n\nSame goes for {{champion:114}} , 52% win rate, getting a rework because, in the right hands, she's a toxic champion.\n\nI could go own, but here's my point.\n\nIn the right hands, MF can be a beast, you're right saying that she's above average in some stats against other adcs. But Pick rate and popularity directly show that if you dedicate to master another champion with the same conviction as MF, you'll get more rewards by doing so.\n\nShe SHOULD shine in a coordinated team (LCS), because, for her to work properly, she needs special circumstances to be met, like  Lockdown compositions for her ult, A shield style of support or utility mage like Orianna, lulu, Karma or Lux for her Strut. And yet, you never see her in the pro play scenario or in high elo ranked games, why? because she's outclassed in every possible niche she can go in and other ADCs bring the same or more to the team than she does without that many drawbacks.\n\nRiot has tried to fix her kit two times now and she's still in the same spot as before if not worse","replies":[{"poster":"LaowPing","date":"2015-07-28T04:06:44.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're LCS example is a bit off.

It's too much of a risk and too easy to counter and play against if you dare to pick MF in pro play.

And I think this is a core problem about MF.\n\nIt's funny that you mention Leona though, that's my preferred lane for when I play MF, the sinergy in their kits is so good that my win rate in that particular lane is about 90% in platinum elo with my duo partner. You can try and counter with Morgana or Janna but the damage combination and lockdown possibilities can overcome this \"counter\" pretty easily. \n\nIn most cases, even with those that follow the herd, the usual notion is \"I'm going to pick Graves or Jinx or Sivir over Miss Fortune because they're better than her\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Minrog","date":"2015-07-29T06:47:55.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Miss Fortune,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5VeOp6Xq,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-28T03:01:45.099+0000)\n\n> Miss Fortune is really strong and even if she's not played in the LCS, it doesn't dictate her power level by any means.

However a few things that I think are worth noting\n\nThe ulti was nerfed because of Black Cleaver, while adding the impure shots mechanics  to sort of \"keep\" an AD ratio (IMO a weird decision). If she had her natural AD ratio like before, Bullet time would be worth the risk ):\nAlso, with proper changes I think Strut could be viable though, it's just that currently, the passive is lackluster and too easy to deny (freaking MINION DAMAGE). It's not about Strut not bringing any team utility, it's about Strut not bringing much to MF's table at the moment\n\nAbout the split pushing thing, weren't the buffs to impure shots AS reverted because she became a beast at siege?  This whole rebalance of MF was swept under the rug so hard -_-","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-07-28T01:15:49.881+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"So to all the little pussies who downvoted without trying to debate that point:\n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=ADC&sortBy=general.totalDamageDealtToChampions&order=descend\n\nFacts are facts little guys.","replies":[{"poster":"X8ViEhkPS0","date":"2015-07-28T01:50:00.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NemeBro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5VeOp6Xq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-28T01:15:49.881+0000)\n>\n> So to all the little pussies who downvoted without trying to debate that point:\n> \n> http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=ADC&sortBy=general.totalDamageDealtToChampions&order=descend\n> \n> Facts are facts little guys.\n\nHoly shit lets look at some numbers.\n\nCompared to Jinx, .5% more damage on average. \nCompared to Vayne, 5.7% more damage on average.\nCompared to Ashe, 4.3% more damage on average\nCompared to Kalista, 11% more damage on average.\n\nJinx we can pretty much throw out because the difference is so negligible.\nVayne while dealing less damage by nearly 6% will kill tanks faster and overall a safer champion.\nAshe being a utility carry dealing less makes sense, but Ashe warps her team's composition around her ultimate while MF should be played because you picked this AoE centric lockdown comp.\nNow Kalista will always be in a good spot unless her damage goes nearly away because of her absurd objective control and being able to throw around allies.\n\nNow if we look at average win rates MF's win rate is only higher than Kalista's and that is by .64%.
