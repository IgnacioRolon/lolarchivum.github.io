Typically breaktime is 10-20 minutes when things are running smoothly, so more like 4.5-5.4 hours.  And typically game length will vary and most series don't go to 5.  If 5 different hour long games happen in a meta that has 35-40 average game length, those teams would make 5 different 50 minute games happen in a meta like the one we have (those games still happen).  That easily stacks up to 4.2 hours without even including break times... and its a result of passive teams using passive tactics to avoid feeding in their ridiculous snowball metas.  The more dangerous 1 death becomes, the more likely there are to be more teams that'll pick every passive option possible to extend the game for safety.\n\nKorea converted to best of 3s anyway, every other region is playing best of 1s.  Best of 5s is now becoming a whole day event for specific tourneys, and if you're buying a ticket to a series I think 4 hours is a reasonable expectation if that's literally your full day of games.  Games of Football, Soccer, and Baseball go on for hours for a best of 1 and in League games have a much higher variance in time so it being sometimes shorter and sometimes longer makes sense.  Hell, if I plan on doing a bunch of Ranked or sitting down for a game night like D&D or want to watch LCS 4 hours is a reasonable commitment.  If they don't have that time why are they traveling to see a live showing and buying expensive tickets for a variable timeslot?  The reasoning doesn't add up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil UwUzi Vert ","date":"2018-07-07T17:51:23.498+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kaìju,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IvM2fep0,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-07T13:46:41.166+0000)\n>\n> Said it makes games too long.

They hear about towers being weak, they hear about TP being taken in the bottom lane, suddenly, that's the reason why everyone takes TP. Clueless people, clueless boards.\n\nTP was first taken by Ezreal around 2 months ago, because of early game execution-heavy comps that had to rely on outpacing the enemy and letting Ezreal hit his 2-item powerspike as soon as possible, while also exerting pressure on the enemy laners. Teleport does exactly that. Ezreal is a safe pick, won't die, except if he fucks up, so the need for a Heal isn't needed until later in the game where teamfights start happening. Even in small skirmishes early game, you are already stronger than most of the enemies, so Heal won't be needed anyway. TP is the superior choice.\n\nAnother thing is that with so much burst, if you are to die as Ezreal, it's because you are getting piled on with CC and probably tower dived, therefore the Heal won't do much anyway. \n\nTP was then used more often, seeing how it was successful, even in the later stages in the game, where you could send your Ezreal - Lucian to splitpush and stil have baron pressure. It has nothing to do with towers being weak or pushing lanes and random shit that the OP said.
