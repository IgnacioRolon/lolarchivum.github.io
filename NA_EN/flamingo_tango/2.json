I've since switched back to the old/legacy client.\r\nalso since Friday, have been experiencing lag (which hasn't happened to me before).  This has been happening so far only tested in A.R.U.R.F.   ARURF is very fun but there is lot of spamming.  Any clues as to how to avoid lag spikes and reconnects would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nMac OS X ver 10.11.6","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T03:48:10.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the two issues you've reported, it sounds like a lot of this may be stemming from an *unstable connection* to our servers.
