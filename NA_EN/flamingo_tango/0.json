I know I'd appreciate seeing if I had any notifications while browsing the site... Speaking of which, you know what I'd absolutely LOVE? *Client integration, Rito please!*\n\nThe first step would be adding the notification icon/counter into the client (next to the IP/RP icons?). Later, I'd hope to have a way to browse Boards from within the client, like how we can view patch notes from within the launcher.\n---\nI don't think this should happen right away. In fact, I don't think it should happen until Boards is out of Beta. That's because, when you do anything in the client, it's going to get a HUGE amount of publicity (which is awesome!), and, if you want this platform to become a huge success, you don't want to give people the impression that it's anything but a finished product with a shiny new coat of polish.\nI understand why","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HellMuff","date":"2014-12-19T13:06:38.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting","replies":[]},{"poster":"dustwind8","date":"2014-12-19T00:51:06.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Flamingo%20Tango?content_type=discussion\n\n2 clicks away, \n\n1.
