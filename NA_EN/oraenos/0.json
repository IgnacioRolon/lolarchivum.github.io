This skin line idea just seems terribly boring. The concept? Elegant looking female champs? That's a tad lame. And the example you have proposed, especially the Leona one, appear to be a tad...fetish fuel. And the female champions are already a tad bit boring visually, since most of them all use the same body type and even extremely similar facial features. Female champs need more interesting and cool skins that aren't just them playing dress up. \n\nI suppose my logic is flawed though. I suppose our beloved Rito overlords have trouble coming up with an interesting skin theme, because most female champs do stick to that same aforementioned stale body and facial type. We have no female monster champions, and for some reason the Shadow isles has no female specters, only scantly clad women. So excuse me if I came of as rude.\n\n-just my 200 cents, and a nickel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustBoneBrook","date":"2014-10-12T04:18:28.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i agreed if diana got one too :D poor her {{champion:131}}  she got so much no low (i dont like to play her but i like the concept)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marcia","date":"2014-10-07T21:51:05.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd really like to see some sort of feminine equivalent to the debonair skin line.
