If you could add a function that allows you to only put pictures on a specific screen that would help a lot. I have a second monitor/screen and when my animated pictures come up on the second screen it lags my computer and doesn't make it look good. If I could make it so that animated screensavers don't appear on my second screen it wouldn't lag and would look a lot more aesthetic.  It doesn't sound too hard to code in, but if it can't be accomplished I understand. Thank you &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T22:47:58.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This type of feedback should be posted on the [Miscellaneous Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous), where it will get more visibility and can be tracked.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
