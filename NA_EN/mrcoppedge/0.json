(Not tested on wards or neutrals).  I am not sure if this is intentional. Any update whether it is would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-29T06:16:12.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MrCoppedge! \n\nThanks for the report! I'll take a look and see if this is intentional, and if not, get the proper sounds hooked up. ^-^\n\n**EDIT:** This is intentional, as hitting different items in the game will give you different SFX, i.e. metals v. turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2016-02-08T18:32:56.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if this is intentional, a lot of us will never be using this skin again (especially in my case since these bugged sounds also cause massive lag spikes everytime I hit an enemy with an ability)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Majestically","date":"2016-01-30T00:44:13.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really annoying his abilities sound like balloons popping, this is a bug right?
