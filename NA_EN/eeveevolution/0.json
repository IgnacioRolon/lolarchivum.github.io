Your account was permanently banned because you didn't change your behavior after the multiple chances you were given, it didn't just go from a clean slate to a permanent ban.","replies":[{"poster":"eeveevolution","date":"2019-01-21T05:07:42.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well this was coming out of a 25 game ban into a permabanned.

(You can find this out by trying to log in to the banned account)\n\n Normally this behavior isn't considered zero-tolerance language, so it should have just gone from a 25-game chat restriction to a 14-day gameplay ban. The only thing here that may have possibly triggered the skip would be this line:\n\n>eeveevolution: ikkk\n\n and that's just because it has 'kkk' in it. That's a bit of a stretch, though, honestly. \n\n If you're positive that you didn't have a 14-day ban on the account at any point, I'd suggest filing a support ticket as nothing here should have made you go from a 25 game chat restriction to permabanned.
