It&#039;s not really that big of an issue, but it&#039;s still something that happens, so do what you will with this info. Maybe because his ult is heard by everyone, I don&#039;t know.\r\nAgain, when my ally Sion {{champion:14}}  places a ward {{item:3340}}  I can hear him saying the ward placing line.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-02T16:23:28.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThis is actually a larger issue - a lot of ward placing lines were swapped to global this patch.
