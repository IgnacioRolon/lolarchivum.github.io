To have an easier time looking through them to find the Thresh skin, I clicked the box that said &quot;Limited Edition&quot; so I would only see those skins. When I scrolled to the bottom of the list, however, I saw Jaximus listed as Limited Edition. I think it has something to do with the release of Battle Boss Blitzcrank and Arcade Riven. Riot said that, as well as releasing more skins, that that patch was also retiring some skins. Among those skins was Jaximus, the skin made to honor the memory of a terminally ill teenager who had visited Riot Studios. Someone had asked Riot if it was appropriate to put a skin with such a background in the Vault, and Riot responded saying that they wouldn&#039;t retire the skin. I think that Jaximus, although permanently in the Skin Store, is still listed as a Legacy skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2015-10-01T19:22:17.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there was a suggestion to keep it permanently 'legacy' status, but obviously still sold, as a way of keeping the teen's 'legacy' known, along with getting people to ask \"Hey why is this skin considered legacy?' so they can learn a bit more about the story behind the skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-01T19:06:44.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Tuskor13,\n\nThis is working as intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2015-09-30T23:48:02.900+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Hey guys i need some help cause i can't find my shoes and then i looked under the couch and they were there.\" \n\ngood thread....?","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-10-02T05:38:40.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ask a question...then answered your own question....so what the point of this thread again?","replies":[{"poster":"Tuskor","date":"2015-10-08T02:11:20.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lightdragoon88,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=BI4UJa89,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-10-02T05:38:40.811+0000)\n>\n> You ask a question...then answered your own question....so what the point of this thread again?\n\nI didn't know if it was a bug or not.","replies":[]}]}]}
