It isn't anything special but it isn't total shit. I stopped playing League of Legends on it for a while (it was working perfectly fine except for weird ping spikes) because I got Overwatch but yesterday I wanted to play some League. It was going normal until I entered the game. My game just froze and the sound did too. I could not move the mouse or exit the window until I shut down my laptop. I tried to fix it by repairing, looking up solutions and changing Windows 10 settings but nothing has worked so far. I tried 4 more times and the game froze again. Is this a common problem? Does anyone have a solution? Btw I am nothing close to good with computers.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T22:02:46.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you got your new laptop, did you update Windows 10?  The freezing and weird noise may be due to an issue with the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) not interacting properly with league.  Try disabling that as your first step and let me know if that works for you!","replies":[{"poster":"Papi McLovin","date":"2016-10-25T01:47:44.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hadn't checked for any answers for a while since I didn't think anyone would answer me.
