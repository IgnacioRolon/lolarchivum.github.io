As a jungle main, I have some of advice for you. Whenever I camp a lane there is always a reason. It is usually because the enemy laner is actively making it easy for me.\n\nSo if you are getting camped try to think about what you are doing that might encourage a jungler to camp you. Are you playing really far forward all the time, do you never ward your lane, or do you constantly take aggressive trades against you opposing laner(s) without any knowledge of where the enemy junger is? I am not saying that every single time you are getting camped it is your fault, but it probably is in most cases. Also, if you are getting camped there is no reason you should be dying to it more than twice. As soon as you realize you are getting camped just play as safe as possible. I don't understand how someone can complain about getting camped, then continue to die to ganks that they knew the enemy jungler was going to make. If your lane is getting camped you should assume that the enemy jungler is always nearby ready to gank, unless you have a particular reason to think otherwise.\n\nAs for a laner complaining that the enemy junger has ganked X times, but their jungler hasn't ganked yet. The reasons an enemy junger would want to camp you are often the same reasons your junger can't gank for you. If you are really far pushed up you are far from safety, and you are pushing your enemy towards their safety. It is hard to get a successful gank on an enemy who is 2 steps from their tower. Also, if the enemy jungler is camping you, there is a high chance that any attempt by your jungler to gank will be counter-ganked by the enemy jungler.\n\nI think one aspect I have seen left out in most conversations on this subject is the jungler's perspective. Imagine you are the jungler and your top lane has been playing too far up without wards and gets camped so that he is 1/4/0, and down 30 cs. Do you have any reason to think that if you gank for him once and get him some more gold that he will stop making the bad decisions that got him killed 4 times in the first place? No, it is more likely he will continue playing too far forward and just keep dying anyway. So to try to get your top laner back into the game you would have to gank him enough times that he could get such a large lead that he could keep playing too far up, and still win.\n\nI am not pretending that the jungler is always right, but even if your jungler does suck, and he could've done something to stop you from getting camped, or if he should have been getting successful ganks in other lanes, you blaming everything on the jungler won't help you get better, or survive getting camped. I also won't pretend I have never blamed the fact I was losing on getting camped, we all do it at some point. You don't automatically lose lane because you are getting camped. I have had some lanes where the enemy jungler tried to camp me early game, and they quickly gave up because they all failed. \n\nSo I would like to give some specific advice on what to do when you are camped.\n\n1. WARD!!!!!!!: I know RIOT hates wards, and that they have been gradually removing vision from the game, but you need to ward as much as you can. You can ask your jungler to help you get wards as well. The worst they can do is not ward. If you see the enemy jungler on a ward near you, you can either back up to tower immediately, or even better, if you know the engage range of the jungler, you can stay just out of his range. If you remain barely out of his range, and occasionally move towards them a bit you can trick them into wasting time hoping you will step close enough to them. I want to warn you again, only try to do this if you know the enemy jungler's engage range very well, and keep the possibility of them flashing for extra distance in mind.\n\n2. Keep an eye on your minimap: Having perfect vision of the whole map doesn't do you any good if you never look at your minimap. I have had multiple successful ganks where I knew I was walking over a ward, but the enemy lane wasn't paying attention. Also constantly checking your minimap can let you spot the enemy jungler in a different lane, or in their jungle so you know how aggressively you can play.\n\n3. Don't keep pushing in: as a jungler it is much easier to gank a lane that is shoved into your tower. So if you notice you are being camped, do not push the wave unless there is a particular reason to do so. I am constantly bamboozled when I have a losing lane that just shoves for the whole laning phase. I have to wonder if these people understand that towers = safety in most cases, and that they are voluntarily moving away from safety when they are already behind.\n\n4. Don't ignore any danger or missing pings: if you have already been ganked multiple times and you are getting pings you should retreat under the assumption that you are getting ganked again.\n\n5. Don't flame the jungler: Flaming the jungler doesn't do anybody any good. Even if your jungler is somehow 100% at fault for you dying to ganks, flaming him will just make him not want to gank for you.\n\n6. Don't use the fact that you have a bad jungler to excuse your own mistakes: Even if your jungler is getting nothing done, and they are not even farming well, you can't force them to play better. What you can do, is play better yourself. Control the only variable you can in that case, and don't worry about your teammates. Using a bad jungler to excuse the fact that you are playing way too aggressive will just lead to you dying more because you refuse to accept that you are, at least partially, at fault for your deaths.\n\nTL;DR: If you are getting camped there is a good chance that you are doing something wrong. Try to think about what you have been doing that allowed the enemy jungler to gank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-02-19T00:13:59.381+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I think I have the confidence to climb to challenger now\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2019-02-19T00:12:20.088+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm. this guy on my 5v5 tourney team shoves to the enemy tower every goddamn game and always complains about getting camped.","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2019-02-19T11:01:25.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Marshbouy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kEU7ibrl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-19T00:12:20.088+0000)\n>\n> Can confirm. this guy on my 5v5 tourney team shoves to the enemy tower every goddamn game and always complains about getting camped.\n\nBeen shoved and can confirm they don't care if you are shoved if you are the lane they want to gank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2019-02-19T00:29:19.525+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're getting camped, let them.

The biggest problem a jungler has is that they can't be everywhere at the same time, and unlike a laner, gold and experience don't just walk up to you in 6-7 convenient little packages every 30 seconds.  Wasting time is bad.  So whenever you have an opportunity to waste the enemy jungler's time, take it.\n\nThis involves a certain amount of trust that your teammates actually WILL do something worthwhile on the rest of the map, but... if all of your teammates are worthless, you're almost certainly going to lose anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2019-02-20T18:08:25.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The worst problem with this is relying on your own jungler to be able to make that initiative happen.\n\nNothing feels worse as a top laner than distracting both Jungle and top for 2+ minutes, not dying, and your team not taking any advantage for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XYGSYS","date":"2019-02-19T00:34:04.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, that was what I was talking about in my point about warding. If you know the jungler is waiting for a gank opportunity try to keep them on the edge of thinking they are about to get the right opportunity.

Ive been camped in lanes where the enemy laner has the prority. I'd rather be camped in a lane i shoved then be camped in a lane that is pushed in my way, namely because my jungler tends to invade and die to the 2v1 every time without me being able to help him.\n\nNext point you made, Warding. Here is the problem with warding in a camped lane. The enemy jg is always clearing your red wards, placing a red ward for the enemy and punishing you for trying to clear it. Furthermore if they are an assassin they just build {{item:3147}}  and are clearing your free wards as well. A camped lane is very oppressive and you are getting ganked from top and support even while shoved they are looking for dives once they lower you enough from the constant pressure. A lot of times they just choose a lane to sit in.","replies":[{"poster":"XYGSYS","date":"2019-02-19T13:56:20.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I guess my question is, were you dying to the ganks while they had you pushed in? My whole point in not shoving the lane is that the farther you push the more likely their ganks are to succeed. I have been camped while I've been pushed under tower constantly. It never works, unless they are already fed. So if you push up, and don't die to the ganks, I have no problem with that. My issue is when people are dying simply because they are too far pushed, and keep pushing. It also depends on the jungler. Some junglers don't need you to be very far from tower and some do.\n\nAs for warding, it can be tough to keep it warded, but there is no excuse to not try. You can even, if you know it is safe, ward farther away from your lane where they are less likely to sweep so that you can see ganks coming. This is intended for the people who aren't even dropping their two base wards for their lane. On punishing you for clearing red wards, just don't try to clear them unless you know it is safe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kattzy","date":"2019-02-19T18:16:28.903+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excellent post.

Not an excuse to flame your jungler at all, but still feels like garbage. \n\nWhen it comes to \"blaming the jungler\" there are two scenarios that piss me off at a jungler. \n1)When I'm playing a snowball lane (I main Jax and we all know what happens when he gets going), and I set up a freeze outside of my tower for 5+ minutes and my jungle never comes, despite my pings and requests for a gank. \n2) When a jungler goes in at a bad time (whether it not there or too low to go in), I ping danger like 7 times, they go in anyways and then die.

Don't keep pushing in: as a jungler it is much easier to gank a lane that is shoved into your tower.

I am constantly bamboozled when I have a losing lane that just shoves for the whole laning phase. I have to wonder if these people understand that towers = safety in most cases, and that they are voluntarily moving away from safety when they are already behind.\n\nMost players are idiots. It's so fuckin easy to avoid shoving and exposing yourself. When I don't feel like dealing with the enemy jungler and mid laner's bullshit, all I do is last hit. That is, I don't hit minions until they are near dead. 95% of players will automatically shove you in when you play like this against them and you end up playing your entire lane phase under the safety of your own tower. You can even do this with Tiamat. Although Tiamat will inevitable shove, you will end up building a huge wave which will protect you from aggression. You can even win 2v1s with a massive pushing wave.\n\nI recently won a game doing this in an unfavorable match up. I was Fiora against and Urgot. A match up I know from experience that I cannot win. So all I did was last hit most of the lane phase. What happened is that this Urgot was permanently shove up which resulted in me winning the lane when my jungler finally showed up. The interesting thing is that my jungler visited quite late. My lane was ignored most of the early game. This wasn't a problem because Urgot will always be at my tower so whenever my jungler decided it was right, he can be sure there's a good gank ready and waiting for him. No jungler would ever completely ignore a lane that's constantly pushed. He might come late but he will come or even very late, but he will come at some point. Just make sure the lane is always ready to be ganked.","replies":[{"poster":"XYGSYS","date":"2019-02-19T17:23:38.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it when I am playing top lane, and the enemy laner stomps me in trades, but instead of letting the wave freeze and punishing me for stepping up to CS, they just mindlessly shove so I can farm safe under tower.
