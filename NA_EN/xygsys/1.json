I have no issue with his damage or most of the kit, but I really hate his E. It is just super frustrating because I can&#039;t punish him for extending really far in his lane. It pretty much turns out that if I can&#039;t kill him before he reaches a wall he is just gone. For that reason he is practically impossible to kill in the jungle if you don&#039;t have a CC chain. If my understanding is correct, the purpose in his E is to help him roam and get in position to assassinate an enemy quickly. Using that logic, I don&#039;t think it should be able to be used as an extremely reliable escape. I think a good way to fix that would be to give his E a longer cooldown if used in combat. This would not infringe on his ability to roam, or get around the map quickly, but it would keep him from using his E to escape situations that any other champion would die in. This also wouldn&#039;t keep him from using his E to run if he saw the danger coming beforehand and started running early.\n\nI do not play Talon, so I don&#039;t know if that might cause problems for him. This is just the best way I can imagine to remove his ability to make stupid escapes without gutting the purpose of the ability. Do you guys think that would be a fair change, or would that cause huge issues for Talon? I am willing to accept that I just need to learn how to play around him better, but I think my argument is valid.\n\nEdit:\nIt appears that multiple people have misunderstood what the nerf would do. It would not mean he could not use his E in combat. It would mean if he did it would have a longer cooldown. Maybe it would go from its current 2 second cooldown to 5 seconds if used in combat. So he could still use it to jump out in combat, it would just require him to run normally for a little bit before he could E again. You could also add something that would reset the in-combat timer if he got a kill or an assist. So if he successfully assassinated a target he wouldn't have any cooldown penalty for a little bit.","replies":[{"poster":"TheMonkeyKiing","date":"2018-09-26T09:05:57.480+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude I always thought this and I'm glad you brought it up.

Then if I ult, he can just ult and it makes it hard because I am a sitting duck after I ult while he is stealthed and there's the part I must actually attack after my ult or the death mark proc wont be that strong meanwhile talon doesnt have to do much after activating his ult and since he is invisible then zed death mark procs and is wasted meanwhile he kills you after with point click dash autoattack rake.\n\nAnyway, now with the annoying ass parkour ability, not only is he good at roaming but can easily jump away to the point where a parkour guy is outrunning kassidin, a guy who is teleporting aka flashing every 5 seconds.

Most of the things they say are easier said than done, and are not nearly as simple as they make it seem. They don't seem to think about the fact that a good player on any champion will know the counterplay to their champion, and try to play around it. A specific example would be for Zoe. People just say keep wards in your jungle so you can be ready for the over-the-wall trouble bubble. Sure, with my two trinket wards and one control ward I will be able to ward every single area she might attack from. This one requires a team to have good vision control, which is something most players can't rely on. I just find that to be one of the things that is counterplay, but it isn't as simple as people make it out to be.

There have been numerous times I have nearly killed him, but failed to because I couldn't kill him before he reached a wall. At that point I can't flash to follow and finish him off because he will just hop the next wall. With most other champions I have a chance to catch them after they jump away, whereas Talon just jumps again. I just want enough of a window where someone attempting to kill him can flash or jump over the wall, and have some time to deal more damage before he jumps the next wall. I would not have any issues with some buffs along with it to help it out as a teamfight escape.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Somber Rites","date":"2018-09-27T03:08:58.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oughta just make it so he can't hop a wall if he's been attacked by a champion in the last 2 seconds.\n\nMake him juke a bit instead of running face first into a wall for a free escape.

Without a somewhat reliable escape, they would be suicidal dive bombers like old talon that either obliterate theirtarget(s) in a splitsecond or are usless which is very binary.\n\nHis E has a rather high cd on the same wall, so he needs to plan his escape path, he can't just dash away like half the champion rooster, he needs to get clos to an aviable wall.\nAnd yes, in the jungle that isn't so hard to achive, but that's where he's intendet to shine. If you don't wander alone into the jungle as a squishy target with no vision on talon, then that's not a big issue. If you're on a lane, he either uses it to flank you and no longer has an escape wall, or he has to try to reach you with just a 575 range targeted jump. \nHe pays for his mobillity near walls by haveing else the by far worst mobillity of any assasins and a rather ankward burst pattern with his passive.\nAnd even close to the jungle, he's no more save than akali with her shroud +3-4 dashes, zed and his shadows or Lb and her W+ult.\nSure it's annyoing, but that's what he's supposed to do. It's no worse than tristana jumping a screen, eventually getting a reset and if needed blasting you from one base to another with her ult(yea, slightly exegerated), or kaisa getting invis and as fast as light every few sec ,then dashing over multiple screens eventually while reciveing a massive shield, or kah haveing up to 3 speedboost+invis uses with a long ranged resetting jump, or tryn spinning away 24/7 and getting 5sec immortallity if needed.\nThey all can use that mobillity any time in any direction, talon has to plan ahead and be carefull to no just jump every wall for fast map movement as he eventually needs them as escape later, and he needs to get close to a suited wall rather than just saying 'fuck it, i'm out' and jumping away imidiatly like the rest....\n\nAgain, his wall hopping is his one big strength since the rework, and he pays alot for it. It does it's intendet job, giveing him ways to flank and escape while keeping hismobillity in the open rather low.","replies":[]}]}
