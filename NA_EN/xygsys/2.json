I am legitimately curious if it would be an issue. With the disclaimer out of the way, let&#039;s get to the topic. (I realize removing crits from the game is totally infeasible in terms of finding out how to rebalance the game without it, so this is purely hypothetical.)\n\nIn my opinion crits just add RNG to a game that, in my opinion, should avoid using RNG as much as possible. I find it very frustrating to lose a duel because the enemy landed multiple crits. I also don&#039;t find it rewarding when I win a duel because I land multiple crits. I would be happy if there were no crits in the game, because that would remove the only source of luck, that I can think of, in the game.\n\nIt is possible that there are reasons crits are important to balance, and the they do add to the game in a way I don&#039;t realize. So, are there reasons that removing crits would cause issues with balance, and damage the game in general?\n\nI obviously wouldn&#039;t advocate just removing crits and not compensating champions that use it. I just think it would be more fair to have all champions have predictable damage output. For this reason I don&#039;t have issues with crit effects such as on stormrazor. As long as they are predictable I don&#039;t think there is an issue, but needing to do statistics to calculate your chance of survival is annoying.\n\nAgain, I don&#039;t hate crits, I just can&#039;t personally think of a reason why the game is better with them.\n\nDo you think that crits add something to the game, or do you have any other reasons that crits are important to the game?","replies":[{"poster":"ZerglingOne","date":"2018-11-07T03:06:14.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"How would you feel about % auto attack damage amplification as a replacement?","replies":[{"poster":"XYGSYS","date":"2018-11-07T03:09:53.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems reasonable to me.

Auto attacks and skills that can crit like Alpha Strike or Yasuo Q.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2018-11-07T02:58:38.676+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's an interesting idea, and I agree, removing as much RNG as possible from the game would be ideal. \n\nMaybe work it in that every single champion crits on the third auto (three hit passives seem to be Rito's thing), but every champion's crit damage starts at +0%. Crit items would increase the damage a critical strike grants, rather than the chance of getting one, and finished crit items could make it so that you crit more often or under certain conditions (e.g., against CC'd champions, champions above/below a certain health threshold, when every basic ability is on cooldown, etc.).\n\nThis would accomplish the same thing that normal crits provide (extra DPS that is better on high-attack speed champs), but without RNG involved. It also wouldn't be front-loaded burst, since you'd need to stay in range of your target for a few attacks before getting the bonus.","replies":[{"poster":"XYGSYS","date":"2018-11-07T03:11:52.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a decent idea.

That way, you couldn't just queue it up and lie in wait.  You'd have to engage with your enemy or farm it off nearby minions. \n\nAlso, I don't really see a lot of assassin's building crit to begin with unless their Shaco or Rengar who depend on their autos to do damage. Assassins generally have a poor auto attack speed, so the amount of value they get from a crit is low, especially considering that the gold they are spending on a crit item could have been spent on an AD/AP item that would give them more damage AND scale their abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"XYGSYS","date":"2018-11-07T03:29:20.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just brought it up because you said every champion would get the crit on every X AA's.

Besides them health is how you counter true damage.\n\nAlso health counters all of those. Regardless of invite being overtuned currently imo the other ones are fine. Maybe conqueror gives too much bonus ad but the true damage conversion is not that much. Average game a champion that takes conqueror excluding broken champions like Jax and Irelia negate about 2000-3000 damage with conqueror. That is pretty fair compared to other keystones.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2018-11-07T07:41:42.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it would. Crit cannot be replaced easily, despite what some people like to say here.\n\nWhile replacing Crit with a percentage-based auto-attack damage increase would achieve the same averaged result (30% Crit Chance equals 30% increased AA damage), it would also come with a massive increase in reliability - every AA would do more damage, instead of a non-predetermined one out of three. As reliability correlates with damage, this would mean that the amplification effect would need to be nerfed to compensate. And nerfing the damage output of late-game ADCs will have a lot of ripple effects regarding damage to tanks, damage to objectives and minions (they reintroduced IE's extra crit damage against minions and monsters, remember!) and general power level.","replies":[]}]}
