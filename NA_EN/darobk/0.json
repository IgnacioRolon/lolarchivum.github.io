A sneaky, jungle champ who excels in hiding in bushes. Perhaps has a stealth when exiting bushes? Maybe a passive where the champ \"gathers food\" from the bushes, passively healing itself. \r\n\r\nI think the champ should be armed with a Tomahawk and Bow and Arrow. An ability to set a trap would be cool. Maybe his ult he turns into a wolf or raven for a while.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've read, warriors from many tribes were experts at guerrilla warfare, excelling in the art of ambush attacks and tracking.\r\n\r\nKudos to anyone who can expand on this idea :)","replies":[{"poster":"Preacher Saiba","date":"2015-01-03T04:06:48.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i want another black man. that is all!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-01-03T01:08:37.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps a man (or yordle) who made his/her life in the Kumungu.
