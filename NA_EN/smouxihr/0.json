The last game i played on my account was 5 days ago. Yesterday i signed on to gift my friend something because i owed him money. i gifted him 4 mystery champions. One day later i get my account perma banned. And i didnt even get an email. I swear riot just bans people that buy Rp so they will make another account and try to spend more money. I know im not the only one considering quitting this game because of this terrible player behavior system. i know i got reported because my friends that i que with did report me in game because they think its funny. But that was 5 days ago and i was using the account yesterday. The ban would of been minutes after the game ended. I just dont get what i did wrong and now i can never get my account back because in the terms and conditions it says under no circumstances will they give an account back. Riot games is starting to turn into a bunch of crooks.","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-07-22T07:49:19.561+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got banned for using bot to lvl account","replies":[{"poster":"Smouxihr","date":"2017-07-22T22:03:22.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean?

This is a video game right?\n\nIt states right in the [Terms of Use](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#your-account) that account sharing is not allowed: \n\n>**1.4. Can I share or sell my account or login credentials? (No.)**\nWhen you create an account with us, we require you to select a unique username and password (collectively, your **“Login Credentials”**), which you’ll use each time you access the Game. You can’t share your account or Login Credentials with anyone. You can’t sell, transfer or allow any other person to access your account or Login Credentials, or offer to do so. You’re entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login Credentials. Please notify us immediately if you become aware of any breach of security, including any loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure of your Login Credentials.\n\nAnd it's not just League that has this rule: countless other games have it too, and for good reason, as it's to help protect you from having things done to your account that you would have never done to it otherwise. If you and your friend want to play together then just make your own separate accounts and do it that way.","replies":[{"poster":"SecondAirbane","date":"2017-07-23T01:26:24.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"maybe if your game didnt have so many fucking levels\n\npeople wouldnt be buying accounts after getting banned","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-07-23T01:22:01.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a video game that's trying to cut down on cheating.
