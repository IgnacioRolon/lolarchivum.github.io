For example, when I'm talking on discord with friends, I can hear them fine, but when I log onto League, they suddenly start cutting in and out. It also causes the taskbar and desktop icons to constantly flash in and out of existence, even during a game of league, so if I click on the very bottom of my screen, if takes me out of the game. It usually lasts for the first 5-15 minutes of league, then fixes itself. Any advice on fixing?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T17:56:21.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having smoe fps issues in game, which can be due to driver problems or third party apps that aren't working well with League.  As a first step, remove any you might be running like play.tv, overlays, recorders, and the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).
