It&#039;s driving people to uninstall and quit league because of how infuriating it is to play an unfair top lane, or an unfair bot lane, because you don&#039;t know how to use the champ you are playing against the certain champ combination. On top of that, the players in the other lanes usually report the players in the corresponding lane of the champ that should not be there because they unintentionally feed due to not knowing how to control the situation.\n\nOn behalf of not just me, but the others... if there is some way that you could implement a feature that could make people pick their role, and only choose viable champs for that role and not some stupid champ that nobody has gone against in that lane, please, Riot, do so. It has gotten way out of control, and if you haven&#039;t notice the drop in players of League of Legends, look again.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Soen","date":"2015-08-03T00:26:14.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lanes were not made for champions.

For not knowing the strengths/weaknesses of other champs due to lack of experience? Why penalize your opponents for that? And Nasus bot lane? I hope to god you aren't Losing those matchups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2015-08-02T23:29:53.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wukong mid is part of the meta, and is not only viable currently, but strong. He's lucky because he's in a good position in top, mid, and jungle. Quinn and Vayne are also two ADCs that can play top lane as well. You just need to tweak your itemization a little bit to better fit who you're against. The meta changes so often for those champions that can potentially play two or three different roles, and there are many that can. There's not a concrete way for Riot to know who will be viable where, and who is no longer viable. This would cause a lot of people to complain about being shut out of a role they would excel in.\n\nThe problem I have is with people who are last pick support, and they don't respect their teammates, so they do something like Ahri support with smite. This person tried to pull this in one of my lobbies, despite multiple people telling her to not do that. I asked her to at least take exhaust if she's not going to choose a proper support, but she didn't. Someone ended up dodging thankfully, but if they didn't bot lane would be at a disadvantage. Support is a role, more than anything else, where you fill out what your team needs, and that's why everyone should learn to support and have a nice support champion pool.\n\nI'm tired of salty last pickers who are so entitled that they think they can act up. We've all been last pick before, and we rarely get the roles we main when we are, but we do not act bratty like that. There's not anything we can do to combat that kind of behavior either except dodge, which gives us a loss of LP and leaverbuster. It's really unfair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-08-02T23:06:10.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What..? Wukong is a perfectly fine mid just like Vayne can win at top. I've won many, many ranks with a Vayne top on my own team. I won't say I'm amazing or in the best rank, only Plat 5, but still. lol. The rest are a bit silly, but still. \n\nOnly issue I have with the current reporting system is that it's almost purely automated. I was surprised to hear people say they'd report people and say it's all in the logs and when I asked them if they knew the system was mostly automated, they asked if I knew Lyte, the one who's supposed to be head of the whole reporting thing, so I had to reply that Lyte isn't looking through all these reports... People actually think Rioters take the time to look through every single report that's done when in reality, it's all a damn automated system that's banned so many innocent people, more-so than its banned actual toxic players. \n\nWe need the tribunal back up or Riot to hire a proper support team that accepts these 'Tickets'. Blizzard has an entire team devoted to checking every single support ticket, including reports of harassment, etc. so why Riot doesn't have a team set up to go through the reports is beyond me. A report system is incredibly flawed if its purely automated and doesn't even check the damn logs.","replies":[]}]}
