I suggest going over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) go troubleshoot and resolve whatever is causing this block or disconnect.  It sucks to say we aren't able to alter game stats, but I hope those steps help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"XDaelin1","date":"2017-03-30T03:21:28.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah hey, so I actually managed to install the legacy client just as they ended, and now i have -17 lp. Please give that back. I was 4/1/4 by 12. It was also a problem with your new client.","replies":[]}]}
