Thats fine, I lost 17 LP. No big deal, still promoted. Now I was queued and had just entered lobby, and my client errored out. Now I lost more Lp right?. Earlier tonight, I'm playing some flex with friends cuz league with friends is fun right? My client crashes a third time, however, when restart my client doesn't ask me to relogin it just puts me back into lobby. Please explain what to do, cause I love league as much as the next guy and if I climb I climb, but losing LP over a bug isn't my ideal way to climbing to challenger by season 2020\r\n\r\n-Hopeful for a fix,\r\n-XDaelin1","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-04T17:09:44.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like that last game may have resulted in a remake, so it ended early and put you back in the lobby.  I would like to get some more details to help figure this out.  Are you solely using the legacy client?  More importantly, elaborate more on what you mean by crash.  Are there any error messages, and what do they say?  Do you ever get to a loading screen for a match?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"XDaelin1","date":"2017-04-04T20:53:26.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am now using the new client, I also did not have a remake that day.
