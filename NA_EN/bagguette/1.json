They would probably go 30/3/8 in any Silver game as one of their mains. That said, you're not garbage. You just need to practice, learn, and apply what you learn properly.\n\nAs for Plat, I can reliably do stupid stuff like going Ryze APC Botlane and get 2 digit kill-scores and a fully stacked mejais by the end of the game in Silver. Again, not to say Silvers are garbage, they just usually don't know how to avoid dieing or how to play when behind, skills a Plat has to learn to stay where they are.\n\nTrue garbage stays garbage. Garbage doesn't improve with time. Silvers aren't garbage. They are improving over time. Bronze aren't garbage, because they're also improving over time.\n\nTo be honest, the higher MMR people are the more stagnant. They improve less because they have less to improve or aren't able to figure out what they're doing wrong.

Some of us silvers are good but need to learn to solo carry, I always win lane too.\n\nWell Gbay99 is more of a team player who knows how to play with his leads, and he knows what to do at what time in the game (most of the time). Plus if you win lane and can't win the game than try to learn to help your team more.  \n\nSome Diamond players you watch may seem bad; because, you watch them play against other Diamond level players. It's like calling a challenger bad because he/she sometimes plays poorly against other challenger players.\n\nP.S.
