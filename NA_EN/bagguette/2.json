You can say the same thing about any champion and explain why they are overpowered or even overloaded with their kit. Honestly Yasuo's kit is designed for fighting. Like Zed, he is a high risk, high reward champion. When played correctly, he can be a pain in the ass yes. But if you play smart against him, then he wont be as much of a threat. He is supposed to capitalize off of mistakes. Lets talk about his Pros and Cons about all of his abilities shall we?\n\nPassive: \nPros: Double Crit chance, Shield based off level\nCons: Crit chance reduced to 90% (75% for Q), Capped Shield capacity, Takes about 20 seconds to get shield back up\n\nQ: \nPros: High damage, Low CD (scales off attack speed), Has knock up.\nCons: Very narrow, Need attack speed to lower CD, Tornado can be predicted easily \n\nW: \nPros: Blocks projectiles of all sorts in front of him and roughly to the sides\nCons: Doesnt block turrets, can be walked through, lazers go through it, high CD, 3.75 seconds of wall\n\nE: \nPros: Very mobile, Stacking damage, Gap closer, used to dodge\nCons: Can only be used on one target every so often based off of E level, Can be interupted, lack of enemies means cant dodge well, AP scaling\n\nR:\nPros: AOE damage, Armour Pen, Suspended for 1 second, Regains Flow bar\nCons: Commitment, can be QSS'd, Normally can be caught out and damaged during ult\n\nAs you can see, each of his abilities has cons to it that makes it more difficult to play him. Good yasuos though, can manage CDs to their advantage (can be said for every champion). He is very slippery but any form of hard CC will fuck him over in a team fight. If focused, he will die very quickly. Just like Riven, or any other carry top laners, if they are focused hard, they will be deleted from the fight. \n\nEarly game: Wait for him to use his wind wall then go in for a trade. Bait out his wall and try to proc his shield. If you think he is going in for a trade, back off and keep distance from your minions. Sometimes staying near his minions is better. And if he is pushed up, ask for a gank. Ask for a jungler that has a point and click CC. Like Udyr, Mao, Voli, Malph, Jax, Hec, Irelia, etc. Also, if you are against a Yasuo, use Exhaust to slow, and reduced damage by 40%.\n\nMid Game: Keep an eye on him. If he is pushing too far, punish him for it. If he doesnt have minions he can only dash to camps or enemies. Never go in one by one against him. Always chain CC for maximum effectiveness. 4 man ganks will tilt them if they are cocky.\n\nLate Game: He will enter the battle as the engager, or to clean up. So save your heavy CC to kill him. Or use it right off the back and wait for it to come back up. He is only useful when he gets a good knock-up or ult on many people. So try to spread out and make sure tanks\nstay in the front to take a good amount of damage. Try your best to bait out his wall. His wall is a game changer if used properly in a late game teamfight. So try to apply a lot of poke on him to bait it out. Once it is used, engage on him with hard CC.\n\nI am a yasuo main. I have been before the mastery system ever came out. Now one thing I have noticed over the years about yasuo is that he is building more tanky. But full AD yasuo is still a huge problem. His kit is DESIGNED to be a carry role. But like Fizz, Akali, Ekko, and someone like Zed, they can build tankier and still get good damage stats. \n\nIf you want to complain about Yasuo, then do it to yourself. He, like many other fighters and somewhat assassins, can be dealt with easily with hard CC and being caught out. I have carried many games but lost because I was caught out. He may be a pain to deal with, but if you shut him down, and keep him down, there is no way that he can come back. He falls behind very very quickly. Keep these things in mind, and you should be able to fight him easier. Learn how to play Yasuo, so you know what counters him and what his weak points are. I have played him enough times, so i know most of his weak points. Though my mechanics with Yasuo are a bit higher than my rank, I dont have as much to worry about when I play him, because people dont know what it takes to play against him.\n\nMany High Elo players love his design and his kit. Ask imaqtpie, voyboy and darshaan. See what they think about Yasuo. Ask any high elo player and they will say around the same things as I have. Also, play someone more mobile against Yasuo. If you can move around as much as he can, then it is harder for him to hit you. His kit is designed for fighting, so give him a break. Every champion has a kit that can be OP if played at a high level and if they can use their Pros to their advantage. \n\nI hope this help you realize that he isnt as OP as everyone claims he is. He is very fun to play as and gives you a challenge to try to master his kit. Overall, i believe that yes, because of his kit, he can have some majour outplays.

He only synergizes with his build paths.\n\n> Because people see that they can be tanky and still kill people in less than two seconds, and if you try to retaliate they just laugh and flip flop away untouched. Such a bullshit system.\n\nOnly way he can do that is if he is ahead by a lot. He takes a lot more damage than you think. He can take less damage if he is able to dodge the abilities well if he times it right with his E. Predictions my good sir. Comes in handy a lot.\n\n> I don't need a stupid rundown of his abilities, you idiot. I know what they do. I just take Annie and stun the shit out of him. Yes I know how to play against him, but it doesn't mean that I like to.\n\nIf you know how to play against him, then why are you bitching like an SJW? Honestly youre just looking for something to complain about now. \n\n> you idiot\n\nTriggered.\n\n> Just shut up already. He is broken. He is OP as everyone claims he is. He is not fun to play as\n\nAgain. He is actually very fun to play. Ask a lot of players why they play Yasuo, some say because hes in meta (like everyone else with their champions in meta) or they say he is fun and want to get better at him. He may be very strong if played correctly (like many other high skill cap champions: **Azir, Riven, Syndra, Orianna, Zed, Bard)**. And he is only OP because of his items.\n\nSo before you open your mouth about how \"you dont care, he will always be OP\" think about this: There is always going to be a strong champion whether you like it or not. **Bitch and whine** like the child you act like. Or you can learn how to play against it and not have to worry about it. If you want to bitch and complain, then talk to **SJW's**. They will hook you up with a really good spot. If not, then get off the forums and just play the damn game and let people be given the time to discuss more important things like bug reports, skin concepts, and nerf or buff ideas. \n\nWhen you make a discussion, look at where it says \"Create a Discussion\", the click on \"Choose a Board\". Then after you do that tell me if there is a board that says \"Bitching\" and/or \"Complaining\". If you find it, i'll take back what I said. You will be right and I will be wrong. But if its not there, then complain to your stuffed teddy bear or pillow. Venting to people in the game will get you nowhere bud.\n\nAt least **inanimate** objects will listen to you.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-09-06T20:07:01.541+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InfernoFoxxx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3urrnb6H,comment-id=00020005000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-06T18:02:23.864+0000)\n>\n> Lol. You gave complaining content about Yasuo. I shoved information back at you to prove he really isnt that OP. It is honestly pointless to complain about a champion on the forums. \n\nApparently complaining on the boards is not pointless because if enough people do it, the more Riot listens. When they got tired of all the \"nerf Zed\" posts, which took awhile, they finally nerfed him. They hear what people are asking for with Yasuo and they are doing it. So, again, not pointless as you say.\n> \n> LOL dude. The only defensive stats that he gets is from his build path. Honestly his armour is extremely low and a very low MR too. He was meant to be a mid-laner so he was never given any tank stats. He only synergizes with his build paths.\n\n\"Defensive crap\" = his shield and windwall, then his build added onto it. He should only synergize with a mid lane build not the tank ones.\n> \n> Only way he can do that is if he is ahead by a lot. He takes a lot more damage than you think. He can take less damage if he is able to dodge the abilities well if he times it right with his E. Predictions my good sir. Comes in handy a lot.\n\nI'm talking more about how Zed and Fizz are able to do it even if they aren't ahead by much. Still, he can kill you quickly while building tank, which I say is bullcrap.\n> \n> If you know how to play against him, then why are you bitching like an SJW? Honestly youre just looking for something to complain about now. \n\nI'm not looking \"for something to complain right now.\" Are you fucking serious? I  came here first and foremost to talk about how Riot designed him, then you went all teacher mode on me. Yeah if you do that I'll complain a bit but I didn't come here to do it originally.\n> \n> Triggered.\n> \n> Again. He is actually very fun to play.

The only AD champs I like to play are tanks like Leona, or juggernaut/tanks like Irelia or Gnar.\n> \n> So before you open your mouth about how &quot;you dont care, he will always be OP&quot; think about this: There is always going to be a strong champion whether you like it or not. **Bitch and whine** like the child you act like.

Calling me a child? How disrespectful of you. I haven't been bitching or whining for your information, only disagreeing with you. Sure somethings you have said sent me into a furry of frustration but again I never came to complain, bitch or whine like a child.\n\nI'll stay on the forums if I want. Don't tell others what to do because you think they should do it.\n> \n> When you make a discussion, look at where it says &quot;Create a Discussion&quot;, the click on &quot;Choose a Board&quot;.
