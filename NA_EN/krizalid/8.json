As I understand it generally a knight was simply someone who exhibited the proper traits of courage and behavior and both swore to and was chosen to serve their sovereign and/or country.  Often people trained as a squire under a knight to become a knight, but not always.  Nobility was required in some cases depending on era and country, but that was mostly the exception.  What was generally required was the means to maintain readiness (read: equipment and training), and that often created a wealth barrier to knighthood, but in some systems being a knight meant being granted a living that could meet that requirement, especially in systems where knighthood was tied to the military.  So then:\n\nRuneterra isn't the only place knights could come from.  {{champion:44}} could just be a knight from another world, and given that the IoW is being retconned out, he'll almost certainly be from Runeterra once his lore is redone.\n\nBeing from a warrior culture wouldn't preclude one from being or becoming a knight, and knights were often gifted mystic armor in fantasy settings.  Being the chosen of something/someone and being given arms and armor to fight in the name of it would definitely put {{champion:89}}  as either a paladin, knight or both.  As I understand it, the two weren't always mutually exclusive.\n\nBeing the daughter of a blacksmith wouldn't preclude {{champion:78}}  from being a knight either.  There are loads of stories of great knights rising from humble beginnings and tragic pasts.  In that respect, she's kind of a shoe-inn.  A young girl who became a knight of Bandle Town and was named diplomat to Demacia after proving herself upon the death of her father.  It certainly fits the stories I'm familiar with.\n\n{{champion:59}}, I would argue, would actually be least suited to being a knight _because_ he's a prince.  Royalty didn't become knights because the job of a knight was to serve the country and/or sovereign.  As royalty, he would be symbolically considered the country, or, depending on how noble titles worked in Demacia, be given the courtesy of being symbolically the country out of deference to his father, the king.  Basically, knights would exist to serve him, so he could not himself be a knight according to most classical standards of knighthood.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-07-08T01:02:19.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying tarric wasnt from Runtera was in refrence to the rioter saying taric was the gem knight technically you usually are a knight of where you are from. \nim not saying that the rest of them arnt capable of being knights but riot hasnt actually made them knights poppy was adopted by Demacia because they got her dad killed when they ordered the item he was makeing. i cant remember the specific item but i suspect crown. and she became an ambasador.\nleona and diana were trained in the art of war just like MANTHEON just that leona was bestowed holy armor when it was discovered she was blessed by the sun. and dianna found enchanted armor. but none named knights in specific.\ni say J4 because royalty and nobility are the most likely to also hold knight hood titles garen would also fit that mold Kinights can be generals and he is from a noble house in Demacia\nEdit: in olden times Royalty would often join their soldiers on the battle field princes more so than kings as a show of strength and to raise troop morale (often with people specifically around him to prevent them from being harmed excessively)","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-07-08T01:56:18.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are looking at it the wrong way.\nIts more about who fits the basic archetype of a knight better and not who actually wields the titel of a knight.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-07-08T02:16:07.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and im saying that none of them do fit it not that they cant. they if just having solid armor made you a knight there would have been much much more","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-06T17:10:39.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think Poppy other than being tiny is the closest to a straight knight archetype.
