I always wanted to see Vlad with moustache, Swain wearing dark clothes and LeBlanc with a costume worth of a Black Rose Matron. I hope that I have succeeded with their looks. \nI would like to say that I really love League of Legends. I’m in love with its characters, story, and the whole universe. I’ve never been so excited about the videogame in my life and that’s the reason why you see so many skin concepts from me. And I swear that there will be more of them in the future. I think that I’m getting better and better with the ideas and realizations as time goes by and one day, one of my concepts will actually appear in this game. Of course I’m just another artist out there who’s just spending his time drawing skins which are just his own desires and views on character’s persona, but that’s my dream – to become a little part of this wonderful game. And even if it sounds ridiculous to somebody – I will still continue to go to it. I’m not sure if I ever did this earlier, but I want to thank Riot Games for this awesome MOBA which easily beats every modern game out there, because LoL has soul. It has everything: you want rivalry? Here you go. You want war? Enjoy it. You want sci-fi? And again – yes! This game is very artistic and I will always stick with it even if I will grow old. Thank you for your time and I hope that you enjoyed this picture as much as I did while making it for you.\n\n**Update:**\nThank you very much, everyone!

Ever notice how he loses the limp in his Tyrant Swain skin, which is supposed to be him after he took control of Noxus. \n\n\"The earliest account of Swain's existence comes from a Noxian infirmary doctor's notes. According to them, Swain limped into the ward without cry or complaint: his right leg was snapped in half, with bone protruding from the skin. A small, scowling bird seemed affixed to his shoulder. The doctor gawked in horror as the young adolescent answered questions about his health and age with a calm, even stare. Even behind the echoing crack as the sand counterweights reset his tibia, Swain’s measuring gaze never flickered, nor did his eyes twitch from the pop of his fibula. He refused the doctor’s recommendation of magical treatment for the leg’s inoperable damage, requesting only a spare crutch before shuffling away.\"","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-02-02T04:30:50.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you see his dance animation, you would know that the injury is gone by now.
