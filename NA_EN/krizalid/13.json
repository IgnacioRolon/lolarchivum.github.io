Basically Hayter has no big roles right now after the mess happened with Konami and Hideo Kojima who pulled a bad trick on Hayter (he's still very upset about it), yet he would really like to voice some cool character in another videogame. We already have Raiden as Jhin(Quinton Flynn), why don&#039;t we bring Snake too? I&#039;m a big fan of his Snake, I know that I can&#039;t be the only one here.
