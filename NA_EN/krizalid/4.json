I just think Marauder would go better for different champions since it implies a certain ferocity, a barbarism, an eagerness to fight. Karma is pretty much the poster child of enlightenment. \nShould she have an evil skin? Sure, I see no problem with that- but I feel like a Dark Sorcerer or something would be much more thematically appropriate than Marauder.\n\nI'll personally wish for a Cyber Karma skin till the day I die, similar to Pulsefire Ezreal. Her Mantra provides the perfect opportunity for making commands with a computer voice. Her little back shield could be turned into a rotating holographic, and her abilities could be made to look computer generated. \nAlas, no drawing talent to translate my idea to an image others can see.","replies":[{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2015-02-16T23:47:27.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Gravitation Karma, search for it and you'll be surprised :P\nBy the way, I love your idea ;)","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2015-02-17T02:04:18.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, Dark Gravitation of Karma does look pretty neat.
