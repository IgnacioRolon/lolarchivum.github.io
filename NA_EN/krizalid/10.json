The only champions I could think of that somehow represent the said patterns are Nosferatu/Marquis Vladimir, Vayne&#039;s Aristocrat skin and small bits of Caitlyn&#039;s design (tell me if I&#039;m wrong, but I really can&#039;t remember anyone else. Ah, humorous gentlemen skins actually count?). I&#039;m definitely **not** talking about steampunk, but the other fictional representations of 1800-1900 years. You know, like Bram Stoker&#039;s Dracula (so the fictional Transylvania in media), Frankenstein, many species of english serial killers like Jack the Ripper **(Who wouldn&#039;t want to have Dr. Mundo wearing a top hat?)**, Arthur Conan Doyle&#039;s Sherlock Holmes and many other fine pieces dedicated to that era. This thought actually came to my mind after playing Bloodborne, which, I must say, has the best design decisions I have ever seen in games (at least for me). \nSometimes I really feel an urge to play as someone classy (in the true meaning of that word) without having to turn off the League.
