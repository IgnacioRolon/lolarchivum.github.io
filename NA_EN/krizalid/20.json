This skin doesn't have any sense of Udyr's fairly unique sillouette, and could cause a lot of in-game confusion. While there maye be one or two excpetions to this rule, even the exceptions retain a characters most defining features, while this doesn't have retain Udyr's iconic skirt. I reccomend trying something like tying a hoodie around his waist in order to emulate the skirt look that is a staple of Udyr's visual design.","replies":[{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2014-11-23T00:35:35.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know honestly.
