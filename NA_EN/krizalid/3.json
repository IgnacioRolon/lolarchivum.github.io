And I LIKE it. \r\nNow imagine what we are going to read when we&#039;ll reach the {{champion:266}} story in the future, maybe when a new Darkin will be introduced (how Aatrox will turn the wheel of fate, change the battle into a pure bloody carnival). &quot;Violence is elegance&quot;. My body is ready. \r\n\r\nAnd more than that, I really like the way TF&#039;s character is being uncovered. He is actually being developed! Now he&#039;s not just a selfish gambler, but a guy with his own fears and weaknesses (he&#039;s definitely NOT a Marty Stu. And it&#039;s great!), he shows proper reactions and we are able to speculate about different situations between him and Graves. Great job, Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-07-24T01:44:38.833+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"We're all very happy that you're enjoying the event so far.

Weird feeling.\n\nEDIT: If you're talking about the Shurima changes as well, then I'm a bit less softened, though I think we've already had the whole \"Sivir and Cassi might be fine, just a bad angle on them in that one story\" discussion.
