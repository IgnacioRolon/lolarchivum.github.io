I have an answer for that one! :)\n\nIf we look at the (( thankfully unaltered )) lore of Taric, we have some insight as to the connections of plants and gems. Some of these direct quotes including:\n\n\"It is the magic of the earth, drawing power from the resonance of crystals and gems.\"\n\n\"Despite his burgeoning understanding of herbs, plants, and animal medicines, it was the power of gems that most fascinated the growing boy.\"\n\nand finally one that I will connect to soon, \"Despite missing his homeland, Taric is happy to fight in the League, serving as a protector for all who seek one.\"\n\nAs we can see, Taric is not only connected to gems, but all of nature as well and has a great understanding for relating subjects! His preference of course leans towards gemcraft which would explain the unique color schemes and patterns while the nature theme relates to the small animals and plants. Finally, none of the above portraits seem to be in pain nor are they fully conscious either. While it may be a stretch, Taric acting as a protector could put people at peace and/or daze them (( think like his stun )) to create such an effect. Sona specifically is notable as he's considered an ally/friend to Taric as found on his champion page and would be a direct connection between the two.\n\nEDIT: With some further referencing from other threads I'd also like to add further speculation on relating these icons/images to Taric. While of course it may not be Taric there are some strikingly similar messages between him and the theories found on the forums. Let's first look at some of the major speculations.\n\n\"Deadshot\": First and foremost it should be noted that there's a gunshot-like sound and flowing effect as if Sona and Zed were shot within their respective photos (( Sona in the throat, Zed in the eye )). Many take this to mean less of literal bullet but a representation of the characters with the position of the injury. Sona's inability to voice her own opinion but literally and metaphorically resulting in her being silenced and Zed's search for things that should never be seen. It's as if the champion's update/creation in mind is aware of the sins or faults of those it's opposing.\n\nConnection to Taric: Assuming that Taric is the correct champion to be looking at, we can look at some of his quotes for further references to these subjects. The major ones in this case being these three:\n\"More than just precious stones, I bring you an ancient power.\"\n\"Magic has ruined this land.\"\n\"You face unblemished power.\"\nNotice that Taric seems to hold a much different form of power than others in Runterra. His gems seem to hold something pure and he even goes to far as to say that magic as a whole has ruined Runterra. If his gems are supposedly pure and he's aware of magic's corruption, then it'd be safe to assume he has some sense of clarity on the subject of how magic works and what it would take to use specific means of such power. Sona's instrument and the forbidden shadow arts that Zed possesses are noted to have lead to the demise of those close to them which would explain their tainted history. Finally, as a side-note, Taric does of course have that beautiful point-and-click stun that is impossible to miss, thus \"deadshot\" could describe the ability itself being used. It even has a sudden burst of sound along with shatter to compare to the gunshot-like effect.\n\nGaren's shattering: It's also been noted that Garen is found to be splitting apart. The notable references to Taric are obvious from the visuals, however many also view it as how Garen seems to be breaking under the pressure of holding such responsibility towards Demacia. So much responsibility that it's essentially his entire character and if he were to voice his own opinion it would be shatter his entire core personality.\n\nConnection to Taric: Aside from the previously noted visuals, Taric also has the ability Shatter. Passively, this creates an armor for his allies, however much like it's name can also shatter away the enemies' defenses. Considering Taric is a defender and healer, it could be safe to say that Taric could either protect Garen's image or shatter it to pieces. Even more still, he has quotes relating to one's mentality such as, \"Emerald for insight\" and \"With clarity.\"\n\nVi's fire: Finally the most speculated one of all is Vi. While there's many theories, not many people seem to have found a concrete theory to expand on for Vi. This is mostly due to how vague it is in nature compared to the easily debated subject matter in the previous icons and pictures. Personally, I believe it makes sense to connect the fire to a more metaphorical representation of the champion much like the others just for consistency. Therefore, it seems like the fire could be representing Vi's passion and drive towards hunting down Jinx but as a result also terrorizing those around her without intending to due to her \"Overkill or no kill\" nature. Though this one is up for discussion as others see fit.\n\nConnection to Taric: Back to quotes again, as they seem to fit rather nicely with Vi's fiery personality.\n\"Ruby for vigor.\"\n\"You are nothing more than glass, waiting to be smashed.\"\nRuby could be the gem that Taric would use to describe people like Vi and when it comes to his enemies, he shares a similar tune to Vi ready to smash first and ask questions later. However, unlike Vi, Taric holds the ability to RESTRAIN himself and therefore is willing to put Vi at rest. Not to say that he'd kill her, but the icons do resemble a more peaceful tone between all of them and Taric could hold the ability to put people at peace. After all, if we look at his lore it's clear he more likely wants to stop the threat with peaceful resolution - even if it requires brute force to restrain others - as in his lore he's described as \"one who used the power of earth to preserve and protect\" and not one who destroys and rampages.
