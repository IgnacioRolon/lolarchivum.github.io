Call it an experiment but I think these are the best yet as they combine real-world clothing with some fantasised style. For Talon I was aware that players had been waiting on a new skin for a long time, also that as a 750 skin it would always disappoint players who are waiting for him to finally get a 'big' skin. I decided to make Dade's General Jacket a big part of the design due to the profound significance of him giving it to Pawn during the awards ceremony. Originally I tried some designs that changed his appearance more, particularly his cloak, but was unable to make it work with his base rig (which doesn't get changed for low scope skins). Ultimately I focused on three things: congruity in the skin line, an awesome looking jacket/cloak, pushing 750 scope with new models on his abilities. There's also a bit of Assassin's Creed and Gatchaman in there.\n\nNaturally I can't make any promises, but his rig is so limiting that I think next time we will want to change as much as we can and deliver on that 'big' Talon skin that players have been waiting for. Also because this was a special skin for the world champions it is not necessarily 'it' for the foreseeable future of Talon (for example Thresh got a skin quite recently but Mata requested him).","replies":[{"poster":"Dies to Wolves","date":"2015-04-29T08:25:13.107+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=JBdJaA8Q,comment-id=00060000000000010002,timestamp=2015-04-29T07:35:46.839+0000)\n>\n>(for example Thresh got a skin quite recently but Mata requested him).\n\nwhy did faker get SKT Zed then, since he publicly stated he wanted an Ahri skin?\n\nnot that I really care about those skins because honestly I dislike this theme of skins, but still.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2015-04-29T08:50:18.946+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the skins are very well made, and you successfully achieved your goals, but I think that's exactly the reason there's backlash.\n\nThey look like they're just wearing regular clothes.\n\nQuite frankly, that's on the boring side of design. With a new skin, there's the opportunity for something new and exciting, to see how you can take a champions identity and a League team identity (usually based on their logo), and combine them. To see what sort of interesting and cool interpretation can be thought up.\n\nAnd that's why I think Talon in particular is getting some flak, because he's the most average base (essentially a human dude in a cloak carrying a weapon), he comes out the plainest by being put in what's very close to everyday street clothes.\n\nAgain, I think the skins are well made, and you guys did a good job, but in the future I'd like to ask for a return to the more stylized interpretations.\n\nP.s.

I'm speaking to you as someone who had Talon as his first main, his first champ played, and the first champ he ever bought skins for. I have been waiting a long time yes, but I can appreciate how damn great the skin is. The new W/R shurikens look great as well. \n\nBut with that said, referring to your quoted post now: If limited edition skins aren't considered within a champion's skin release cadence and thus provide hope for a \"bigger\" skin, then where's Zed's \"Second\" skin? You don't have to answer directly - it's just that...well. Zed's the only Season 2 champion that technically only has one skin, which is a huge thing when you consider how consistently popular he has been. The reason Yorick hasn't gotten one is because he's badly designed and in need of a rework; is there a similar situation going on with Zed or is he just hated by the skins team?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-04-30T07:25:16.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was one of my biggest questions when I started! I have since learned some things I can share with you:\n\nThe reason Yorick, Poppy, Taric, Urgot etc. haven't gotten skins recently is because yes they are in the process of being reworked  - and the reworks are on a scale that if we released a skin now there would be a chance that it would have to be completely redone in the near future when the champ is updated. This is double the potential work for us but, more importantly, could really suck for players who pick up a new skin only to see it change from what they just purchased. Yes we update older skins that have been around for a while, but we think it would be far worse if you had just bought a new skin and then it was changed (possibly drastically).\n\nBecause in production we all work far ahead of the live game there are often projects in the pipeline that we can't talk about yet. The new Lux skin has been in production for quite a while but we couldn't tell players. Sometimes projects get delayed because of particular effects or features we want to implement or they would fit in with an event and so get shuffled around in the schedule.\n\nJust remember that everyone at Riot is also a player and there are plenty of Zed and Talon players that raise the same concerns and likewise for every champion. As I said with Talon I was excited that we were doing a skin for him but also prepared for the disappointment at it being a 750.
