I believe my score is far more impressive as it was done in a much shorter amount of time than his seeing is how I would average about ~300 cs per 20 mins if my game lasted the same amount as Zvens did I would of probably surpassed 1000 cs. I&#039;m just wondering if this would count as anything. I would love to know what anyone thinks and I appreciate anyone who reads this. &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-12-19T18:39:20.037+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You farmed zzrot minions over the course of the game, they had two of them. They count as cs but don't actually give anything rather they just inflate your cs.  Riot should honestly fix that. I hate when someone buys a zz rot early in the game and I can't judge how well I'm doing against my lane opponent anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"God is Kind","date":"2016-12-19T18:44:33.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Makes more sense now, they should fix that I was totally misled I thought I had something amazing, my bad, lmao.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-12-19T18:07:30.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"how does one get that amount of cs while participating with the team and/or not stealing cs from other lanes? \n\nUnless you're singed, I just don't see how that is realistically possible (I can't actually click the link rn cuz school blocks it)","replies":[{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2016-12-19T18:09:05.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He had the highest kill participation lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-12-20T00:10:06.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, I wasn't able to click his link to see any information outside of what he said in the actual post...\n\nand you didn't notice the \"and/*or*\" part apparently","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"michkeegan bae","date":"2016-12-19T18:34:47.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope he just farmed the zz-rots.
