You can only charge the explosive charge with 4 autoattacks. Casting Q prior to E will reduce the time to it takes for the charge to explode from cast. If this is mid game where you already have a few levels in Q and some attack speed from items, you have more than enough time to land those 4 autoattacks before it explodes if you're in range of the target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PierreAndreis","date":"2015-07-22T05:54:09.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is this good or bad?","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-07-22T06:01:07.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda both, depending on if you can get the autos on them. If you can, the damage is not only greater, but comes faster. However, you've got less time to get those autos off to get the damage from the charge.","replies":[]}]}]}
