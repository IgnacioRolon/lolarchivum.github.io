His Q has a 4 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nWith 20% CDR, these would be 11.2 and 3.2 respectively. and his passive reduces his cooldowns by the cd of his Q.\r\n\r\nWe can assume that a Q-E-Q is easily performed during the duration of this cooldown. So once his Rune prison goes on Cooldown. 11.2s - 3.2*3 = 1.6 seconds which is less than the duration of the root.\r\n\r\nSo at level 9 with 20% CDR, Ryze has a perma root, at least for duration of his passive which is 6 seconds at all levels. \r\n\r\nSomething tells me Riot won&#039;t let this be unanswered.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-06-04T23:35:48.956+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"agree, thats also the whole reason Huni maxed W first, if yur target can't move for the 6 sec of passive+ult, Q beeing a skillshot isn't a big downside anymore.\nI think the 6+sec point n click root-abuse is the only reason ryze is picked or band in lcs","replies":[]},{"poster":"PKP PunchaNig","date":"2015-06-05T06:27:58.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think he's perfect leave him alone!
