It's fun yes, but some servers don't even have Dominion anymore because Riot didn't believe that keeping it up for those servers would be worth it. Submit a simple bug like \"You aren't able to place the Dominion specific variant of Luden's Echo in an item set\" (which is still true) and it will not get addressed. They do balancing for that map once a season when nothing big is happening, and even then it's never as big as balances for other maps.\n\nIt feels that this is the queue that gets the least attention by both players and Riot, followed by TT, then HA, then all SR queues. Honestly I think that the largest reasons they keep it around is because it's an easy place to find and filter bots, and it provides new players with varied game modes to play around with and pull them in. I feel like no amount of support though could bring it to the levels of even ARAM levels of fervor as it's a lot less straightforward strategically with its map openness and strategic openness, there's less content and time to strategize around, and there are notably fewer anti-snowball mechanics in this mode. While I could see them adjusting these to make the mode more full and worthwhile, it would be radically different, so much so that I could see it warranting a new name.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2015-10-28T21:46:24.820+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which servers had their Dominion queues removed? I know the smaller/newer servers simply never got Dom/TT queues at all or had them be time-restricted. EUW (or EUNE, I forget) had the dead draft queue removed, but blind pick is still around.\n\nNot being able to place the Dom-version of Luden's Echo into an item set is a feature, not a bug. The item hasn't existed since Riot did that round of AP itemization updates for all maps. I agree that it takes an unusually long time for Dom bugs to be addressed though (like Azir leaving the summoning platform early).\n\nI definitely think Dominion could at least match ARAM's popularity. Difficult, but not impossible. ARAM excels at being a straightforward game mode that quickly gets into the action:  it's very approachable for casual play. Dominion is more action-packed, but is also massively more complicated:  it's well-suited for high-adrenaline competitive play. If Riot rewarded good players like it does in SR (e.g. LCS-style promotions), Dominion could definitely garner a large following.\n\nLess objectives and time to strategize is probably intended, since the design of the mode emphasizes tactics over strategy. SR focuses on slow, methodical development (e.g. focus on dragon control and win with fifth dragon buff). Dominion is much more about quick actions and immediate responses (e.g. enemy team is currently camping windmill, so we need to gank bot).\n\n\"Notably *fewer* anti-snowball mechanics\"?

The player base gained momentum in the years over it's release. We had a pretty solid tournament scene going on for I want to say 3-3.5 years total. If you want to see the history of it nearly in full I suggest you give Gandair's Youtube a look since he's archived as much of it as he could.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/VATOCLAN\n\nBut yeah, it's been a sad history of ill-hearted promises and some of the most passive-aggressive betrayals of customer faith a company has ever done. Riot makes Electronic Arts look like saints in that department. Not once, but twice the Dominion community had to make massive, month long pushes on the original forums, garnishing over thousands of posts and +'s just to get a Red to come on and say \"Yeah, we lied, sorry.\"\n\nThey tried to pretend like they were going to pay attention, and for a while it looked golden. We got our own dev to do map specific changes, item balances, ect. And he was pretty proactively involved with the community...for about a month. Then Riot yanked him away once they saw things were actually being properly fixed and tossed a lower tier Rioter our way (not in an insulting way, literally just someone lower in the company hierarchy). Changes trickled slower and slower, outright broken things (see immediate post-buff Thresh) took several weeks to even be addressed. And all communication dried up again.\n\nOne more push was finally made with another massive topic and Riot finally came out and said \"Nope, we don't care.\"\n\nThe community pretty much fled en masse after that. Tournaments died down. Forums changed to boards and Riot left anything Dominion related to languish in the sea of ARAM, TT, and Mode of the Month posts. So now all that's left is pretty much a small pittance of people who stick around just out of a mixture of spite and passion.\n\nIf you ever, ever see a Red post about Dominion it'll be because a topic like this somehow gets 300+ upvotes and I guarantee you it'll be nothing more than \"Yeah, we screwed up. No, we're going to do nothing about it.\"\n\nIt's the same mantra they've been spewing since everyone realized they lied about the initial Ranked promise.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-10-29T02:48:14.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot has made broken promises but they're not trying to kill Dominion.
