Just wondering if you guys have any plans at all for addressing this? Also, is there a reason why it seems unfathomably more potent now than it did in season 5? It&#039;s gotten so bad that the two kruggs will box you into the wall until they&#039;re killed or you can use an escape to get out. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy creep block in the game, can you at least make it so you can only be blocked by enemy creeps?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-12-08T00:52:49.021+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minion/monster blocking's had some issues we've wanted to improve for a long time. In 5.22 we released changes that addressed one of the major issues, that revealed some other problems however that are pretty frustrating. In 5.24 we're going to roll back the changes to the pre 5.22 system so that things are in a better spot while we work on a good long term solution to multiple problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-12-08T01:14:37.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think this is a problem exclusive to minion blocking.
