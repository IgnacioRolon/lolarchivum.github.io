The Human Q: I&#039;m completely fine with how much her spear is able to do. It is a hard skillshot to land, anyone saying otherwise probably hasn&#039;t played much Nidalee and is falsely claiming she&#039;s a super easy champion. What I&#039;m not okay with is the fact that it&#039;s on a 6 second cooldown, 3.6 if you&#039;re like myself and many others who max out cdr every game. The mana cost is kind of negligible as well, 90 for max rank? After I&#039;m finally oom from chucking spears for 20 minutes late game, I only have to wait a couple seconds to regen enough for another with only a morellos for mana regen/mana items. Increase the cooldown, increase the mana cost. She&#039;s got an entire set of abilities that don&#039;t cost mana, she can afford to spend a bit more while in human form. \r\n\r\n2. The Cougar W: No one enjoys infinite gap closers and low cd escapes, especially when hers is manaless. Honestly not much you can do here, and that on top of long range burst skillshot are kind of her identity as a champion, so I wouldn&#039;t change anything here. \r\n\r\n3. The Human E: The rest of her kit makes it extremely hard to lane against considering she&#039;s got a reset, manaless form, long range, an execute, 2 minute wards that trigger your passive which is a 4 second &quot;Haha you can&#039;t go near your minions without dying&quot; mark. On top of that you give her a heal with a .5 ratio (pretty damn great for a heal) ensuring any damage you do whether early game or late doesn&#039;t stick. It&#039;s infuriating for such a slippery champion to have a heal, and on top of that it gives a huge attack speed buff for **7 seconds**. That&#039;s an unnecessarily long time. My advice is to increase the heal&#039;s mana cost at early ranks, as of right now it&#039;s really not taxing enough not to spam, and lower the attack speed buff to 5 seconds, while increasing the base of the heal at all ranks so it&#039;s more impactful, yet less spammable at early ranks. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: My suggested changes: Increase Human Q cooldown to 7 seconds from 6, increase mana cost to 60/70/80/90/100 from 50/60/70/80/90. Increase Human E mana cost at early ranks to 80/90/100/110/120 from 60/75/90/105/120, decrease the duration of attack speed slow to 5 seconds from 7, increase base of heal to 65/105/145/185/225 from 45/85/125/155/205 to compensate. This way it costs more to use it at early ranks, but the heal is more impactful. I&#039;d also stagnate Human W&#039;s mana cost at 40 from 40/45/50/55/60 as a bit of compensation for the increased mana cost on Q. Overall these are nerfs, but I don&#039;t think they&#039;re too heavy and there&#039;s room to compensate her further if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"jDVL20eCYs","date":"2015-07-28T18:50:17.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":16,"body":"not seen lane nida in since spring. its not even good so i don't get the part about the laning. if anything lane nida could need buff. problem is that as skilled jungle nida is so extremely strong and have so much potential while a meh nida is nothing specially do the line of weak.\n\nthere are already nerfs on pbe for nida. q damage reduced and passive duration lowered from 10 to 6 and some thing more i think","replies":[{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2015-07-28T18:52:12.398+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ekko or feed,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wE8bIJTt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-28T18:50:17.709+0000)\n>\n> not seen lane nida in since spring. its not even good so i don't get the part about the laning. if anything lane nida could need buff. problem is that as skilled jungle nida is so extremely strong and have so much potential while a meh nida is nothing specially do the line of weak.\n\nWell the only part of this thread about laning is the part about her heal, and it'd be a buff on top of a nerf, so hey look we both win. \n\nThanks for you input though.\n\nHer passive only lasts for four seconds, not ten.

The issue is there's no drawback to firing off spears whenever you feel like it. A higher cooldown and mana cost would impact bad nidalee players heavily while not punishing good nidalee players that can consistently land spears. The W is fine, her whole kit is really fun to play, changing that isn't the point of these suggestions. The same for the heal mana cost increase, and at the same time you'd be getting a stronger heal, but it'd actually drain your mana if you spam it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-29T03:42:24.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straight up nerfing it and giving her better options with her W and E would fix the problem.

She's always been considered a Mage and Assassin above all else, but they wanted to give her some sort of supporty-ish ability and gave her one of the more awkward choices that not only thematically doesn't fit, but as a solo champion, it doesn't have an actual fit for a Poke champion. It would be similar to Ziggs, Xerath, or the like having a random heal thrown in or Jayce sitting there with a heal. It just wouldn't make much sense and on her, it really doesn't. Her kit has been and always will be to get the person low in human form, then go in for the kill as cougar form. When they reworked her kit a little bit in season 4, they made sure to change her to be more like that with her kit 'Hunting' the enemies, getting them low with her ranged poke, then going in for the kill. They gave her the tools to do this properly, yet they didn't take into affect that her E doesn't fit into that. Her E in cougar form is a generic AoE hit meant to help with wave clear and doing some good AoE damage, which is fine. Her E in human form is a generic Heal on a targeted ally. Why? Why would she have that STILL? \n\nThey wanted to shift Nidalee into being an AP Assassin that pokes her enemies down and then dives in for the kill on the targets she's hunting, so WHY would she need to be able to heal her allies at the same time? She's not like Sona any of the other three supports that poke well and heal and her kit has been shifted from originally being a supporty-ish one to being a true AP Assassin. So why does she need a heal? WHY? WHY DOES SHE NEED IT? She ISN'T a support, she had her AD build reduced, her traps are near useless, and because of this, all of her power is shoved into pressing Q in human form and then running away in Cougar. Why is her kill potential shoved all into a single human form ability without any other kind of synergy? Jayce has special interactions between his E and Q while his W is a standard steroid that FITS HIS KIT when in ranged form. Elise's human form abilities are all about capturing her prey and quickly draining their health bar down, then going in for the kill as spider form. So why does Nidalee have a god damn Heal and a useless W? Every last bit of her power in human form is shoved into her Q because she has no other use in human form damage-wise. Absolutely NOTHING else. Her E helps push towers, but so does her Q in cougar form and her W in cougar form can help proc Lich/Runeglaive. You can argue that her heal helps her jungle, then give her a small heal on her Cougar form Q if it kills a target since she's chomping into her opponent and ripping it off, may as well eat it. She gets sustain, but has to put RISK into it and it lets her human form get a new E that might actually help her in lane. \n\nRiot let her hunt targets because she was near useless in lane. All she had was her Q so if you dodged her Q in lane, which is easy with minions, she can't get close to you or do anything. The only reason she saw laning success was because laning let her get gold to be able to throw tree trunk sized spears at carries for 160% of her AP plus almost 600 base damage. Most AP combos total 200%-250% of their AP and Nid got to do over half that in just a spear. That got nerfed to 450 plus 150% of her AP though and the spears got turned into toothpicks while she got kill potential in her cougar form. Well, why not shed off some of that power off her Q and put it into a new damaging ability on her E that could let her hunt targets? Give her kill potential in lane? Her late game oppression would be highly tuned down because of her Q being nerfed a bit, but her team fighting could be increased, her lane pressure could easily exist, and she'd still do well in the jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShinobisDemon","date":"2015-07-29T09:30:21.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wE8bIJTt,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-07-29T00:24:59.310+0000)\n>\n> Eh.

NIdalee mid (who does this) doesn't need it. AD nid adc, needs the heal and attack speed. \n\nAs a Nidalee main, I think she is actually in a fair place right now. she isn't like (YI) or (Annie) or (Blitz) or (Singed) (Morgana) that require little to know practice. If you want to play nidalee at any decent level you need to train alot like most decent champions which I feel is something that should give her a little power.\n\nSkillshots by nature have to be a little OP or what would be the point of trying to land them? Lets think for a second, at level 1 the average skill shot doesn't do much more damage than an auto or 2 from an adc.  To ADC all you need to do is click someone and wait half a second and boom, damage. Skillshots require accuracy practice and prediction.\n\nI'm so sick of people complaing about things that don't need to be fixed. Problems with the new HUD? Think it should be reverted? Take a look at tab, or any of the good things done for them. \n\nCan any of you remember what nidalee used to be like? When you couldn't play her anywhere because she couldn't farm until 6? And her spears was all she had? \n\nRiot improved Nidalee and I think she is pretty decent right now. Lets focus on champs like kalista who can (poke) with her auto's without ever being caught.\n\n\nP.S. Nidalee has no form of CC other than the slow. Her traps are basically useless she doesn't have an ult because her ult just changes forms, her cougar Q doesn't do much executing by itself really (compared to other Executes) and her spears only do alot of damage early if you go solid Penetration and AP. \n\n\nSorry for the rant, just sick of threads by people complaining about a not very OP champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-07-29T01:26:05.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still confused why her Spear needs to scale with distance traveled.\n\nI thought the whole point of the rework was to remove power from her nuking from 1000+ units away and more into setting up combos for her Cougar form.

His Q by itself was a 10(!) second snare, his W was a 5 second stun, his E was an auto-attack steroid that added 21 damage to every attack, and his ultimate ability was 750 bonus hp, 30 damage, 15 armor (equivalent to 90 armor in League), and complete spell immunity. His ultimate was passive, incidentally. \n\nLuckily, him and a few others (Death Ward Riki, old Invoker, Void Demon, to name a few) were all eradicated the instant IceFrog got his hands on DotA.\n\nSince it was pretty much right before IceFrog, that makes Guinsoo responsible for that stuff.

This isn't a complaint thread. This is a thread to protect a champion I enjoy playing from being nerfed in the wrong way. Like I said, I'm not against nerfing Nidalee, but let's go about this in an intelligent way. Straight nerfing her damage doesn't fix the problem and just makes her feel less fun to play, while my suggestions keep the rewards for playing her well the same while adding repercussions for playing her poorly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-07-30T01:58:44.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly bro, your TL;DR is more difficult to read than your first 3 points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthSpectrum","date":"2015-07-30T01:05:25.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you hit the points dead on.\nPlaying against Nidalee is like being the Fish in shooting fish in a barrel.\nSure, her spears are difficult to land, but she does not lose anything from missing them.\nOnce she gets a {{item:3165}} or {{item:3174}}, she can just keep tossing them until one of them hits.\n\nIf she ever finds herself in a unfavorable situation, she can either pounce away or flip the tables and all in back on you with cougar form. \nMost champions who can toss out long range skill shots don't have the mobility or burst to fight off or peel off any assailants who get in close range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squeaker101","date":"2015-07-29T22:49:29.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-Mobility\n-Poke\n-Burst\n-Sustain\n-Gap closer\n\nWe just need a revive passive and a knock-up until she's perfectly balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-07-30T00:20:25.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And 2 passives for every 3rd AA, 1 of which procs on-hit effects.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-07-30T00:19:52.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reading your name, and what you had to say, I've got only 1 thing:\n\nAYY LMAOKAI.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WTFMatee","date":"2015-07-29T17:17:09.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've mained nidalee since season 1.
