I know its not a game breaking bug, but its still a skin glitch. I&#039;ve tried other skins just to be sure and it seems to be only Snow Day that has the issue. Anyone else run into this?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-22T20:56:57.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Asteriek! \n\nThanks for the report!
