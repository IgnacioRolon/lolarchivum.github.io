If they switch her single target DoT's with low CD's to switch between targets as her Q, her W left to be the same, and her E changed to give a slight boost in her poison damage or even just be a targeted poison while her Q is a long-ish range skill shot poisonball of death, she'd be in a pretty damn good spot as a Poison Mage. They'd be able to adjust her kit accordingly since she'd be mostly single target with an actual skill shot that a tank could block, yet because of how her kit works, she'd still get a boost in speed and be able to kite that tank for days, which would make her into a kiting DoT mage, something we don't have.

Even if they deal damage through other mechanics, their theme is still tied to poison. Teemo doesn't actually kill you by annoying you. He *does*, in fact, kill you via poison damage. EXCLUSIVELY.
