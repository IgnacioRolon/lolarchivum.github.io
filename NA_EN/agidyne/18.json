It's actually a really nice mechanic because it provides utility to champions without making them over powered.\n\nSnares provide enough counterplay already considering they allow targets to fight back.\n\nA snare is a CC debuff which allows targets to use spells and essentially fight back, it just doesn't allow movement impaired abilities or spells. It also allows the target to auto attack.\n\nA silence doesn't allow most targets to fight back, yet it allows the target to move. It does allow the target to auto attack but that's it.\n\nA stun is like a mix between a Snare and a Silence. It doesn't allow Movement or the Casting of spells. It also doesn't allow the target to auto attack.\n\nA 99% slow allows the target to do whatever the hell it wants, it's a joke, seriously. It should be like, a Snare that actually allows the targets to flash away or use Movement Spells such as Shunpo and stuff. But the mere fact that it is Hard Capped at 110 makes it worse. \n\nTargets are already able to use spells to get to safety, why should they also be able to move?\n\nI understand that on the reworked Zileans kit, a 5.5 seconds 99% slow would be too stupid. \n\nBut the one on Talon is just a joke. They remove a 1 second Silence to give a 0.25 seconds 99% slow, which would be a fair trade-off if the Min MS Cap didn't exist.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2015-02-11T17:27:51.821+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's the point of it being a 99% slow, instead of a snare.
