The other doesn&#039;t know why she must dress at all but still dresses because the main character forces her too. Infact, she doesn&#039;t know how to do shit, other than painting ofc.\n\n---\n\n#One has a very VERY strong catchfrase. The other doesn&#039;t seem to talk much in the first place.\n\n---\n\n#**2 SHIINAS. 1 SURVIVOR.**\n\n---\n\n#**VOTE NOW**\n\n---\n\nPS: I feel like this is the stupidest fucking thing I&#039;ve ever posted on GD, but I&#039;m probably wrong anyway so I don&#039;t give a shit.","replies":[]}
