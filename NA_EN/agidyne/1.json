She's only weak until she gets Tear/Catalyst. Once she has a mana pool to spam her Twin Fangs she's very powerful in duels and skirmishes. You can complain that she's boring or that her gameplay is lacking, but it's completely false to say that  people can shrug off her all-in and beat you in duels (once you have tear / catalyst). She literally does more single target damage than old Cassio did at every point in the game as long as you space well against the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Grand Eleven","date":"2014-11-19T01:26:41.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot has already admitted she's \"undertuned\" on live so you can say it isn't true but even the devs agree here.

Yes it is difficult to reach 400 stacks, but as of now its actually fairly balanced.  I got 400 stacks at around 30-35 minutes in before.  And once i hit 400 stacks i usually have 700-900 AP.
