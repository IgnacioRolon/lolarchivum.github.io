It only shields for half as much as those other shields the first time around, and the shield amount doesn't stack, it only refreshes. To get the full benefit you have to be taking damage so that first shield pops, and then you have to be in the path of the shield when it come back, which is basically forecasting your position if you try to get the rest of the shield. \n\nAs for her E, the numbers on it are just bad all around. It has  the lowest damages while having the highest mana cost of any similar waveclear on a mage midlaner. 10s cooldown at all ranks, at rank 5 has 240 base damage and 60% AP scaling.\nCompare to, say, Orianna W with a 9s cooldown, 250 base damage and 70% AP scaling (plus moving her ball into position to cast it does damage as well).\nSyndra Q, with a 4s cooldown, at rank 5 has 264.5 base and 69.5% AP scaling.\nXerath Q has a 5s cooldown, 240 base, and 75% AP scaling.\nZiggs Q has a 4s cooldown, 255 base, and 65% AP scaling.\n\nObviously these are not 1-to-1 comparisons, but even so it's not hard to argue that Lux's E falls far short of the other abilities. 2x to 2.5x the cooldown for 3 of the 4 examples here, equal or worse base damage in every case, and worse AP scaling in every case. \n\nOrianna W is the most similar ability here, with comparable (actually better) utility - because it still has a smaller cooldown, a stronger aoe slow, an aoe speedup for your team, and continues to grants vision even after it has been \"detonated.\" With Lux's E if you want the enemy not to walk out of range right away you have to detonate it immediately, which is how it's used most of the time. So most of the time, the utility in it is completely lost. Meanwhile Orianna's W leaves the slow field and the ball behind, so you get the (higher) damage AND the (higher) slow AND the vision. With Lux's E you get slow and vision OR damage.\n\nChoosing Lux sometimes makes it feel like you're only playing half as much as other mage mids, because you spend twice as much time running in circles in the back waiting for your cds, and when they come up they don't even do anywhere near as much damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tofutime","date":"2015-02-05T16:09:14.210+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think they overreacted with Lux's movement speed nerf.
