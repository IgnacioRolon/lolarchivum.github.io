He doesn't give a shit. You're supposed to beat his FACE in early on, and then zone him from farm. If he can't farm, he can't heal. Denying farm is the number one thing you can do to fuck Cho up early on, since he loses out on both gold and healing. Unfortunately some people aren't as aggressive as they should be against him.\n> \n> He has a lot of CC with stupid range and are so easy to hit, and he can easily knock-up, slow, and silence an entire team for 5 seconds of CC total, all doing damage as well.\n\nQ does have good range but it's delayed, along with the short foot stomp animation he does beforehand. Silence is good too, but he can only fire it in one direction and hope that he hits people. Cho excels in teamfights for this very reason, you want to know how to counter it? \n\nDON'T FUCKING GROUP UP IN A BALL. Cho's eyes instantly light up at that. You need to spread out and force him to make a decision. \n> \n> If he gets ahead he's impossible to kill since he's a tank, and can easily just Q > R the enemy ADC.\n\nCho's a slow fatass who has to deal with an entire frontline if he ever wants to kill the enemy carry. If said carry dies, then that's either shitty positioning on their part, or their teammates can't peel at all. \n\nIf he's tanky, he doesn't have to damage to nuke someone. If he does have said damage, he's actually possible to kill. Really. Pay attention to his build. AP Cho might LOOK menacing, but that's an illusion that he wants to you believe. If multiple people dump on him, he's going to die. \n> \n> If he's behind he can still instakill most squishy people and since his ult does true damage, it isn't hard for him to kill tanks either. Even if not, he still has a ridiculous amount of CC.\n\nIf you kick Cho in the balls hard enough, he won't have the damage to kill anything. And what the fuck are you saying that 'because his ult does true damage, he can kill tanks too'. True damage is COUNTERED by building health, something that tanks do? Quite often? Cho also lacks any %health damage in his kit. So guess what, if you buy a Banshee's Veil or Spirit Visage, you're neutering his damage hard. \n> \n> I've heard mixed opinions. Some think he's overpowered but has counterplay, some think he's balanced.\n\nCho's one of the most balanced champions in the game. He trades mobility and dueling potential for amazing AOE disruption, sustain, and strong base damages on his abilities. I wrote a longass guide on him, so if you really want my insight on how to counter him, I can post the link and you can look at the lane and jungle matchups.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-08-01T14:26:00.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The guy with a broken 650 point and click true damage ult that scales off 70% of his AP and also indicates when it will kill the target has no dueling potential lol?\n\nSo basically he trades mobility for everything else in the game?

He loses ult stacks on death, and that means he walks out of base with less max health. And that makes him easier to kill. You shouldn't just let Cho'Gath get max Feast stacks in lane, but some people just see his sustain and think 'well fuck this, he's not going to die' and leave him alone. That's what he wants. You need to GET IN HIS FACE. \n\nUnfortunately, some champs just don't have the early damage to kill him.\n\nYou have to treat the lane like Nasus, but instead of preventing the dog from getting stronger damage-wise, you're preventing Cho from turning into a brick.\n\nAnd while it's not _technically_ a weakness, I consider his Vorpal Spikes a second passive. You don't need to turn them off, so he REALLY has 2 passives, 2 normal skills, and Feast. And due to the power creep of the game, his kit is lacking in comparison with newer champs. If Cho were released today, I guarantee you Vorpal Spikes would be the second part of his passive, and he'd have a new E entirely.\n\n> Him having not dueling potential is a lie, since he can 100-0 most squishy people and his ultimate allows him to not really struggle with tanks that much. Obviously there are matchups that he loses to, though making a mistake post-6 usually can result in a death and make Cho'gath even more difficult to deal with.\n\nI don't think you get the difference between dueling and bursting. You're talking about bursting. If Cho bought AP and is somewhat fed, then yes his BURST combo can kill squishies. And shouldn't it? He causes a huge-ass tremor, screams your ears off, and then EATS you. He's alien Godzilla, it makes thematic sense. \n\nI'm talking about dueling, AKA 'sitting there auto-attacking each other'. Cho can only duel if he builds specific items, like Wits End. Otherwise, champs that have lifesteal and magic resist can absorb that first chunk of damage and then continue to beat his face in, and then he's boned because he's slow and fat. \n> \n> Him falling off late game is just totally inaccurate since he can instakill any ADC late game unless they're hypermobile freelo like Vayne, and even if he can't he still has more than enough tankiness and CC to provide for his team that he never really falls off.\n\nI read my earlier posts and I didn't claim that he falls off as a whole lategame. I said his sustain falls off, and it does because he's not always sitting next to a big wave of enemy minions. In teamfights, he has next to no sustain and any damage you do to him will stick.\n\nCho's an anti-carry, you're right. Any opposing ADC's need to watch for Rupture, and once you see it go off, get out of the way. Then afterwards, your team needs to engage when it's on CD, because now Cho only has half of his CC available for the fight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-07-31T19:08:50.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The silence is the only form of crowd control that Garen has.

On the other hand you have champions like Sona, Garen, Darius who are very binary and there isn't much you can change other than numbers. \n\nI'm not saying Garen should and is going to get 300 skillshots, but he definitely needs a raise in skill floor.","replies":[{"poster":"doombotMECHA","date":"2015-08-01T15:56:08.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think garen is gonna stay pretty simple. he's got an identity as a champion that a lot of first-timers play as him, so he needs to be easy to learn","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nataan99","date":"2015-07-31T20:03:52.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god, my two counterpicks for Riven...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-31T19:45:37.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how you claim Garen will lose silence, when they already said he won't xD\n\nEven more so when Garen doesn't even fit into group of champions who lost their silence xD","replies":[{"poster":"Agidyne","date":"2015-07-31T19:47:52.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"When I created this thread, I didn't know they wouldn't be removing his Silence.\n\nBut either way, they also said Miss Fortunes Grievous Wounds were fine a few years ago, and look at them now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2015-08-01T00:33:19.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Twin Arrowguns,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AUs9uVbh,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-31T10:04:16.088+0000)\n>\n> Please, for all that is sacred, don&#039;t put as much counterplay in them as there is in someone like Sion where the enemies can always f*cking sidestep your ult unless they were CC&#039;d before or you caught them in a very small angle in which they cannot escape.\n> \n> It&#039;s almost never up to me to land the ult, it&#039;s up to my enemies to dodge it. \n> \n> Anyway, back to Darius & Garen.\n> \n> They are **lane bullies**, they have always been.\n> \n> They are supposed to make the enemy laner feel like shit unless the enemy laner is a lane bully himself.\n> \n> As a trade-off, they don&#039;t scale to late game aswell as other top laners and despite being somewhat strong in a 1v1 or 1v2 scenario, they are still inferior versions of someone like Jax.\n> \n> But we all know what&#039;s going to happen. \n> \n> Garen will probably lose his Silence simply because of \"muh counterplay\".\n> \n> And Noxian Guillotine will have a \"can only be casted on Slowed targets with at least 3 stacks of Hemorrage after 5 seconds of being in combat that will root Darius in place and force Jarvan to record a One night stand with Fiora with Teemo and Evelynn watching it in the background\" slapped on it's tooltip.\n\nThe last paragraph had me on the ground with laughter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2015-07-31T10:12:05.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said Garen isn't losing the silence since it's an auto attack and he is immobile.
