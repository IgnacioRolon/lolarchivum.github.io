Basically, I am asking for there to be more transparency on Riot&#039;s side about everything MMR related. Also, I&#039;d like to know more about their philosophy as to what the ranked ladder is in theory intended to represent and how well they feel the current ladder does hold true to their philosophy of the ranked ladder.

Really, if you want to see why a botlane loses just look down there and see which support is being more active and that'll tell you which one is going to win. If botlane is the most important lane in the game, supports are the most important part of it for the first 5-10 minutes. \n\nThere are selfish support champs, too. Brand/Zyra/Velkoz etc. Champs who do a ton of damage, and can carry games, and can destroy enemy botlanes 1v2 without any help from their ADC. \n\nNot to mention, most of them are playmakers, free to roam the map and make plays and push their teammates where they want. And, the primary source of vision in solo Q where no one hardly ever buys vision.\n\nIf anything, the most team reliant positions are probably tank tops and most ADCs, like Kog/Varus/Ashe/etc. Champs like Trist/Vayne/Kaisa can do their own things.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Unker139","date":"2018-04-20T20:45:26.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Notion Z,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9jqGaV2Z,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2018-04-20T19:31:51.166+0000)\n>\n> Yes, macro without a doubt wins the game.

It's not easy but pulling it off once every 20 games will up your win rate by 5%.\n\nLearning to overcome less than ideal situations is a skill.\n\nA game with \"bad\" teammates might have a 10% chance of winning but if your skill can turn it into a 15% chance, you will increase your MMR over time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DestructoDave","date":"2018-04-20T19:31:26.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Canonic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9jqGaV2Z,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-20T19:21:45.117+0000)\n>\n> What most people don&#x27;t understand is that your understanding of the macro game, and ability to apply it and get your teammates to apply it is the biggest factor in winning.

Rarely do you actually have someone &quot;running it down.&quot;  it&#x27;s the mental party or the game that makes the good players good.\n\nIts because League is actually a fairly easy game to play. Your champ is not that hard to control. You have 4 abilities. Its not hard to get mechanically proficient at your champion. Its one of the charms of the game, and why so many people play it. You FEEL good at the game. So people FEEL they deserve higher elo because they play their champ so well. Well, there is more to the game, and more to winning, than mastering your 4 buttons. League is mostly about decision making, like you said. Its the equivalent of driving a stick shift. Just learning how to drive your stick shift does not make you an amazing driver. Just learning how to control your champ respectfully doesnt mean you are so good at the game you deserve higher elo.\n\nI can honestly say in my own experience, what holds me back the most is poor mid-game management. I lane well, I have good mechanics for the most part(who doesn't), but I'm just lost a lot of times running around mid game doing nothing productive. Maybe copying something I saw on a stream or LCS. End up pushing a wave when I should be teamfighting. End up bot when I should be top. End up doing Krugs when I should be doing this. Having poor map awareness. The actual control of my character is almost never what causes me to lose games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2018-04-20T18:58:24.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ALl the evidence shows that individual skill has highest factor.

I can get S every game without contributing at all. Based on CS? KDA? All of that encourage solo play, splitpushing and fucks team oriented champions. There are also many strategies that dont get graded well but heavily contribute to win. Also if game didnt start well, why bother helping team and making any risks that could ruin my score?  No. LP gain/loss MUST only be ever determined based on win/loss because only then will people be motivated to actually win.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-04-20T19:54:26.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I can get S every game without contributing at all. \n\nI don't think this is accurate.

All of these factors are relevant for determining the outcome of the game, most of which is not under any specific player's control.\n\nIn a game where 1 player can decide each of the above categories for themselves, that results in:\n\n4 lanes to play (jungle as a lane) x 5 roles to choose from x 11 summoner spells x 2 summoner spells to pick x 16 major rune keystones x 46 subset rune choices x 124 champions to choose from x 222 potential items to choose from all maps and game modes x 10 players to make individual decisions = 980,613,427,200 potential choices to make in a single game.\n\nNow as a single player, that results in:\n4 lanes to play (jungle as a lane) x 5 roles to choose from x 11 summoner spells x 2 summoner spells to pick x 16 major rune keystones x 46 subset rune choices x 124 champions to choose from x 222 potential items to choose from all maps and game modes x 1 player to make individual decisions = 98,061,342,720 potential choices to make in a single game.\n\nTherefore, the chance any singular player has at carrying and winning a game based on their decision alone at best is:\n98,061,342,720  / 980,613,427,200 = 10%\n\nSo, that means you have a 10% chance of establishing victorious conditions for your team, whereas the other 90% of your win condition depends on the performance, collaboration, and decision making of your teammates as well as your opponents.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I would say that any form of ranked ladder in any competitive, multi-player based game like League of Legends that relies on you playing with unknown teammates shows in large majority the performance and consistency of those teammates (or lack thereof).\n\nP.S. - these math calculations don't account for the multitude of decisions one can make in-game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackEyesBlue","date":"2018-04-20T18:57:32.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I'd say inconsistency of teammates and opponents.\n\nThis season, most of my games have been a nearly 10k gold difference by 15 minutes!
