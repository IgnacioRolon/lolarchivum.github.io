It had very long cooldown, and that meant you had to consider whether it&#039;s worth using it at given time or not. Now, from the thematic perspective - you really did play 2 champions, and now you dont have that opportunity. Now all Valor does is carrying you through the Rift, and that&#039;s where it ends. A bird that is strong enough to swiftly carry a grown woman for the endless time, but too afraid to take part in the battle himself.\r\n\r\nMy second, and I believe the main point here as to why the rework is bad is that you made Quinn viable in top lane only. Before the rework she functioned mainly as an ADC that would go botlane, but at the same time she could go top and she really did the same thing back then what she does now - which is making your enemy melee toplaner&#039;s lane phase as uninteractive as it can possibly get. I believe she does that better now, because not only her R did see the change. If that was the point of her rework, then that&#039;s just disappointing.\r\n\r\nQuinn was one of the very few champions i enjoy both thematically and kit-wise, and I think you managed to ruin both of these parts for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-01-11T12:55:49.413+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I strongly support Riot's decision to give every Champion in the game a unique strategic niche, I think they might have gone with the wrong one for Quinn.\n\nOut of the options available, Twitch was the marksman they chose to be the most assassin-like carry of his class, giving him changes in both Preseason 6 AND Preseason 7 to support this. \n\nWhile I think it's cool what they've done with Twitch, I feel Quinn was a MUCH stronger candidate to become _the_ marksman-assassin; it was written all over her old kit and STILL written all over her lore and voicelines.\n\n[Assassins](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses) are described as \"mostly **melee** [characters that] must put them themselves into **dangerous positions** in order to **execute** their targets ... Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively **avoid incoming damage**.\"\n\nC'mon, an AD Carry whose ultimate made her **melee** for 20 seconds, was forced to vault into **dangerous positions** and had an **execute** to finish off her targets along with an AoE blind to **avoid incoming damage**? To me, it should have been a no-brainer to make Quinn the premiere marksman-assassin--Twitch very well could have been the marksman focused on poisons and DoTs whose gameplay revolved around spreading the plague.\n\nInstead, they chose Quinn to be the roaming marksman (forget that Corki or MF could have fit the role better thematically or mechanically) and removed the most fun and unique ability that Champion had to offer: Tag Team.\n\nNot to mention Quinn being the best roamer very nearly pushes Talon out of the game and gives him no reason to be picked since she can traverse the map twice as fast as he can while having more uptime and range with which to assassinate priority targets with ease and safety. I'd go so far as to say an ahead Quinn will even 100-0 a squishy faster than Talon can due to the new delays in his abilities. Where does this leave him?\n\nEven if Riot was dead-set on making Quinn the speediest marksman, I don't think it was necessary to remove her ability to play as Valor in order to accomplish this. And that, I think, is the one thing most Quinn players sorely miss. I've said it before and I'll say it again--you don't take away Gangplank's oranges, Shyvana's dragon form, or Shen's taunt when you're updating them. As odd as it is for a pirate to eat citruses to cure himself or for a ninja to throw himself into the fray to grab everyone's attention, those are the things about those characters _that players have grown to love about them_, just like Quinn players loved Tag Team, as odd as it was for a falconer to jump out of sight and allow her bird to fight for a while. \n\nWith all that said I'll end on this note:\n\n> \"[Quinn and Valor](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/quinn/)'s unbreakable bond is deadly on the battlefield, leaving opponents ravaged and riddled with arrows long before they realize who they're fighting: **not one, but two Demacian legends.**\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lovelle","date":"2017-01-13T02:29:41.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not going to lie, I miss the Tag Team instagib, but I do like her new Q over the old one. Old Quinn was a much better pick on ARAM, since past a certain point you could blow up their ADC no matter what. Now she's one of the worst picks on that mode. If she still had Tag Team, but kept her new Q, she would be perfect.\n\nAlso, she can still jungle. I honestly think she's better in the jungle than she is at top, because it's much easier to snowball from there.

And then adding power elsewhere (damage or Q range/cooldown) to compensate, Boom, quinn is about same (maybe a bit less annoying) toplane, and might be viable elsewhere.\n\nToplane quinn CAN respond by leveling E first, thus gaining some of her harass back, at a cost of not leveling Q, which can be an interesting tradeoff.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-10T18:56:20.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't fix her only being viable toplane at all, it only makes her less viable there while still being unviable everywhere else.","replies":[{"poster":"dim2a","date":"2017-01-10T19:27:11.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Limmie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=439zFGaj,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-01-10T18:56:20.095+0000)\n>\n> This doesn&#x27;t fix her only being viable toplane at all, it only makes her less viable there while still being unviable everywhere else.\n\nDid you miss the \"buff damage and/or Q\" part? That is essential to make her viable elsewhere. The E cooldown change is only to make her not too overpowering toplane despite the damage/Q buff.\n\nAs for specific buffs, more harries damage and bonus AS (extra ~10% AD and ~10-20% AS/MS post-proc), or revert of Q's nerf last season would work.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ViiLLAiN","date":"2017-01-10T18:32:07.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"she didnt need a rework she was just fine where she was another thing riot loves to fck up shit that aint broken \n\nher previous version fit well with her lore and kit made it seem like 2 people in one champ which was great now its just stupid","replies":[{"poster":"Maddey","date":"2017-01-10T18:37:29.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her old kit wasn't perfect.

So now she spends her time there, making their lives a living hell for fifteen minutes before teamfighting begins.
