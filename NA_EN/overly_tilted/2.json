In this mode, you get stuck for 20 minutes in a game where you have 5 awful champions and they have a Garen who is unkillably tanky and can kill you in 0.25 seconds, or a Fiora who does 1800 true damage every 15 seconds, or something like that. If you&#039;re having fun, the other team is in your point of view now. \n\nBring back normal URF, it was one of the few things left in the game after countless shitty balance decisions\n\nI mean it's not even random, I've gotten Yorick 8 times now and I've been dodging each time I get him","replies":[{"poster":"imStarrk","date":"2017-08-17T03:53:11.462+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"AR URF Is fucking cancer, no counter play to half the brain dead champs with 0 cd on their abilities","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rafatinoni","date":"2017-08-17T10:23:42.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^This","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chain Warder","date":"2017-08-17T03:56:49.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I haven't truly enjoyed URF or ARURF as a game mode since the 2nd time it came out. URF was frustrating because I wanted to try different champions, whereas everyone else was playing the confirmed OP ones. ARURF is frustrating because it usually ends up being pretty one-sided. And it doesn't seem random to me either. Out of the few times I've played this round, I've seen a lot of Ziggs, Karthus, Swain, Jax, and Elise (though people have rerolled Elise every single time).","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiteUpSketchers","date":"2017-08-17T03:39:49.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just outta curiosity, is it possible to get two Maidens on the map at a time?","replies":[{"poster":"Taikobou","date":"2017-08-17T03:43:36.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LiteUpSketchers,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MXy4WwYA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-17T03:39:49.830+0000)\n>\n> Just outta curiosity, is it possible to get two Maidens on the map at a time?\n\nNo, while your Maiden is alive the cd wont reset.","replies":[]}]}]}
