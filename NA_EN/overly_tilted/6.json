Time to react, more skill required, more thinking, etc.?\r\nWell they reworked all the assassin champs that could one shot to make them either completely null and void, or just flat out broken now. On top of that, they didnt take into account that there&#039;s champs like Riven who can one-shot you before you even have time to react while being only one kill up. Seriously, that&#039;s not an assassination? Are you trying to tell me that&#039;s healthy? One kill up and being able to kill you before you can react(literally, because she can kill you before you are free from her cc)?\r\n\r\nThat combined with the jungle changes is throwing so many people off, it&#039;s stupid. Half of my games are assassin mains feeding because they said they never read the patch notes and dont know what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2016-11-09T15:15:28.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm certainly glad you figured this out in a matter of a few hours.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-11-09T14:31:48.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost like it's the first day (not even over yet) of the preseason?\n\nDid you really expect success on the first day?  Even the easiest stuff has a learning curve. \n\nAt least wait until a few patches in the preseason before saying it's a failure or a success.","replies":[]}]}
