I do not feel that people should gain LP for defeating a team that has no hope of winning, no matter how hard they try in a 3v5 game.\r\n\r\nEspecially now, late in the season with people trying to climb to gold, the trolls are coming out in force and making climbing effectively random luck. This is no fun for anyone.\r\n\r\nFor example: a premade with two angry kiddies enter the game, call everyone gay, then both say the team is trash and that they will quit. they then do so.\r\nThey come back 5 minutes later and begin flaming and abusing everyone else, saying they dont care if they get banned, hate nerds and will just &quot;Have a life once their accounts are deleted.&quot; This is intolerable, even more because the other team actually SUPPORTED this behavior and praised them for them giving a free win. (almost all teams in low ranks act this way, i have NEVER seen the opposing team agree to report a clearly toxic player or intentional feeder).\r\n\r\nThe other two players in this example game refuses to forfeit or give up and tried their hardest to win a 3v5 game against a barrage of toxic abuse, constant spam and mildly nonsensical insults from their teammates, Why are the mature players with a good sense of sportsmanship being punished for random luck (getting matched with trash that has decided to throw from pre-lobby, for no reason. not that there is ever a reason to throw on purpose)\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}} ....","replies":[]}
