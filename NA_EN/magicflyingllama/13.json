This is by no means a rare event in the current state of the game.\r\n\r\nWhat are your experiences? What can actually shut him down? Forcing him out of lane seems utterly impossible without sustained poke, can he be denied CS?","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2016-06-11T23:07:52.312+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morellonomicon/executioners calling","replies":[]},{"poster":"Apocalypsic","date":"2016-06-11T23:22:08.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanna know the secret to beating any vlad, ever, no matter how much they change him?\n\nThe secret is Riven","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-06-12T02:04:57.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It is possible to play riven without being a screaming preteen shitbag?","replies":[{"poster":"Apocalypsic","date":"2016-06-12T03:09:15.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uEji8t5W,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-06-12T02:04:57.462+0000)\n>\n> It is possible to play riven without being a screaming preteen shitbag?\n\nA good start would be by not stereotyping people.   \n\nPeople tell me all the time in game that I'm a pretty nice guy and I'm a Riven main.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nananananacat","date":"2016-06-11T22:54:39.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he might need to be toned down a bit, because he feels too strong rn, but I think a big mistake many players make is they try to fight him when the red bar below his health is full, and then he just does a ton of damage and heals for a ton.","replies":[]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-06-11T22:41:06.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best way to learn what counters which champion is to play that champion in multiple games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-06-11T22:39:38.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who Really supports Vlad, (even though he is a bit strong) \n\nHe's a battle mage, He's going to do pretty good in a crowd.
