That 20% discount on a crappy skin for a champ i dont play has entertainment value, at least.","replies":[{"poster":"FrozenFitzgerald","date":"2019-04-05T03:29:34.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely not a completely accurate system. The \"My Shop\" that I have is exclusively offering skins for characters that I have not played a single time in the entire history of my account. Not one skin in there is for a champion that has any mastery points above zero. Apparently, it does not matter that at the time I opened my \"My Shop\" a full 54% of all of my games were on one champion, no skins for him should appear in my shop at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2019-04-04T23:04:32.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you think you got it bad I got a 60% and 70% discount on Count shitskin. _Also gave a  vlad skin, even though I only played him once or twice in bots, decent skin though_\n\nIt seems to work slightly better than last time, I didn't get any Yasou/Zed this time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2019-04-04T21:54:10.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"IT IS BROKEN\nfor the love of god , I DON'T EVEN PLAY EZREAL AND AKALI , why did I get their skins ?????

I've noticed it doesn't seem to draw from your entire gaming history ever, though it may weight your mastery in a bit.\n\nMy last few months, I've been logging a helluva lot of Morgana and Zyra games as support in Ranked. I also played Caitlyn very rarely, and I've spammed Kayle in norms when I could since she's come out. The caveat - I own all of Zyra and Morgana's skins. My Shop looked like this:\n\nPool Party Caitlyn\nSand Wraith Pyke\nOdyssey Sona\nCosmic Lulu\nBattleborn Kayle\n(Can't recall the last one)\n\nSo it's definitely pulled from supports I play a lot based on my mastery with them (Sona, Lulu), and definitely pulled Caitlyn and Kayle. I've extremely rarely played Pyke, but he's a support, so I understand it. Overall, my pulls make sense based on my recent play patterns, so I don't believe the system is broken at all.\n\nI would think the only thing that \"breaks\" the system is playing ARAMs, where your champions played are randomized (thus giving it highly inconsistent data) and low frequency of play. Both of these factors would cause the system to have little to no data to pull from, and would complicate each other if both things occurred.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DracoFox","date":"2019-04-05T13:12:31.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot went through the trouble to put, \"\"Offers include Champion if unowned\" in the shop.
