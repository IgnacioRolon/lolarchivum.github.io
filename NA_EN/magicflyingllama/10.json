Two admitted to being lv22 at the start of the game, a third said they just hit 30. They had no idea what a &quot;leash&quot; was and accused me of being a crybaby and &quot;needing handholding&quot;, proceeded to run off to ward (and die) during a gank, next lane stands still and watches me die in a 2v2 gank, ect. \r\nThey proceed to be hilariously toxic in that special, pathetic and entirely un-annoying way unique to bronze teens for the rest of the game, each one blaming everyone else for how hard they are feeding.\r\n\r\nBefore this day, i had not even seen a lv22 in over two years.\r\n\r\nRito, why you break teambuilder matchmaking? Or is my luck just horrible?","replies":[]}
