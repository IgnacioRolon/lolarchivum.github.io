Framerate counter dips to an unstable 40-70, while actual framerate looks closer to 5-10. Microstutter and rubberbanding as well. This persists for several minutes and then stops.\r\n\r\nWhat has absolutely no effect on it: Graphics settings, VSync, framelimiter, FRTC, Radeon Chill, client enabled/disabled, lowspec mode, window mode\r\n\r\nWhat seems to have fixed it, at least for now: Uninstalling the Realtek audio drivers provided by MSI, and setting LeagueClientWhatever.exe processes to only use threads 0,2,4 (CCX 1 physical cores) in ProcessLasso\r\n\r\nCPU is an R5 1600@3.8Ghz, GPU Vega 56 (only reaches about 300Mhz in LoL, because it is lazy), MSI B350 Mortar motherboard, 4x8 2933C16 dual channel RAM, OS and game both on 500MBPS SSD storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nA huge number of people seem to have similar issues since mid-2018, some fixed it with modifications to their audio configs as well. My personal theory is that it is related to a certain audio phase or track, what else would explain it only happening during transition to midgame?","replies":[{"poster":"ÃŸK Foot Lettuce","date":"2019-06-29T19:47:11.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same problem for at least a month, but probably closer to two. 3 of my friends experience the same issues on their own computers, and 2 of my friends borrowed my laptop (I normally play on desktop) where they also had these problems, even immediately after installing league. Twice have I talked about it in game, and both times one other non-premade says they have the same issue. This really ruins games, when you lose entire fights because the framerates drop to 10 or less. Happens to me throughout the whole game, not just 7-12 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-29T21:25:16.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is almost certainly an unrelated issue, if it is happening on non-Ryzen laptops.\n\nDo you have any details on the specs of those systems? It is likely something a bit more straightforward than inter-CCX latency.","replies":[]}]}]}
