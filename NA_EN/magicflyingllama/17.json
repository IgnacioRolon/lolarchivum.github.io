Salty lowbies, please read.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":11,"down_votes":11,"body":"I am going to clarify a few misconceptions a large majority of players seem to have about the report system:\r\n\r\n**More reports mean a higher chance of punishment**\r\n   One and only one report is needed to flag an automatic review of the game and account. This is why asking other people to report someone does no good and is considered punishable harassment.\r\n\r\n**People can get punished just for being reported**\r\nIncorrect. If a report is filed and the review finds no misconduct, the false report actually counts against the reputation of the reporter.\r\n\r\n**Reports do not work! Rito pls.**\r\nYes, they do. If you report people who actually did something wrong (puncturing your paper-thin skin is not automatically punishable, neither is picking a champion you dont like), you will often get a little popup box saying that someone you reported has been reviewed and punished. Typically it takes more than one reviewed and guilty game to trigger punishment.\r\n\r\n**Things people, mainly angry kids, think are punishable, which are actually not:**\r\n**A:** &quot;Troll&quot; and &quot;Nonmeta&quot; picks are completely OK, unless they lead to reportable behavior, like feeding. Most often they do not, unless the team is set on throwing the game as hard as possible by flaming or refusing to help the &quot;troll&quot; pick.\r\n**B: **Not ganking your (0/6 at 12 minute) top lane: Totally OK. No good jungler would, anyway.\r\n**C: **Refusing to join your curse chat or skype. Nobody wants to hear squeaky voices with awful feedback loops.","replies":[{"poster":"abcdefg182","date":"2016-09-10T05:32:32.255+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"This post is BS like the report and \"reform\" system, and the reason is that only behavior that can be detected by the automated system gets punished. What is the point on reporting an afk if he gets LeaverBustered anyways? \n\nThe only truth here is the just one report for triggering verbal abuse review (by a machine). But if you troll it doesn't matter if you get one or one hundred reports, if you don't afk and never say a word in chat you will NEVER get punished. This is because there are no actual people reviewing this reports (except extreme cases like cheating, fraud or notoriously public cases) and an automated system can't detect a troll.\n\n\"If a report is filed and the review finds no misconduct, the false report actually counts against the reputation of the reporter.\" This is ridiculous per se but even more when you are aware of the previous fact.  Not that it  really matters if your \"reporting privilege\" gets revoked, the only times your reports counted were auto detected by the system anyways.\n\nNo one reports for troll picks, not ganking or refusing to join skype.\n\nThings we DO report that go against the rules but will never be punished:\n- \"asking other people to report someone\"\n- \"gg ez\" and all its variations\n- Banning your pick intent on purpose because it was considered a \"troll pick\"\n- Spamming pings, emotes, masteries.\n- Flooding the post game chat (you can do anything there really, except extreme harassment that could be screenshoted, it's not monitored).\n- Any trolling ingame behavior except going afk or suiciding straight to turret. And I mean ANY, Riot will never punish you for things like following your jungler all game and taking his farm for no reason, building 6 tear of the goddess, engaging 1vs5 repeatedly or eating your ADC with tahm kench and tossing him under the opponent turret because as they have stated many times they won't enforce the meta.\n\nLearn this, only chat toxicity and abuse is getting punished. The only thing riot cares about are flamers/ragers, the trolls have the right to troll because you will never prove that they were trolling on purpose, so if you try to argue with them YOU are the one getting banned.\n\nYou don't like flamers, you can mute them, the flame disappears instantly. I don't like trolls/feeders, what can I do? Report them?
