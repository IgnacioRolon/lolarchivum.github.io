And some tips on dealing with him in lane.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just throwing it out there, i am not a frequent Yasuo player, and yes, i find him annoying to lane against..\n\nBut he is really not overpowered in any way. His winrate has been hovering within 1% of 50 for a long time, and his lane winrate is similar.\nHe is a high-skill champion with clear weaknesses and strengths, and yes, he will seem OP if you do not understand how to lane or what those weaknesses are.\n\nWatch and count his Qs and avoid the tornado. \nDo not stand right behind your minion waves, try to stand to one side of behind, so he cannot minion-taxi onto you with his dash.\nThe damage of his dash increases with repeated casts. Be aware that he will probably try to dash down your waves to Q you as soon as it is ready.\nIf you have ranged damage, trigger his shield and let it expire before engaging.\nIf you have important skillshots, bait his windwall - do not just all-in when you know it is off cooldown, unless you can reposition easily.\n\nHe has no escapes from ganks if he is pushed down his lane, unless your wave is behind him. This is especially important in top lane.\nCall for jungler help if he is pushing the lane too far in, and try to coordinate so that he has no escape. Make sure the jungler comes in from the side of the lane, or he will just dash through them. Try to bait windwall before gank if it is a jungler like lee or amumu.\n\nOn AP champs, rush seekers - even if you do not upgrade to hourglass, the extra armor and AP is very gold-efficient.\nIf you can survive his ult and have hourglass, feel free to let him hit you with Q under your turret, when your minion wave is dead or not nearby.\nMost low-elo yasuos have incurable lee sindrome, and HAVE to R any time the hit Q on anything.\nHit hourglass when his ult ends and watch the turret kill him. With no minions to dash to, he cant escape.  Apply CC/ignite if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Tilthankaldar","date":"2016-08-03T21:00:48.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You overlooked the most important thing.\n\n\nIf a champion has a 54% win rate but a 1% play rate\n\nThen those stats generally mean nothing.\n\nIf a champion has a 52% win rate accompanied by the highest play rate ( Yasuo has the highest play rate atm )\n\nThen 2 things should be considered\n\n1) This champion is mechanically easy that first time players can do fine on him\n\n2) This champion needs to be looked at for nerfs because a high play rate should by definition lower win rate for new players","replies":[]}]}
