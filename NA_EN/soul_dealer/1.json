So what?  At least Pantheon has to go balls deep!\n\nAnd TF is intentionally kept very weak for that reason. Panth and TF have the same playstyle: use ult to teleport to a target, point-and-click stun, skillshot that won't miss because the target is stunned, more targeted damage. TF just has a bit more range while Panth has a bit more defense. After the rework, Panth will switch that targeted damage for another skillshot that won't miss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-08-11T02:11:55.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bastilean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EEGE00NQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-11T02:10:00.652+0000)\n>\n> TF has a point and click stun too.
