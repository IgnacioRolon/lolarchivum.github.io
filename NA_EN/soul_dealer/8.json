Even the toughest tanks in the game can't do that for 8 seconds let alone kill you anyway. I say we should make his ultimate duration scale off level, like 4 seconds at level 6, 4.5 at level 11 and 5 at level 16. I'm even okay if it's 4/5/6, just as long as he doesn't have that capability at level 6.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-08-13T15:34:45.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think a Jax main is allowed to complain about bullshit personally, but ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-08-13T15:37:41.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hnuAIoZx,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-08-13T15:34:45.576+0000)\n>\n> I don't think a Jax main is allowed to complain about bullshit personally, but ok.\n\nLol my champ is bs.

In almost all cases if a champion gets buffed it is bc they are weak. Jax is getting bugged not so much because he is weak but because ranged top lamer bully him to hard right now. The buff does not affect jungle Jax at all and hardly affects his non ranged match ups.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MaFyO2154","date":"2019-08-13T16:58:30.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"legit one wardhop while he is diving you and he wont reach you anymore lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2019-08-13T16:51:26.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a few seconds to talk about our lord and saviour {{item:3123}} {{item:3076}} \n\n/s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-08-13T16:27:00.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can't just walk under tower and 100-0 a Jax without being hella fed, which he was or without you grossly misplaying or standing around with low HP.
