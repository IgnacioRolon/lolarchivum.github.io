So I was on a 2 game win streak and was playing pretty good so I go into my third game against a top lane Elmo as jax ( my main) and \r\ngot first blooded by him but after that I shut him down and take his turret for turret first blood and around this time I am 5 and 1 but then our alkali mid gets mad at our Aattrox  jpg for no reason and processes to feed saying she doesn&#039;t care about the game. Eventually she stopped and said &quot;I am going to farm until I can 1v5 &quot; so she never grouped with us and fed some more. At this point this are going pretty well for us and I am very fed ( so much so I can 1v1 the enemy con under his turret) but alkali then procedes to feed ekko some more and the enemy team gets baron after which we start losing. Then she just says she doesn&#039;t care about winning she never did and goes afk allowing them to take out base and wi n. \r\n\r\nI have been seeing this happen a lot lately in bronze and I want to say that if you don&#039;t care about winning please don&#039;t play ranked and ruin fo the rest of us","replies":[]}
