You are not allowed to defend yourself in chat if you are getting flamed and that is a problem. You don’t always need to defend yourself and most of the time you can mute and move on but if someone starts threading you or your family or is wishing bad things on your family you need to be able to defend yourself in chat. \r\n\r\nI’m gonna compete this issue to an issue I had throughout middle school and high school.\r\n\r\nIn middle school I was bullied by one person non-stop but I couldn’t defend myself because my school didn’t allow that, they also didn’t do anything about the bully as they said that “it does not concern them”, this unfortunately hurt me mentally for years. Eventually I went to a therapist and she helped me through my problems but she told me that my issues stemmed from the fact that I would not stand up for myself due to the fact that I was not allowed to defend myself against my bully in middle school. \r\n\r\nNot being able to stand up for yourself or standing up for yourself and getting punished is bad for you mentally and can hurt you in the future. Riot needs to update their punishment system to take things into context and allow us to defend ourselves without getting punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-07-13T05:32:06.282+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in media, it's not the case for old forum threads.

That's why it feels bad to use it, because it's the acknowledgement that all else **has** failed, and therefore indirectly it feels like an acknowledgment of your own failure.\n\nBut that's just one way to see it. The other way to see it is as a tool of absolute control. It gives you 100% of the control of the situation. Whatever you say, you don't know what they will reply. Maybe they are able to use your own words against you, maybe they will feel like **they** need to stand up for what **they** have said and merely escalate the entire thing.\n\nBut there is absolutely nothing they can do about you muting them.\n\nLet me share a little story from the time I played WoW: To spare you the convoluted story, some stranger thought I had been unfriendly to them, but I was literally unable to help them due to their own mistake. I even tried to do the exact thing they expected me to do.\n\nAnd yet, the player just **snapped**. They started insulting me like crazy... and I blocked them.\nShortly thereafter I was messaged by *another* character about why the fuck I blocked him, and how I was a coward... so I blocked them.\nThis repeated a **lot**. I'm fairly sure that person went through all their existent characters to insult me before stopping.\n\nNow here's the thing: I tried to stand up for myself, explaining what really had happened, but that just fell on deaf ears. There was literally no reaction to that. But when I **blocked** that person? That riled them up more than anything I could have ever said to them. My goal when I blocked that person wasn't to win. It was to remove the white noise of having somebody spam your chat with insults. But at the end of the day, blocking made me win:\nI had absolute control over every step in the \"fight\", I was evidently more content with the situation and more calm, and I can't help but imagine I was happier about the outcome.\n\nBeing muted means you lose control. Muting gives you control.\nIt is not weak, it is not giving up, it is using the tools you have at your disposal to best protect yourself and your mental health.\nAnd while it's probably not super healthy to try and get revenge on people: It makes a lot of people **really** mad when you mute them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-04-03T01:14:42.368+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"You are permitted to defend yourself with the mute button, which acts as a magic shield to prevent toxicity.\n\nLast I checked, that doesn’t exist in real life for someone punching you.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-04-03T01:20:35.141+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other than the mute button, you are allowed to stand up for yourself - provided what you say isn't inflammatory, or along the lines of what they're presumably saying to you.\n\nHowever, I will stress: for the sake of the game, say your piece, mute them, and focus on your gameplay.

He spent the next 27 minutes screaming at my adc (and presumably me, though I muted him after about 2...) about how we never helped him, we threw the whole game by not helping him, a few things about our stats (coming from a XinZhao self-proclaimed \"one trick\" with a 37%WR, I really couldn't care less...)\nWhat I remember most clearly was the 2 points in which I muted him...\n\nBut the gist of the conversation was that I clearly told him \"Yeah, you just lv 2 dove a Thresh with no minions at tower...\" and he started presumably foaming at the mouth cause he made like 17 sentences in 20s that basically made no sense. It came out to something like \"you %%%king idiots just gave up a double kill and now he has my red!\" and something about how \"people like [me and my adc] need more bleach\" or something. So...\"Honest Confusion and Concern\" (not really) I asked him if he was ok, and said that if he needed me to, I could roam with him til he could play the game. (Note: this is a very nice, not at all inflammatory way of telling your jungler that you can hold his hand and babysit him for the whole game, because he has no skill)\n\nHe kept going on and on and on about the same crap. So after about 2 minutes (and him inting in the enemy's red side jungle instead of even pathing to his blue first) I just reiterated \"You ran in lv 2 and turret dove a thresh.

Even in the real world, there's gonna be situations where you can't \"stand up for yourself\" by fighting back. And, beyond that, you need to learn that, in dealing with flamers, _being toxic back isn't going to help. It isn't going to make them stop, and it sure as hell isn't going to make them admit they're wrong._\n\n_They are **flamers.** They don't care what you think, they're going to think that they're right, no matter how much toxicity you throw back at them. In fact, **being toxic back is just going to put them further on the defense, and they're not gonna want to apologize or stop when you're being just as bad as they are back.**_\n\nYou need to learn that retaliating and being toxic back is completely and utterly counter-intuitive.

I didnt say any 0 tolerance words nor did i even swear but excessive typing also can lead to a punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-04-03T23:18:00.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the guy who regularly types pages in chat: Bullshit.
