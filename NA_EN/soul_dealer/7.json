I thought they were learning when they started lowering the damage a bit this season so tanks could be more relevant again, but they're still leaving some pretty ridiculous players high on their thrones while area nerfing entire groups to oblivion with item changes...I get rageblade, but I really don't understand the Wit's End change at all.\nIt was underused, but a fine niche. I hope they revert it when they realize that adcs should have the old niche version back after the gunblade changes, but I know that's never gonna happen.","replies":[]}]}]}
