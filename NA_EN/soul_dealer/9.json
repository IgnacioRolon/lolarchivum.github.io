I just played a game where I was doing pretty well and getting bot lane and top lane ahead as jungle. Unfortunately my mid lane Akali said in chat she was going to troll at about the 10 minute mark and proceeded to throw the game hard. She started flaming in chat so I muted her and played the game out. In post game lobby she started threatening me and my family and used hate speech multiple times towards me and the other members of the team. I unfortunately lost my cool because I was getting so sick of seeing trolls in my game and told the Akali to “stfu and go back to playing fortnite your prepubescent 12 year old”. My entire team reported her but knowing what riot bans for and considering I had a 14 day suspension for much the same thing about 5-6 months ago I believe that I will get a perma ban and the trolling Akali will not get any form of punishment as riot doesn’t pushing trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"rKRex","date":"2019-08-26T05:42:07.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"riot doesn't care about you as long the money keeps rolling in","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-08-26T18:42:39.271+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, they do care.

The person who initiated the toxicity should be banned, the person who retaliated shouldn't. Period. That's how you prevent people from instigating, you punish them worse. It's simple logic.\n\nExcept that's not how the world works. Two or more people arguing with each other just makes the situation works and also ruins the experience of everyone else who has to put up with it. \"They started it/were worse\" didn't work in school and it doesn't work here, and businesses will usually have no problem throwing all involved out. From the [Instant Feedback System FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q7): \n\n>**WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!**\nSimply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game. If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\nReports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nFor a more detailed explanation from [**Understanding the Tribunal**](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.","replies":[{"poster":"rKRex","date":"2019-08-29T03:56:50.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Of course it matters.
