I'll have my usual style of post with the specifics of item changes on Friday when we try to coordinate a PBE push.\n\n  \n  \n\n**Attack Damage - B.F. Sword normalization**\n\n**Items Affected:** {{item:1038}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3139}} \n\nWe're going to be normalizing everything that builds out of B.F. Sword to have 80 Attack Damage with minimal price increases to compensate - as well as shifting B.F. Sword to have 50 Attack Damage at the 1600 Gold price point, instead of 45 Attack Damage at the 1550 Gold price point.\n\nOn the whole, we like what this does to the overall decision making when purchasing a B.F. Sword - you know it will eventually morph into an 80 Attack Damage item - the only question being what sorts of side utility you want out of the whole deal.  \n\nThere's a slight caveat here in that this puts an unfortunate damper on **Bloodthirster** - whose presence is too dominant and skews the power between Ratio driven carries and more traditional basic attack oriented carries.\n\nEssentially, BT goes down in power - everything else goes up in power - including the midgame where you build up to BT.\n\n  \n  \n\n**Attack Speed Itemization - Dagger Retuning**\n\n**Items Affected:** {{item:1042}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3086}}\n\nAttack Speed isn't a particularly attractive statistic to overcommit to at the moment given the natural Attack Speed growth of carries. We're making some slight buffs to Dagger to help mitigate some of the mid-game power issues that carries are facing at the moment where Attack Speed only feels good at the final completed item rather than during the build-up, where it matters.\n\nBasically, you usually do get enough Attack Speed by the end of the game with your build.   It's just that the entire way to the end item, you don't have nearly enough. You can expect these items to have slightly more attack speed with a minimal price increase.  \n\nFor example: Berzerker's Greaves giving 5% more Attack Speed and costing 50 more Gold.\n\n\n  \n  \n**Lifesteal**\n\nGoing to start with a quick item preview as a framing piece:\n\n{{item:1055}} **Doran's Blade**\n\n80 Health --> 70 Health  \n8 Attack Damage --> 7 Attack Damage  \n3/5 Life on Hit --> 3% Life Steal\n\nFor a long time, we were trying to phase out early life steal as a statistic and replacing it with other mechanisms such as life on hit.  However, with the rise of non-sustain supports - this avenue no longer makes sense.  With non-sustain based supports being the norm rather an exception - Life Steal needs to be easily accessible from a variety of sources in order for the ADC to not be locked into a single early build path - the one that includes Life Steal. \n\nWith this in mind, it makes more sense for Life Steal to be more expensive overall but easier to 'stack' from a wider variety of sources rather than have Life Steal be a single specific path. \n\nHence, we're going to lower the life steal amounts of all items - but introduce it back into Doran's Blade in order for carries to have a wider range of possible % Life Steal values - this allows carries to basically build the 'right' amount of life steal for their carry type, their support and the power of their lane opponents - rather than having one single overpowered choice that tries to cover every situation in which you might need sustain.\n\nOn the whole, you can expect there to be less life steal on each of the life steal items but more available % life steal options.  What we expect to see is a slightly wider range of potential first order buys - especially since this version of Doran's Blade has more mid game potential.\n\n{{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} {{item:3031}}   \n{{item:1055}} {{item:3072}}   \n{{item:1055}} {{item:3153}}   \n{{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1053}} --> ?\n\n{{item:3072}} **Bloodthirster**\n\n70 Attack Damage --> 80 Attack Damage  \n12% Life Steal --> 15% Life Steal\n\nStacking Passive --> **Removed**  \nNew Unique Passive --> Your life steal effects can overheal you, granting you a shield equal to the excess up to X (based on character level).  This shield decays if you haven't dealt or taken damage in 15 seconds\n\nBloodthirster becomes a problem when its too commonplace as it creates a situation where it basically comes down to who acquires it first.  This is both due to the power and build path of the item as well as the stacking mechanic on it. Additionally, it favors Attack Damage ratio-driven carries who traditionally have weaker end-games to begin with.  We're retuning Bloodthirster to be a more consistent choice and to give other damage options a more favorable comparison point.\n\nWe know that this will leave certain ranged characters that rely on Bloodthirster Stacking in a bit of a bind at the moment - Certain heavy AD Varus and Miss Fortune builds will be in a bit of a pinch without a stackable Attack Damage source.  However, given how Bloodthirster both supports these characters *and* suppresses them by being **more** favorable to other characters - it's not really contributing to a healthier ecosystem.  \n\nMelee will generally come out favorably as they have a very offensive life steal item (Hydra) and a more defensive one (Bloodthirster).\n\n  \n  \n\n{{item:3222}} **Mikael's Crucible**\n\nLastly, I want to talk about Crucible - this item is too commonplace and negates a lot of decision making in the end game.  Crucible does odd things where it devalues long cooldown initiation patterns in exchange for repeated pick patterns.  \n\nThis **heavily** suppresses utility centric carries like **Ashe** or **Varus** who rely on these patterns to be strategically interesting.\n\nWe do like that Crucible is an option in the game but it is currently too broad of a pick and appearing too frequently on a much wider array of supports than intended.  Mikael's is just as good as a buy on offensive tanky supports as defensive ones - which skews the balance of power even farther away from initiation based carries as their unique niche both gets countered *and* replaced by the same character.  \n\nWe're going to both raise the cost of this item and adjust the statline to favor more Mana intensive supports to shifts Mikael into favoring more mage-centric supports rather than Tank supports.  We'll be adding another support item in Mikael's price point in order to grant a wider breadth of items - the details of which will be on the PBE post on Friday.\n\n**Note - 11:43 a.m.:** Gotta run. Won't be responding to posts for the rest of the night. I'll check back in this thread tomorrow.\n\n**Note - 1:11 p.m.:** Can't.. respond to every post in this thread based system.

I'll be responding again when I post the specifics on PBE.

If you note the specifics - there's already some minor numerical adjustments based on concerns raised in this thread.\n\nLink: http://community.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback","replies":[{"poster":"Sjokz and Awe","date":"2014-06-05T05:52:23.888+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":62,"body":"What do you mean that Mikael's is too commonplace?

If, by chance, mikaels wasn't used on an elise cocoon, a thresh hook, a leona ult, an annie stun, a tf gold card, among others, and solely saved for the utility ADC engage, Ashe and Varus both have a minute and a half cooldown on their ultimate compared to the 3 on mikaels. A professional-grade team should be able to time and utilize that information to make a significantly stronger and more impactful push in that down time. \n\nI also would go to mention that in a lot of situations, the mikaels active is used often built and used for countering an assassin's burst on a prime target, and the active is not held on to solely for cc elimination. It would be an interesting experiment to separate those two components, the heal active, and the crowd control cleanse into two items, and see which is more useful/popular.\n\nI do not disagree that cleanses make these initiation marksman types less effective, but I think that their kits making them less useful for objective control is a larger component of why they are unpopular competitively. Both offer less help in taking towers in the mid game as compared to lucian with waveclear, jinx with pure attack speed/range/damage, or caitlyn with safety, and die relatively easily to assassins, fighters, long range mages, and aoe. Without any form of mobility or self peel, they are unreliable outside of their niche of utility initiation, which isn't what is desirable in a competitive marksman. This could also be due to the high mobility creep of fighters, but as it stands, I think its fairly valid. I'm not sure if a substantial mikaels nerf will directly cause a substantial strength in utility carries. I think more so, it will have a bigger impact on those like elise, with her cocoon mid game, where the stun is 2 seconds on a 10 second cooldown rather than the 3.5 second stun on a 1.5 minute cooldown.\n\nI know I'm not telling you anything you haven't thought about already, i'm sure that you already have some answers for them coming up on friday.

Another option could be adding a few seconds of slowing effects reduction after using, so we could see more quicksilvers at all levels of play.\n\nAlso, if you're going to have a look at ADC itemization and attack speed here are some ideas:\n\n\"Sword of the Divine\" {{item:3131}} building out of \"Recurve Bow\" {{item:1043}} and \"Brawler's Gloves\" {{item:1051}} and granting half base stats while on cooldown would make it quite a decent choice.\n\n\"Runaan's Hurricane\" {{item:3085}} is a good item, but it's building path is quite unfriendly for an ADC as you're wasting a lot of money on getting a lot of attack speed without getting any AD.\n\n\"Zephyr\" {{item:3172}} could also be tweaked or repurposed since it actually just gives a bit of everything making it not widely used.\n\n\nFinally, and only in my opinion \"Blade of the Ruined King\" {{item:3153}}  is too strong, it's building path is perfect, the material objects are cheap and that lets you get some AD and lifesteal in early game while additionally gaining survivability and kill potential with from the active slow in {{item:3144}}. When you get the final upgrade into BotRK you also have a quite decent amount of atack speed and high increase in the dmg output thanks to passive effect and extremely hight survivability thanks to the movement speed and health steal on active. Maybe another object building out of {{item:3144}} could help to mitigate the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iara","date":"2014-06-05T14:24:07.654+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ashe or Varus are useless because they have a **bad kit for the current meta**. Everybody has **gap closer** or **slow/stun**. They aren't useless because we can cleanse there ult, but because they can't do anything against a Leona, a Thresh, a Braum, an Udyr, a Kha'Zix, an Akali, etc etc. Ashe's ult lasts like 1 sec (not sure the exact amount, sorry) at close range so an Udyr won't care at all (and an Udyr doesn't build a Crucible), for exemple. \n\nI don't think they need a buff and I don't think reworking the Mickael's Crucible will give them they opportunity to shine either. We never see an Ashe or a Varus, neither in competitive scene, neither in Solo Q, because they are weak in current meta.\n\nAnd like someone says, a team needs a marksman who does damage à 100% like Draven or Lucian, and not an utility ADC, because we already have a mid support half the time, a real support and half the time, a supportive jungle. \n\nI think you're taking the wrong way to solve the problem and you'll penalize all the players because you don't see an Ashe in LCS. Personnally, i'm a bit mad about your announcment on Crucible, because you already nerfed the Locket {{item:3190}} to the ground and made it super expensive, and now, you want to change the Crucible. Also, the Crucible has like **180 sec CD**, and 3 minutes is enough for an Ashe's or Varus' ult to come back and to make a great play.\n\nCrucible is really helpful in teamfight and also, it's a **decision making object** for a support, because you need to chose which of your teammates needs it, which one will it be worth it to waste a 3 min CD active, which ability to cleanse, etc. And sometimes, Crucible is the only thing that can help you to peel for your carry, because everything is on cooldown or you're just useless against a fed Kha or Leblanc. \n\nHave a nice day :D\n\n*Sorry for the mistakes i could have made, English is not my language.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syelor","date":"2014-06-05T11:24:24.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"C0ntract0r","date":"2014-06-05T12:28:53.252+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":46,"body":"All riot cares about is the \"professional\" or \"competitive\" play, they could give a rats ass about the majority of the games players in solo queue.

As an example (albeit a terrible one) Runescape uses In-game polls to get opinion of community over whether or not to do an update, or nerf/buff an aspect of the games combat system. It focuses around the majority of its player base and has since started re-growing to be relatively close to its original size when it was the popular mmorpg.\n\nIMO making a games revolve around the minority of its players is just going to decrease the games overall Lifespan. I know i can hardly Play league anymore due to the overall negativity in the community, whether its ranked/normals/arams or any other game mode that has come out there is constant shit talking for NO reason.\n\n Hell, the last ranked game I played, it was really close game and I was being supportive of my whole team any time a mistake was madfe, im pretty sure I said \"dont worry we still have this game\" around 20 times after a teammate got caught out, or we lost a team-fight. After we lose in post game, 2 people on my team (I'm guessing a duo) were talking shit saying I'm a worthless pile of shit and should kill myself because it was my fault we lost the game, and then I got the \"reported for offensive language\" notice pop up in my client.

Due to the crit chance given by IE combined with its passive, having access to Infinity Edge during laning could decide the lane by RNG. If both carries rush IE then it could come down to whoever crits first. While this could be considered a concern to crits in general, the impact is bigger in lane as it involves less autoattacking compared to lategame teamfights, and players will feel \"haxed\" as a result.\n\nNow I'm all for buffing the autoattack oriented carries, but bringing IE rush back into viability seems dangerous for lane purposes.\n\nJust my 2 cents","replies":[{"poster":"Xypherous","date":"2014-06-05T06:35:21.272+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Going to copy / pasta myself from a couple minute ago:\n\nWhile that's an interesting point - I don't actually see that random factor changing as much - mostly because the first item you get after BT is a Zeal - which has much less crit chance and just as much variance in terms of 'I win the lane.'\n\nSecondly, the triple DBlade into I.E. build is more expensive than a straight BT rush. By the time you finish triple doran's into IE - it's far more likely that you'll be at the tail end of the laning phase as it's far more gold.\n\nIn both of these cases - the situation where the game is more random because of lane cases is mitigated by the fact that it either takes longer to get to the crit (in the case of DBlade --> IE) or by the fact that when you're at the same gold equivalent value there was crit in the BT build as well. \n\nI do kind of expect single DBlade into I.E. to be suicide.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-06-05T05:49:59.391+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":17,"body":"Really, Riot? You're not gonna change how easily accessable vamp scepters are? The reason that non sustain supports are so popular is that, given how easily available life steal is via vamp scepter, runes/masteries, and psuedo-lifesteal on Doran's Blade, sustain supports are basically redundant, and because it's easier for an ADC to lifesteal up by hitting creeps than it is for a poke support to try to poke them down with their skills, burst damage is the only way anything is getting done bottom.\n\nOnce a marksman gets a vamp scepter, they become unharasssable unless they're losing lane incredibly hard, meaning poke supports have to poke the other support, since any mana spent on harassing the ADC is wasted mana due to the ADC lifestealing up simply by last hitting and pushing the lane.\n\nWhen I heard you guys were addressing ADC itemization issues, I was hoping that this was gonna be one of the things you're gonna change.","replies":[{"poster":"Xypherous","date":"2014-06-05T05:53:25.167+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":9,"body":"As stated in the post - Vampiric Scepter and almost every life steal item will have a reduction in % Life Steal.\n\nRight now, carries only have three possible stopping points for life steal: 4.5% (Quints), 14.5% (Quints + VS) and 16.5% to Y% (BT).\n\nMy goal is to nerf every source of lifesteal that stems out of the Vampiric Scepter path, including Vampiric Scepter but add a small component source of % lifesteal such that there is a wider range of lifesteal values that a carry can get or stop at which will then allow him to choose what level of sustain he wants / feels like he needs.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-06-05T06:00:58.507+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":12,"body":"But as long as Vamp Scepter is a cheap item that builds into good lategame items (and it still is, especially considering how absurd BORK is still going to be given how you haven't mentioned changing that too much), basically every carry is going to buy it immediately unless they have enough gold for a BF sword.

And that's assuming they rush it, without buying a sightstone or an upgraded support item, which is a bad idea in the first place. But without a chalice, a support has no hope of pushing out an ADC with lifesteal without killing them, causing poke support to be much weaker as soon as the ADC buys their first item.

With reduced LS during lane phase, ADCs can heal up gradually, and if they play smart and avoid further poke they will win. However, if the enemy  support plays smarter and is able to land more poke consecutively then they will win.

Why do they have a place in a team**\n\nThree core aspects (CA):  \n1. Late-game tank and objective buster: An AD champion with the right items puts out an incredibly high amount of sustained damage. Damage you need to cut through fully build tanks, who should normally be rather strong against burst damage (which they should be able to facetank).  \n2. Structure taker: To maximize your potential damage against structures, you need a lot of AD or AP, as well as good AS. However, building AS isn't a top priority or even possibility for most AP scaling champions.  \n3. Safety: Possing ranged attacks allows for a safety buffer, in the fact that the enemy's attacks and abilities cannot reach you as easily. This safety allows a ranged AD champion to forego the heavy defense itemization a melee needs to survive prolonged time in the enemy fire (time needed to deal sustained damage).\n\n**How do current items fill in these core aspects?**\n\n*The Gold Standard*\n\n{{item:3072}} : The quintessential carry item. Fulfills CA 2 (high AD for tower damage) and 3 (Safety through keeping HP up via Lifesteal) fully, while still being an asset to CA 1 (a ton of AD to fuel crits). And all at a reasonable price point.  \n{{item:3031}} : CA 1 - basically, this item is what leads to the really high sustained damage a carry can deal. Also, the AD are helpful for CA 2, but much less so than BT's AD - you pay a lot more gold for less damage to structures.  \n{{item:3046}} : Force multiplier. Complements both CA 1 (AS and Crit chance massively boost sustained damage) and 2 (AS helps taking down structures faster). Also, contributes to CA 3 by giving increased movement speed and the IUC effect.  \n{{item:3035}} : This item is supposed to be another centerpiece for CA 1, as it is supposed to counter heavy armor-stacking. However, as it stands, it  doesn't do its job - or, rather it doesn't do its job correctly. Basically, due to everybody having base Armor, at some point, it is an item good against everyone, instead of merely screwing with resistance stacking.\n\n*The non-standard stuff*\n\n{{item:3087}} : A force-multiplier akin to PD. Gives slight AoE damage, which contributes to CA 2. Since open sieges rarely involve more than 1 or 2 AAs at a time, it can be better for that purpose than PD. Also, it synergizes well with the kiting playstyle carries need to do. However, for raw output (CA 1), it is inferior.  \n{{item:3153}} : Supposed to counter health-stacking (CA 1). Ok at that, too. Also, a big item for safety (CA 3), due to Lifesteal and the powerful active (slow, haste, damage, heal). AS is also an asset for sieging (CA 2). A decent alternative to BT for carries that value AS over raw AD.  \n{{item:3078}} : A good safety option (CA 3), due to the HP and two forms of MS. Synergizes well with ability-based carries, which are, by their very nature, more burst-oriented than AA-based carries. Also, good for sieging (CA 2) - as said before, that activity rarely involves more than 1 or 2 AAs at a time, and a Sheen proc is like a mini-crit on a tower. Only thing it doesn't do well is CA 1 - it trades a good deal of sustained damage for more burst.  \n{{item:3071}} : Rarely seen on carries. Few benefits for safety, and isn't effective against structures beyond the AD part, either. Also, since the passive lowers the enemy's Armor for everyone, not just yourself, it is a funny case of having good synergy with CA 1 - but only if one or two of the carry's teammates bring it.  \n{{item:3142}} : Interesting item. It is purposely weaker on ranged champions, but, apart from that, it brings a good mixture of stats for all three aspects - ArPen and Crit are good for CA1, AS and AD for CA 2, and MS and CdR for CA 3. Still, PD, Triforce and SS are superior in most situations and on most champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Xypherous","date":"2014-06-05T19:44:21.748+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a decent analysis - but typically analysis leads to desired outcomes or results.

Also, it was a good exercise for a scientifically oriented mind...\n\nWhere I'd like thing to go...now, that's a difficult question. To be quite frank, I am basically a rather mediocre player with not enough game experience to really have a valid in-depth opinion. However, with that being said, it would be a great thing to have more...flexibility in your build.  \nWhat I mean with that is both your picked champion and your intended playstyle (which CA and what secondary traits to focus? Do I want to emphasize abilities or auto-attacks?), as well as the game situation (ally picks, enemy picks, enemy builds, who is ahead/behind) can play a role in your decision of what to build and when to build it. Basically, if there's a gold standard build, that GSB should be inferior (by a good margin) to a build optimized for a certain situation if one is in the situation the optimized build excels in. However, if one can't create this optimized situation, the GSB should be better, but not so much as to make the optimized build completely pointless.\n\nMaybe you could put where I'd like things to be as:  \nFlexibility, not for the sake of flexibility, but for the sake of being able to adapt according to your champion's and your team's needs.\n\nA personal example is {{champion:133}} for me - my favorite champion.  \nWith her, I have been in games where I build the standard build and had good success. And then there are other games, oftentimes with my buddies who like to bring a lot of damage, where I can afford to build more on the tanky side, with things like {{item:3156}}, {{item:3022}} or {{item:3143}} mixed in. Or go for splitpush/dueling duty, with {{item:3153}}, {{item:3078}}  and {{item:3142}} .
