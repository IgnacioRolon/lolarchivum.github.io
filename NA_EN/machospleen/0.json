I've had to dodge 3 games because of this problem. If I try to select a champion, itll say an error has occurred. Also sometimes when I exit after this problem, the client will re open on the main menu options in a frozen state. I've patched the client and everything but nothing seems to work. Any suggestions ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-03T00:56:15.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it kind of sounds like your League client might be damaged or corrupted somehow. Let's run a quick repair through your client options to make sure everything is working properly, and then after that's done turn on *low-spec mode* in client as well. Test those changes in a practice/custom match and let me know how it helped.","replies":[{"poster":"machospleen","date":"2017-07-03T06:46:22.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=dAEJYiEx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-03T00:56:15.817+0000)\n>\n> Hmmmm it kind of sounds like your League client might be damaged or corrupted somehow.

For more info check out this ticket: TICKET #30855945. Also I seem to be losing connection to chat right before this problem happens. I've tried reinstalling/hextech repair tool as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T20:18:48.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries!
