Now i get the game is meant for &quot;casual fun&quot; but tbh is this even allowed it&#039;s not the biggest hindrance but I have 2 choices either mute character volume, or just deal with this \ntype of BM which I&#039;d prefer the latter.\nEdit: So apparently this isn't bannable but if you can't beat em join em I'll be looking up how to do this as well considering it does seem fun and dives into the psychology of league","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-12-29T06:30:01.193+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot intentionally added Singed's laugh to his fling.
