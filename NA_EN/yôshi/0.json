There was 3 people who were premade on his team ganging up on him. They reported him and he&#039;s banned now which I think is honestly not fair or right. You guys have chat ban for a reason so why couldn&#039;t he have been chat banned? He spent like $300 on that account and a lot of time and one game he messes up he&#039;s perma banned? This is honestly ridiculous riot. I might just quit league because what is the point? Waste my time or money? Why can&#039;t you guys have the account suspension system back instead of insta perma ban. Why not warn the summoner not to do what that person did before they get a perma banned? So ridiculous man. This is not a hate message or anything. I'm just saying, maybe the perma ban thing can go a bit over board sometimes....","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-09T02:03:31.925+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> perma banned because he was being toxic in ONE game ever\n\nExtremely unlikely. Permabans are the last step in the [4-tier punishment system](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions); to get permabanned, you must A) be a negative player consistently across many games, get punished one step at a time, and continue the behavior up until that step or B) Be extremely toxic, using hate speech or making threats and the like.\n\nThat is for chat offenses, though. For gameplay offenses such as intentional feeding, MMR Boosting, account sharing, cheating and so on you will receive an account ban (14 or perma) and you only need to be caught once for each time you get punished.\n\n>  3 people who were premade on his team ganging up on him. They reported him\n\nReports don't work that way specifically so premades and mass reporting don't punish people unfairly. All reports do is flag the match for review; once a player receives too many reports across too few games their case full of all those reported matches will be reviewed. Premade reports *do not stack* and do not have more power to trigger a report than a single solo report can, and either way, if the person has done nothing wrong they will not be punished regardless of how many reports they recieved.\n\nIf you want to discuss the validity of the ban, I recommend your friend stop by and show us the contents of his reform card. If the punishment was done by the system for chat offenses he will have received 1-3 games of his own chat logs which contributed to the ban. If the punishment was manual or the reasons given were unclear, he can submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more information.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-09T02:02:41.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't get perma banned for one game unless it is really really bad. More likely he had already worked his way up a couple of punishment tiers and then did something that bumped him up an extra tier past the 14 day suspension. He may have also got additional chat logs in his email, if he didn't get it check his email. If you would like to contest the ban, submit a ticket.\n\nAlso, it doesn't matter how many people report you in a game, 3 reports in one game is treated as 1 game you were reported in, not 3 reports total.","replies":[{"poster":"Yôshi","date":"2016-10-09T02:09:54.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He never got a chat ban or a suspension or a warning.
