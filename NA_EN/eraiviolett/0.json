Ahri uses lots of blues in her spells while Eve is more associated with pink hues. Ahri's trails and Eve's lashers don't read too similarly.\n\nIf Classic Diana and Warden Sivir both exist in-game then Blood Moon Eve should hardly pose a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prestige Eve","date":"2018-02-28T18:31:03.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NineTailedMystic,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=7Yxi919X,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2018-02-26T22:20:07.605+0000)\n>\n> I just think it would be hard to differentiate between Classic Ahri and this Eve skin at a glance.

I do think though they look nothing alike but the mere similarity between inspirations, which is japanese clothing and folklore (that also has been used for Ionia and the Blood moon skins). Besides, I made different clothing designs for this concept some which look more like pre-rework Evelynn (check thumbnail #5) but people were way more inclined to 1, 3 and 6, which ended up being the design i'd follow through. Anywho, thanks for the feedback, next time I design something I'll try to make it stand out from existing designs as best I can.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkKatalyst","date":"2018-02-27T20:26:20.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's unavoidable for many reasons.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DWSCALNH","date":"2018-02-26T08:51:03.224+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is awesome!

Keep up the good work and let's hope that RIOT will see this post and they will change the Evelynn skin + the current one's hair is really bad in my opinion i don't like it at all. In the other hand, from your skin her hair is really really really nice i LOVE IT! <3 I think i don't have to say how awesome her clothes are... Her tattoos, her boots, her legs, her arms, just everything! And her spikes on the back (couldn;t find a better word).
