Mine usually takes 3 or 4 times as long, and periodically freezes my computer, so that I can't do anything during the update (like type this post - which has already frozen up on me twice). \n\nThe funny this is, my computer is better than my boyfriends! So mine SHOULD be faster - AND this ONLY happens on League. No other game, no other programs, no other updates or downloads or uploads. Nothing but League. \n\n\nThe differences in our specs are as follows: (We're in the same house, using the same internet, sitting 2 feet away from each other)\n\n**My Computer**\n-- Windows 10 64-bit\n-- Intel Core i7 Processor 4790K CPU @4GHz\n-- 16 GB RAM\n-- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970\n-- ~60 GB of space remaining on the hard drive where League is installed\n-- My PC can reboot in less than 30 seconds\n\n**My Boyfriend's Computer**\n-- Windows 7 64-bit\n-- Intel Celeron CPU  G540 @ 2.50GHz\n-- 8 GB RAM\n-- AMD Radeon HD 6800 \n-- ~ 50 GB of space remaining on the hard drive where League is installed\n-- His PC can reboot in about 2 minutes\n\nSo I started updating my League client 35 minutes ago - it just finished and this post took me about 15 minutes to write (but it should have only taken 5)\nI started my boyfriend's update about 10 minutes ago and his has finished.\n\nSo what's the deal? \nIs there some sort of compatibility issue with Windows 10 maybe? Anyone else experiencing this problem? Is there something I can do to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T16:18:49.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The patcher can take a few minutes to download and update files depending on a few factors like your network strength and even hardware.  For example,  the hard drive can be an important piece here in determining how fast it can write these files, so it's not so much how much space you have available.  As long as you aren't receiving any errors during the patcher, it's best to let it do its thing until it's done.  Otherwise, closing it out can cause the whole process to restart in addition to scanning files to check for any corruption.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
