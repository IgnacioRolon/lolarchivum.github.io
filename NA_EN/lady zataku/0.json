When it finally let me in and i got my items my team remade and it counted as a leaver for me and I lost 22lp. I feel its a bit unfair to lose lp for a technical issue beyond my control.... I don't expect anything for letting you guys know but I feel its fair to point out that can happen on the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T21:41:32.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While we can't adjust your LP, we can help you figure out why you got a bugsplat and take steps to prevent it in the future.
