After champion select my loading screen will never load and keeps telling two different things but never at the same time. It always say's my game has crashed to reconnect so I do, again loading screen still doesn't load then it will fail again and say you have no internet connection when i cleary do being i can use the internet to submit this. it is very very frustrating because i keep getting leave busters for something I have no control over and it dissapointing to both my friends and I. for the past two days i have been playing fine without any issue then today it patches for new champ roation and same issue happens again. All my compter software is up to date, I just recently defraged my disk, and yes I am the admin on my computer and yes i even right click to run as admin when this happens. someone please please please help.{{champion:91}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-04T22:13:03.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Serial Stabbist, \n\nI'm just wondering if you get a crash error or it just shuts down?
