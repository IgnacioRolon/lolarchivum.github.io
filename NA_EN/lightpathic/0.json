Open _My Documents_\n2.) On the left panel click _This Pc_\n3.) Click now on the main menu_ Local Disk C Drive _(That's where games usually auto install unless when you originally installed your league you moved it into a different drive in that case find that drive.)\n4.) Open the _Riot Games_ folder\n5.) Open _League of Legends_ folder\n6.) Scroll down until you locate the file called _LeagueClient_ this is where my fix works, if the symbol beside that file is an \"X\" or when you click on the file and \"Error\" pops up then this WILL help you. If not I'm not entirely sure.\n7.) **DELETE** the _LeagueClient_ file\n8.) In the same folder, a few files down click _lol.launcher_ and it should run the client.\n9.) From the client click on the [LAUNCH] button and voila!\n\nGoodluck!","replies":[{"poster":"shark dfd","date":"2018-01-15T23:31:40.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.

Typically the steps in our [**permission guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) can help with stuff like this, but it looks like you were able to find something else that worked for you!!","replies":[{"poster":"LightPathic","date":"2017-05-14T01:40:30.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I had tried all the previous fixes and this was the only thing that worked, I've had messages from 11 different people telling me the same thing that they tried the other fixes and this was the only working fix (I had this as a comment on another discussion and just decided to make my own)","replies":[]}]}]}
