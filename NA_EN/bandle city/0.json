However I've had multiple people chastise me for supposedly scripting now recently for how much I've been able to improve it in recent months. I shouldn't need to be worried about a ban just because multiple people are reporting me for this same thing should I? If it were just one or two people I wouldn't be so nervous but it's not. People are starting to cite my match history as proof of my supposed scripting but it's just not true...\n\nI'm willing to subject myself to some kind of spectated game or something if need be, it's just that I've sunk several hundred dollars into this game to unlock various skins and champions and I'd hate to lose out on that investment over some stupid false claims. Maybe I'm just paranoid but I always fear getting punished for crimes I've never committed, one of those irrational fears I guess.\n\nThank you in advance! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T21:29:35.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries!
