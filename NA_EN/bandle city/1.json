Why is this happening? Normally I can reconnect but this time I couldn't until the game was over at which point I was slammed with leaving penalties... All the while I was able to load web pages instantly, log into here to start writing this after doing a bunch of searching for solutions on Google and YouTube, and etc. There's not a chance in hell that it's my PC either, running a 4.0 Ghz CPU, a GTX 980 Ti, and 8 GB of RAM so why the hell is this such a consistent issue?\r\n\r\nI absolutely hate being punished for things that are not my fault or are out of control. It happens so randomly too. I can maybe play 2-3 games completely lag free but then the next however many games start rubber banding all over the place or just flat out disconnecting. I've tried reinstalling League but that didn't help. Does it have something to do with the fact I'm running Windows 10 or something for some dumb reason? Please tell me how I can fix this if anyone knows how; this is extremely frustrating and it's not fair to me and IT'S EVEN LESS FAIR TO MY TEAM MATES WHO ARE FORCED TO PLAY 4V5 WHILE I'M DC'D...\r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions that anyone can provide would be EXTREMELY appreciated and thank you in advance.\r\n\r\nI'm now off to submit a trouble ticket too. >.>","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-14T18:24:39.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your disconnections are caused by an unstable connection to the servers. Different servers/services are in different locations, therefore your connection to each will often take a different route. Because of this, it's possible to have a good connection to one server, yet not to another. \n\nDisconnections will negatively impact everyone in the match, even if the disconnection was not intentional. This is one of the reasons as to why the [Leaverbuster System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats all disconnections equally and penalties cannot be modified or removed. \n\nWhile there are a lot of reasons why your connection could be unstable, our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) addresses the most common solutions.
