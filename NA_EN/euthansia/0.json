The map feels extremely zoomed in, it doesn't seem like it responds well to my movements and I have just felt unable to get comfortable on either side of the map in any game mode. At first I wrote it off to maybe I'm just rusty, or \"first game of the day\" syndrome where you feel sluggish, but it's persisted the last couple of days and I've played a lot of games. I've encountered a couple other people who said they've been experiencing the same thing so is this something patch related? Furthermore is there anything I can adjust in my settings or something I can do? Please help, league just feels awful and sluggish to play right now!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-29T20:40:12.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really weird, can you grab a screenshot of this?

I've noticed that my mouse has started feeling really slippery the last couple of days, and it doesn't feel like I'm in as \"in control\" of my movement. Everything just feels sluggish and off, and it doesnt seem like the map responds well to my movements either. Gah this is driving me nuts, I've been happily playing with no issues for 3 years now and now this just pops out of the blue..I don't even dare play right now because in game just feels awful. I turned off mouse acceleration and messed around with sensitivities and pointer speeds to no avail. Any ideas? I'm at a loss.\nUsing a Perixx MX2000 mouse","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-01T16:31:04.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we can help get this figured out!
