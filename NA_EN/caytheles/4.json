Nothing negative to say about that.\n\nMy big beef is that I really hate convenient exceptions.   This reeks of that.  It's like when the skins team said that SSW Talon wasn't going to count as a new skin for the champ because it was a legacy, then changed their minds six months later because Rito.\n \n> The amount of effort put into a VGU and splash updates exceeds that of a single new skin tenfold. It's important to understand that all updates and new content requires resources.\n\nResources dedicated from a team wholly separated from the Skins department.  A skins department that has not worked on a new skin for that champ because of the possibility of a rework, mind you.\n\n>When Noxus Poppy got a splash update as well as a model update, I would've ventured to call it a new skin as well. Revamped from a jokey, goth looking Poppy to an actual Noxian rendition of everybody's favorite Demacian diplomat. Completely new feel IMO, and little to absolutely no players were feeling a loss/sacrifice with its change.\n\nProblem.  No one at Riot called the new Noxus Poppy a \"technically new skin,\" either, afaik.  \n\n>Is taking something nonsexistant/unappreciated and making it revamped and relevant not making it new essentially? \n\nWasn't that the purpose of the rework itself?  To take a champion with a ton of problems and make it relevant to the current game?  As far as I am concerned, that's the job of the champion update team.  The skins team's job is to make new skins for champs when they're eligible for one.\n \n> So this alleged \"Rito-speak\" aside, let's talk about common sense:\n> \n> • Taric is getting a rework, which requires tons of resources.\n\nOnce again, these are resources from a team (ChampUp) that is _separate_ from the skins department.  Riot is not a \"small\" company, but one that has over a thousand employees around the world.  There are dozens of teams within Riot, each with their own budgets and lists of available resources and personnel, that work on various aspects of the game.\n\nIn short, ChampUp's resources are not those of the Skins team.  This is not an excuse.\n \n> • Taric's rework has not been revealed yet. None of the community has a clear idea who he now is, what his design is, etc. \n\nNo argument there...\n \n> • SUBSEQUENTLY, nobody has a genuinely clear idea what kind of new skin they'd want on him. Maybe some rough concepts, but Riot likely wants to see what the community thinks before they start working on a certain skin.\n\nOr, they could just come up with something, like they normally do.  Some good skin ideas have sprung from the community but most are just the skins team saying \"we thought this was a good idea, so here you go.\"\n\nOf course, they could also be tracking how \"popular\" (how many players are buying RP to purchase the reworked Taric) before starting work on a new skin, like any good corporation does.\n \n> • Literally all of that aside, it should be given that a new skin won't be out for a while for Taric. You don't need to ask a Rioter to know that. We just got one for Sion, and that one has been in development for a while IIRC. But for now, a rework should suffice.\n\nInfernal Nasus will just have to be the lone exception, lol.  (Announced minutes after the puppy's rework).\n\n> TL;DR, Taric fans should already know they're not getting a brand new skin upon rework release as per the reworks of Poppy, Sion, Shen, so forth. . .\n\nAnd I think it sucks that Taric's fans are going to have to wait another year and a half (if Sion is any indication) before a real new skin is released.  If Taric's rework is released in late April 2016, that means his first actual new skin will be out by late October 2017 for a wait of over 6 years.  To be blunt, that's just unacceptable.  Especially from a company that claims to be for their players (a mission statement they've not been living up to in recent years, imodo).","replies":[{"poster":"Warner624","date":"2016-03-31T21:46:32.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that last bit is indisputably unfortunate and a bit, well, excessive.

Patch 6.8 (the expected release of Taric's rework and the \"new\" Emerald skin) should be out by mid to late April 2016, all things going well.  \n\nIf Taric players have to wait 18 months for a new skin (see Sion), that would be a release date of October 2017, or six years, two months and a few weeks and days.  That would suck major Teemos for Taric fans, much less Yorick fans (like myself) who haven't seen any love from Riot since launch.\n\nNote:  Reav3 says that Riot wants to get new skins for reworked champs faster released faster, but I'll judge them on their actions and not their words.  :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheKennedyCurse","date":"2016-03-31T18:01:34.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will \"Fifth Age\" Taric be getting any love?
