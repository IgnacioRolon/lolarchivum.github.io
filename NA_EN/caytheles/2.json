In his splash art you see him fighting Multiple Undead. \n\nPassive: (Light Slinger) After every ability, lucians next AA is a double shot. Each ability Will trigger a different form of this passive.\n\nQ: (Piercing Light) Active, The same...\n\nPassive, Lucian fires a weaker round of Piercing light from each gun. (id say about 25% of the original Piercing light damage, making this 50% if you hit the same target Twice)\n\nW: (Ardent Blaze) Active, The same... Original passive, the same...\n\nPassive, Marked Targets temprature increases, Lucian can now shoot Two Heat seeking bullets at the target if it is in 800 range (or something like that.... This ability is somewhat Hard to hit with minions in the way and the Star shape) the damage would be like two normal autos, just the range is increased. \n\nE: (Relentless Pursuit) Active: The same. and this would keep your original passive of just a double shot since it helps with your ultimate.\n\nR: (The culling) Lucian Unleashes a torrent of Shots from his weapons Hitting All enemies Within 8 Teemos (or 10 idk) away from him slowing them for 1 second each time a bullet hits the unit. Enemy champions hit are all marked, Lucian can use (Relentless Pursuit) During the ultimate, While lucian is mid dash he fires 8/9/10 shots Quickly at the nearest Marked target. (abit of burst for out bully) \n\nI am sorry if i did a really bad job with my Explanation. i think these would make Lucian very unique. Also the damage from his passive do not proc on hit Effects such as Lifesteal other than Relentless Pursuits. \n\nBut yeah. i feel like this would give Lucian a better feel being the only Dual wielding Marksman (correct me if i am wrong). Most of his appearances (His Login theme and the PROJECT: Overdrive) show him shooting barrages of bullets at single and multiple enemies  so i wanted to include that.\n\nOP?..... now that i look at it..kinda. but i hope anything helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Boss Naut","date":"2015-09-29T14:32:30.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you're trying to turn lucian into yasuo 2.0 with better range? wasnt he fine as graves 2.0? his winrate may be down but i believe that's because he's a champ with a fairly high skill floor. i have a friend that plays a lot of lucian and his winrate with him is nowhere near low. i think if they do change lucian at all it doesn't really need to be the functionality of his kit, but rather with ease of learning him.","replies":[{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-09-29T15:06:12.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont understand how my changes would make him close to Yasuo, but im sure you have your reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Boss Naut","date":"2015-09-29T15:16:49.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the yasuo 2.0 comment is more along the lines of an overloaded kit with extra bells and whistles he doesn't need to function, making him frustrating to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-09-29T15:22:13.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remember that with the Updates, many other champions would also have somewhat of an Overload in kits, For Example the Juggernauts. i tried to make it so it would add some Persona to Lucian and his guns, but not to the point of giving him a heal if he were to throw Sennas gun like a boomerang procing on hit effects dealing % Max health true dmg and applying bleed.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Boss Naut","date":"2015-09-29T15:35:12.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have to question if you understand the identity of lucian as a marksman to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-09-29T15:37:36.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you got the Obvious joke...","replies":[{"poster":"Final Boss Naut","date":"2015-09-29T15:46:18.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i ignored the joke because even if what they did to darius made him a pain in the ass, it fit thematically with WHO darius is, but you want to change the way lucian's passive exists, and overload his ulti in a weird way. how does that do anything healthy for Lucian's identity? now he does More AoE dmg, More single target Dmg, Has Kog range, and all of that on top of what already was a had to be nerfed time and time again kit. lucian may be low but thats only because the meta has shifted with juggernauts to be less early burst adc \"IE lucian/graves\" and riot being **slightly** overzealous with nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-09-29T15:51:57.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hitting someone with the pointy sharpy part of an axe magically healing your wounds is exactly what Darius is. \n\n(Sarcasm aside) I just put some recommendations that i think will give lucian the identity of his past fighting the undead.

Marksmen need the synergy of one damage type in their kit unless their specialty is dealing mixed damage (Kog'maw, Ezreal).\n\nUnlike Make it Rain, Rocket Jump, or .90 Caliber Net, Ardent Blaze does not have any crowd control attached to it. It is also Lucian's main form of poke early, and a good source of mid game team fighting power, so it should be strong in the mid game with a good AD scaling and physical damage. \n\nAnd no, the idea that it could make Lucian's mid game too strong isn't a problem.

Adjust the time Lightslinger is up then he has to act quickly as he would lose stacks if he doesn't act quick enough. To be clear the stacks wouldn't drop off 3, 2,1 but instead immediately drop to zero.  This makes it so the player has to constantly thinking about when/where/how to weave his abilities into his AA. \n\nThis pushes his \"gunslinger fantasy\" into overdrive. \n\nAlso consider making him able to move while casting W","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talith PA","date":"2015-09-29T13:32:09.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm hoping the answer is \"we have to look at all of them because we are removing the RNG portion from critical hits and that's kind of a big deal for marksmen\".\n\nYou can even change critical hit to something marksmen abilities potentially scale off of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2015-09-29T12:41:54.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you tell us anything about Draven?\n\nA LOT has happened since he was first released, and much of it hasn't made it any easier for him.\n\nDraven's core gameplay is about juggling axes, but a number of champions that have been released since, has found odd ways to make that even harder, Braum/Yasuo wall disrupt the axes, while Tahm Kench's 'friendly' save and Bard's ulti prevent him from keeping the axes spinning.\n\nDraven only have 6 sec to do any of 3 things in order to keep the axes spinning.\n\n* Hit something.\n* Catch an Axe\n* Activate his Q again\n\nRecently you added a QoL announcement change, and an 'apparent' buff, which in actuality is more of a noob trap than anything else.\n\nI wrote a pretty big thread on why it was poorly implemented [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/VyAQaJwG-riot-lets-talk-about-the-draven-change), but that isn't really the topic.\n\nWith the current meta changes that used to favor assassins, to cinderhulk, to devourer to runeglaive, back to devourer, Draven is in an even worse spot seeing as the current meta favors bruisers who can walk or jump up in his face before he can react.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AceNova","date":"2015-10-05T02:27:12.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, So lucian. . . I have alot of thoughts on other ADCs and bringing them out of the dark ages. But I think that bringing changing Lucian to benefit more form the  Spell> Passive> Spell> Passive.  play is probably the most reasonable and compelling way to fix him. He is currently capable of it but its done more as a \"do when you can\" than a obligated  part of his mechanic. I think that increasing the Cool Down on his abilities so that missing one is a weakness similar to like if lux misses a skill , or blitz misses pull. would Grant a weakness that would allow the balance team to give him strength else where without making him pick or ban.  Lucian is one of the best crowd pleaser ADC, he is mobile, he is flashy, he is fun.  So letting his impact plays feel more impactful, as well as creating those moments to show the diffence between a good lucian and greatones. in alot of ways ADC in general lack that feel to me especially as a spectator for LCS and now Worlds.. Like Lee Sin, Leblanc, Thresh, etc etc all have these dynamic kits that you can tell when someone has put the time to master the champion. And i wish ADC as a role, the champions had more depth to create that kinda feeling. And honestly Lucian is probably the best place to start. Because he is loved, and fun.  Just my thoughts. Going back to something Morello said onces \"ball of stats\" is currently how all the best ADCs feel atm. and the ADCs without those extra steriods seem to just fayde into the darkness.. \n\n\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"iWicinna","date":"2015-10-03T13:44:47.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a huge fan of Lucian but he seems to have lost what makes him strong at the moment.\n\nI would suggest that you change his E to allow him to store 2 charges, much the same way that Corki can store up to 7 charges of his ultimate. Each charge would build up with the current cooldown timer on his E.\n\nI understand there may be some aversion to this idea because of the memories of 4.12 Lucian dashing all over the place and killing everyone.\n\nHowever, since then several things have changed with Lucian's kit to make this more viable. His E cooldown has been increased, and more importantly mana costs were added back to his E, making it so that early game Lucian can't abuse this movement without going OOM and thus limiting his effectiveness. Also, Lucian's damage was nerfed pretty much across the board.\n\nHaving 2 charges of E would allow Lucian to play more like a mobile AD assassin. Dash in, combo dmg, dash out. Additionally, he could use a double dash for chasing or escapes. \n\n\nBefore we talk about how potentially OP this change could be I would like to point out several champions who have more mobility than this change would give Lucian.\n\nFirst is Yasuo. He can dash through an entire minion wave at will and this doesn't seem to be an issue to the balance team.\n\nSecond is Kalista. She has a dash on every auto attack or Q. Also doesn't seem to be an issue.\n\nThird is Tristana. Can jump endlessly on assist or kills. Doesn't seem to be a problem.\n\nTL;DR Allow Lucian to store up to 2 charges of E.
