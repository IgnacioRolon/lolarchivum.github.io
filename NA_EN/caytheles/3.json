We are here to Support hence the name.\n\nExcept there's a niche for everything. What do you pick for a support when your top laner is Malphite, jungle is Pantheon, mid is Yasuo and ADC is Jinx? You go straight AP because tankiness is covered, and AD is more than covered. You make up for lost utility by forcing the enemy team to build MR or get punished by you, while still keeping yourself relevant in a supporting role through the AP scalings of your utility spells. If nothing else, Frost Queen's Claim supports this wonderfully.\n\nA support's role outside of vision is not simply to CC, it's to fill the gaps that your team lacks. If that means CC, pick Leona or Nautilus. If it's engage potential, pick Thresh or Blitzcrank. If it's sheer tankiness, pick Tahm or Braum. If that means disengage and safety, pick Janna or Janna. If that means AP, pick Annie or Sona. They all have CC, they all also excel at different things. Annie and Sona just happen to excel at melting faces. A carrying support is a support who succeeds at any of those things, when and where appropriate.\n\nRemember that in the end whether or not the support gets the kill (which a skilled AP support is supposed to be able to avoid), more damage leads to faster kills which is also a very valid way of supporting. Let's assume I happen to snatch an early kill as Sona after a bad trade in which my ADC died. If i get a bit of AP with what i have i can perhaps bully away the enemy ADC and/or support, thus allowing my own ADC to farm more safely and helping him carry better, later. Supports having damage is not, and never was a bad thing and i don't understand why people think so.\n\nThe real issue with supports having damage is that if they steamroll some way or another, they may begin to think their role shifts from supporting to primary damage dealer, which is false, but that's a player mentality mistake, not necessarily a role one.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-10-07T23:51:08.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually Frost Queens Claim works really badly with AP scalings given how little AP it gives for how much gold it costs...\nIf you want AP/Damage you are better of building other items (and just sitting on {{item:3303}})\nHowever the utility of the active can be good but usually isn't considered good enough when compared to other options\n\nif you consider that you will always have {{item:3303}} \nThen here is what you get and what you pay for upgrading {{item:3303}} into {{item:3092}} \nYou pay 1835 gold\nyou get 25% mana regen, 45 AP, 10% CDR, 5 extra gold and damage on proc (once every 10 seconds or 15 extra damage in a fight with max stacks)\nAnd the active\n\nfor almost the same amount of gold you could have instead have gotten {{item:3108}} {{item:1052}} {{item:3114}} which will give you 50 AP and 50% mana regen and 10% CDR also for only 435 more gold you will have {{item:3165}} \nWhich will give you 80AP, 100% mana regen, 20% CDR and the Grevious wounds passive\nwhich is obviously better stat wise compared to {{item:3092}} + {{item:1052}}  (65 AP, 25% mana regen, 10% CDR)","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2015-10-08T01:42:56.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Champion Skin,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=veKTEKVn,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-07T23:51:08.035+0000)\n>\n> Actually Frost Queens Claim works really badly with AP scalings given how little AP it gives for how much gold it costs...\n> If you want AP/Damage you are better of building other items (and just sitting on {{item:3303}})\n> However the utility of the active can be good but usually isn't considered good enough when compared to other options\n> \n> if you consider that you will always have {{item:3303}} \n> Then here is what you get and what you pay for upgrading {{item:3303}} into {{item:3092}} \n> You pay 1835 gold\n> you get 25% mana regen, 45 AP, 10% CDR, 5 extra gold and damage on proc (once every 10 seconds or 15 extra damage in a fight with max stacks)\n> And the active\n> \n> for almost the same amount of gold you could have instead have gotten {{item:3108}} {{item:1052}} {{item:3114}} which will give you 50 AP and 50% mana regen and 10% CDR also for only 435 more gold you will have {{item:3165}} \n> Which will give you 80AP, 100% mana regen, 20% CDR and the Grevious wounds passive\n> which is obviously better stat wise compared to {{item:3092}} + {{item:1052}}  (65 AP, 25% mana regen, 10% CDR)\n\nI rather disagree with you, as you forget to calculate the gold income in the cost. Every time you gain gold with it, it's basically it's price going down. By the end of a 40-50 minutes game where i'm not feeding, usually the cost of Frost Queen's Claim becomes 0, and it's cost becomes pure profit. I say that for an item that costs potentially 0 gold, Frost Queen's Claim is plenty powerful enough. (But feel free to buff it anytime you want!)\n\nYou also forget that by upgrading the item to it's max rank you can now kill minions without being punished, meaning that while you still shouldn't farm, at least last hitting a minion accidentally while poking won't cripple your item income. And excuse me, but DOUBLING the gold generation of the item seems very much worth the upgrade into Frostfang to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-10-08T05:50:45.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Compared to {{item:3303}} (after all nobody is saying spell thief is bad... if anything it is too good) the upgrade to {{item:3092}}  gives +5 gold each time the passive is proced which can happen at most once every 10 seconds\nSo for the upgrade from {{item:3303}}  to {{item:3092}}  to pay for itself (1835 gold)\nthe game would have to last 1835gold/5 gold per proc = 367 procs\nIf you stand and hit an enemy champion/tower all game long then it will take 367procs * 10 seconds recharge time = 3670 seconds or 61min and 10 seconds\n(after you have bought frostfang which gives the increased gold)\n(Also keep in mind that is 61min without going more then 30 seconds of hitting an enemy champion/tower... which will pretty much never ever happen so it will take even longer then that)\n\n{{item:3098}} and {{item:3092}}  doesn't really give much more gold compared to {{item:3303}} ... so upgrading it for the \"extra\" gold is pointless and it is much better to just save the gold and just sit on {{item:3303}}  until you run out of inventory space/slots","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-10-07T23:35:24.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no\nIf you can proc it is probably the best... however frostfang and frost queen isn't all that great so upgrading it is usually a bad idea\n(and eventually Targon line will give the most gold as the gold value of minions increase as the game goes on.... however usually in game later on it is impossible to use the stacks so that's only in theory)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-10-07T10:49:38.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you can consistently use the stacks, yes.\n\nHowever, being near an enemy has... inherent risks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-10-07T01:55:57.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"What Gino said, however the item is abused quite alot... the other two items cant really be abused.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-10-07T03:38:11.772+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Caytheles,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=veKTEKVn,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-07T01:32:14.201+0000)\n>\n> Any chance this unneeded &quot;support&quot; item is going to be removed? or at least changed so that Burst/Lategame mages wont be able to abuse it like they do now?\n\nNow when the hell did mages buy a gp10 item?
