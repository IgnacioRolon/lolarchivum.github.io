From all of the evidence we have, it seems pretty likely that they are going to be wielding a Darkin.\n\nLike, every providence gets a Darkin, and the only one we don't have is from Demacia... also the Shadow Isles.\n\nKayle and Morgana are from Demacia.\n\nThe Darkin are allegorical to the horsemen of the apocalypse, and I don't think there is a better pair of champions to better represent the scales of justice and famine than Kayle and Morgana.\n\nThey are Ascended, and the only things with Ascended power is the Sun Disk, and the Darkin, so, either Azir is giving out power to whomever, or they got a hold of a Darkin.\n\nThe amount of hoops you would have to jump through for Kayle and Morgana to not be Darkin is a bit nuts.","replies":[{"poster":"gerbe","date":"2018-08-12T22:11:37.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"their teaser looks like they’re going to be from targon or associated with it after the rework. that teaser doesn’t have a hint of darkin in it. there are only three darkin right now and they all originally came from shurima because of the new lore right? kayle is also unworthy of ascension, that’s what aatrox says","replies":[{"poster":"SSmotzer","date":"2018-08-12T22:26:20.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=imgrabe,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FAm7hvA8,comment-id=000300000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-12T22:11:37.267+0000)\n>\n> their teaser looks like they’re going to be from targon or associated with it after the rework. that teaser doesn’t have a hint of darkin in it.\n\nNope, They aren't from Targon, or at least are closer related to Demacia than they are to Targon. I mean, Taric was an awol Demacian soldier who let his brothers in arms die, and then redeemed himself by climbing Targon. He is labeled as a Targon champion, and not a Demacian champion.\n\n>there are only three darkin right now and they all originally came from shurima because of the new lore right?\n\nThe Darkin themselves, yes, but Kayle and Morgana are not Darkin, they are wielding Darkin. Like how Kayn is a Noxian child soldier who was sent on a suicide mission to Ionia, but killed everyone he came across until he met Zed. Now he wants to take over Ionia, burn Noxus to the ground, and usurp Zed as the master of shadows. Him wielding a Darkin is actually irrelevant to his story or his goals. \n\nThe wielders of Aatrox raged wars in the Freljords, and slaughtered Tryndamere's people, and Varus is wielded by Ionian lovers, Valmer and Kai, who were ambushed by Noxian soldiers and risked their lives to stay together by giving themselves to Varus.\n\nSo, none of the wielders of Darkin are from Shurima, or have anything to do with Shurima.\n\n> kayle is also unworthy of ascension, that’s what aatrox says\n\nKayle is not worthy of the Ascended power she is using, because she didn't go through the ritual, and she wasn't honored by Shurima.","replies":[{"poster":"gerbe","date":"2018-08-12T22:28:56.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kayle and morgana are not wielding darkin weapons. they don’t even look like darkin weapons","replies":[{"poster":"SSmotzer","date":"2018-08-12T22:47:27.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=imgrabe,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FAm7hvA8,comment-id=00030000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-12T22:28:56.571+0000)\n>\n> kayle and morgana are not wielding darkin weapons. they don’t even look like darkin weapons\n\nShadow Assassin Kayn doesn't look like he is wielding a Darkin.

Don&#x27;t expect Zoe&#x27;s prophecies to come to pass anytime soon.\n\nBut the whole World Rune thing Riot made the map for, also shows that the world is about to end.\n\nWhich story was that in? The last thing in the lore we see from Taliyah and Sivir is that they were running from Shurima, as it was being attacked by Xerath, who was looking for Sivir. Then the showdown between Xerath, Azir, and Nasus was the in game Ascension event, where everyone fought Xerath.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"gerbe","date":"2018-08-12T22:17:55.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how are they going to make kayle a darkin if they want to focus her rework on making her a melee/ranged hybrid and then a ranged powerhouse late game. darkin are supposed to be bound to one weapon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-08-13T03:37:51.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think morgana is nearly guaranteed to either be a baccai or a darkin.

Like, it could use a face loft to something more... exciting.\n\nZoe has multiple lines about how the world is all going to change, very soon. On a cosmic level.\n\nThe reason why they are making all of the lore make sense is so every champion will be, in canon, affected by the \"Twilight of the Gods.\"\n\nThe Darkin and Sol are all about killing the gods, and we got most of that lore in the past year. The map is the perfect way to show exactly what is going on with every champion, during the apocalypse.\n\nRiot's player base is declining, and this is probably Riot's way of giving LoL a shot in the arm. Darkin kick off their plan, Sivir comes in and we have an event where she stops the Darkin or helps them, probably along with her relaunch. Either way, Summoner's Rift will be replaced by something more lore friendly.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-08-13T04:06:16.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it won't, not in the short term at least.

Then the Void and the Shadow Isles are each preparing to do something big, not to mention Lissandra is still on the verge of freezing the world in ice.\n\nLiterally every force that wants to destroy the world is primed to do so.\n\n> 3.- What she talks about is void rifts and such.

Like there is no crowned queen of the Freljord yet, despite being able to do so in any match between any of the potential queens. But an even like the Ascended game mode is lore. If Riot did a major lore event, where it actually decides the fate of the Freljord, between Ashe, Lissandra, and Sejuanni, then that would be canon. If there was a game mode where the teams fought over the remaining world rune, and destroyed Summoner's Rift in doing so, that would be a canon event.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-08-13T16:47:33.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll clarify some misconseptions on your end.\n\nThe vision Ryze has on his video us him recalling the Rune Wars, not a premonition.\n\nRiot can take as long as they want with the Lore, because they haven't established a time line for many of the events that you are describing, so they can put for example Miss Fortunes arc way before the arrival of A Sol and such.

Talking about summoners rift, there is even less chance of it being changed, not only because of the amount of work that would have to be put into it, but also because summoners rift is detached from lore and Riot has said so themselves (minions, towers, champions behaving differently,all exemplify this point)\n\nOh and lastly in game events aren't \"lore\" Rather lore is usually released during events, and Riot has strayed away from doing this because so many different parts have to work together and it makes the whole process slow","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-08-12T23:51:10.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right in the Champion Roadmap it says they are coming in 2019.
