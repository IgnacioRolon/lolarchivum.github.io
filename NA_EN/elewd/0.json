This means whatever you picked first will get swapped first, but that doesn't always line up with the visuals or the actual clicks a player is making (you click the second one, but the first one swaps and you're like \"wut\"). \n\nI'd like to do more work on this aspect of selection in the future, either making it easier to tell what's happening or by switching up how it works, but honestly I think we have a buncha other work that's more important to tackle first.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-11-30T18:26:32.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I hate the FIFO system for the secondary runes. Even though I know it, I still mess up my runes here and there, especially when time is tight (like when you get a ARAM swap 20 seconds before champ select ends, and you are playing on a potatoe).\n\nWould much appreciate a \"change what you click\" system.\n\nWouldn't this actually be a low hanging fruit to stop fustration? Or is it not as low hanging as I thought it would be?","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-11-30T19:41:27.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To answer your Q: \n\nIt's not quite as low hanging as you might think. Even if it were easy to change (and I actually could not say that without talking to a programmer tbh) any logic changes (as in, changes *how* the thing works) are actually particularly risky. I say \"risky\" because they have a tendency to create the worst bugs, even if those bugs don't occur very often (see: the bug in this topic, which is most likely a bug in the logic). \n\nSo even if it was quick/low effort to actually MAKE the change, if there's a bug on an \"edge case\" (ex: this bug only happens in champ select if you're on a Mac and you created a new page from the editing screen or something like that) it can basically bork the whole thing for someone. With a project like Runes, which touches so many parts of the client & game, the ramifications of something fucking up in the logic can actually be pretty bad - the secondary doesn't work right so now your page is bad so now you end up with Resolve even though you were making a custom Malz page, etc. It's like a really shitty waterfall if one bit is even a little bit wonky. \n\nOn the other hand, something like a visual change (ex: this button is red now) is actually a pretty safe change. If that fucks up it's like, yeah, the button is blue and we'll fix that bug but it's not wrecking your whole day. \n\n**TL;DR** We often assess \"risk\" when looking at changes to see how badly something could mess up for a player as well as how easy it is to change the thing. Logic changes are particularly risky, so they require a lot of checking and double checking even if the code change itself is relatively quick or easy. \n\nThus, I would wanna dedicate real time & effort to making sure the fix would be significantly better to use than what we have now AND we had rigorous testing to catch edge cases if we changed the secondary selection. That's why I have this particular bit on my personal \"let's take a good, long look at this in the future\" list. :) \n\nThis answer is a small essay now, but it's actually one of the things I always wondered about before coming to work in software/games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-12-02T01:28:42.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found a lead today on the Grasp preset bug (idk if you guys solved it already).\n\nIf you finish selecting your primary path and then leave one rune spinning after selecting your two secondaries and saving, it won't default to Grasp the next game.\n\nI've got at least an 8/10 repro rate on this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-11-30T20:25:13.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never been clear on what functionality people are exactly asking for here, as the first in-first out thing seems most intuitive to me.\n\nHow does the system know which of your existing two runes you want to change otherwise?

That results in a two click system at best if you only want to change one, and ups it to 4 clicks if you want to change both secondary runes.\n\nIf it only changes your most recently changed secondary rune, how would you ever change the first rune?\n\n(The first in first out thing doesn't apply if you're picking a second rune from the same 'drawer' since that's not a valid choice so of course it'll change the rune already in that 'drawer' instead of trying to put two from the same row, but I'm not sure what people are looking for in general.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2017-12-01T17:05:35.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a bit late sorry been working, I honestly dont know how often it happens, im a one trick zyra player who rarely dabbles anywhere else so i normally have my runepage setup but when i dont have it setup or im playing a different champion it almost always resets on me.
