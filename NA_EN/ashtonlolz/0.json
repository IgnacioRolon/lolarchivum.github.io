All tho the person I was being toxic to was more toxic than me. He told everyone to report me for being bad at the game and also got the whole team to intentionally feed ONLY me. It doesn’t make any sense that I get a ban when they were also In the wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-02T21:26:23.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As long as you've done nothing to contribute to a negative experience, you don't need to worry about others threatening to report you.  They're causing others a bad experience just by doing that and distracting from the match, so don't let negative players take you down with them!  Mute and report are always the best option.  \n\nWhen you get a chance review your reform card, because the suspension was a result of telling others to kill themselves and using homophobic slurs.

Also idk what “%%%” meant I was just saying it ;(. But is there anything I can do to get unbanned instead of waiting because I have no other games.","replies":[]}]}]}
