Each game you enter, it's against you. That's how all games are, it's either you put the team on your back or lose. Even if some games aren't like that, that's how you should think.\n\nThe issue is riot doesn't balance around bad players. I'm looking at your match history. I see that one game you popped off with diana but a 42 min game with only 165cs? You got 20 kills so i imagine you secured kills. Looking at the rest of the match history you never broke even 200cs and a good portion of your games are running into the 40 min mark. and some of your rune choices aren't very optimal either why do you run 6ap seals? If you're against an ap mid go health if you're against an ad mid go armor seals. If you want extra juice then go per level ap glyphs but never sacrifice your defensive seals for laning.\n\nThe issue isn't these meta champions you're complaining about, it's you my dude. You need to work to improve your cs, your item build choices, your rune choices and even possibly your masteries. Do you read masteries? Sometimes I won't go off a build i read but will switch them up depending on the lane im against or if i know that I am better than the other person. Always look at your own skill level, league is a game about knowledge and how you improve a set of skills to close games out anre based on your kdas, item builds, mastery choices, runes, cs (especially cs) you aren't good. Ultimately it's all game knowledge. shit even kills isn't important in league. point of the game is to push lanes to take turrets then inhibs to eventually reach nexus.
