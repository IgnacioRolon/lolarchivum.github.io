Let's try resetting your input file that stores your League display resolution and give it a quick reset. \n\nFirst, **log into the League Client** then navigate to your config folder, which should be found in the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, hop into a custom match alone to see if the reset went through and if your display looks normal again. Let me know if this helped!","replies":[]}]}
