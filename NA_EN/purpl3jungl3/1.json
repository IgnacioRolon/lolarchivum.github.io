Your network might also be having an issue specifically holding a strong connection to the patching servers.  It's really important that you leave it alone unless you run into any errors.  Continuously restarting it can run into corruption or other patchiing issues.  Once finished, you can run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune things up.
