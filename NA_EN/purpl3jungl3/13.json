Less than a minute later, twitch (for some odd reason) decides to go back alone to the red buff that got invaded (btw minions havent spawned yet); UNEXPECTEDLY the enemy team were still there (wow, who would have guessed).\r\n\r\nSo laning starts, twitch doesnt get a leash, Flames Kayle, Kayle flames back. I manage to poke the enemy blitz &amp; jinx down to half health. ofc minions have barely just spawned &amp; MF gets hooked &amp; deleted. Comes back to lane, gets deleted a few more times. then, we manage to kill blitz, and attack jinx till she was at 10 hp &amp; flashed out. She started to recall under tower, MF went back and refused to engage, so I placed down a plant &amp; Q&#039;d. The plant kills Jinx. MF gets annoyed and flames at twitch for not ganking. Kayle jumps in and flames twitch, ofc twitch flames back. Lux, our mid laner was carrying but started flaming out of nowhere. ofc we lose n yah.\r\n\r\nbasically this is what some of us nice bronzies have to face every day. its prolly hardest on the supp since she cant do much except get the ADC to carry...","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-04T08:49:56.051+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra carries harder than most, if not all, Adcs.\n\nThat just comes down to a toxic team with a bronze mentality","replies":[{"poster":"Purpl3Jungl3","date":"2017-02-04T09:43:13.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok but i was playing with the mentality of being a good support and getting my adc fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-04T18:39:08.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That depends no the support you're playing. \n\nThat mentality is also bad in bronze, depending on others is a no no at that stage.\n\n\nIf you pick something like zyra/vel/brand/(insert damage carry here)...You want to carry.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xilixer","date":"2017-02-04T10:05:05.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bronze here this never happens to me i just want to clarify. most  times we lose just cuz someone just made a bad play. it happens. although if i wanted to climb faster id kinda start sticking with my main instead of trying to be good at multiple champs.","replies":[]}]}
