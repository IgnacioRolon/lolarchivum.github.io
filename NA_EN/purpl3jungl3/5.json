This feature can allow you to set bandwidth per client (device) and/or set bandwidth per site/service.\n\nOther than that, you can try to play during times when others aren't using the network so heavily or try upgrading your Internet plan to accommodate all the bandwidth being used. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waltenwalt","date":"2017-01-09T05:41:52.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way I can think of is in the router settings. If you are able to access the admin settings to your router you can set specific programs for the router to prioritize in terms of the bandwidth stream. \n\nAt least that is the case with my Linksys router.","replies":[]}]}
