(I personally dont like it but I dont have a problem with it on the likes of rumble and victor and can even play victor rather well (last time i played him anyway like a year and a half ago)) but tahliyas w is not even remotely simular to victors *E*?? and rumbles ult. Its far more precise and its very very hard to judge where the ability is even going to go off with the indicator. Also the old W allowed you to wait as long as .5 seconds to decide where you were going to actually direct the enemy which actually allowed for you to completely change the outcome of that one ability. IE one time I was getting ganked and after I pressed the w to cast the ability I noticed and instead of thowing the enemy midlaner through my mine field I threw her away and evaded the gank. where as the direction is already locked in with vector casting. Also vector casting in essense adds like .25 seconds to the actual ability because of the added cast time taken to *draw a line* and on such a small ability like tahliyas w this change results in you casting the ability but the enemy randomly changed directions and narrowly dodged it when it would have hit had it casted instantly like it used to. \n\nCan all these things be worked around and adapted too? yes, funtionally tahliyah is still a champion that has the potential to be good. I just dont enjoy playing her at all after the changes because she feels very clunky to me. I want riot to implement a change where the player can change the W cast to either double click *as it used to be* or vector cast as it is on live (specifically since every person who picked her up and loved her before the change *who I have seen or talked to* really hate her after) If they changed her back I would go back to having her as my favorite midlane mage no matter how weak she is. As well as funtioning the same as live if they just remove the lockout on her w, so in essence you cast w-e-w to throw someone through the minefield if you so choose. \n\nTLDR I dont like vector casting and I miss tahliyah because i just don't enjoy her anymore. Vector casting is not a bad thing but I feel like it makes tahliyah's w less precise due to the casting indicator, i also think she feels clunky with the changes. Riot could cater to both people who really enjoyed tahliyah by enabling both casting options *without the lockout as on release* and allowing the players to choose which option they want to play with. \n\nMy two cents, take it or leave it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-12-04T16:52:28.485+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"One, it's far easier to learn and braindead easy to do.\n\nTwo, it doesn't even fit the nature of Taliyah's W.\n\nThree, Taliyah's W timing is EXTREMELY CRITICAL. Vector casting FORCES an INHERENT human delay on it. It does not start until you let go after dragging. The time it takes to do that is MASSIVE. The old casting would start the 1s countdown IMMEDIATELY on first click.\n\nFour, it removes freedom of choice. Old casting meant you didn't have to pick a direction until the very last fraction of a second. New casting means you have to pick a direction and stick with it.\n\nFive, vertical knockup cannot be done anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2016-12-04T12:04:51.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just feels worse after you got used to the previous casting.

I didn't care about the numbers, they could buff or nerf her as they wanted but it was her playstyle and her unique casting type that drew me in.  Since they changed her w to vector cast I don't enjoy playing her at all.  It feels like the most unique aspect of her playstyle that I spent so much time learning was just swapped away for people who didn't feel like putting in the time to actually learn her.\n\nIf they ever decide to change her casting type back to the way it was on release, I will definitely be playing Tali as often as I can despite any number changes.  But I liked the max e land w playstyle, I enjoyed the risk/reward element to this playstyle and it made it fun and challenging to learn to play her and felt extremely rewarding when I could consistently land my combo after so many games learning to.  \n\nIt's really sad too because vector cast really isn't all that much of a difference, but for some reason this change just ruined my favourite champion released in so long, it basically removed the playstyle that I found enjoyable on her because of how clunky the vector cast is when cast after your e now.\n\nSaddest panda :'(","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2016-12-05T00:11:37.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah the max e and land W is what I did as well.
