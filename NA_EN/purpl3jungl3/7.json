I argued with him without being toxic but got a chat restriction lol. He called me an autistic retard whore feeder who is cancer at this game and should play bots, but no chat restriction for him!\r\n\r\nI ended up carrying too ;)","replies":[{"poster":"AngelKitten","date":"2016-11-02T20:41:05.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-02T20:58:15.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Of course, why shouldn't it be? Arguing with people achieves nothing, just STFU and play the damn game instead of being a keyboard warrior. Nor does saying shit to tilt people AFTER you won the game. At least saying shit during the match makes sense in a dickish way because you can potentially make your opponent play worse, but if the game is already over you get nothing out of kicking them while they're down. You're just making the game less enjoyable for people for no real reason, which means you're hurting Riot's business. Anyone with half a brain would try to curb that crap.","replies":[{"poster":"AngelKitten","date":"2016-11-02T21:08:27.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-02T21:13:14.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who's pissy? Stop projecting, sweetcheeks. There's no non-dickish way to say ggez to random strangers, sorry to break it to you.

I didn't call people dickish, I called their behavior dickish. Big difference. Are we in game? Last I checked, we aren't. So whatever I say here can't be unsportsmanlike by definition. Not to mention STFU and play is a general advice geared at keyboard warriors. Unless you're one of them, don't have a cow over it. Personally I couldn't care less about whether you say ggez or not, but if you think it's an acceptable thing to say to somebody who just lost a game you've got pretty warped views.","replies":[{"poster":"AngelKitten","date":"2016-11-03T20:37:27.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-03T21:34:50.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just because more toxic players aren't received swift enough punishment doesn't mean the lesser ones shouldn't be punished either. That's like saying robbers shouldn't be arrested until all murders are caught, it makes no sense. Should an account be penalized over poor sportsmaship? Yes they should. If saying ggez wasn't a big deal it wouldn't be so consistently reported and penalized in the first place, that's how the report system works. Saying ggez IS being a shit talking, flaming/intentionally trying to tilt people keyboard warrior, that's like the definition of it.
