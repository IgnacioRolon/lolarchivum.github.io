I waited a bit to make sure they werent gonna adc,  and if they were I was to change my role for the sake of the team. But they didn&#039;t say anything so I let them know im going adc and I locked in. After I locked in, he flamed and locked in ashe. anyways, no biggie cuz i dodged but it&#039;s so annoying ugh t.t","replies":[{"poster":"DestructoDave","date":"2016-12-30T05:24:44.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont evne care what role i get in blind pick. I just pick whatever and make it work. Its blind pick normals, after all. My main gripe with Blind pick is people literally ff at 20 every game. I mean even in losing Blind pick games I'm trying to screw around and do something, but nah lets ff at 20 immediately. Sucks on the winning side, too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LBmyBB","date":"2016-12-30T05:16:24.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There once was a queue called teambuilder.
