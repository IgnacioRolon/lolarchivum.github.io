Help Please!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nSo before preseason started I finally reached gold, which I'd been trying to do for quite some time. I later received all of the rewards in pre-season, and created a separate account to practice on before the next upcoming season starts. Today, I attempted to play a match on this account (which got to gold), and all of a sudden, my border was gone. I went into a normal match as well as a custom game match and it didn't show up. How come my border dissapeared? Any help would be appreciated, especially since I worked really hard to get that border. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T02:04:12.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like this account was showing possible signs of boosting which would disqualify someone from ranked rewards. I'd definitely hit up our agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see just exactly what went down and where to go from here though!","replies":[]}]}
