Correct me if I'm wrong though.\n*Edit* I also heard ya'll were establishing new servers, is this apart of the problem?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sky Shadow","date":"2014-10-10T22:43:12.480+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been a serious problem.\n\nIt's not my internet or on my end for sure. I've tested everything while it has been going on and everything leads to it being server-sided.\n\nI can't say how everyone else is affected, but mine starts with a lag between going from champion select to the loading screen. After which, every 2-5 minutes in the game it continuously gives me the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" message and I cannot move or use skills, however, I can see things going on in the game just fine as if it's not lagging.\n\nFor example, I can see people moving correctly and using skills, warding, ect. Which when I have lagged in the past, it either continues the other players down their clicked path or stop moving period and you can't see them use skills or ward.\n\nThe other funny thing is that this issue only occurs for that specific game. Afterwards it doesn't persist and only affects 1 out of every 5-7 games or so. So it's very jumpy and why I think it may be a faulty server or something.","replies":[{"poster":"joelkira","date":"2014-10-26T01:50:55.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same damn things happened to me, but I DC about 4-8 times during the game, every 2 minutes... this just so annoying I'm wondering whether I should stop playing league of legends.\n\nLast time I lagged out, I smashed my mouse, because this just unfixable and piss me off sooooooooo much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MeagerPompnano","date":"2014-10-10T23:50:19.257+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah... I don't mean to be rude, but this is really dumb. It makes me feel like I, as a Mac user am not really appreciated as a player of the game. PC bugs get fixed relatively quickly, and I realize that one reason for that is b/c PCs are easier to meddle around with than Macs are, but thats not a cry good excuse for a game like League of Legends with such a large community. I can definitely attest to the fact that this bug has only been occurring as of Patch 4.17, and it has not really been improved in Patch 4.18, even though it was mentioned in the patch notes, and I have read a thread posted by a Riot Engineer who personally worked on fixing the bug, who explained very clearly what the bug was. But still, that is the only thing I have seen from Riot acknowledging this issue, and it have been almost three weeks since it first started happening. I don't even get Loss Prevented on games because Riot won't acknowledge this, and it happens often enough in one game to completely throw the game, even my team is really far ahead. I wouldn't even mind if Riot took another week or so to fully address the bug, as long as they acknowledged it and took measures to compensate for it. Maybe a notification in the patcher, or not raising my LeaveBuster level because I keep crashing, or preventing players from all reporting me because I disconnected six times over the course of a 35 minute game. So PLEASE, PLEASE do something about this, even just posting a link to a thread where we can all talk to the Riot Engineers. One thing that I actually think would be really cool would be  a livestream from the Riot Engineers, even just for an hour or so, to kinda see what they are doing to fix this, if anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JahGod","date":"2014-10-26T17:41:33.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been bugging out ever since 4.17 on a windows 8.

I've decided I'm just not going to play anymore until I hear good news from other mac users.\nI crash /every single game./ This has never happened before. It takes AT LEAST 7 tries to reconnect, and I'm likely to just crash again. So why bother playing?
