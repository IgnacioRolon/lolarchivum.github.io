EVERYONE GOT IT, THANK YOU. SOME PEOPLE JUST GOT TO THIS PHRASE AND UNDERSTOOD ONLY THAT AND DIDN'T GET THE PROBABILITY PART (~95%). THE MAIN CONCERN IS THE OTHER 5% OF GAMES WHERE SEVERE IMBALANCE IS GOING TO HAPPEN, AS WELL AS THE GAMES IN 3+1+1 vs 3+1+1 OR 4+1 vs 4+1 FORMAT. AND YES, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE 5% EXACTLY, BUT COMMON SENSE CAN TELL YOU THAT INSTEAD OF LONG WAITING TIME FOR PREMADES SOLO PLAYERS WILL BE USED TO FILL**\n\nWhy it is a bad idea in my opinion:\n\n **Increased toxicity.** Premades are usually in their own game, talking in skype or whatever other program they use and not giving a damn about other lanes (a valid point even for 2 people (for example, premade botlane)). In worst cases add the blame game and collective reports. There are already issues with duos (numerous threads over last years), and we are going to see even bigger premade groups now. Just look at what is happening in normal matches and you'll get the idea.\n\n **Balance issues.** Communication and team synergy is insanely powerful in this game. A 5-man ranked team can win against 5 random people even if these random players are a whole tier higher ranked, just because of team coordination, from pick-ban phase to actual gameplay. As there is no premade mmr penalty anymore, it's going to be a problem.\n\n**Climbing the ladder**. I'll put it as a separate point. It is said that premades will play vs premades in 95% games. It leaves us 5% chance of being matched against a 5-man group, which is almost as bad as 5 instalosses. And it is a 5% win rate drop. Almost everyone I see in solo queue has about 51% win rate which is absolutely normal and you climb slowly as your skill increases. If your win rate drops to 49%, you will fall slowly in ranks. And this time there is literally 0 chance for you to offset this by being WITH premade 5 teams (except if you make one). The \"only constant in the game is you\" argument is not valid in this case.\n\n**Social aspect**. Newly introduced bonuses for playing in groups should encourage people to play together. However, there are those who can't do that for some reasons. And there are those who can. This means that the number of groups should increase compared to the number of duos in this season by the number of those motivated by bonuses, and playing solo will probably feel unrewarding or even punishing, since you don't get all those chests or whatever it is.\n\n**Trolling**.  4-man premades /ff-ing when you are in your promo (because it's fun). Reporting the whole premade is not going to be effective and will probably be counted as report spamming.\n\n**Elo boosting**. Never was as easy. Now it will be absolutely legal to pick a person and boost him on his own account. 4 masters/challengers will have no problems up to plat or even low diamond, being able to 4v5 enemy team (even if it is also a premade).\n\n\n\nNow, what are possible solutions?\n\n**Make a dynamic group queue**. 2-3 and 5-man(still don't see the point of 5s) groups are matched together. This way solo queue will be strictly solo and we'll have an intermediate mode with semi-organized teams. The downside of this is longer queue times (but premades are going to wait for other premades anyway, so not much longer?).\n\n**A checkbox to agree to be matched with premades**. Imo, not going to happen, but why not? Technically it will be the same queue, but this time with an additional parameter.\n\n**Just leave things as they are (with or without duo q)**. Simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Osbeorn","date":"2015-11-04T00:00:39.036+0000","up_votes":76,"down_votes":9,"body":"I hate the idea as well, I already dislike duo premades in my solo queue games, and now I might end up with 4 premades that gang up on me in chat.. not exactly my definition of fun.

I'm sorry, but I'm not risking my rank to have to deal with anything more than a duo. Already I say there are 2 kinds of duos: THe ninja duo and the loud duo. \n\nThe loud duo is the one that instantly makes it known that they are duoing with X and typcially want bot or is calling their role as well. From personal experience this duo is the most likely to be toxic especially as a duo.\n\nThe ninja duo is the kind of duo I play as. We don't call ourselves as a duo. We might be adc/support mains, but we simply call our roles without making it obvious that we are duoing. Personally I refuse to play with people that must make it known that we are duoing and then call bot for us. I always back pedal on it and say I'll fill.  This kind of duo I've seen tends to be less toxic or more likely that 1 of the players will be toxic. \n\nNone of this has any affect on the actual skill of the duo because thats irrelevant. Expand these situations out to multiple people and we start to hit big issues. \n\nI hope this doesn't go through because I've already cut my time drastically between a new job and league just not having the same fun factor I felt when I started and this might just push me over to dropping the game almost completely (with the amount of $$$ i've dropped i'll probably never fully leave).

AND YES, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE 5% EXACTLY, BUT COMMON SENSE CAN TELL YOU THAT INSTEAD OF LONG WAITING TIME FOR PREMADES SOLO PLAYERS WILL BE USED TO FILL**\n> \n> Why it is a bad idea in my opinion:\n> \n>  **Increased toxicity.** Premades are usually in their own game, talking in skype or whatever other program they use and not giving a damn about other lanes (a valid point even for 2 people (for example, premade botlane)). In worst cases add the blame game and collective reports. There are already issues with duos (numerous threads over last years), and we are going to see even bigger premade groups now. Just look at what is happening in normal matches and you'll get the idea.\n> \n>  **Balance issues.** Communication and team synergy is insanely powerful in this game. A 5-man ranked team can win against 5 random people even if these random players are a whole tier higher ranked, just because of team coordination, from pick-ban phase to actual gameplay. As there is no premade mmr penalty anymore, it's going to be a problem.\n> \n> **Climbing the ladder**. I'll put it as a separate point. It is said that premades will play vs premades in 95% games. It leaves us 5% chance of being matched against a 5-man group, which is almost as bad as 5 instalosses. And it is a 5% win rate drop. Almost everyone I see in solo queue has about 51% win rate which is absolutely normal and you climb slowly as your skill increases. If your win rate drops to 49%, you will fall slowly in ranks. And this time there is literally 0 chance for you to offset this by being WITH premade 5 teams (except if you make one). The \"only constant in the game is you\" argument is not valid in this case.\n> \n> **Social aspect**. Newly introduced bonuses for playing in groups should encourage people to play together. However, there are those who can't do that for some reasons. And there are those who can. This means that the number of groups should increase compared to the number of duos in this season by the number of those motivated by bonuses, and playing solo will probably feel unrewarding or even punishing, since you don't get all those chests or whatever it is.\n> \n> **Trolling**.  4-man premades /ff-ing when you are in your promo (because it's fun). Reporting the whole premade is not going to be effective and will probably be counted as report spamming.\n> \n> **Elo boosting**. Never was as easy. Now it will be absolutely legal to pick a person and boost him on his own account. 4 masters/challengers will have no problems up to plat or even low diamond, being able to 4v5 enemy team (even if it is also a premade).\n> \n> \n> \n> Now, what are possible solutions?\n> \n> **Make a dynamic group queue**. 2-3 and 5-man(still don't see the point of 5s) groups are matched together. This way solo queue will be strictly solo and we'll have an intermediate mode with semi-organized teams. The downside of this is longer queue times (but premades are going to wait for other premades anyway, so not much longer?).\n> \n> **A checkbox to agree to be matched with premades**. Imo, not going to happen, but why not? Technically it will be the same queue, but this time with an additional parameter.\n> \n> **Just leave things as they are (with or without duo q)**. Simple.\n\n\n\nHey there - This is some good feedback! It's informative and well constructed.\n\nI play most of my games as a solo - I don't like the hassle of finding other people to play with and I don't like the idea of playing harder opponents and being EXPECTED to use skype to cover the gap. That's my personal opinion, and it's a very healthy source of debate for me as one of the primary Visual Designers on player behavior / social play teams.\n\nHowever, that being said, I still agree with our mission:\n\nPlaying with other people is almost always a better experience for players. I can debate whether it's worth the time and effort or worth the penalties, but playing with buddies is many times less toxic and always more coordinated. It doesn't have to be playing with your best buddies - it could just be people you've elected to play with (like someone from the game you just won). Self selection is powerful, and it shapes how you feel about a game. We're removing systematic barriers that would otherwise stop players from playing in self selected groups. \n\nI know I've played some duo games where there's another person with a great attitude and a killer jungle route that I'd love to have in another game, but I can't - I'm capped at Duo or I have to go for full-on premade 5. This extra person is a sort of \"lone wolf\" that doesn't play with other people, and under the current system, that possible connection or \"fun game #2\" will never happen - in fact it's systematically forbidden and even kinda taboo. It's almost \"rude\" to send out blind friend requests or blind invitations to people, which is the opposite of what we want.\n\nMost of the time in a multiplayer game, your first experience with grouping is by joining a functioning group already in progress. In the current system, you cannot really utter the time-honored phrase, \"Can I join your group?\" in ranked. It's actually kinda silly when you think about it. I don't wanna oversell it, but this dynamic premade business is a serious SOCIAL step forward, and it's important that we monitor it and proceed carefully. Right now, I can't know how many duo's would have liked to add me to their group, so I just queue right up for another solo game.\n\nI understand that it feels like there's going to be pressure to find and play with friends just to keep up or maintain, but I think the opposite will happen - I think as a solo, you'll be slightly more open to group experiences and \"Hey man, wanna join our group?\" stories. Those experiences are almost impossible now outside of IRL friends - You would need to have two \"outgoing lone wolves\" who both decide to group (and that's super rare.)\n\nFor the people who simply don't like to group (me), the new system is still beneficial: you'll feel more empowered to stand your ground and play what you set out to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Niaphim","date":"2015-11-04T22:12:24.205+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for answering, Ryedan!\nI like how you are on the same boat as many of us and that you've explained your point of view.\n\nToday I tried to summarize the discussion in a concise form and came up with this:\n\n**This new system indeed largely increases social interactions in the game, but also it opens path to both positive and negative experience as a result of such interactions.\nSo this new queue can be totally fine if more attention is paid to improving the Report System efficiency (which was mentioned by Lyte), and Tribunal as well.

Indeed, I surely enjoy playing with my buddies, however due to the skill disparity those games are not competitive nor balanced. And yes, playing with buddies is more coordinated... which brings us to the question that how is it even remotely fair to randomly assemble teams with variable coordination and communication from the get-go and send them into the yoloQ?  \n\nWhy all of the sudden you people want to turn Ranked into the imbalanced mess of Normal games where buddies of variable group sizes are creating havoc _(skill disparity)_? \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Ryedan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4jKU71cH,comment-id=007d,timestamp=2015-11-04T21:53:51.551+0000)\n>\n> It's actually kinda silly when you think about it.

All you are doing is skewing the balance of the Ranked ladder by introducing more randomness and groups with various coordination/synergy/communication differences that will either make or break the whole team and screw the actual solo player over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lotus Blade","date":"2015-11-04T01:54:50.026+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"this ruins the thing we all love and hate, \"solo Q\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-11-03T23:46:07.249+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"That's obviously a terrible idea.
