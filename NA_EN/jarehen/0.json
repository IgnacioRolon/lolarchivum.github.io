I have recently found League of Legends to be lack luster and not fun to play. There has been no way for their to be true custom matches where the players can edit things however they wish and there are lots of other things as well that could be improved. I mean LoL is falling far, far behind now. \r\nAnyhow, I decided to play LoL today and then it said in my game that I was playing against bots and so I thought that was the case. I then found out in the tail end of the game that it was real players. Upon finding this out I realized I would have played differently if I had known this. Honestly, I think that if things like this are funny to Riot Games. I will never play a game by Riot again. I do not find this funny and I do not want this to be how my games are messed with. Blizzard makes Reinhardt do some weird phrases for April Fools. This is not a good April Fools joke. If Riot, you think that this is funny, you will probably lose lots of players from things like this. So in the future at least put it down somewhere that it is an April Fools joke for all to see. Like put it in the AllChat or something. I am honestly not going to play another game of LoL now for several months or more because of this. So I am sorry that you think this is funny, but I am not playing anymore","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-03T06:20:13.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's *amazingly* funny to see how many people fell for this. \n\nRiot even did their best to warn you without giving it away \"Leaver Buster is still active, so don't AFK. They learn from human behavior so play like you normally would.\" Etc.\n\nSorry, if you don't enjoy it I have a hard time imagining you liking *any* April Fool's joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-04-03T06:52:45.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's...

Then there's players like you who took it seriously for nothing. At least you'll get a free icon from it. So there's that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuronii Lumiira","date":"2017-04-03T06:15:58.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bye. \n\nDon't let the door hit you on the ass on your way out.","replies":[]}]}
