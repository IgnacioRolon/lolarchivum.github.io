One of the new breed of juggernauts, she's a slow but impactful solo laner in any game, with tentacles that offer huge zone control once they worm their way into a game.","url":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-reveal-illaoi-kraken-priestess","image":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/5.20.1/img/champion/Blitzcrank.png"},"up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:161}} Title is self-explanatory.","replies":[{"poster":"KrunchyPudd1ng","date":"2015-11-19T02:34:52.502+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"(This is my first post btw) Hey! I love league of legends and I have a ton of great ideas I'd love to share with you! (even if I'm bronze 1) I actually had an idea similar to omega Squad teemo called \"Operation Teemo\" with similar recalls and exact same look! (I drew it in school on a piece of paper, and it looked EXACTLY like the splash art!) anyways, here's some ideas: Pool Party Illaoi! She had braids and sunglasses, her idol thing that she holds is a coconut with a straw (like pool party lee sin's q) and her tentacles are palm trees. Her q is a surfboard slam and her e makes the shadow look like water. Maybe her ult would make the ground inbetween the palm trees sand? idk. one more idea, Atlantean Vel'koz! He looks like an octopus, and his q is a bubble that bursts. when the rift in his w exposes, it's like a coral reef underneath the rift. his e would be a burst of water underneath the target, and his ult would be a jet stream of water! Thanks for reading this, if you did rito! I really appreciate it and hope to post more!","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-11T00:04:43.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We thought it was a pretty good idea, too! ;D She's hitting PBE now!","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-11-11T00:07:08.187+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not a \"Spaghetti\" skin?
