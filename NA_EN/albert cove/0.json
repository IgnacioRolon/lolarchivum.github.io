Since you didn't actually own Karma at the time, the skin was still placed in your hextech loot. \n\nAfter getting that skin in your loot though, it looks like you then turned around and used Sun Goddess Karma, Defender Leona, and Pirate Ryze to reroll again and got Temple Jax.","replies":[{"poster":"Albert Cove","date":"2017-09-25T07:54:07.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay!
