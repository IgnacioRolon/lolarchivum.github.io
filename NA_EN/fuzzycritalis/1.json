Had to reinstall my league everytime a new update came out, because the launcher simply bugsplattet whenever I tried to start it.\r\nNow I´ve reinstalled it (once again) and now after getting it to download everything i try to create a custom to see if it works. League simply shuts down and now this error msg keeps appearing whenever I try to open it.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me? Or does anyone have similar issues`?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-01T15:10:24.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm thinking your PC security settings or antivirus may be off and blocking your game files from installing properly with each update.
