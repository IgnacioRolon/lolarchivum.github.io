Now I found a kind of solution I'm running it on my external harddrive, which makes the game more laggy, but hey at least i can run it at all, now my fps started to drop from 120 to 20 - 15 since the newest patch, so i thought i could give it another try, it's still bugsplatting (I mean i copied the same folder from my external harddrive to my D drive?)\r\n\r\ny maybe anyone has any ideas why or what could be causing the problems!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-08T19:47:05.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running on an external drive can cause issues and continuous reinstall because the game is intended to be saved to your primary internal drive.
