The goal was to make him less of a pain to play against, the result was he became a bruiser not an assassin.\n\nLeblanc: The rework was designed to emphasize her thematic, fix her lane phase and make her a more reliable assassin. The result was she CCed people for 6 seconds straight, played more as a kite mage and her wave clear was absurdly strong on release, resulting in a nerf and making her near unplayable.\n\nKatarina: The idea here was to Emphasize her thematic, make her have more obvious skill expression and lower her burst window. These were all accomplished, she still stayed an assassin, she just got better at it, her waveclear is better as well making roaming on her easier and her burst window is reasonably longer but not to long like Leblanc's was or Rengar's was. \n\nBasically if a rework changes a champion in a way that doesn't accomplish what it was meant to, this applies to Mini-Reworks only, it get's reverted or changed a little bit to put the champion back where their supposed to be. In addition if the mini-rework ends up causing a champion to be absurdly strong, first it gets nerfed, buffed, then nerfed again, maybe another buff but eventually get's reverted in favor a more easy to balance itteration(see Kog'Maw).","replies":[{"poster":"Infinite Saught","date":"2018-06-12T21:34:29.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"From a kit standpoint, Katarina stopped being considered an Assassin by Riot internally after she was updated.

How dare I?\n\nThe reason I am posting here is that I understand why she was reworked and know that the reworked did exactly what it was supposed to.\nRiot wanted to add counterplay to her \"press e q w r ignite\" kill combo by adding the daggers and her dagger-connected passive.\n\nThese daggers also helped with Kata's own waveclear.\nBefore she had a massive problem farming against ranges champions. If she walked up to waves to use her w, she got poked, before she could e out\nand otherwise she only had her Q.\nGetting pressured under your turret unless you somehow manage to abuse a enemy mistake and kill them is bad for an midlane assassin, since they are supposed to roam (Something riot lately helped out by reducing the waveclear of mages).\nNow she can use her daggers together with her passive to clear the minions with a massive chunk of damage and get out unscratched by using her Q to put a dagger close to the wave and using her w before blinking on the first dagger and return to the second.\n\nI believe riot also had the intention to give Kata a unique mechanic.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FridgesArePpl2","date":"2018-06-12T17:20:39.681+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why would anyone want Katarina reverted?

I've been playing Kat for as long as I can remember and have been playing the game for over 6 years. The new Kat is better in literally every way I can think of. She's never been more balanced and her new kit is perfect for her. The old katarina was the definition of a binary champion who had one goal, wait till cc was used and then press all your buttons. Katarina's current kit requires more skill and has more skill expression in it allowing for experienced Kat players to really show off how much time they've invested in playing her. Playing old Kat felt so bad and she almost never left the laning phase with a lead and she was so easily abused. Even now her laning isn't the greatest, but at least she has room to make plays and win the lane if the player is skilled enough. Reverting her would be a complete discgrace in my opinion and would only bring her back to a more unbalanced state. The only thing that could potentially be weaker about new kat is her burst window. But if Riot feels it could be made quicker then they could easily do so by making the dagger drop timing scale down with champion level so the daggers fall quicker and she can pick them up quicker the later the game goes. I personally think her new kit is better in every aspect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nevrankroaton","date":"2018-06-12T17:13:56.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"New katarina is far more interactive and strong than old katarina while living way better on her fantasy, she is always a matter of number and her kit is 'kinda' unique compared to other assassin.\n\nAlso leblanc revert is an aberration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-06-12T17:20:04.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"There is no chance she gets reverted lol","replies":[]}]}
