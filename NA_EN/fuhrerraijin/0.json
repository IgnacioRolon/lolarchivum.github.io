Especially gaming keyboards. Macros have been rather wide-spread for a while now; this feels like the equivalent of someone saying \"Use the click option of copy-and-paste rather than use ctrl c+v\". We're not talking about a cheat engine, map enhancer, or any kind of modding... this is really basic shortcut mechanics.

Using macros to combo spells, automatically call out objective timers, etc. will likely get you banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rkoturdo Ndo","date":"2016-05-16T16:32:48.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya\nThey are considered cheating since they give you an advantage over other players.
