After a fight, i died and killed the enemy Nami. That unlocked the next element for me. The problem is that i was able to select Nature element again even if i already had it.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, i tried it and it transformed me to the water form. The game considered it as a &quot;last form&quot; since i wasn&#039;t able to gain elemental power again.\r\n\r\nAnyone had this bug once ?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-19T20:17:03.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We gotchu - you'll have a fix for this in 7.13. <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2017-06-15T12:17:24.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already reported it, and Riot is aware.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/NU5Lh0Qj-gameplay-elementalist-lux-letting-you-choose-the-same-element-twice","replies":[{"poster":"Indiana Jhins","date":"2017-06-15T14:33:14.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, i didn't saw it.
