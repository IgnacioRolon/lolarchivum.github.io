Nobody is understanding that although it consumes both, it spends 0 mana while the full cost of the spell is returned along with the 8%. All other champs just get the spell refunded with the 8%. Yes, it does nothing when at full mana, but it gives Lissandra the unique ability to cast 3/4 abilities from almost 0 mana. \n\nLet's say I have 62 mana at level 6. I cast a Q and my mana increases to 185. I can then cast both E and R immediately. This is the cost (85) + 8% of my missing mana (38). If it worked the other way I would cast Q at 62 mana for free, then at most I can cast W which would be free and return (38) mana, allowing one more cast of an ability. At lower than 50 mana I couldn't cast anything immediately because manaflow does not allow a free spellcast, it allows for the cost of a regular cast to be refunded.\n\nI believe the current interaction is the best for Lissandra. Consuming both may feel a little weird at full mana, but this allows Lissandra's otherwise passive and especially high mana costs to be used in a way unique to the champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-11-10T13:18:57.316+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah there was a thread that was on this as well, it's fairly depressing that Riot saw fit to make lissandra's actual passive into a rune accessible to every single champ in the game. \n\nAnd not let her get any benefit outa stacking the two.","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2017-11-10T14:19:36.904+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly did not think of it this way, and now that you pointed it out, I'm pissed af.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-11-10T14:45:13.703+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well to be fair it's not surprising that it got through the PBE, they had a ton of stuff to go through.\n\nAnd hardly anyone actually plays Lissandra, i can only imagine it's much more so on the PBE itself too.\n\n\nBut it still seems so strange somehow, if the guys who made the rune in the first place didn't think about Lissandra at all (since it was obviously not tested by them) then does that mean that Riot themselves have forgotten the champion?\n\nI am a tad bit worried about the subject of how they go from creating ideas to implementing them and seemingly not testing them at all ,c","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2017-11-10T18:36:42.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't mention it, because I don't want to use the rune on her anyway.

So you need to cc someone for it to land, and if you do, that means you're close enough to them to use those additional 2 spells/autos to proc electrocute. And if you pick sorcery as secondary, then trancendence is also probably better, because Liss likes a lot of cdr.
