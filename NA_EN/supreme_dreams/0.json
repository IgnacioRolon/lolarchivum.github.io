Riot terms and services does not say that an account cannot be used on different computers which mine is due to the fact of my parents being divorced i have gotten much better at league and now am being punished for it i created the account i have the right to play it on diffrent pcs/labtops etc.\r\n2. This is a blatant move to stop orgnizations from making money that riot doesnt get a piece of example the removal of skin codes riot saw that websites making great sums of money were not benefiting them so they said nope. They saw that mmr boosting is just if not more profitable and if riot actually believes thar mmr boosting is hurting there game then there ranked system sucks if it works like you then those who got boosted will just go back to where thry belong seeing how they dont have the skills to stay there those who win agaisnt someone whos been boosted will do the same\r\n3. Riot please improve your ranked system so this stops happening( Cant comment on being stuck in elo because i havent personally experienced it but i know the problem exists)\r\n\r\nI love league of legends but seriously this is just stupid Riot is making a statement with this there saying no one can benefit from paying except riot which is fine but dont make up an excuse that you think its hurting your game when you your own company praise it mark my words next from riot is not coaching no help from outside source\r\nRiot employees if you read this please issue warnings sure its little extra work but i promise that people will stop but doing this but punishing them by not allowing them to recieve rewards for the current season defeats the purpose of playing the game now the ones who have been falsely accused cant get rewards therefore whats stopping everyone who you have punished for this to quit playing the game thats ridiculous. You wanna stop people from elo boosting look for the long distances","replies":[]}
