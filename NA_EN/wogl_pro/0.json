This is why PBE exists too, gives Riot time to get a closer look to glitches or bugs.\n\nBut aside from that, I only have Dragonblade so I don't know what to say :P plus I'm playing in ~280 ping so I don't bother on cancelling animations","replies":[]},{"poster":"stabby himiko","date":"2015-10-19T23:47:10.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally will use any.
