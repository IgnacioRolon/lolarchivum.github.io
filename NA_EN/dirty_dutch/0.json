Naturally I was very happy at this monumental skin that is stupendously rare to get.  However i quickly realized i got this skin on my account that i don't play as much due to its drastically smaller list of champions and skins.  I was wondering if there was a way for my to transfer this skin alone to my main account by any means.  I don't play Annie but with the skin, hell yeah i want to play Annie but on my main if i could.  I basically have a skin on a dead account that i only play ranked with some noob friends...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T18:33:45.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grabbing a Hextech Annie shard is an awesome find, congrats on that!  Currently, transferring content between accounts is not a feature.  I know that you might not play often on that account, but that shard might add some sentiment to turn it from a noob account to a great hextech one!  I wish you a fiery, good time playing Annie!","replies":[{"poster":"Dirty Dutch","date":"2016-07-23T01:38:23.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think in the future there might be such a feature?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-17T23:58:26.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, there is no way to transfer content between accounts. Riot has no system for this and does not grant requests to do so manually either.","replies":[]}]}
