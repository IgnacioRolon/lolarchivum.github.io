How would I do this? I have already saved the game but can't figure out how to send them a copy? Can I get some advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T04:58:56.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full games cannot be shared, but if you create a *highlight* by launching into the replay from your match history and record a highlight, you can share the file with your teammates and they can play it in any web browser. The highlight will be saved in the **League of Legends** folder inside *Documents*.\n\nLet me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"tschmech","date":"2016-11-16T14:27:34.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes sense. Is there any potential work on being able to share whole games with people? (i.e for coaching, team vod reviews, etc.). The replay system is fantastic, but since it is a newer feature I was hoping it would be capable for this kind of a thing. Montages and clips are great, but full game shares would be the icing on the cake.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T21:47:02.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of that being a currently planned feature, nor has any announcement mentioned it. You may want to make this suggestion in a post on the [Miscellaneous Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) for more visibility. It's possible a member of the team that worked on the Replays feature may see it there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
