Thus, you need a support item. Problem is deciding between upgrading the support item early so you can actually get money or buying an early Sightstone so you don&#039;t miss out on vision. Either one winds up with less of the other, you get less gold or you get less vision.\r\n\r\nSo I thought &quot;What if the sightstone didn&#039;t build out of a Ruby Crystal and instead built out of a lesser sightstone?&quot; With a much cheaper sightstone that only holds 1 or 2 charges, the support can finish upgrading their income item so they aren&#039;t way behind and still be able to ward. Later, they can finish the sightstone and be able to ward to the extent a support needs to.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m always building the &quot;Eyes&quot; as a support (Eye of the Equinox, Eye of the Oasis, Eye of the Watchers) so I can actually get the rest of my build, and as a result, I&#039;m missing out on actives that really help and the item active cdr passive from Ruby Sightstone.\r\n\r\nLet me know what your thoughts are.","replies":[{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-12-06T14:10:01.489+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally I'm not sure why they don't get rid of sightstone and give some support items interaction with the trinkets to increase recharge rate or max # charges.

It was an idea.  Not SPECIFICALLY the charges thing.  However, I was just trying to come up with an idea to help against one thing that I've never felt good about as a support (I'm a support main anyway).  Being behind in levels and gold can be frustrating, but to start the game, sinking 800g into a Sightstone never 'feels' good.  Which is partly why Support is stuck with it since if it felt good other roles would get it way more often, so the role who doesn't get money should just get it.  I'll admit that Vision and who does it is a hard problem.  Especially since Sightstone exists now and will probably continue to exist due to the playerbase rioting (heheheh..... bad joke) if they took it from us.  Vision is kind of locked in place with Sightstone.\n\nI understand the power of it and that's why I do it.  I'm not sure how they could modify the red trinket (or if another role could just pick it up instead) to make Sightstone more replaceable.   Who knows.  It looks like they're experimenting with other avenues of vision denial (I know {{item:3147}} is a situational thing and not always bought) so hopefully they'll look into making Sightstone feel more exciting to buy and less like paying your taxes. :)","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-12-06T15:13:00.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a Mid main, but whenever I've played Support getting a Sightstone first back has always felt comparable to getting a Needlessly Large Rod first back when Mid.
