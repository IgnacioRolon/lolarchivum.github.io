Tried writing bug report but that systems is so messed up that it's unread to actually report a bug there. Tried Re-patching like 7 times, now doing a full repair. Wrote a ticket to riot support a couple hours ago but they don't give a shit.\n\nTo clarify, you had the Windows cursor instead of League one amirite? no keyboard inputs work in game and mouse is useless too, have to ctrl+alt+del or alt+tab out to close the damn thing?\nThe launcher works fine, but the Game Client itself just went and fucked itself.\n\nGreat patch by Rito, in this patch we DON'T get to play the game {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \nGG\n\n\nEdit: Can confirm 'FULL REPAIR' repairs nothing. It's still unplayable. ","replies":[{"poster":"Manghi","date":"2018-02-07T18:00:27.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This same thing is happening to me right now as well.

Can't even submit bugs. Shows how much RIOT cares. I really need to find something else to play, cause RIOT is determined to bury league completely. With every year the game just gets worse and worse. Who cares if the game looks pretty, if the gameplay is messed up tank meta every year and everything fun is getting nerfed to favor tanks. There are a bunch of Tank games out already.... why do this to League...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akane","date":"2018-03-02T12:13:02.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually done with league of legends, I put a bug complaint but obviously they're not fucked to do anything about it, happened to me once in the middle of a match then happened again after that I just realised what was happening, now a low priority queues, should've listened to people when they said don't bother with league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WittyRaven","date":"2018-02-08T01:19:49.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/7WW3aT8x-mouse-and-keyboard-not-responding-in-match-after-new-patch-83","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinayion","date":"2018-02-07T23:19:26.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, sorry to hear this happened. I'm going to forward this to the relevant team to check out. We've identified an issue between our game and the Discord overlay, and working towards a fix.\n\nI can offer two potential workarounds:\n - Disable Discord overlay\n - Try enabling/disabling the overlay whilst you're in-game with the issue (default keybind is Shift+`, and you can verify this in Discord's settings under App Settings -> Overlay -> Toggle overlay lock)","replies":[]}]}
