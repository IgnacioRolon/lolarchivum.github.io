Look at the timeline of the game, tell me some things i could work on, or what I can do better to win games. This game demoted me into b5, which is sad. I've lost 17 of my games only winning 7, and 5 were provisional games.\r\n\r\nA little background to this game: My sona was late to game, entering at lvl 5, so I had to take blue and go mid immediately. I staved off zed, and together, sona and I killed him successfully. I ganked every now and then, but sona kept dying to him. I also noticed top lane pushing too aggressively and asked him to either ward more or stop pushing past river. He and sona continued to die. I helped top get a kill and i also helped bot lane too. Eventually we fought and we won out the fight. I tried to ask my team to help with mid turret, and they instead backed, wasting the opportunity. Eventually we got the turret and it looked good. We never got a dragon, we tried for baron, but my team took too long and i unsuccessfully smited it losing it to the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2015-02-25T00:44:04.156+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"get your smites and less deaths. for every death, look for why you died and how you could have prevented it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MigYalle","date":"2015-02-25T06:04:36.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Gameplay)\nOkay first, I was placed Bronze V, placement matches going 2-8 (Obviously 8 losses) My current score is 17 wins 16 losses a Jungle main, High win % Top. \n-Since this is a jungle one, I can help ya out here buddy. \n~Rek'Sai is a healthy jungler, good clear speeds/health with good mobility.  Nocturn has alright health, decent move speed and good clears. Due to this, you should have more gank potential. You started red side, Your path route should be Gromp-Wolves-Red (My route for Rek) with smitting gromp/red giving you great health. Right away jumping into a potential lane gank, Ending with red route your options are Top/mid, IF both are pushed, Secure scuttle(use your cc since your resourcless) and back to buy either a chilling smite or trail blazer. After this go for another clear but stay VERY aware if enemies look hostile, If your laner is getting pushed in and you think you can't fight the enemy, as long as your laner has mana and more then 30% health, you can get at least a 1 for 1, Nocturn beating you to a gank was extremely surprising. \n~Second, Zed killed sona. You have 2 options now, Help Sona at mid by killing Zed, or ignore Sona at mid and gank other lanes even more. But then later Zed kills Sona again and Again, at this point he snowballed the lane and it's too late for you to help. Your option is to help the other lanes now and hope Sona doesn't let her tower fall. \n~Then Teemo killed Morgana, and you were killed by Nocturn. Don't know what happened there. \n~Nocturn killed Renekton again. (go place a green or pink ward for Renekton so he can see the gank incoming and he wont feed any longer, or be ready with a counter gank by placing a tunnel in the bushes in his lane so you can ult in.)\n~ Now your mid, and top are both at a minimum of 0-2, Their lanes are lost, but a great gank at bottom will make bottom snowball hard, letting you get easy dragons. This is the point where you just ward around mid/top to prevent ganks during your clears in between camps since you have tunnels to help you travel faster you can use this time to ward. With your bot lane being relatively even, Keep them especially warded with the help of morg, If Nocturn reaches bot and wins that lane, the match is surely over. 14:00 in, Nocturn got Graves, and Graves got Trist. Only problem? Trist was already weaker than Graves, she was not only worth less gold, but Graves was still worth a good amount of gold, which Nocturn collected, So him being fed even more now. \n~After that 2 turrets fell, 1 to enemy champa nd 1 minions. If a lane is to die, DO NOT continue your jungle route, instead head to the lane and secure the cs, but don't push the wave, ONLY last hit (Don;t use your Q cause its AoE) WARNING! IN BRONZE YOUR TEAMMATE MAY PING TO YOU TO LEAVE BUT DONT LEAVE THE LANE UNTIL THEY SHOW UP, THIS IS CAUSE ALL THE MINION XP/GOLD WILL DISSAPEAR INSTEAD OF GOING TO SOMEONE, SO IT MAY AS WELL BE YOU, THIS BEING BECAUSE YOUR JUNGLE DOESNT DISSAPEAR. \n~Shortly after the enemy got dragon, you got shutdown gold on Zed to you, and nocturn to renekton. With this money you should now devote some gold to armor, not more damage. (Talking about that Mallet/Ravenous buddy. Ravenous is more then enough) What you needed was Ninja Tabi for Nocturn, and Tristana. +The armor protects you from 4/5, you don't need MR yet, despite Teemo being strong. (always finish boots 2nd if your behind, 34 minutes without complete boots is a terible idea.) \n~Your team was making a comeback 20:00 to 22:00, This was your chance, but I THINK you may have over stayed to try and take another turret (not sure, I didnt see gameplay) and your punishment was being killed by Tristana/Pantheon. Because this happened Tristana is now back in the game, She was shut down but the misplay here brought it back to a 5v4 (Your  Sona is almost non-existant unless she lands her ult) Tristana was their weakpoint, YOu could of warded around tristanas usual paths and when she was alone, catch her out and free gold, keeping her down and rising you up. \n\nAlmost anything after that is super hard to tell what's going on in the match. \nTL;DR(Gameplay) \n~Rek'Sai more mobile, you should of ganked more then Nocturn and gotten first blood.\n~Top getting camped, place a green/pink for him.\n~CS friendly laners CS when they die/go back because that experience is lost if not given to a champ, unlike minions, your jungle can wait.\n~When enemy laner is killed, push your teamamtes minions into their turret so they lose the xp\n~Sona fed Zed, since he can probably 2v1 now, Just tell her to not let him take tower and cs. Renekton is almost a lost cause, camp bot and they will carry.\n~Keep dragon timers/punish low health enemies at Dragon\n~This is bronze, go for the steal or bait the smite out of him, lots of people panic smite.\n~IF your making a comeback and taking towers, when one enemy respawns, it's the signal to just back off. \n ~Your cs count is low, which tells me you didn't cover lanes.\n~Finish your boots as 2nd items unless your super fed (Why not finish them at 34:00 still?)\n~You didn't need MR, 4/5 of them are AD with no apparent tank. \n~Frozen Mallet bad choice. WHen your health reaches bellow 15% pantheon automatically crits, But you have no armor so your health will drop quickly. Zeds passive also does 8% of Max health in Magic damage, So you buffed his passive. Frozen Mallet is used to slow enemies down, But if your dying instantly what's the point of slowing them down?\n~ You placed 7 wards, way too little for a 34 minute match, I usually go with a bare minimum of 10 placements of wards in a 30:00  which is not even close to what I actually need to place. (Here's an example of my placement match for B4, My warding is almost = to the supports, just 1 under and I don't buy sightstone. http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1738262275/213490818?tab=stats \n~No MR needed\nMASTERIES\n~9/21/0 Your a tank. Build like one. If you only have 9 points into damage, Don't go full Ad, There's 3 rekai i'm aware of in masteries.\n21/90/0 (AD, Killer, Bruiser) 9/21/0 (Tank, good cc in fights) 0/21/9 21/0/9 (Farming/Fast ganks.) \n\nThat's about all I got, Seeing a video would help A LOT more. Good luck and have fun summoner. \n*Note this is one of my low KDA matches, feel free to check my Ranked history and see how easy Bronze actually is. Feel free to add as well, I'll be available to talk/play with all day after 3pm eastern time 2/25/15 and 2/27/15*","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowOfCrimson","date":"2015-02-27T02:27:47.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks everyone for your suggestions and comments!

However, in your overview you talking a lot about what others were doing and less what you were doing, which makes it a little harder, anyway:\n\n>  hh the thinker: for every death, look for why you died and how you could have prevented it.\n\nThat's really good advice and i second it. \n\n\n* Def suggest (as an overall thing) upgrading your trinket asap to the double stealth wards. it's will increase your ward output TONS: it's almost like having a sightstone for 250 gold. (higher elo, i recommend sweeper for junglers.)\n\n* If you ever go support don't build like that teemo or Morgana and actually get a sightstone and upgraded GI item.\n\n* FOR Katarina, your first item should probs be an abyssal or hourglass depending on your match up. [This is an awesome Kat guide](http://www.lolking.net/guides/112279).\n\n* It looks like you're trying to build multiple items at once, and that's generally not the best idea because it puts you behind in your build.\n\n* Call for dragons. You can do them *way *earlier then people think, particularly with Rek'Sai (like the game you linked, drag wasn't taken for *15 min* which is insane to me). If your bot/mid lane has a good push before you get your jungle item call for drag. Once you get yr jungle item you can solo no prob. \n\nerr for overall ranked advice, i really suggest that after losing a game or two, you play norms or something until you win and/or feel confident with what your doing. a lot of bad losing streaks happen because people just* keep playing* after losing or doing badly.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-25T08:57:25.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only point of disagreement is the higher elo get sweeper, depending on your champ/lane (Riven one trick pony who almost always sticks to double ward trinket across all accounts) you can make a legit argument for it at any elo. For me it comes down to as Riven I want max items ASAP, and rarely would use my sweeper because i primarily split push so the trinket saves me even more than say mid who generally groups with team.
