Not a big deal.  But, I noticed that during a teamfight, she came from nowhere and destroyed out entire team without even knowing what happened (and yes, I get it.  It&#039;s Kat.)  But, something was off.  There was no audio at all.  I figured that maybe I just wasn&#039;t paying attention until my friend mentioned it to me.  I realized that there was an issue at that moment.  She was wearing the new Deathsworn skin, and we figured it was probably just a bug with that skin.  After the game we queued up for another game, and actually encountered _another_ Kat, this time with no skin.  Same exact thing happened, and it is driving me up the wall.  For someone who does that much damage and can be in the fray and in the middle of crazy teamfights, having the ult sound again would be great to have again.  Anyone else encounter this?  I don&#039;t play her, so I don&#039;t know if the player experiences this as well, but it&#039;s very off-putting.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-30T21:07:21.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!
