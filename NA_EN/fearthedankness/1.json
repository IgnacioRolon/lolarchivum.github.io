Is this statement true? If so please indicate this on his toolkit. Thank you.\r\nP.S. I am posting this in &quot;report a bug&quot; because if this is true it should be in his toolkit, and it is not.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-14T01:02:38.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trundle doesn't steal damage reduction.
