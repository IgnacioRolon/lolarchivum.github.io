These aren&rsquo;t canonical pieces, but instead conceptual reference stories meant to illustrate the personality of the champ and show thematics that we could express in their gameplay and art.\n\nCan you release these to the public, it would be a nice change to get some in depth information for us lore-lovers.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-06-28T03:40:30.983+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's very likely to happen. They would be the Narrative equivalent of concept art though so they wouldn't be canon or anything, and may be a little on the rough side here and there, but there are quite a few of us on Narrative and Champion who have liked the idea of showing some story sketches to you for a while.\n\nTL;DR: Keep an eye out.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-06-28T13:29:02.502+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay!
