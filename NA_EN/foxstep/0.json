If she hits a q once she can bully you easily out of lane. You either pick a long range mage or you are screwed. \r\nA champion with such a disgusting late game dps shouldnt be so strong early.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on cass?","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2016-11-30T01:05:55.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I understand, you like to use champions that make you the worst kind of person and are complaining about a counter to them.\nSounds legit.","replies":[{"poster":"Foxstep","date":"2016-11-30T01:25:45.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shuyin178,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1NTQE1iY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-30T01:05:55.082+0000)\n>\n> From what I understand, you like to use champions that make you the worst kind of person and are complaining about a counter to them.\n> Sounds legit.\n\nNah i only play nidalee.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2016-11-30T02:36:55.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't help your argument in the slightest.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Neko Caitlyn","date":"2016-11-30T02:35:40.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can name about 50 champions more annoying but okay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AquariusGine","date":"2016-12-02T02:20:32.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play nidalee, I'm a Cassiopeia main and nidalee is easy food","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-11-30T01:42:44.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, you're just playing an awful laning champion.
