(Hopefully this is the right board this time)","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"TL;DR I have complaints. Just leave if all you have to say is &quot;stop playing the game.&quot;\n\nI&#039;m not sure where to put this as I don&#039;t use forums ever. But I needed to get this off my chest, especially as someone who literally overcame a lifetime&#039;s worth of clinical depression as of 2 days ago.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/19194895\nI don&#039;t know if this is visible and if not I will send screenshots of it as I&#039;m not typing out this entire thing again, it&#039;s just too long and I&#039;m not even in the same mindset as when I was writing this post:\nhttp://puu.sh/l7d7V/47176965be.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/l7d9j/496f0633ef.png\n\nSay what you want about how I wrote this, I don&#039;t care anymore. I&#039;m following up with this nice man&#039;s suggestion and putting this out in the open for discussion. It pains me that one of my most favorite games ever is also one of my most hated all because of some silly, bad people who can&#039;t keep their mouth shut unless they don&#039;t have anything vitriolic and venomous to spit at people for the most absolute trivial reasons. The fact they represent the FACE and sometime seemingly the MAJORITY of this game&#039;s community just makes me actually cry internally. I&#039;m sick and tired of being blamed for literally anything in this game, whether it&#039;s absolutely ridiculous or actually right, because no one ever bothers to be civil to me about it. No one ever wants to treat me like a fucking human being and I hate it. I honestly wouldn&#039;t even mind if Riot just got rid of the entire chat system altogether and left pings in the game. Or even somehow replaced it with a voice only system, although that would probably be hard as fuck to implement so I&#039;m not expecting much.\n\nI want Riot to do something about this because as far as I can tell it doesn&#039;t seem like they are. They&#039;re making minor fixes and tinkering here and there, but aside from that nothing seems to be happening. I have no idea how responsive Riot is to player feedback when it&#039;s NOT related to the actual gameplay and all those fancy values and lines of code that they have to constantly tinker with, but it doesn&#039;t seem like they are. I also have never expected anyone to care about my problems or feelings in my life, as no one seems to ever bother responding to my complaints like this one right here. But that was a long time ago, and I&#039;ve sorted out those personal problems of mine, so let&#039;s just pretend I didn&#039;t even say that.\n\nIf anyone has a better idea than me, or if I could even get a response from a Riot employee, maybe even that hopelessly idealistic Riot Lyte or somebody of importance, that would be just wonderful. And if you&#039;re response to me is to stop playing the game, just leave. Go, I have no interest in discussing anything with you if that&#039;s all you have to offer me. Cause if I really hated the game that much, you think I&#039;d honestly keep playing it and enjoying it to this day?\n\nAny and all feedback to this post is greatly and highly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n(I apologize to the moderators as the first time I posted it only loaded the &quot;Help &amp; Support&quot; board as an option, which seemed fine to me at the time. Hopefully this one is the correct board to post to).","replies":[{"poster":"Teslablade","date":"2015-11-03T00:03:49.184+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of being more strict, with only third chances.

The fact is, most of the people who come to this board to complain about how they were banned? They don't understand why they were banned. They don't understand the concept of not being toxic. But, okay, let's say you are right. That's why the 14 day suspension is there. If you get to the 14 day suspension and just can't shape up, you're done.  \n\nYes, you've had some bad experiences.

It sucks, and Riot puts quite a lot of work into minimizing it, but it's a risk you take when dealing with randos.\n\nThe question we all face is, since it's impossible to entirely prevent due to the nature of solo-Q, what are you going to do about it? The way I see it, there's three options:\n\n1. Quit playing solo-Q - either don't play League, or only play with full pre-mades to avoid random jerks that want to do random jerk things.\n2. Blame Riot - piss, moan, and complain about how they aren't \"fixing\" what is an inherently unsolvable problem.\n3. Let it slide - report the jerks, and move on without giving them significant consideration, because they just aren't worth it.\n\nEvery player faces this question at some point, and every player has a different answer.

It's about feeling an instinctive need to prevent any further tarnishing of my character for up to potentially 9 people who have to be around me for sometimes 40 minutes to an hour. I do so knowing, even though I'm just fanning the flames, I'm a goddamn human being with emotions and I've already bottled up my feelings for fucking 20 years, for as long as I've been alive because people have told me you're better off saying nothing at all no matter what. This is getting personal, but it's kind of my point. Not everyone is emotionally \"fit,\" so to speak, to try and even bother meeting this pedestal of emotional neutrality. I barely am and I still just take shit from everybody because I find muting people does nothing for me and I want to be able to communicate regardless of the shit being flung at me.

Setting aside people with actual triggers, that I understand, just how are you going to call me the fucking jerk when my team has been the ones to claim and assert anything first while I've only been saying stuff related to the game? \"You are too squishy, \" is not an insult, jeez, I just want you to fall back because you literally don't have the defensive stats to just saunter on over to the enemy team and try and Pentakill them. Like goddamnit, the last game I played fucking amazed me that I actually wasn't allowed to take a game even REMOTELY seriously, even if it wasn't my intention to in the slightest, I just wanted to shot call, what the hell is wrong with that? Like the fact that I'm in the community's standard of \"wrong\" because I wanted our team to coordinate better in A FUCKING TEAMWORK-HEAVILY-REQUIRED-GAME because they all started to do their own fucking bullshit whenever they felt like it (PLEASE NOTE THAT I WAS NOT NEARLY THIS ANGRY AT THEM DURING THE GAME, I KEPT MY PATIENCE FOR AS LONG AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE) and then Miss Fucking Lux just says \"I can't fucking stand you, muted\" in response to me ASKING HER VERY POLITELY LIKE ACTUALLY TO STOP RUSHING IN AFTER I DIE TO CLEAN UP BECAUSE SHE JUST CAN'T.\n\nI.\nJUST.\nCANNOT STAND THESE PEOPLE.\n\nThey have ruined the game and everyone's standard expectations of people so much that people just assume I'm being some cocky asshole when all I want is everyone to fucking work together and accomplish the GAME'S GODDAMN OBJECTIVES.","replies":[]}]}]}
