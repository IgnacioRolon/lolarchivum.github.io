ALl of them get defensive about their &quot;waifu&quot; but it&#039;s like, dude, she isn&#039;t real, like back off lmao.\r\n\r\nShe honestly isn&#039;t even that high of a tier on waifu scale imo. She&#039;s unattractive, and eats peoples souls. Who want&#039;s that? Like she seems like she&#039;d go hang out with any dude that walks up to her, she isn&#039;t a loyal person, yet these people just HAVE to be SO into her for NO reason.\r\n\r\nidk man, these people need to get a grip on reality. Even if I was a weaboo, I&#039;d hate Ahri. She&#039;s gross, and is basic.","replies":[]}
