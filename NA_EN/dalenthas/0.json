Sandbox mode could be used to test out new champs before buying. (The same argument could be applied to skins, but I&#039;d understand if you&#039;d be more hesitant to allow that).\r\n* Ideally the mode can be used on any Map, just as any other Custom game.\r\n\r\nRiot obviously already has some for of sandboxing available, the Champion Spotlights always have minions in odd configurations standing still. \r\nObviously this would only be available as a Custom game, you couldn&#039;t exactly queue for a Sandbox game. This fact would reduce the burden of having an extra mode around, as queue times wouldn&#039;t be a problem and it wouldn&#039;t require any more server resources than custom games already do. I imagine maintenance costs would also be low, as there are no balance fixes you&#039;d ever need to implement and once all the bugs shake out the odds of finding a new one are low. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody else think this is a good idea?","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-04-01T15:54:48.304+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget changing cooldowns so you can practice gap closers over walls.","replies":[{"poster":"TroyBallParksSit","date":"2015-04-02T01:00:38.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sandbox would have two summoner spells...\nFlash - The Flash Distance is Doubled\nTeleport - Cooldown reduced to 10 seconds, Channel TIme to Teleport is reduced to 1 second","replies":[{"poster":"Soybean16","date":"2015-04-02T06:35:07.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem with flash distance is if you would be trying to figure out different walls or bushes and flaching over or between them to see what you could do in an actual game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PlayingOnATrain","date":"2015-04-01T20:25:40.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main thing should be NO NEED FOR INTERNET ACCESS. \n\nI would love to test things when I'm on the go.","replies":[{"poster":"Tea Mochi","date":"2015-04-02T18:41:59.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean when you're on the train?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FreshMeat707","date":"2015-04-02T18:05:44.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want a mode in League that plays like an RPG, you team up with players around the world and quest, farm, gain XP and upgrade skills and buy items in the store with champs that you have purchased, just like regular League, but instead of against each other it all kind of works like a HUGE jungle for a world. You can go out and farm on your own, but every time you take on a quest area it sets you in a queue of 5 players, just like regular matchmaking, and you all take on the boss together. I feel like it could help the community chill out and maybe even find teams and strategies for actual League matches, and maybe even have rude players chill out and trust their team members, and that could help win games if you're confident that your new friend have your back.\n\nI know for sure that if this became a thing, i would love it forever. There are SO MANY good games that **aren't** RPG's that **totally could be** an RPG, but the fact that it could work like that is a little unappreciated. I'm not saying to change it from a MOBA to an RPG, but just add a new perma-mode that could let us do that it we wished. League could be the first MOBA/RPG combination that already has millions of players, so i feel like this, the Sandbox mode that this thread is actually about (i don't hog the *whole* spotlight :P) and a few other good ones that would be totally awesome, like i saw somewhere in these comments that you make an offline version where you play against/with a team of bots, this could offer enjoying League from anywhere, as well as practice for future games.\n\nRiot, PLEASE notice all of these suggestions from YOUR community, there are too many GREAT ideas to have wasted potential. Riot, in my eyes you are already the coolest game producers for being so active with your fans, giving us awesome temporary gamemodes to surprise and entertain us, and responding to us ON YOUR OWN, NOT EMAIL-BOTS. To me you guys are the best, i want to see this game and your company blossom.
