I've been playing this game ever since 2011 so i can tell you from experience that I personally did not like how the game has shifted this much.  In my diamond ranked games, it feels like I can't pick any champion i want because you can get boned in the game for not picking decent teamfight champs sometimes if you didn't snowball the game or the enemy didn't make huge mistakes.

At least if I do this I'm learning something, and I'll probably even lose because of me- which is great. I'm tired of losing because I'm relying on my teammates.\n\nI have vastly more experience than the players I'm playing with and its either we destroy the other team, like stupid destroy, or its whoever has the better team comp. Which, welcome to low elo, most of these people don't even know what a teamcomp is, and the kicker is that even if they did, they don't reliably play enough different champions to build one.\n\n\nI'm tired of losing because of other people. I know what the responses will be, its a team game, blah blah. Well, its soloq, we are not all on coms and we have never played with each other before. This means its very much NOT like a team game, except for the fact that we're all on the same team with roles.\n\nSomeone mentioned in the comments below that the only way to carry is to have a vast skill disparity. Hes right, and if there is a vast skill disparity- then matchmaking isn't matching very well. Clearly. There are no excuses anymore, players can now pick their lanes, we know where players are going. A bronze3 top should always be facing a bronze3 top, a plat5 midlaner should always be against another plat5 midlaner. I don't care about mmr, mmr is junk- or at least its not needed, its a bandaid.\n\nMmr is what got us here, and its not designed for the new system. If you want to have accurate matching you have to accurately measure performance of individuals, per game, and judge them on that. Mmr is what caused me to get into silver 2 in my first promos ever (HA was I NOT silver 2- I knew how to play support and like 2 champions mostly shittily), and the this season I go 7/3 and I'm placed bronze 5. Broken, obviously. If I started a new account, I guarantee I would be placed much much higher without the help of mmr. I'm not going to do that though, because I shouldn't have to do that for the system to work properly.\n\nAnyways, I go into a lot of detail about this, and what I think could be done to fix it. I am a programmer for a living, but I'm by no means a riot level programmer, I know what that means. I feel like my ideas could really turn the game around, or help spark someone else to turn the game around. I'd appreciate it if you guys would throw your options in. I've gotten a lot of great comments so far with indepth thought.\n\nLets see if we can get riots attention, if we want a better game we need to contribute to it being a better game.\n\n\n[Fixing the Ranked Ladder System](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Gbg9mmEq-support-and-ranked)","replies":[{"poster":"Julius Evola","date":"2016-03-13T20:28:57.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of supports (45% cdr) and ADCs mixed with this dynamic queue is the cause of this.\nAssassins, mages, and solo pathing champs cause excitement and balance in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-03-13T22:15:56.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"League of supports?\n\nBut there's no one playing main-support in a lotta places?","replies":[{"poster":"Julius Evola","date":"2016-03-16T06:02:17.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lulu, Nautilus, Lux, Morgana, are supports.
