It would avoid confusion in champ select from people just saying in chat what role they are.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it more, this could make catching people who don&#039;t go their role a whole lot easier, if you were to report someone for such a thing.

If I swap roles with someone to some sort of autofilled role I should receive autofill protection for being the \"nice guy\" and technically getting filled to support  (put 2 other roles and got support in the end). The main reason I don't swap with people who get autofilled is A) no one usually does it to me and I can't get mid lane to save my life anyway and B) there is a fairly high chance I could get autofilled to support the next game and have to play it twice in a row.\n\nI don't necessarily hate playing support, but there is a reason I don't put it in my role selection. If everyone gets a role they tolerate and i can control the 1 out of maybe 10 games I HAVE to play support (I take the role here willingly with a team I can hope will do better than if I intentionally queue support) then it seems like a win-win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2017-02-16T03:59:37.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a QoL improvement that would make players feel a little bit better\n\nexcept for the autofilled to support player.

EVERYONE PLEASE UPVOTE OP's POST\n\nOne of my main reasons - Most people have 1 or 2 primary roles. These same people aren't upset when they get a role that is not their primary role, even though they completely suck at the lane they got filled with. They say, Oh well, I've been playing league for 3 years now, I can play any role,  and play it out. They also don't chat much. They suck super bad at the lane they got filled at, further contributing to your frustration and loss.. Now I haven't taken any polls to ensure the accuracy of this, but as a support main, I can tell when someone gets AUTOFILLED as an ADC. Their mechanics, bad ADC mechanics in general, are super obvious by about 2 minutes in. This isn't going to prevent that all the time, but it could help. \n\n\"XXXX Would like to change positions with you.
