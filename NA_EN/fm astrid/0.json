This is a game 15 hours ago: [Game 1](http://i.imgur.com/nOV735y.png) and this is a game now, after the patch: [Game 2](http://i.imgur.com/LUM8xn4.png) What on earth? \r\nFirst, my pc is OK I can run things like dota 2 or Hots with high settings and no packet loss anywhere. My internet connection is OK too because any online game/full hd videos or MOBA are working fine, no ping, no jitter. Second, I got the same problem 2 weeks ago, when I changed the client language, the game just broke in the same way (Why? those are only audio files iirc o.0) packet loss everywhere, and it was working so fine before that, not even a clean re-install worked, the loss was there. The only thing left was formating my pc and the game was running great again, but with todays patch the packet loss shows again. Is it there some file that may be causing this sort of thing? I don't want to format my pc every patch, please if anyone has an idea let me know.\r\n\r\nPs: sorry about my english i'm from south america \r\nPs2: ticket support just tells me is an internet thing but I know is something when the game patch :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-22T23:33:04.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Audio or game files won't really cause a connection problem, but a poor connection or your routing to the game servers can.  For example, it sounds like you have a physical distance that may already cause some high ping.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your network settings.  Keep in mind of that physical distance to the NA region, in which no troubleshooting could exceed that limitation.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"fM Astrid","date":"2016-11-23T00:28:27.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play in LAS with stable 29 ping as shown in the pictures. I came to this forum because the support on LAS keeps telling me is an internet issue, but the problems starts directly after a patch. 2 packets loss before patching vs 1k5 packets loss after patching, something is happening there..","replies":[]}]}]}
