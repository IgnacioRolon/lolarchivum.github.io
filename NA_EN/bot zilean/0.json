Take wrestling for example that has an injury timer.

The reason I specified that is because the match immediately stops if someone is bleeding and a person is given up to 5 minutes to either stop bleeding or cover up whatever is bleeding and I have never seen anyone forfeit due to the blood timer.  Only about 30 seconds is typically used out of the blood timer and it is usually because of bloody noses.  An injury is something that just randomly happens as can be a disconnection in LoL.

Let's see...injuries, play-review, or literally any situation that arises where a pause is required. Do you watch any sports?
