Like if you dont care for the pie you dont care for a slice of that pie, but yet people have this mentality that i dont care about the pie but i care about the slice of pie, in this case the full pie being the video game and flame being a slice of it. like if the whole thing doesnt matter to you then the flame shouldnt matter either. If you care about the flame then you have to care about the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crescent Dusk","date":"2018-08-07T00:43:29.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In such a crisis you should have left the game so that the rest of the team can FF earlier.

If a player is doing poorly flaming them only makes this person commit more mistakes which I realize is the point of this long post.\n\nthrid Your story makes no sense how was your mom fixing your dads respirator and he came in after that cause he heard it? Also when you post a stack of problems like this it makes it seem like your saying OMG PLZZ GIVE ME ATTENTION! aka like the person on facebook that posts \"Don't even ask me about my day\"\n\nOverall this is ARAM so if they are flaming so hard just tell them stop tryharding cause its ARAM, because if I wanted to play a real game of league I would be in ranked.\n\nI once had to take a 10 minute break in Aram came back and I told them I had to walk my GF to her car. They laughed said I had no gf and a little back and forth joking and I said I am sorry and we got over it and we ended up winning this Aram game somehow lol. anyways get some over the ear gaming headphones it will prevent distractions because I assume you might be playing league to escape a bit and that will help you focus.

There is a distinct difference, and you are in the post fighting for one thing, and in comments completely contradicting it. I disagree with this entirely, no I do not think that people should be banned for words when there is a mute button IN THE GAME that takes 2 seconds to hit, and no I don't think that you should continue to play the game with that much going around you. Yes it does ruin the experience for the other 4 just so you can play the game longer and avoid life, no they aren't ruining your already shitty experience. \n\nI'm going to get really pissed off at someone who randomly starts playing like crap because it looks like they are trolling. I think someone said it best in the comments, if the game remains just a video game, the words are just that, words with no meaning. You cannot have it both ways. Now you can support the game the way I do, It is a passion, but I don't care about what people say, but you cannot have it the other way around. You cannot have it be where you expect them to not care about the game, but also care about what they say, that isn't how this works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-08-07T05:06:27.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute button","replies":[]},{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-08-07T04:44:33.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I woulda just afked.
