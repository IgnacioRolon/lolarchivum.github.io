Can't.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"TL;DR: This is a post of a nobody crying like a kid about the toxic community. \r\n\r\nI know, I know. \"Oh, boo hoo some little baby is sad that some big meanies said mean things on the internet, oh boo hoo\", but truly: I can't anymore.\r\n\r\nI used to play this game a lot. From Season 3 up to Season 6 (I think. I know Tahm Kench was the last hero released before I last quit), I played a bunch because I was having some genuine fun. The games could go on for 15-20 minutes or they could be those  long, hour slobber knockers but generally speaking I enjoyed myself. \r\n\r\nBut as time goes along and the game became more popular: so too did the toxicity. Eventually, it caught up to me and I left the game and the community in a sense. \r\n\r\nTime goes by and I started to get a bit of an itch to play again, so I reinstalled the launcher and found myself lost among all the changes. New champions. New rune systems. No more mastery trees. Some familiar faces got mini-reworks. Some got overhauls. New items. Some items removed. It took me about a week of on and off play to start to figure things out.\r\n\r\nAnd I was having fun. \r\n\r\nUntil; I'd say this month: I've noticed I'd go against some players that were both more experienced than I, and quite simply far better than me. I won't deny that I am not good. I mean: I'm Iron elo after all, and feel no shame admitting that. Its where I belong.\r\n\r\nHowever, with this change in the general playerbase I was being pitted against, too also saw the removal of any fun I was having. I'm getting killed. Stomped. Brutalized. Any confidence I was building is gone. I watch guides. I used the practice tool. But nothing really seems to work. \r\n\r\nI know, I know \"get good\", but really getting good isn't my issue here. My issue is the playerbase. The community. I perform poorly, I know. But I try my best. But it isn't enough. People just go off on me as if I physically assaulted a family member of theirs. Tossing completely baseless accusations of me intentionally feeding when I botch a flash, or miss a Sej ult. Telling me to essentially kill myself when I struggle with the new jungle and being behind 2+ levels at all times. Berating me for losing my lane when I'm simply just outclassed by the opponent. Spam pings, spam of hate in chat. I shouldn't have to mute 2 or 3 members of my team every match.\r\n\r\nThis isn't fun. And honestly, this is why the community is poorly thought of. It hasn't changed one bit. And now, I'm done. \r\n\r\nI know I'm a nobody. I came in a nobody and am leaving a nobody. However I wanted to get my thoughts out and to vent some aggravation. I don't know the solution to this problem, except quite simply to not play anymore. \r\n\r\nTo anyone who may have played with or against me that had some amount of fun: I hope you continue to enjoy the game, and that all goes well in life for you.","replies":[]}
