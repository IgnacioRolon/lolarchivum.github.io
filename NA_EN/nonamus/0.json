I don't remember my old email or username.\r\n\r\nIt was a level 30 summoner level account too. I had been playing for free for a long time and had a nice collection of champions all from free points. I have a good functioning computer again and available time. I was hoping to get back into the game but having lost my account I am totally drained of all excitement now.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if Riot will help this poor forgetful man?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T22:10:32.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We would absolutely love to help recover an old account!
