Run through [**the steps listed here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac) to clear up any blockages for League. Your champ select should be plagued no longer by connection related problems then, but if you still get those freezes and black screens don't hesitate to hit me up again so I can look for another fix!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"D Drip","date":"2017-08-06T03:36:09.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for replying :) I'll reply again if it works or doesnt in about a day or so \nThanks for the quick reply as well","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-08-06T04:03:24.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure thing! :D Glad I could provide some solutions~","replies":[{"poster":"D Drip","date":"2017-08-06T20:55:10.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i followed every thing I did, additionally i reinstalled league , used the hextech repair tool. \n\nYet, Im still having some freezes like when i accepted a queue and my friends got sent into champ select but i was frozen until banning phase 17 seconds left.\n\nAlthough it is noticeable that the frequency went down, yet i dont know if this could be a random occurrence.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-08-06T21:02:21.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, sorry to hear that.\n\nAnother idea I might suggest is also updating your graphics card driver [**with these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq2).
