At this point, I&#039;m not even that good.  So I&#039;ve been thinking and I want to find a one trick champ that I can spam and learn to get better with.\n\nAs a top main, I&#039;ve had decent success with Irelia, but I don&#039;t feel confident in my lategame plays on her at all.  I&#039;ve tried Pantheon, and he might be a viable option.  Gangplank has also caught my eye as of late.\n\nSo I want to ask, does anyone have any opinions when it comes to a good champ to one trick?  Am I setting my sights too high with champion difficulty?  Any feedback is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-03-28T19:13:33.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:33}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} \n{{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:33}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:33}} {{summoner:33}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:33}}  {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:33}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:33}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{champion:163}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}} {{summoner:34}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"FooDang","date":"2017-03-28T18:59:05.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stick with Irelia.\n\nWatch \"IreliaCarriesU\" videos non stop on youtube.\n\nProfit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2017-03-28T18:54:00.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:31}} is surprisingly a very powerful one-trick champion. Especially after the recent changes to his kit, if you play him top and know how to play conservatively early game and be opportunistic with your cc and feast, you become a late game monster. Just realize that your early game is pretty bad and you will lose lane to most aggressive match-ups if you try to fight them head on until you get some HP and AP under your belt. I've seen him played both ways, but I find the best builds with him are a hybrid of defense and AP. \n\nWhat separates the good Cho players from the great Cho players is the ability to predict enemy movements in order to land rupture. Landing rupture on a carry and combining it with silence, an auto, and feast pretty much spells death for almost everyone.\n\nAs far as keystone masteries go, thunderlords works really well but so does stormraider's fury against more mobile compositions. You should be able to proc thunderlords before needing to use feast, however, I have found that if you end up proccing thunderlords with feast, you still get the stack, even if thunderlords ends up killing them, so it works out really well. Just realize that because it takes more time to get stacks now, you need to know when to use Feast. Feast on dragon or herald/baron, yes. Dragon, Herald, and Baron do not count in your 6-stack limit and therefore are beneficial to feast on.  Feast only to kill champions, otherwise you don't get stacks for it. Most people will only feast on minions if they have 80 or so seconds before they need to worry about a team engage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kristopher205","date":"2017-03-28T18:32:24.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-03-28T17:00:38.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'd say one trick the champion you like the most.
