Going Mid allows the Support the ability to roam to both other lane rather then just mid.\n2. It provides better objective control, with the changes to Rift/Dragon from past seasons this gain much importance\n3. It allows the support to better react to invades and help his JG in crab battles\n4. it provides better vision control \n\n>But but the ADC 1 v 2\n\nI think the advantages of having a support mid are much more valuable then have one bot and that BOTH support should always start mid.\nThis is already the standard thing to do post laning phase in pro play. I honestly think this should be done during laning phase.\n\nI will be playing support mid lane from now on because i think it's the correct thing to do.\n\nP.S. Let me make one thing clear. I'm suggesting both ADCs and support go mid and that traditional mid laners go bot. I think this makes sense from both a strat perspective and would also help from a \"fun\" perspective in the long term as it makes it harder to counter pick the solo lanes when they're effectively playing the same lane and can lane swap bad matchups","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-20T19:47:38.913+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"short answer: no\nlong answer: no","replies":[{"poster":"BestPudgeNA","date":"2019-06-20T19:49:08.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luther King Jr V,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fuBL1TKR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-06-20T19:47:38.913+0000)\n>\n> short answer: no\n> long answer: no\n\nWhy?","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-20T19:51:53.173+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"cause that means exp is shared between two laners and will slow down the pace of mid lane\nand supports are not supposed to lane face to face to assassins\n\nlike did you think about that for more than 3 seconds to see the horrible flaws of ur idea","replies":[{"poster":"BestPudgeNA","date":"2019-06-20T20:05:07.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luther King Jr V,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fuBL1TKR,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-06-20T19:51:53.173+0000)\n>\n> cause that means exp is shared between two laners and will slow down the pace of mid lane\n> and supports are not supposed to lane face to face to assassins\n> \n> like did you think about that for more than 3 seconds to see the horrible flaws of ur idea\n\nYes i did. But apparently you didn't read what i said. The bot laner should be mid with the support and the mid laners should be bot. I think if one team sends it's bot duo mid and the other sends it's bot duo bot the team with the bot duo mid lane gains the bigger advantage. Thus forcing both teams to send their \"bot duo\" mid. It's already what the pro teams do post laning phase. For the reasons i already stated.","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-20T20:09:19.210+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok supports are not supposed to roam\nsupport who their playstyle depend on staying in bushes will be ruined (they only have river bushes and that could be too dangerous)\n\nthe midlaners won't be able to roam as much despite having the mobility to do so because you sent them to the furthest lane from their teammates\n\nstill a flawed and bad idea and totally not an elaborate justification to what nubrac did?","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2019-06-20T21:54:46.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luther King Jr V,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fuBL1TKR,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-20T20:09:19.210+0000)\n>\n> ok supports are not supposed to roam\n> support who their playstyle depend on staying in bushes will be ruined (they only have river bushes and that could be too dangerous)\n> \n> the midlaners won't be able to roam as much despite having the mobility to do so because you sent them to the furthest lane from their teammates\n> \n> still a flawed and bad idea and totally not an elaborate justification to what nubrac did?\n\nwhat sort of flawed logic is this? the supports are supposed to support, whether it be bot, mid or top, when my adc is a boosted monkey that cant even farm minions without pushing the wave im gonna go elsewhere to support, since staying at bot will be guaranteed feeding, and at that point, if i stay bot i might aswell be reported for inting","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-20T22:00:52.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"support the adc i never saw a serious support leave his adc side minute 0 to minute 30\nsupport or adc alone are not complete separate champions riot made them that way that they need each other one peels and the other damages\n\npeople who don't understand this go as adc solo and complain they died while they were fed duh cuz ur class isn't immune to death and is one of the squishiest hence the need of support\n\nwhen i am saying this i am talking in general i dont care about ur own personal misadvantures with ur bad adcs they don't interest me","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2019-06-20T22:06:11.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luther King Jr V,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fuBL1TKR,comment-id=0001000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-06-20T22:00:52.290+0000)\n>\n> support the adc i never saw a serious support leave his adc side minute 0 to minute 30\n> support or adc alone are not complete separate champions riot made them that way that they need each other one peels and the other damages\n> \n> people who don't understand this go as adc solo and complain they died while they were fed duh cuz ur class isn't immune to death and is one of the squishiest hence the need of support\n> \n> when i am saying this i am talking in general i dont care about ur own personal misadvantures with ur bad adcs they don't interest me\n\nwhen my adc is a boosted monkey, im not staying in the lane to feed, its a lot more helpful to go help other lanes and has turned games  that would prob have been losses into wins in the past, it limits the gold potential for the enemy carry making them easier to deal with later on as they are only getting 1 kill instead of 2, while potentially allowing someone else to get fed as a lot of supports can setup kills for people, no reason to be inting bot when you can get both top and mid and maybe even the jungler a kill instead","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-20T22:08:20.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool story bro","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BestPudgeNA","date":"2019-06-20T20:32:05.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luther King Jr V,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fuBL1TKR,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-20T20:09:19.210+0000)\n>\n> ok supports are not supposed to roam\n> support who their playstyle depend on staying in bushes will be ruined (they only have river bushes and that could be too dangerous)\n> \n> the midlaners won't be able to roam as much despite having the mobility to do so because you sent them to the furthest lane from their teammates\n> \n> still a flawed and bad idea and totally not an elaborate justification to what nubrac did?\n\nSupport are supposed to roam. Just watch a pro support stream.

In theory Mid+JG+SUP should beat Sup+adc+Jg in the early game. Minions also reach the mid turret quicker and fort only last 5 mins. In theory the mid duo setup should win in an early race.
