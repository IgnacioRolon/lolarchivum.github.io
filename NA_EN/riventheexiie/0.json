Sometimes the game colors become black and white and honestly its pretty creepy, it happens to many other players without them realizing the actual reason. Took me a while to find it out, and I just use my phone for background stuff til the game loads in, I hope this get fixed because sometimes windows 10 pops up and forcefully give you an update tab that would bug out the loading of the game. Thank you and have a nice day.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-13T21:50:08.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question for you:  Do you play in full screen or windowed/borderless?\n\nThese types of problems aren't necessarily specific to league, as this is a recurring issue that can manifest in many different ways.  We can address a bunch of them, but then more will just show up as there are new graphics drivers etc.   If you do want to be able to alt tab during loading, playing in windowed mode typically helps with that.","replies":[{"poster":"RivenTheExiIe","date":"2018-06-13T23:25:41.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying! I play in fullscreen, but I connect my laptop to my PC monitor. Maybe that has an effect? But I remember it happening on my PC as well. But yeah, I mean I can just grab my phone for discord etc. I just felt like informing you about the issue, because I don't seem like the only one having it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonic√êeHedgedawg","date":"2018-06-13T22:06:09.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will say, I've alt tabbed in the loading screen before and didn't have any issues but it's been especially testy after this latest patch","replies":[{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2018-06-13T22:07:38.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found that the tabbing itself takes significantly longer (for the change in windows to display) but that if I press alt+tab once and patiently wait, it's mroe consistent.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
