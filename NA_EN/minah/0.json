Please investigate this issue because the alpha client that you have released shouldn't have been released in the first place. It uses a lot more resources then the legacy one and you didn't think that about the main reason League is still not being abandoned, because you don't need a high end PC to play it and I can say that it's laggy( I5-3317U 1,7-2,6 GHz, HDD 500 Gb 7200 rpm 32 Mb Cache, 4 Gb Ram DDR3, GPU AMD HD 8730M 2 Gb ) so it's a medium specs pc and it's laggy to the point that it takes ~10 sec to ban or get a champ. Please find a solution to bring us the legacy client by default.
