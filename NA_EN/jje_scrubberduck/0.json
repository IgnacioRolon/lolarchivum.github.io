While on Diana, and with 3 stacks of Tahm&#039;s passive on, I use Dianas AoE pull, pulling in 3 enemies.  Literally exactly the same time as i start the pull, Tahm ate me, and pulled all FOUR of us into his mouth.  Working on a video now.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-07T20:20:13.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a similar topic, i recently watched a syndra pick up and throw what looked like more than 3 dark spheres and part of a minion wave. I was too terrified to notice the exact conditions.\n\nAs a programmer, i would hazard a guess that entities being pushed or pulled relative to another entity are in some way linked to it, in some cases? I have seen similar bizarre glitches in other games and code.\n\nIn the name of science, what happens if tristana ults diana at the same moment?","replies":[]}]}
