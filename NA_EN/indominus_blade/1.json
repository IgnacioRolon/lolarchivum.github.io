Nothing in League of Legends exists in a vacuum, and drawing comparisons between similar elements of the game is both perfectly valid and essential to understanding how things work and why they do they way they do.","replies":[{"poster":"Indominus Blade","date":"2015-12-08T00:49:16.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=npOcAX5N,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2015-12-07T23:49:18.576+0000)\n>\n> Yes they can, especially when they share similar roles, and especially when their design is driven by the same impetus.

Even if they had similer roles, they couldn't be compared, but in this case, they don't even have the same role.
