It&#039;s good for objectives. But PLEASE STOP JUNGLING IF THERE IS A 1V2 LANE. That lane is doomed to fail, and they&#039;re obviously going to beg for ganks or for help, and I haven&#039;t seen a single jungler in OFA that responds to them. Often times it&#039;s &quot;Stop feeding, I&#039;m helping the other lanes&quot;. It&#039;s so fucking toxic and it makes other people toxic. The game is no fun when you know you&#039;re going to lose not because of champions, not because of skill, but because one asshole decided to focus on farming jungle while top lane gets their inhib destroyed by 8 minutes by 2 yasuos. Or by 2 Katarinas. Or by 2 anything because 2 broken champions vs 1 broken champion results in the 1 champion&#039;s death.","replies":[{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2015-10-18T20:34:57.429+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should just git gud.

Thus endeth the lesson. Close book. Let the junglers go about their business. Question nothing.\n\nThe real truth is: most people aren't skilled enough for meta strategies to even matter, and when they're put in a queue where no one is telling them what to do, or copy-catting LCS know-how, they suddenly realize how hopeless they are against oppressive non-meta lanes. Players then base their strat-perspectives on actual THOUGHT, instead of what they've been told, and it's ass-backwards from what they say the rest of the time. I see this repeatedly and roll my eyes every time at the blatant inconsistency. It's why 99% of voiced opinions in League carry no weight to me.\n\nYou know what? If you sign up for a lane, and it sucks, deal with it, and deal with it how you please. Rotate to a better lane, stay there and turtle, I don't care. But don't rage at allies. Let other people have fun and not revolve their playstyle around you. YOU figure out how to compensate for YOUR role decisions when YOU queue up solo.\n\nEven when top's in serious trouble, a jungler that's effectively ganking other lanes is probably doing a lot more good than splitting experience top to keep a tower up. Or maybe not. It's a gamble either way. Not everyone's going to come to the exact same conclusion, nor should they. I've seen way too many holes in way too many strat-calls in-game to treat any player's claims, INCLUDING MY OWN, as fact, despite everyone else treating their opinions as some kind of law.\n\nIn regular queues, people pressure standard role-strats on other players. In new gamemodes, they pressure their first-ever-thought-based role strats on players AGAIN. Just stop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Megarra","date":"2015-10-17T02:17:21.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL I couldn't agree with you more :)","replies":[]}]}
