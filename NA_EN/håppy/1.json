From refunds to bans, an increased number in ranked or the addition of certain things, mass-upvoting a thread to show your support behind it has always been how people have used the feature. Today I saw a thread about the newer ARAM thread being deleted, with this as the moderator reply.\r\n\r\n> [{quoted}](name=Jikker,realm=NA,application-id=yrc23zHg,discussion-id=hfGfxjel,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2019-04-20T03:23:16.791+0000)\r\n>\r\n> It wasn't removed by Riot to silence the desire for bans to come back.  Personally, I _want_ bans in ARAM so there's no reason I'd want to silence that!  However, the reason for the removal appears to be that it was low effort/spam and didn't really do much for discussion.\r\n> \r\n> If I had made the removal, I would've redirected you to General Discussion, but I can understand the choice the moderator in question made.  It didn't really provide much in the way of discussion which is something we are aiming to see more of on Gameplay versus just \"upvote this\" (excuse me, I mean \"upvate\") type threads.\r\n> \r\n> I can understand the frustration in seeing the removal though after it received much support.  However, we don't judge removals based on votes or number of comments; we remove based on rules and guidelines for the Boards and the specific sub-board.\r\n> \r\n> EDIT:  I'll add in that a good thread with plenty of substance for discussion such as mentioning why bans made ARAM a better experience and why you want it back would probably be allowed to stay and, given the support for the subject, will receive the same amount of support for Riot to see.\r\n\r\nPardon me if I seem rude, but this seems shallow. Very, very shallow. I can recall for _over 5 years_ how the top 3-4 threads on the League of Legends forums, with the most upvotes _ever,_ being just reposted \"3 refunds per season, upvote if you want 3 refunds per season\". No effort, the body of the post was just \"title\", and it was by like 4 different people just riding off the refund hype. For five years, those threads were around. They might still be around, actually, but the fact that they hung around for so long despite being _actual, literal 100% reposts_ of each other proves that this \"No effort\" thing is heavily fabricated. Maybe you're misguided on it, Jikker, I'm not going to flame you, and I'm not shaming you on this. I'm also posting this thread separate from replying for visibility.\r\n\r\nBut this looks like Riot and their moderators just erasing a thread they don't like. Riot claims that the aram bans were massively hated but more people were playing ARAM than I've ever seen before. And the outcry over the removal was _huge._ It's still _huge._ Deleting threads is not the way to go, that's just censorship, especially when **hundreds of people** are putting their weight behind it.","replies":[]}
