It feels _bad_ to play as that champion. The worst part is, it also feels bad to play AGAINST Fizz, because that damage can still take you by surprise. IMO, this Fizz rework, now that it&#039;s had lots and lots of time to be felt and worked with, did nothing to fix the miserable feeling of vsing a Fizz, and just removed the fun of playing him.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-11-03T18:48:43.750+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Revert Fizz 2k18 imo","replies":[{"poster":"Håppy","date":"2017-11-03T23:00:39.164+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-03T23:14:17.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I came here to say that, but I will just give you my upvote.","replies":[]}]}]}
