Does riot not see the problem here?\n\nVs Events are essentially pointless.  Whats the point of even voting for Garen when you know you're gonna get the Darius icon shoved in your face at the end anyways... May as well vote darius and get that 1k LP.  Like, I already knew he was gonna lose. Darius had 10k likes on his theme while Garen had barely 8k. The whole point was to get his icon. Wtf.
