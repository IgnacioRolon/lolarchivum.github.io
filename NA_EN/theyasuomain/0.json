This program has the potential to be inaccurate (distortion upgrade and some masteries can change Flash cooldowns). That inaccurate nature makes it feel less like an \"I win because I have this program\" situation.\n2. Riot has always been OK with the idea of people manually recording notes on key events and using those notes to plan ahead.\n3. The only difference between this program and one you alt-tab out to click on is how you interact with it. It could be argued that using the note command takes you out of the game less, making it *more* OK than a timer in a web browser.\n4. Riot *intends* the Notes.txt file to be read by the end user. Riot isn't trying to hide that content from you.\n\nIf you cling to fragments of statements about third party programs you get a very distorted view of what is and is not allowed.
