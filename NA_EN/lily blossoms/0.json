I see this a lot. League of legends cilent crashes during promos during champ select. And it kicks you out and you lose promotions. That's hours of gameplay just lost. Ugh... Especially climbing Bronze to Silver, Silver to Gold, Gold to Diamond. Is there a possible way for League support team to actually do something about this or will it just be a \"Sorry, it's your unlucky day. You are kicked from promos?\"\r\n\r\nAnd also is anyone else having this issue?\r\n\r\nIt's frustrating. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Lily Blossoms","date":"2016-12-21T17:44:24.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing was that I had perfect connection. I was able to play other games or open any website. It wasn't my connection problem. And I can confirm this because my brother was playing league with me and he wasn't kicked from champ select.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-19T03:07:00.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I have to say that I cannot undo any losses or Low-priority queues you may have incurred during these Issues, I'll also mention that we can work together to resolve this issue for good so you're much less likely to experience these losses again.\n\nCrashes that happen in champion select are most often caused by a poor connection to the matchmaking servers. In this case, I'd really recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address the most common solutions for this. Please let me know if you continue to experience these issues after you've followed that guide.","replies":[]}]}
