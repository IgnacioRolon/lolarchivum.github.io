I went through the entire connection guide (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) trying to fix the problem, and I ran a traceroute which showed no response from 2 hosts (another 2 cutting out intermittently), and I contacted my ISP. I explained my issue, and they informed me that since this is the only game I'm having connection issues with, all the evidence points towards LoL being the problem. I have no idea what to do from here, but here is my traceroute - https://gyazo.com/d0d1108b2295176ebf44b4469c3cca52 Another thing to add, this traceroute is listing packet loss, however when I type in the IP in Command, it doesn't list any packet loss, but still shows 200+ ping - https://gyazo.com/46dcef572f8fcc8724f01ce61efa102a","replies":[{"poster":"Martinboostdking","date":"2016-08-14T03:41:54.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been happening to me for over 3-4 months now. Ive posted videos and on these forums twice now. I can't even rank up because i go into games not knowing if this is a \"Lag game\" or not. Seems like its a certain node(s) of LoL's that gives most people problems. Please fix.

Two days ago my ping was a steady 30-50. Since the Ascension game mode was available, my game starts out at 30-50 ping but with in 2 min to 8 min it ramps up to 400-500 and spikes to 11k, highest I have seen yet. When I close the game and reload the game it starts back at my initial 30-50 ping but with in 30 sec it ramps back up to 400 or more.  During this time I steadily get the prompt \"Attempting to Reconnect\".  I have tried multiple game through out the day making sure it was not during peek hours.  My latest game was at 9:30 central time and I could not move my champ for more than 1 and half minutes.\n\nI have also checked and nothing is being used in my house that uses the internet nor is there any auto-updates taking place.\n\nCurrently LoL is unplayable and not enjoyable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vokun93","date":"2016-08-13T22:06:51.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got this problem too. I started a ranked game thinking my connection would be fine as it normally is. 450-500ms throughout the whole game, I closed everything that was using my connection. \n\nLiterally only LoL and Skype were using it. Still had the ping, lost the ranked game because it was unplayable. I checked today in a bot game and it is still around that value. \n\nSomething has broken this patch and I literally can't play the game. It's definitely not on my end. Hope this gets fixed ASAP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T20:21:44.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for troubleshooting all of this, and we'd like to dig into this more to find out what's going on.
