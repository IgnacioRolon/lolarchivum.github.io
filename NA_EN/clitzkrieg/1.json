Now for over a month, it has been a constant 200+. Just so you guys all know, 300mbs+ download speed, wired connection, have tried with and without firewall, port forwarded for LoL, tried playing without any processes in the background, tried repairing and reinstalling, tried flushing and changing DNS, and this is the only game with any connection issues at all whatsoever. Nothing I have read anywhere has helped at all and I'm really on my last straw for this entire game just because of this issue. Does anyone have some possible solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-02T18:23:45.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the steps you've already tried, it seems that you may have worked through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) already. Because latency is largely impacted by how your connection is routed to the server, we'll need to take a look at your exact ISP routing to the NA server specifically. \n\nTo do this, I recommend grabbing a great network analysis application called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) and running a 5 minute traceroute using the IP address 192.64.170.1\n\nAfter the trace has run for 5 minutes, export your results as text and either upload them to pastebin or paste them into a reply here. I'll be able to point out where in your route you're specifically having issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Clitzkrieg","date":"2016-08-02T21:24:47.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding.
