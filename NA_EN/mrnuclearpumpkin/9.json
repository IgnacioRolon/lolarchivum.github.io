Ultimately, 99.9% of Champions are just \"recycling old thing\", except on  the very rare occasion where they create a brand new effect like Grounded on Cassio or Polymorph on Lulu or some other effect that no other Champ ever had before (and even then, one could argue that Polymorph is just some flavorful quasi-stun). If you cut any kit in small enough pieces, you can find those pieces in previous kits... I can do it for Sion if you want.\n\nBut if you're being honest, Rakan gameplay as a whole is very much novel. The jury is still out about \"engaging\", but Rakan definitely plays more like a Lee Sin than a Sona/Soraka/Janna/Lulu, and that's a brand new experience for a Champ in the support position.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nymzo","date":"2017-04-09T20:24:24.341+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name me one more support that can charm tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-04-09T20:27:28.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"thing is the adc will be picked against zed/rengar\n\nthe support? i don't find any unique situation for him except if he's numerically stronger\n\nhaving a charm doesn't give you a niche","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2017-04-09T21:48:13.358+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about those times that a team needs cc/initiation, but the support sucks at tanks? Would not a mobile enchanter with cc and initiation be helpful then?\n\nWhen thinking about \"where can this camp be used\" you also need to also think about people's' playstyles. I like the enchanter playstyle, but I am overtly aggressive and like to force fights, but that makes me weaker playing as them.And tanks? Can't do it on a support budget(in other roles I am fine). Now though? I will have an aggressive enchanter  to play with.\n\nAnd not everyone likes every champ. Some might like a certain playstyle, or aspect of a champ, but loath the champ that fulfills it. Having multiple champs that do similar jobs is useful, as long as they do it differently(No {{champion:113}} and {{champion:32}} ). Need a safe adc? {{champion:51}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:18}}.
