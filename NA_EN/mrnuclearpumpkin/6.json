But Lucian has 35 max mana. That means two will regain him an extra 10.5 mana per auto attack. Sounds great but let’s math it out. He is gaining 20.5 mana per auto so he hits max mana in 2 autos as opposed to 4, pretty scary. Hmm, wonder how it would go if he got a single seraph’s instead. Seraph’s restores 20 mana on spell cast, hmmm, wait a second, that means it only takes 2 autos because he only needs 15 more mana. Actually hmm wait a second times 2, because if he crits, that gives 15 mana instead of 10, making him only require a single auto (the crit only increases base mana regen so shojin build would still need 2 autos even if he crit).\n\nWhat makes double shojin op is it makes champions with 150 mana take only 3 autos to cast their spell. Triple shojin makes 150 mana units cast their spell again after 2 autos. \n\nTL;DR low mana units benefit more off seraph’s and high mana cost units benefit more off seraph’s. Don’t want your shojin’s on lucian/akali/yasuo guys!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-07-09T17:13:59.518+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pyke needs to be nerfed, AND same items shouldn't stack.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-07-10T20:37:05.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive seen a guy build {{item:3124}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3124}} {{champion:136}} and just stack random tanky units infront of him to buy time for the items to build up.\n\nneedless to say it was stupid and unbeatable.\n\nso +1 to the notion that the same items shouldnt stack.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bebe Yoda","date":"2019-07-10T20:28:53.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can deal with glacials, i can deal with literally anything except a pyke because he is so over clocked on dmg and stun duration and being able to use his move every 3 auto attacks is just beyond sensiblity.
