Has League always been this snowball heavy?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cannot remember much around Season 2-4, I know that there were Kassadin snowballs, Katarina snowballs, the occasional Leblanc snowballs. But i wonder, when they were snowballing, was it easier to stop them than it is today?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had several games where a single person has often carried the game on their back. One match it was a Master Yi, the other match it was a Tryndamere, and one match was a Darius.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing we could do in every situation. Tryndamere would run in 1v5 and blue smite then slow with his W, then burn ghost and laugh as you try helplessly to peel/run for your life, Master Yi would just go in and devour everyone in seconds, and Darius was just a tanky healing juggernaut that laughed as you attempted to 1v5 him.\r\n\r\nThe past few games I played, it felt the same way but with my team. I snowballed as Taliyah and everyone just died.  My Swain one game started snowballing and became a god.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to win a league game nowadays without losing by a snowball, or winning by a snowball?","replies":[]}
