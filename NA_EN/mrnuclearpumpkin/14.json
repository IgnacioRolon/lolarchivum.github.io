You see, I had thought that I needed to slam them into the wall to gain the shield, but as it happens, you really just need to tackle them. And... that&#039;s it. Considering how disturbingly easy it is to do, I&#039;m honestly a little surprised but it was giving my early game a ridiculous amount of pressure and skirmish advantage. \r\n\r\nBetween Poppy&#039;s passive and Courage of the Colossus working together so well, it allowed for me to go in pretty much at level 2, hammer them when a few auto attacks and my Q, then walk out of the fight at almost full health. The biggest problem is that I didn&#039;t even need to land my stun most of the time. I pretty much just tackled them randomly and picked up my passive shield and boom.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with this was that I could tackle them  into an open spot, Q, auto attack then walk away without worrying about any returned damage from the ADC. After doing it about 3-5 times the ADC was completely zoned out.\r\n\r\nI just feel like the Keystone Mastery should only activate if Poppy hits them into a wall to gain the shield. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-11-05T03:52:30.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're saying that Poppy support might actually be viable now?\n\nWell, good job then Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Veraska","date":"2016-11-05T03:25:40.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its working as intended, poppy tackle us a displacement which is considered a hard cc, sounds exploitable in poppy's case but not like a bug","replies":[{"poster":"MrNuclearPumpkin","date":"2016-11-05T03:27:44.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BLLLK FLLG,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nc11MEB6,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-05T03:25:40.164+0000)\n>\n> Its working as intended, poppy tackle us a displacement which is considered a hard cc, sounds exploitable in poppy&#x27;s case but not like a bug\n\nHuh.
