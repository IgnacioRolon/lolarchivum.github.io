Some serious advice about this game.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried on multiple occasions to branch out of support. To rely on my own two feet and carry on my own instead of relying on another person to do it. But every time I do, I fail. And I fail hard. Like 1/10 kind of failing.\r\n\r\nNeeko, Nasus, Ornn, Zoe, Liss, none of them matter because I always screw up in solo lanes. But whenever I play support, (Lulu in particular) I excel. I almost always get an S and my ADC honors me in every game. \r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s the thing. It&#039;s support. No one cares about support. If you can only climb as support, you&#039;re not climbing at all. You&#039;re riding on the back of someone else.\r\n\r\nIf I can only do well playing support, does that count as doing well at all?","replies":[]}
