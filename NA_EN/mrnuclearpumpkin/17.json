But for some unknown reason, people take suggestions as a sign of insult. &quot;Oh how dare you give me a suggestion! How dare you tell me to build something different from what I&#039;m planning on!?&quot;\r\n\r\nLike, say if you&#039;re playing an ARAM match and at the start of the match you see that they have almost a full team of self healing champions. So, you suggest to your carries to buy an executioner&#039;s calling. Because you know that that eventually the healing champions (Swain) are going to simply outtank your team and because morello needs to be 35%, it&#039;s pretty much useless until they get low enough. :(\r\n\r\nWhat makes it worse is when they start complaining that the tank is outhealing everyone and will actively blame the one person on the team with Morello, because they think that they&#039;re not doing anything.\r\n\r\nSo allow me to make a brief explanation about how the two Grievous Wounds items differ and why just having one Morello isn&#039;t always enough.\r\n\r\nIf I can help even ONE person understand how to fight against a heal comp, then my job is a success.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n{{item:3165}} Morellonomicon Unique: Dealing magic damage to an enemy champion below 35% health inflicts Grievous Wounds to them for 8 seconds.\r\n\r\nNow there&#039;s something that should be paid careful attention to right here.\r\n\r\n&quot;Below 35% health.&quot; This is the biggest problem at the very moment. Imagine you have a Swain, on the other team and you notice that the Morello&#039;s isn&#039;t working on the tank with Rod of Ages, Rylai&#039;s, Spirit Visage, Warmogs. Why? Because simply put, your team can&#039;t outdamage his heal enough for him to be lowered down to 35% for your item to inflict grievous wounds. \r\n\r\n{{item:3123}} Executioner&#039;s Calling Unique &ndash; Executioner: Physical damage inflicts Grievous Wounds on enemy champions for 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis is what&#039;s the most important thing to take note of. Unlike Morello, Calling inflicts the very important healing nerf to anyone that is dealt physical damage to, regardless of their health. Meaning that you can drop on the swain and have a higher chance of killing him over just relying on Morello.\r\n\r\nNow, does this mean that Morello is useless? No, of course not. However it just means that, they both serve their purpose. Imagine if there&#039;s both a Swain AND a Soraka on the same team. Well, chances are, it&#039;ll be A LOT more difficult to proc Grievous on the Swain than before. Where as Executioner&#039;s Calling is instant.\r\n\r\nHowever, while Executioner&#039;s Calling is immediate it only lasts for 3 seconds, which jumps up to 5 seconds when upgraded to Mortal Reminder. Whereas, Morello lasts for a good 8 seconds. So, while Executioner&#039;s Calling is good for wearing them down, Morello is good for making sure they STAY down.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo seriously, if you&#039;re playing MF, or Vayne or any kind of ADC. Have a real good look at their team comp. Regardless if it&#039;s ARAM, or Summoner&#039;s Rift or Twisted Treeline, or whatever, look at who the champions are and ask yourself, &quot;will it be harder for me to get kills if I don&#039;t buy executioners?&quot;\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! &quot;:D","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-05-17T17:59:32.761+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I play against healers with Chogath, I just yell really loudly then eat the one closest to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2016-05-17T16:32:08.528+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Everyone just says that Executioner's Calling and Mortal Reminder are terrible items.

(Lost Chapter and its one build path is still taunting players who remember BMB; that kind of item family is what I'm thinking of, with one being *specifically the GW option* and balanced as such, and the others having other strengths that meaningfully trade off.)\n\nNobody should get GW just because they bought stats that are good for them as stats.  They should make a decision to get GW, and give up something else they could have gotten instead.  EC gets this right.  It's good at what it does, but without being good at everything.\n\nBut on the mage side, Grail rework actually made this worse -- there *used* to be a similar stat alternative and they actually *took it away without replacement* and forced even *more* people to build the \"buy it for the stats, get GW free whether you care about it or not\" item.\n\nGW should *only* be available on niche items, it should never just be there.  How bad would it feel to be a CC champion if tenacity was on a highly efficient stat stick that lots of people built just because?  How bad *did* it feel to be a tank when tons of armor pen was on an item that was good for all physical damage all the time and 2-3 people per team built it every game?  How would mages like it if instead of having to choose to build toward Maw for MR, it was just added to IE?\n\nCounters to a group of champions (and remember, this is not just countering someone else's item build, in many cases it's countering their *kit*) need to be something that you make a decision to pursue, not ubiquitous side effects of things that are already good for other reasons.  Otherwise those champions are just bad all the time, or have to have crazy numbers so that they can function when the guy holding the counter item happens to be across the map .","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-05-17T16:23:45.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because Executioner's Calling is a specialized item purchased almost entire for the passive while Morellonomicon is a core item on many mid-laners regardless of the enemy team's composition.\n\nThis is especially true since 6.9 buffed it significantly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2016-05-17T17:10:11.280+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of wish they'd raise the minimum for GW on morello.

In terms of Grievous wounds, if your a mage and Morrelo's isn't part of your core build, chances are, you won't actually buy it. (more so now, with the item changes) and if your the ADC. Even though, Executioner's calling is only 800 gold, that's 800 that could have gone to raw AD or AS, and offered you more DPS, that's hard to justify if your already behind. And also, people won't like building executioner's calling, unless they will eventually proceed to Mortal reminder. And item you would really only build against sustain tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2016-05-17T21:45:01.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how it makes the balance any more of a knife edge than it is now.  The only difference is that now you get the nuclear option to just invalidate 40% of a champion's kit.  It's just as bad for the healing champions as QSS's existence was for the balance of Zed/Trundle/etc.  \n\nAs for Soraka, the only reason she's been jerked around as much as she has is because Riot's designed her around the expectation that heal debuffs exist in the game.  Riot realized that current Soraka not being affected by such a mechanic wasn't balanced, so they reverted the change and brought her back to square one, but they could have done this more permanently by simply nerfing Soraka's heal itself rather than pulling her back into this binary environment where your heals are either 100% effective or 60% effective.  \n\nAnd I think your 2nd point is another great argument for removing heal debuff!  Suppose Riot balances Soraka around a gamestate where she's played against heal debuff: do you think players are going to purchase those items to deal with Soraka, or are they going to refuse to buy them and complain that Soraka's too strong?  Even if they do bite the bullet, now you have the healer feeling bad that their kit is countered so hard and the other player feels bad because they had to cater their build to one player's champion pick.
