She wasn't...possibly human. Nor was she a vampire or anything. No one knew what she was and that was her charm. She was unknown. Just an expensive assassin that lurked in the shadows for her next prey while having fun at it.\r\n\r\nBy flat out saying, \"Oh she's a demon now.\" kinda spoils a lot of the mystery behind her character. I liked that the whole idea of using the word 'demon' was more of a symbolism to their character, Tahm being called demon didn't exactly mean he was one, but it was just something that could be called of him. \"Call me King. Call me demon. Water forgets the names of the drowned.\"\r\n\r\nBy flat out turning her into one kinda just... I don't know. Rubs me the wrong way personally. I liked the ambiguity of her existence and her race.\r\n\r\nI could probably be the only one that feels like this.

A little bit, yes. The thing I always liked about Eve was that she was something close to human, but clearly not. We had little information on who she was or why she did what she did, but the human elements gave her an edge. Her relationship with TF (for example) was something I found fascinating, because Eve's motive for it was a little unclear. Did she get with TF specifically to make him fall for her and dump him later, as she implied in the journal (it'd certainly be something this Eve would do, assuming she didn't flay him alive)? Was it solely a casual thing that she broke off when TF got too attached? Or perhaps she broke it off the moment she felt HERSELF getting attached?\n\nYeah that last one isn't very likely, but the fact that it COULD have been the case was something i loved about her old lore. She clearly had a supernatural reason to cause pain and suffering, but she also had a human side that could potentially have emotions of its own that contradicted those. That's not to say that we had a symbiote/Spiderman situation here; Eve definitely revelled in her power. But even evil people have friends, lovers, favorite jokes, pets, etc etc. Her color story in Zaun (that's now non-canon) showed that while she had no problem showing respect to nobles, she'd cut your throat if you dared think yourself her better. It showed that she had a personal distaste for the Gray Lady, and took pride in her own accomplishments. She was a person.\n\nThe newer demon stuff... well, to be fair, we haven't actually gotten our hands on it yet, but given that she's now a full-blown demon and judging on her voice lines... yeah. She seems flatter as a character.\n\nThat's not to say I hate this new version, I'm just gonna miss the old.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2017-09-27T17:12:54.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a good description of my feelings as well.

Evelynn's reaction does not have to be one of love, but I could definitely see her being unearthly pissed off at being outsmarted.
