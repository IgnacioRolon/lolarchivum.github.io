Is Soraka broken? Is she this unstoppable force that needs to be gutted? Even if you hit her numbers a bit.

I played against her as Darius before all the hype, and a well timed barrier spelled my death under tower, learning from my mistake by the end of the game she had less than 100 cs and I had above 200, but she was still very effective outside of lane, and single handily won a teamfight on her own because of her dependable healing and sustain. what does this all come down to? Impact. Top Lane impact. \n\nSoraka Top is just another flavor of the month pick, and her WR will dip if left alone as people learn to respect her sustain and ult, but this shows us that having a 3rd damage threat, a tank, or a split pushing top isn't nearly as impactful as an additional supportive champion that can keep teammates alive and disrupt the flow of a teamfight for the enemy. So we should really look at Soraka top and learn why she is so successful to fix the issue, because currently her lack of damage doesnt negatively affect her team. Does this mean that bruisers are weak? That mages are too strong? that supports are overloaded in response to kits in the game? Or maybe that traditional top lane items are too weak and gold inefficient?\n\nBruisers are my favorite class of champions, and I believe that having bruisers in the game allows for a fun and interesting experience for everyone, I've had a lot of fun playing against sett and have had moments where i want to tear my hair out playing against soraka. I think buffing certain advanced items and corresponding finished items would lead to stronger laning phases for traditional melee tops that can transition to stronger team fight impact that will discourage enchanters and glass cannon control mages from going top.

It's rare you can get a double kill like that, and a TP from top is risky in general because if ANYTHING goes wrong, you are screwed (at best you give a lead to the enemy toplaner, at worst you get killed). And then you gotta wait 6 minutes before having tp again. Not to mention you can't cancel the tp anymore...\n\nMid can easily roam bot again and again while top has to wait for the TP cd.. And mid is also 2 levels ahead of jungle and bot, which is broken. Mid is the most impactful role right now, and since it can have so much map pressure it didn't deserve the exp buffs. If bot is lvl 5, mid should be level 6 like in previous seasons (unless very fed) while top lane gets to be level 7 as compensation for not having an impact on the map (at least until Riot does something to fix that).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2020-02-06T17:31:51.789+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"have you met any ADC main? these guys are usually the biggest whiners in the entire community.

Not only adc-s (marksmen) as a whole class got nerfed, but it's the only class that can do what they're doing - ranged physical damage. So I can understand why rekkles benched himself.\nOn the other hand, if some melee tops got nerfed, you can switch to another melee top that works in a similar fashion.\n\nIn the context of melee tops, from what I've seen, only bruisers are having a hard time, while the rest of melee top are doing fine. Maybe the biggest reason why people dont take toplaners seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2020-02-06T17:16:44.947+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bijeesny,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eNx1aGTK,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2020-02-06T16:55:42.679+0000)\n>\n> I didnt mean it to be offensive, it's just funny how people dont like hash cuz of his behaviour while they're behaving the same way as of recently.\n\nBecause no one listens to us???
