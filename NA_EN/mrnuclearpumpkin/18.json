I don&#039;t understand it at all. Sometimes you get a game where it&#039;s nearly a perfect composition for the mode, and sometimes you just wonder if it&#039;s even really that random.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s because there are legitimately just flat out ARAM-only accounts.  \r\n\r\nNow, is it right to say that every single game has a bunch of ARAM only accounts? No. It&#039;s not. But they do exist and there are a lot of them. And the higher the elo you get in ARAM, the more chances you&#039;ll have of running into ARAM-only accounts. \r\n\r\nThere was a suggestion that I&#039;ve seen quite a few times in the past. And I think that it&#039;s appropriate to bring this up again. \r\n\r\n****Unlock all champions in ARAM only.****\r\n\r\nThis not only insures that every match will be 100% random, but it also allows for everyone to trade with every person. \r\n\r\nYes, this means that sometimes you might get a champion that&#039;s &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;not fun to play&quot;. But that&#039;s the whole point of playing randomness. That&#039;s the point of playing a match where you get a random champion and throw it into a bunch of other randomly chosen champions. It&#039;s the risk you take when you play this mode. And ARAM only accounts, that are outfitted with just the best champions for ARAM matches, kills the entire purpose of the mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-03-16T20:27:50.214+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":100,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrNuclearPumpkin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6Fe1byGl,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-16T20:25:10.006+0000)\n>\n> And the higher the elo you get in ARAM\n\nAhahahahahaha, \"ARAM elo\".\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"MrNuclearPumpkin","date":"2016-03-16T20:36:22.766+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dominick Destine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6Fe1byGl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-16T20:27:50.214+0000)\n>\n> Ahahahahahaha, \"ARAM elo\".\n\nUh huh.

Somebody rolling Lux when they have 100 champions is no different from somebody rolling Lux with 10 champions.

Imagine if your marksman had a chance to do X10 damage instead of X2 with a crit. It's a stupid argument point.\n\nNot to mention that the theme of ARAM is RANDOM. It's in the name. All Random All Mid. What's random about having a champ list of only champions extremely good in ARAM. Let's plug your argument back in again. It's still random, so I'm not going to get it 100% of the time, but would you rather 50% of the time, or 15% of the time? That's the difference.\n\nThe point of random is that you don't know what you're going to get. How is it fair to just increase your odds? Even if you're alone, you still increase the odds for your team because you're more likely to get someone like Lux, and less likely someone really bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Maratsune","date":"2016-03-17T03:13:13.593+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"Obviously the person with ten champions will have a higher chance of rolling a certain champion- that wasn't my point.

So unless you're queued against an ARAM account multiple times in a row, which is generally unlikely, their higher chances of rolling a good champion are completely irrelevant to the rest of the people in their games. \n\nThe only person that advantages or disadvantages from having an ARAM account are the ARAM accounts themselves, and as I said before, if they're willing to devote an entire account to one game mode, then they deserve that higher chance of winning. And besides, an 'ARAM' account to some people could just as likely be somebody's account who favours champions that happen to be good in ARAM.

The odds that, if we use our real world here, has costed shit tons of money or resources. You cheat a randomizer system's major flaw to increase your odds, and you say they deserve to win for it? It becomes less fun when every other ARAM game has a Nidalee Lux Varus combo once you start playing it a lot. How is that random? It goes against the point of the mode and has killed it for some.\n\nAnd how are we taking away the fun out of the system by doing that? By your logic, you can still get the champs so it shouldn't hurt them right?\n\nAlso, don't use ARAM only accounts as an excuse for why they should get what they want. There were Dominion only accounts. Look what happened to them. They lost their mode and got paid with an icon. Having accounts for only one mode should not excuse certain actions being taken.

The only POSSIBLE way ARAM accounts could affect your enjoyment or success with ARAM is if you happened to queue against one every game, which is unlikely. In fact, it's very very likely that you will end up on both the enemy team AND same team of an ARAM account an EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIMES, therefore nullifying any affect they may have completely.\n\nA Nidalee Lux Varus combination every other game is possible regardless of whether any ARAM accounts are involved at all- hence, 'Random.' The only people that ARAM accounts affect are the holders of those accounts, and even then the advantages they gain are nulled by the chance that any one of the enemy players happen to roll a champ that they're skilled at. \n\nWe aren't talking about keeping the game mode around or not. The removal of Dominion is completely irrelevant to this conversation, and now I know that you're grasping for straws when you don't even know what the straw is for.","replies":[{"poster":"Jari","date":"2016-03-17T05:55:39.889+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You really don't know odds then.\n\nUnless you, and I'm saying YOU, are an ARAM only account built like that, your opponent is more likely anyways, since they have 5 chances compared to your 4.\n\nContinuing on here, this is, again, about abusing odds by putting them as much in your favor as possible. Not only does having accounts with just that defeat the reason of random, but it's also telling those that get more interested into it early that it's punishing and a mistake to unlock more things on your account, as you're only ruining your odds. It's stupid and not what the game in general should even be. Unlocking all of the champions in the list period not only makes it so that you don't need an ARAM account, not only makes games more diverse, but it can sometimes have a player find a character they enjoy even more that they don't have yet. Imagine someone getting, say, Viktor on ARAM. Let's say he's never had a chance to play this champion, as he's never got the chance during free week. Let's say he actually enjoys how viktor plays. Boom, he can go get the champion for when he's not on ARAM and he's enjoying himself.\n\nBy definition, random means, \"made, done, happening, or chosen without method or conscious decision.\" Lowering your pool to the minimum best champions is using a method, and therefor defeats what random is. Oh look at that. A definition for you to read so you actually know what random means. What a surprise.\n\nAnd I mentioned dominion because you were saying to give accounts for just a certain mode special treatment (by saying if they do that they deserve more wins.)

Anywho- no matter what champions or how many champions the system has to choose from, it's still random. There's less chances of getting a worse champion, but the champion you get is still going to be technically random. Can't argue that it's random or not random, because it 100% is. (A randomly chosen apple out of 5 apples or a randomly chosen apple out of 1 apple and 99 oranges is still a randomly chosen apple)\n\nAttempting to gain an advantage in a game mode through effort is something that happens in every facet of League- why should ARAM be any different? People who play more have more runes, thus they're more likely to succeed. People who have better internet connections can have faster response times, thus they're more likely to succeed. These aren't unfair advantages gained through trickery and bad design- they're an inherent part of the game. As should be those few that decide they'd like to have a better chance at winning in ARAM. \n\nI admittedly mussed the team chances part up, however- it's kinda like the Monty Hall problem- that specific consideration always sort of goes over my head. But I digress- the odds still aren't too badly against the average non-ARAM account player.\n\nA mode where people can play champions they may not otherwise get to play is a nice idea, but whether it should be shoehorned into a pre-existing game more or worked around more cohesively in a new one is up for debate. It may work quite well in ARAM, and if that was the intention behind a potential redesign I would have no qualms with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
