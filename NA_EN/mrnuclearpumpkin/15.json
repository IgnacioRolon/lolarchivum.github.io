League is not at it&#039;s strongest point at the moment, but you know what? League has had it&#039;s downsides before. League of Black Cleaver anyone? Kassadin being 90+% ban rate for almost two seasons? Renekton being an unstoppable force for who knows how long? There were balance issues back then too. And we&#039;re always going to have balance issues.\r\n\r\nDynamic Q isn&#039;t all that great. And we miss Solo Q. There are champions right now that are so broken that they practically shift the game just by being in the game. (I once saw that Veigar was open and picked him into support. We won) \r\n\r\nAnd maybe you are going to stop. Maybe you really are going to uninstall. Maybe you&#039;re going to put league down and start something else. Maybe you&#039;ll get into Overwatch or Battleborn. Maybe you&#039;ll pick up your dusty PS4/Xbone and play that game you&#039;ve been trying to start. Maybe you&#039;ll start playing DOTA2 or Smite or something. Maybe you&#039;ll go outside and make some friends.\r\n\r\nBut you&#039;re not gonna completely quit league. Eventually, you&#039;ll watch an LCS match. You&#039;ll hear of a new champion. A new item. A new balance change. You&#039;ll see how the meta is shifting. You&#039;ll notice how people are talking about how the new patch is better. Or how fun the new champion is. Or you&#039;ll notice that a few new champions are being reworked. Something is going to bring you back.\r\n\r\nSomething will always pull you back. Even if it&#039;s not playing the game itself.\r\n\r\nLeague is part of our lives now. We love the game. We love the characters.

I'm simply pointing to the fact that one game is free, but puts so many barriers behind content (champs, runes) that adds nothing but pointless grind while the other had a down payment, but you get access to all major content (now and the future) with stuff like cosmetics being unlock able through simply playing the game.\nSecond, that's just bullshit. Having anytging that \"paces\" how you get to progress in learning and playing a game versus letting you go at your own pace is bad design. And don't pretend free rotation helps, all it does is let people play champs that they might enjoy, then rapidly put them away from reach making newer player go through the cycle of learning another round of champs. If anything THAT is going to overwhelm players, especially new ones (not to mention you don't get access to free champs in ranked). \nFinally, some people just don't have time to grind for a few weeks just to get one champ. Punishing people because they don't have the time doesn't need an explanation of why that's stupid. There's a reason why league has a notoriously hard entrance cap for brand new players. Getting all of 136 Heros is staggering especially considering how little ip you get per match (assuming you win each match of course).","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2016-05-14T02:31:38.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">I'm simply pointing to the fact that one game is free, but puts so many barriers behind content (champs, runes) that adds nothing but pointless grind\n\nThat is the hitch when you play a free to play game.

That's a bullshit excuse and you know it. Dota 2 is completely free, giving access to all heros, yet still somehow manages to make literally millions from the game solely from cosmetics. Where's the hitch there? Oh wait there is none.  And let's be honest here, no one buys IP, Riot makes it money from people paying money for RP, which there is no way to earn other then paying. There's nothing rewarding about grind, it's for artificial game time increase. It's called grind for a reason.\n\nHow will I grind the IP though if I'm forced to play new champs I have no idea how to play? I will most likely lose, vastly decreasing my IP. And what If i fall in love with another champ? Then I need to grind for two champs. But what if another rotation comes and I fall in love with yet a third champ? See how this turns into a vicious cycle that leads no where? And that's not even touching on the runes or rune pages (which some argue can turn into a p2w factor since runes do indeed give advantages over those with no runes), which cost a hefty 6300 IP.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2016-05-14T04:14:54.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">Dota 2 is completely free, giving access to all heros, yet still somehow manages to make literally millions from the game solely from cosmetics.\n\nhttp://www.kdramastars.com/articles/14664/20140123/dota-2-vs-lol.htm\n\n>And let's be honest here, no one buys IP, Riot makes it money from people paying money for RP, which there is no way to earn other then paying.\n\n... huh?\nI didn't say you could buy IP, Riot doesn't sell it.

Still doesn't take away from the fact that Riot could make EVEN MORE if they followed Dota's example. \n\nHow is it bullshit? How do you know that someone will like them? Different champs have different things, from aesthetics to gameplay. I hated Ashe when I first played her. Yes, I know I'm not representative of an entire gaming population, but the point stands. Chances are other people may not like them either. And the issue is not whether or not someone is going to find a champ they enjoy. The issue comes when you want to keep them permanently. Braum is fun, I agree with you, but he's a hefty 6300. Someone whose just getting into the game or may play leisurely won't be getting that anytime soon. (Fyi you can't earn mastery for a champ you don't own). And again, I bring up ranked play. You can't use free rotation in ranked. High quality/meta champs are expensive in terms of IP, and in matches that are heavily focused on winning, you want the best champs to choose. I don't know if any of the 450 champs are top tier, aside from maybe Ryze?\n\nBut it IS decaying. Can you honestly say Riot listens to community feedback? No. Can you say the game is in a balanced state where most champs are played? Absolutely not. The pro scene showed that with a handful of champs always being picked for roles(tank ekko, graves jungle). Can you say matchmaking is in a state that ensure fair and fun games? Depends on who you ask, but usually the answer is no. Pro's even have issues with it. Yes, they are pumping out new content, a new champ is to come out soon. But that is inherently the problem. Riot is pushing more and more content into a game that severely needs a balance check. They are making it harder and harder for them to maintain any semblance of balance. Instead of simply stepping back, looking at champs and tweaking numbers here and there to help some champs that are in ruts and bring others down a notch, they just push new content. And honestly, that's what they want, because they know players like you are going to jump on the FotM bandwagon and forgot about whatever current issue is going on. \"Make it a 21st century game\"? No, it was already a modern game. Tell me, how is the game feeling better than it use to when, for example, with the mid-season update, they added RNG to dragon spawns? Riot said they wanted to remove RNG from the game, its why they removed evasion a long time ago, yet here they are adding RNG. Seriously think about what I have said, rather then just trying to blow off my arguments with fallacies, as this is my last response to you.\n\nI guarantee you haven't been playing a long time, probably only for maybe two years or so, if you honestly believe the game is \"better than it used to\".","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2016-05-14T08:56:40.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">And? Riot makes more, ok. Still doesn't take away from the fact that Riot could make EVEN MORE if they followed Dota's example.\n\nNo, they couldn't, because if they could, Dota would be making more.  Instead in 2013 Dota2 didn't even make 1/8th of the revenue that League of Legends did.  This is because Valve doesn't need to rely on the revenue from Dota2 to keep it's doors open, Riot does.  So Riot made a free to play system that (while slightly outdated and in need of some updating in terms of pricing and gain) actually works without gouging players and forcing them to pay to win.  It's not perfect, no F2P system is or could be, but it's a lot easier on the player than many other systems.\n\n>But it IS decaying. Can you honestly say Riot listens to community feedback?\n\nYes, yes I can.  I frequent these forums, I read the posts, I see the responses, I watch surrender@20.  While Riot is slow in their actions, they **DO** listen!  The issue is most people think that a suggestion should be implemented within days or a week of Riot hearing about it or responding to it.  But if you watch long enough, it may take 1-5 months, but you'll start to see a lot of player feed back getting reactions and a lot of suggestions being implemented.\n\n>Can you say the game is in a balanced state where most champs are played?\n\nThat's not how League works.  It relies on the metagame.  Being that once something is strong, people will seek a way to counter it, the counter will become strong/popular and the former pick will go to the wayside until a strong/popular champ is weak against them.  \n\nIt's not a perfect system.  You've got champs with kits too similar to the point that you simply pick which ever champ you prefer or whichever just does the job better than the others.  \n\nYou've got champs that have inherently unhealthy kits that cannot be allowed to be strong or else they will begin to warp the meta.\n\nThen you've got the ever popular generalists who are sufficient in virtually any meta you can think of and naturally are going to constantly have high pick rates because of the safety they offer.\n\n>The pro scene showed that with a handful of champs always being picked for roles\n\nThe pro meta is also nothing like the general meta at any other elo.  It can point to issues with champs, but is unreliable as a single source of information.  If looking at the meta, you should typically consider Gold up to Master without counting the pro league.  You'll get a much wider and more reliable information pool to pull from.\n\n>Riot is pushing more and more content into a game that severely needs a balance check.

But they aren't.  The balance team does one thing, they monitor balance of each and every champ and try to make adjustments as they feel necessary.\n\nAlso, compared to 2012 when Riot released **19** champions.  We got  5 new champs last year.  They **HAVE** slowed down to focus more on balance.  \n\nI think the bigger question, is does your ideal of balance line up with Riots?\n\n>I guarantee you haven't been playing a long time, probably only for maybe two years or so\n\nMid season 3.  \nWhile they still have hiccups from time to time.  The balance as a whole has improved.\nOr do you want the jungle Trio back? {{champion:64}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:254}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2016-05-13T22:18:30.569+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except people are quitting. What?\n\nTake for example some of us who are top 100 most played NA. Like I have over 20-25k games played. I haven't played this game actively in the last 5 months and neither have the others who enjoyed this game so much for the first 4 seasons.\n\nI've pretty much quit and log in to play a game or two here and there to see if the game has changed enough for me to come back. So many people have quit this game and that is why Riot has been cutting resources and trying to bring back the feel of the game. When they push this amount of content and keep trying to make huge changes it's because they are seeing a dip in players. The boxes were a way to keep players attached in to a \"grind/reward\" tactic.\n\nI don't enjoy the way this game has changed. Solo impact has been nerfed into the ground, individual skill has less of an impact on lane phase, and now champion select is winning games. This is not the league of legends I enjoyed so much back in the earlier seasons. I play one game and I'm disappointed beyond believe in the current balance of the game. I'm disgusted by the player base.\n\nYou say \"you aren't quitting\" but you do realize there is a lot of people who aren't saying they are quitting but are actually quitting. I get what you are trying to say but you are really pushing attention away from the real issue with the game in its current state and it's having a huge impact.","replies":[{"poster":"ZigZags25","date":"2016-05-14T04:42:52.684+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for writing this.
