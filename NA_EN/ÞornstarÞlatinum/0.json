In previous times I bought similar bundles but this time I can't do it. Is this a bug or is it really blocked to people who previously bought such bundles?\r\nIf it's a bug, how can I fix it (or will Riot fix it)? \r\nThanks you for the help","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T20:49:53.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not entirely sure I know what your specific issue is.  When you click on the bundle to buy it, do you get a particular error message?  Can you take a screenshot of this error?\n\nLet me know!","replies":[]}]}
