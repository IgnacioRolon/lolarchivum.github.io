It has absolutely no basis in either gameplay or statistics and leads to people respecting Yasuo far more than they should. All of Yasuo's stats go down as player skill increases which is the opposite of what you would expect to happen if what you said is true. And in game, there are tons of things you can do in every possible matchup to significantly increase your odds regardless of what the Yasuo is doing. I can't promise that it will be easy on every champ but even champs like Lux and Ziggs can handle Yasuo if played well even if the Yasuo is good. This champ absolutely oozes counterplay and the idea that \"you have to wait for Yasuo to outplay himself\" is a load of nonsense and always has been. Worse, that mindset encourages passive play which is exactly what you should **not** be doing vs. him in most matchups.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-06-20T00:42:28.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably because higher up, they know to 2v1 him and not 1v1 him with a skillshot Mage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2017-06-19T19:58:16.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WTF DARIUS ADC ,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g9x7XddN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-19T19:53:14.977+0000)\n>\n> https://i.gyazo.com/493aeb3767262678c6176318615607fb.png\n> \n> reworking a balanced champion in the first place is a mistake\n> \n> they never did that before\n> no champion who got reworked was an example of balance unlike yasuo who can be considered about how a melee carry should be unlike feast or famin carries like trynd who splitpush if ending up behind\n> \n> yasuo is being reworked because of 50% ban rate\n> meanwhile lulu and fiora rework? lulu has 50% ban rate since march 2017 now and nothing was done\n> \n> you seriously think that people like to play against lulu? against a no counterplay laning phase while getting outplayed in teamfight by her buffing her adc+protecting him?\n> \n> then think again you fool\n\nBecause Lulu isn't a problem lol.

If they only balance and rework for high elo then good luck keeping this game alive.","replies":[{"poster":"ACENOX","date":"2017-06-20T00:08:01.932+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"you do realise that yasuo isn't op at all elo?","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-06-20T04:25:27.383+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You do realize that people don't call Yasuo OP but just unfun to play against due to an overloaded kit right?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-06-20T05:06:36.831+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yasuo is not reworked for being a \"meme\" or being op.

But Yasuo goes \"over the top\" by having hypermobility which is at the same levels of Nidalee or Kassadin in URF.......\n\nYes, I know he needs minions to dash around. But this doesn't solve the issue with 0.1s cd dashes.\nMost champions with multiple dashes on the same ability got a cooldown or an internal cooldown. Take Ahri or Akali for example, they both need to wait around 1 second in between dashes. Yasuo can dash though the entire minion wave in that second >.>\nAnd the likes of riven, despite having no big 'cd' on her Q and can literally Q dash 3 times in a row very quickly, she then needs to wait up for cooldown before using her Q again.\n\nYasuo doesn't, Yasuo has 0.1s cooldown on his dash. As long as there's shit nearby, he can use it.\nIts hard to even point and click spells on him for fucks's sake","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinigamiOtaku","date":"2017-06-19T20:51:34.795+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i always felt that if they would throw his passive into his ult and make it scale with it (10%-25%-50% more crit) would make him easier to deal with while keeping his main type of damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkZ DoPe","date":"2017-06-19T22:27:57.063+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"the less I play with or against one the better, that's the reason for me why i ban him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darth West","date":"2017-06-19T20:16:56.475+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"I see people who are down voting me are the ones that aren't replying to the thread at all.\n\nDon't blame you, guess you're not wanting to embarrass your self and say the same things as you always do.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nI just recently had a guy tell me \"When a Yasuo is picked on the enemy team you are forced to pick CC!!\"\n\nQuestion is..
