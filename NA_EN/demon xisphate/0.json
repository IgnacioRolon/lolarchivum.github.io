It looks like you were able to forge that key and open a chest. If you're still missing some keys that you crafted, it may just be a delay in the client that's preventing it from showing up. Try to close out of the client and reopen it, and that should refresh your inventory!","replies":[{"poster":"Demon Xisphate","date":"2017-03-24T05:01:12.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have done that and I even played a few games afterwards but there was still no change","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T20:29:28.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you open chests, you won't necessarily always get a champion or skin shard.
