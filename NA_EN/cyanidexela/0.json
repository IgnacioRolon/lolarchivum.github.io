A teammate and i asked the fiddlesticks on our team to play a more useful jungle because our team was already really squishy.  He said if he didn&#039;t do well as fiddle, flame him all we wanted.  he proceeded to go 0/2 in landing phase and continued to be absolutely useless in team fights.  He would just be off taking krugs while we were team fighting and was just a horrible teammate.  I posted the chat log below, and yea, I&#039;m not being the nicest guy but a 14 day suspension seems real harsh...

I've rallied crappy teams in the mid-to-late game just be being level headed, friendly, and trying to get everyone to overlook small mistakes and focus on working together. It's a skill I'd consider almost as important to ranking up in solo queue as your raw mechanical performance.\n\nRemember -- you can't carry everyone on raw skill alone once you get out of MMRs way too low for you. But you can support those struggling and help stop them tilting further.\n\n\n> cyanideXELA: thresh waht man\n> cyanideXELA: wtf was that\n> cyanideXELA: LOOL\n> cyanideXELA: BAD\n> cyanideXELA: i seem to recal you saying shit on you if you suck with fiddle\n> cyanideXELA: 0/2 usless in teamfights\n> cyanideXELA: FIDDEL\n> cyanideXELA: WHAT ARE YOU DOING\n> cyanideXELA: dude that was 100% your baad\n> cyanideXELA: youve been nothing but stuoid\n\nI get that you're frustrated with him, but that's really no excuse to abuse him. Remember -- 50% of ANY player's games are below their average performance. It's mathematically obvious, but you'd be surprised how many players fail to grasp that, on average, 2-3 of the players on their team (including possible them) may be underperforming their average performance. The trick is to accept that people are human, that bad games happen, and that it doesn't make that player a bad player, a bad person, or anything of the sort.\n\nIt also doesn't matter that he asked you to \"shit on him.\" That's not an excuse for toxicity (since everyone else has to see it and experience it as well), and, if anyone reports you, you ARE still answerable for your actions and words.\n\nFinally, remember -- *League* expects you to have a 50% win rate if your MMR is accurate. Sometimes it'll be a bit higher if your MMR is lower than the system estimates, and sometimes it'll be a bit lower if the system thinks your MMR is higher than it should be. If you persevere it'll even out at the right level for your skill eventually -- but if you're not prepared to lose between 45-55% of your games? *League* may not be the game for you.\n\n> cyanideXELA: SUCH A %%% CHAMP\n> cyanideXELA: %%%\n> cyanideXELA: %%%\n\nRiot has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for this sort of derogatory language. They punish aggressively for it, and it almost always escalates punishments to a 14-day ban, if not directly to a permanent ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AzureDragoon","date":"2017-05-15T18:13:27.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going by only this single game log alone that was posted, you used offensive slurs three times. Use of such language is considered as Hate Speech violation according to the League of Legend rules, and is often elevated to a 14-day suspension minimum. \n\nDo make note that the next punishment tier after this is a Permanent Ban, and that goes for any sort of punishable offense regardless of how severe it is. It will take a long time of consistently good behavior in order for you to drop back down in tiers, and be considered reform. It would be best to keep in mind that you've been given the \"Last chance\" warning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-05-15T18:01:10.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'm not being the nicest guy but a 14 day suspension seems real harsh\n\nDura lex sed lex.\n\nAlso be aware that the next one is the permanent ban, and it arrives pretty quickly, and for less than these chatlogs after a 14 days ban. \n\nI strongly advise you to either change your behaviour or to unbind your \"enter\" key from your keyboard if you want to keep your account.\n\n> I like to win.
