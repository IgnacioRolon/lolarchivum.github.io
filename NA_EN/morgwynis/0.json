This keyboard has a specific ergonomic area that is meant for gaming alone (which I use instead of the normal keyboard), pressing the E key in this area instantly tabs out League and goes straight to Cortana (which I had fully disabled before).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T22:48:35.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can be a little hard for us to troubleshoot those keyboards since we didn't have a hand in developing them, but I did a little research for you and it looks like those Merstealths are a part of the steelseries keyboards. I'd first double check that you've got all of your drivers updated by checking [**this site**](https://steelseries.com/downloads). If that doesn't help, you might be able to find some better support by looking through their forums.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgwynis","date":"2017-07-19T11:30:35.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem was driver related. With the new Windows 10 Creator update it apparently wiped the keyboard driver from my system overriding any settings the keyboard brought innately. A quick download of the required driver fixed the issue.","replies":[]}]}]}
