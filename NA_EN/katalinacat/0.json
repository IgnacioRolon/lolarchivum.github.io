I mean, there are so many other champs who just aren&#039;t even honestly anything *cough{{champion:6}} urgotcough*, but I&#039;m not saying that {{champion:99}} lux isn&#039;t OP or anything, or that she&#039;s broken or whatever. she&#039;s just so simple. I mean, you have her q, which roots; her w, which provides a shield; her e, which slows and explodes; and her r, which KSes and annoys everyone to death. her passive is this: Illumination - {{champion:99}} Lux&#039;s damaging spells charge the target with energy for 6 seconds. {{champion:99}} Lux&#039;s next attack ignites the energy, dealing bonus magic damage (depending on {{champion:99}} Lux&#039;s level) to the target. basically, you can put a little light mark that mean that they take more damage while its on them. I mean, great, but...\r\nits just so\r\nsimple\r\nnot that simple is bad. it can be great! but the thing is, all the new champs and the new reworks have all this shit going on with them, like {{champion:202}} Jhin&#039;s w can stun, and he has all that stuff with fourth shot, and you can stack crit, do lifesteal, have some mad ad. with {{champion:99}} lux, you can build ability power. I mean, you can build other stuff, but....it normally leads to defeat.\r\nand then there is {{champion:164}} Camille, who has all this stuff with different shield types, bonus damage, awesome combos, ect. {{champion:99}} lux doesn&#039;t really have a huge opportunity for amazing combos. you can use combos, but they are never quite as wowing as all the intricate little combos of other champs.\r\nand with the reworks, like with {{champion:19}} Warwick, it just has so much potential and room for creativity, like with taking {{summoner:6}} ghost, or what to build, and all those fun little passives and combos.\r\nI am by no means implying some huge monumental rework that changes her entirely, but maybe something like, I don&#039;t know, bonus mana for certain hits, movement speed bursts, some sort of passive that&#039;s a lot of fun, little things that can be played with, like {{champion:202}} jhins stun, {{champion:164}} Camille&#039;s shield, or {{champion:19}} Warwick&#039;s...everything. because as much as I love {{champion:99}} lux, she is kinda just &#039;qwer&#039; and &#039;passive&#039;.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-28T22:58:53.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is fine. 100% skillshot and positioning reliant.\nNot every champion needs to be complicated.","replies":[{"poster":"katalinacat","date":"2017-02-04T03:49:21.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they could at least improve her mana regen though","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-02-04T03:57:21.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rarely have issues after 2x Doran's Rings and Morellonomicon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-04T04:28:42.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Running out of mana on lux = doing something horribly wrong or just bad.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"katalinacat","date":"2017-02-04T04:05:19.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just feel that with all the newer champions who have so many intricacies, lux may get a bit lost behind them, and it would break my heart if that were to happen","replies":[]},{"poster":"hunterspec","date":"2017-01-28T22:57:58.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lux is simple? you should of made this post about {{champion:1}} then","replies":[]}]}
