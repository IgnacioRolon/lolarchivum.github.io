Can i get a response for this? I don't use any programs that should ban me for hacks or anything of the sort, and I have never once been banned for verbal harassment, so this would be a permanent ban for the first ban.\n\nEdit: I got messaged by a friend in game, but it did not show his name in the message and just said \"System message: Due to the decision of the Player Behavior &amp; Justice, your account has been suspended permanently after this game.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T04:23:42.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/e2/e2494b2dae9d4c537141a47eaad0913f6732f4839e20513804ad74f4fa7d28be.jpg\n\nSooooooo it looks like your friend may have played a bit of a prank on you. Your account is not currently banned, and that message was most likely sent by your friend using the emote chat function. Let me know if you were talking about a different account so I can check up on that one if so!","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-07-29T13:09:08.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broporo,\n\nIf you could please pass on to whatever team made /me that it isn't very funny due to cases like in the OP.  For every person posting here, there are likely thousands that aren't posting; just sitting there worried about their account for no reason.\n\nSome of them are younger and won't research what happened.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXxDaMilkManxXx","date":"2017-07-29T06:56:53.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think someone is doing this everywhere!!!!!!!!!\nI got the same exact message, I actually almost cried due to my poor self worth because im my previous game i ran into the group of duo's who just threaten to report you for nothing!! I left it alone and kept playing and seeing that message made my heart drop. The whole game i sat there tears in my eyes as urgot swallowed me whole. \n\nglad to hear its just a joke thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
