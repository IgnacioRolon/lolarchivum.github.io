Arcane shift cancels it out!","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"ok I was playing a game earlier today as a Blitz crank support, I was fighting with my adc Teemo and we were against a ezreal and a soraka, anyway as my bud was invisible I was lureing in ezreal to come in closer so i can pull him in and uppercut him so that way teemo can still attack him why he&#039;s in the air!\r\n\r\nNow when i used my grab ability on him, it hit him, but as it was pulling him back all of a sudden Ezreal suddenly used his arcane shift while he was being pulled in by my grab, the arm was still attached to him as it happened right after he reappeared and I thought, heh your still getting pulled to me, but then to my surprise, Ez was running the other way with my arm for 1 second and then the next the entire arm animation just disappeared!\r\n\r\nBoth me and the teemo said WTF? in chat confused on why he wasn&#039;t pulled in! At first we thought it wouldn&#039;t happen again\r\n\r\nguess what IT DID, the grab was successful again and just when he was about to reach us he used that skill and tped away from us and the arm with him until it disappeared!\r\n\r\nThis Glitch or bug usually happened when the blitz grab is at it&#039;s farthest/half farthest way, and just when the grab is good and starts pulling ez uses that ability again and cancels out my grab by him not coming to me after he reappeared with the arm still clearly attached to him!\r\n\r\nIt was complete bs that game! I really wish I was recording but my frame rate gets really bad all of a sudden during that..so yeah...anyway \r\n\r\n\r\nAren&#039;t Blitz&#039;s rocket grabs silents people while they are being pulled in/can&#039;t be used during the grab? Cause Ez sure as heck was able to when he kept escaping with the teleport even  the arm made contact with him and started pulling him in!\r\n\r\nif this is a bug/glitch then please patch it!","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-07-21T12:21:09.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is working as intended. If you hit ezreal with anything during the cast time of arcane shift he still moves and cancels any displacements. If it rooted or something like that it would apply at the end of the movement.\n\nYou can't cast while being pulled, but arcane shift had already been used and he just hadn't finished casting it yet.","replies":[{"poster":"RedvsBlueCaboose","date":"2016-07-23T00:34:07.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooh, ok then o-o this is the first time I ever herd or had this happen to me before, so yeah...don't play blitz much and i thought it was a bug by how the arm went all screwy o-o\n\nbut i really don't get why so much negativity rating for this post of mine like seriously i didn't know that was a thing on league for ez to do o-o","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RedvsBlueCaboose","date":"2016-07-21T11:52:18.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok why isn't this post being showed o-o","replies":[]}]}
