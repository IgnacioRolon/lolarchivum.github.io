Since I don&#039;t really wanna lose that LP, I am basically forced to play a game on my laptop, which just is not good for gaming. I will bet that my performance after such a big break + my bad laptop will be horrible and I will be a big reason why my team will lose.\r\n\r\nTherefore, why force someone, like me, to play a game like this and cost 4 other teammates a game? I understand the decay mechanism at the highest tiers to avoid position holding etc, but in plat and diamond, this shouldn&#039;t be a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-06-28T17:27:49.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but you probably lost around the same amount of LP for playing that game?","replies":[{"poster":"Kalistarc","date":"2018-06-28T17:29:52.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I indeed lost the game, I did terribly, alongside my teammates. I lost 19 LP. It's not so much about how many LP I lost, but more about the way I lost them. I don't want to lose them without even playing a game, and I don't want play a ranked game when I'm very rusty.","replies":[]}]}]}
