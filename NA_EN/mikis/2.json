And the sound only turns off once you finish the game and enter new lobby (like it overwrites it). So is there any option maybe to disable the ambient lobby sounds without disabling the SFX for client? Disabling SFX would mean no sound for Match found, so thats no go for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T22:37:15.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh....that's pretty weird tbh. It must be some sort of hang up with the client not correctly suspending during the game. Try turning on 'close client during game' in the client options and let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Mikis","date":"2017-11-07T07:13:11.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But didnt you guys say that you will be disabling that feature soon? So if it would helo, it would only for a short time","replies":[]}]}]}
