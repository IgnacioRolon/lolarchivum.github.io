I played 2000 games, got my honor basically maxed out, and it's all gone. Why? Because a full team decided to troll me. \r\n\r\nFirst of all you should not allow a player who has reported you to re-queue in your next game WTF were you thinking?! This asshole got to torture me on my promos for two whole hours, insulting me, stealing kills, stealing cs, banning my champ, refusing to cooperate, and I'm expected to just not react?! WTF. Yeah I got tilted and defended myself to constant verbal abuse and throwing. I got salty and said some mundane common ass insults you'd find in literally any game and just because enough people decided to report me I got a chat restriction and my honors stripped by some stupid ass bot.\r\n\r\nI contacted support on this issue because I know how salty games get and that I was not out of line especially being attacked like that. And they didn't care. But that's just what riot is like. They don't care about their players because there will always be plenty of people who's wallets they can suck dry. So fuck me right?\r\n\r\nWell I'm glad I know where you stand. I'm glad I know that I can report people just because I don't like them if they do anything that even remotely fits into any of the reportable categories. I'm glad I know that if I really don't like someone and I feel like my team feels the same we can gang up on them and get them muted or banned for no good reason whatsoever. I'm glad I know...","replies":[{"poster":"AcidOrchid","date":"2019-12-15T00:10:36.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I came here to post the same thing. I was at top honor level, and got stuck in a game with a troll account playing Anivia who kept getting me killed on purpose with ice wall. I admit I flamed but I got banned by a bot, and lost all honor. Submitted a ticket and riot didn't care. I won't be giving them anymore money, debating on if I will even play anymore. I couldn't even report after I left lobby because their name was like 11111111111IIIIII or something. Obviously an account made just for trolling, but I lose 5 years of honor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waka FIocka","date":"2019-12-14T19:45:26.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it really sucks that typing in chat is more important to support than someone throwing/griefing hours and hours and HOURS worth of games for countless people. I'm talking  people with an account solely made for griefing with hundreds of games played in all the same toxic manner. You can mute a flamer. You can mute someone calling you a r%%%%%. This game is not rated for minors and chat can be completely removed from all your games if you want to never see it again.\n\nbut you can't remove a troll from your game. You can't mute their intention to never take a single cs and yuumi around you because they didn't get to play the flashy new champion they wanted. You can't even ban them to avoid playing another game with them. Their behavior makes the game miserable for everyone and there is nothing players can do aside from report (which riot support loves to mention that a 1x report is the same level of agency as a x9 report) after enduring 20+ minutes of completely unfair bs and pray not run into them again. \n\nalso how does riot expect players to behave when they allow streamers with thousands to tens of thousands of viewers to sit in their games and flame their teammates to shit. I'm talking like calling their teammates useless, braindead, r%%%%%ed, and i personally have seen then spew much worse insults like %%%%%% and kill yourself on streams like ratirl's. like .... ok. I've seen a clip on t1's stream of him (after he 'reformed') as heim selling all his items to spam buy + place control wards in fountain. I've seen streamers rage quit. They still stream and play on multiple accounts though with no chat suspension or anything. lol\n\nriot is not gonna do anything about that but he moment a regular player says anything even remotely snarky it's a chat suspension leading up to a ban with all honor progress and privileges removed. support told me the other day that i could very well be punished for telling a griefer to 'enjoy their ban'. \n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Dont AD Carry","date":"2019-12-16T19:15:32.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean their is a mute button for these reason.
