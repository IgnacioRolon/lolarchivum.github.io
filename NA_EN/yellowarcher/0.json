For the second time in the past couple of months, my client crashed right after the game loaded. Every attempt to rejoin was met with another crash, so I restarted League entirely. Naturally, some files had been corrupted _by the game itself_. So I got to sit around and wait for League to try to repair itself. By the time I finally got back in, the game had been remade and I was given the Leaver title in my match history.\r\n\r\nMy reward for trying to play tonight was an LP loss and a shameful match history. I understand that writing code to recognize situations like mine is insane on the face of it, but I also can't imagine what could possibly cause a game to corrupt itself under completely normal circumstances. I can't express how discouraging it is when shit like this happens. I just want to play, but I'm being punished for trying.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T03:36:46.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We understand that sometimes *shit just breaks*. This is why you'll never receive a penalty for crashing out of or disconnecting from a single game. However, if a trend of disconnections or leaves occurs on your account, you can eventually earn a low-priority queue. Corruptions that force you to repair typically point towards either a poor installation (if not in the default directory) or missing system permissions that League heavily relies on.\n\nI strongly recommend working through our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to ensure you've configured League to run with the right access rights.
