I tried looking up on the hextech crafting guide but did not find any answer. I also play a lot of league, i play for hours everyday so i don't think that if i keep playing i will get one :(. sorry if i seem impatient but i'm just really excited because i got a nice legacy skin in an orb during the arcade event and the honor capsule i got so far only gave me champion shards :(","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-25T20:03:26.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only get 12 a month, but you can get more per week if you play a lot.
