I think champions SHOULD be designed around professional level of play.  If you have a champion with a high skill cap and a low skill cap and you assume that players arent going to be able to fully access one champions power you get situations like kalista vs garen where one character can literally do nothing against the other character once both players reach a certain level of skill.  Or situations where games can be carried by a single long range mage because no one thought that nidalee or xerath would be able to land that many skillshots.\n\nTrying to acheive both is impossible unless you do what riot has been doing and basically designate an entire group of champions as \"not allowed to be viable on pro scene\" and another group that is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2015-08-17T07:01:46.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Instead, they're just plain cancer whenever they show up in solo queue.\n\nAin't Heimer the fucking greatest?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-08-17T08:55:21.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UbAKH2HT,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-17T06:46:01.422+0000)\n>\n> This statement makes the assumption that our balance goals are aimed only at the pro scene.

Riot has failed at doing this and any time a champion achieves this and becomes strong in a unique way they overnerf it because like i said they want 15 champions to be viable.  95% of the time those champions have everything needed to succeed(no discernable weakness) and the only reason they are played is because at hte moment they are numerically stronger than the other champion who is similar.","replies":[{"poster":"Koldheartedjsp","date":"2015-08-17T06:59:40.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this simply isn't true.\n\ntake warwick for example\n\nwithout some sort of drastic change/meta shift, there just simply isn't enough he brings to a team to warrant picking him over someone else.

Riot has made too many champions that can do everything.  The problem isnt people like garen or warwick arent viable the problem is you have to actually build a composition around them and you can only play them in certain situations and thats much more difficult to pull off. especially in things like lcs games where you need to be at a certain standard of mechanics that requires practice that you simply cant do for 10 diff champions.  Not only that but the way their system is set up encourages sticking to the meta.  All of the teams that are high enough calibre for them to practice against are the same teams they will be playing against in the lcs so theres no point in them practicing gimmicky one game comps because in order to do that they give away the secret.\n\nhonestly riot couldve and probably could still do this if they deleted most of certainlyts champions.  There are new champions that dont have this problem and actually do what i was talking about really well(like braum for example, he has a very specific role and hes not completely overloaded.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2015-08-17T07:48:58.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w\n\nLook it up please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2015-08-17T11:07:47.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, how exactly do you propose balancing the game among the champions?\n\nThe way things are, some champions will always be relevant, while others may pop in and out of popularity. In an ever-shifting game where numbers are constantly adjusted, mechanics are added and removed, the items may change, and even the very Summoner's Rift may change.\n\nYes, Lee Sin can do quite a lot for a champion who has a traditional ultimate (unlike say Nidalee, Elise, or Jayce who sacrifice a traditional ultimate for more abilities), and it can frustrate those who play a champion who lacks the ability to easily clear walls like he can, but that is his gimmick, he can be all over the place. The trade-off is that to make the best of his kit, he has to go all-in, even if it could mean his death at the hands of a better team who can cripple him with just a measly silence? What is a Lee Sin going to do if he tries to Q to the enemy team's Sona, then gets silenced and knocked up by their Cho'Gath, and then cursed by Mordekaiser and turned into a ghost, but other than a Gangplank who runs Cleanse, what champion could deal with that situation?\n\nLee Sin is extremely ability reliant, a silence alone ruins him in a way it would not ruin, say... a Warwick. A Warwick who is disabled by a silence still has auto-attacks, so in the time a silence begins and ends, he can still auto-attack a few times, which is where the source of most of his damage comes from. The trade-off is that unless the enemy is positioned in such a way, he would not be able to just wall-jump to get to an enemy without his ultimate. The reason Lee Sin is favored in LCS is because at that level, the single largest priority is simply to not die, and Lee Sin is very good as avoiding death via escape, which is why Lee Sin sees more LCS play than Warwick would. Save for a team comp built around a Warwick, or a comp that Warwick heavily compliments, a Lee Sin jungling would be preferred over a Warwick jungle because a Warwick isn't as good as getting away as, say, a Lee Sin would be.\n\nAhri? Good at escaping.\nLeblanc? Good at escaping (why do you think Faker was undefeated with her for the longest time).\nLucian? Good at escaping.\nRenekton? Good at escaping.\nRiven? Good at escaping.\n\nAll those champions I listed are not only good at escaping, their escapes are dashes that don't require an enemy to interact with. A Kalista is not going to escape from the enemy team unless she has someone hard-chasing her who she can kite off of, so her escape is not as favorable as say, a Lucian who has an unconditional dash only limited by mana and eventually only by cooldown. Balancing the game at the LCS level is not the same as balancing at the normal ranked or unranked level, because the mentalities are so different that you might as well be playing another game.\n\nAn LCS team would rather a strategy with 90% effectiveness even if it never got them a single kill on the enemy team, rather than a 50% effectiveness strategy of simply fighting the enemy team. Their desire to win supersedes any arbitrary score like a KDA, your KDA of 40/0/20 is not the same as last-hitting the enemy nexus. At our level? We aren't in the LCS, we don't get anything beyond an increase in our rank (in ranked play only) or a sense of personal accomplishment, so we seek to get the best KDA because it's the only way to validate ourselves, deep down regardless of what we say, most of us often would rather consistently go 20/5/10 and lose than go 2/4/5 consistently and win, even if this was to continue for the end of time.\n\nThat is why it's impossible to compare balance around LCS with balance around normal/ranked.","replies":[]}]}
