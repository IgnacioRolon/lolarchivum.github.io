Unfortunately, they weren&#039;t there to help friends learn, and only were there to go all out and stomp the new players. In my game, it ended up being me and another smurf on our team vs the 3 on theirs, while the other 5 players were just there trying (but not doing much). \r\nAlso, in the bot games they make you play, people would get very mad very quickly for any mistake anyone made. Even for taking garen down bot lane. Like, these are literally brand new players and people would cuss them out and say how bad they are. \r\nSo my friend no longer wants to play because they think they&#039;re bad and it&#039;s not fun, which is really sad because they never even had a chance to learn.","replies":[{"poster":"xBushx","date":"2016-06-29T18:56:20.396+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be solved BIG TIME by allowing us to link accounts.\n\nThis would allow Actual New players.

It's not that they don't care, it's just that they have a lot on their plate.

This is all a universal problem. The issue is majority of players are basically in the silver-bronze tier lowest brackets. Because of these people, Riot is going towards directions no one wants. Now when new players join, you either go against asshole smurfs who think you should play like pro's or people equally as bad as you but they think for some weird reason they are much better than you. Riot doesn't see that it's mostly this bracket range (the lowest tiers in the game in terms of proven skill) is where a lot of problems lay.\n\nBasically scrubs thinking they're the shit and ruining it for everyone. Then when balance issues or game system changes arise, these scrubs have the most say because they make up so much in numbers. I remember back in the day when Riot had balls and didn't bend just because people complained about things being too OP or something was wrong. Like back in the day, we had solved a problem to ending toxicity. Ignore every damn person. We really don't need chat. If Riot doesn't find a need to implement voice chat in fear of toxicity, why is type chat any different? We've proven on consistent basis you don't need anything but pings. We had a society that was accepting that you can't forcibly stop people from being %%%%s. If they act like dbags who can't control their temper, there's a reason for that and what some random guy online says won't change that. So this was why you muted. There were a large group of players (primarily vets when I joined) who said people who used to word \"toxic\" were the real toxic ones. EVERYONE is prone to getting angry in this game. It's just how it is. If you are an extremely happy and positive person, then good for you but for average people there's a physical chemistry that goes on in your brain that causes that same \"tilt\" or toxicity. EVERY player can get salty and toxic. If you can't get salty or toxic, then you should seriously be worried because you might lack the function that makes your brain \"fight/flight\" aka survival instincts.\n\nThe issue was resolving this and we had the answer. Everyone who muted most people or could ignore chat never seemed to have problems with trolling or raging teammates. I understand \"hiding the problem\" doesn't fix it but this isn't hiding. Again like I said, you're not that special that what you say would forcibly change how some arrogant prick online feels. The best you can do is to contain and limit as much collateral damage as possible aka not spreading toxicity. Best way to not let toxicity spread is to just ignore it. And @people who can't let things go... you can be one of those tough guys who go \"I'm not letting some kid talk trash to me and walk away,\" LOL this is a video game.

Also, if their match making system worked liked that, there would be an even number of smurfs. Most of our games were very one sided. Also, he and I both encountered smurfs in our first matches. The problem is that HALF of the number of players are smurfs, which makes the other half of the players feel like they&#x27;ll get dominated every game, and lose interest\n\nNo, by playing with him, you inflated his MMR to the smurf MMR. He'll encounter smurfs even without playing with you until he loses enough matches.","replies":[{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2016-06-30T15:21:10.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeszarck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xiae6bRL,comment-id=001600000000,timestamp=2016-06-30T15:19:22.076+0000)\n>\n> No, by playing with him, you inflated his MMR to the smurf MMR.

I think most people win their bot games, so I don't see how that could have raised it that much.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meta Phyton","date":"2016-06-30T10:15:31.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell them to add me - I'll offer them some initial guidance in bot matches, now and then, if they really feel that they can't make it by themselves.\n\n- - -\n\nIt's definitely possible to learn the ropes going solo in bot matches. In my opinion and experience, learning to play initially is not a matter of playing against evenly skilled opponents; it just takes learning how to swing your sword or fling your spells or fire your arrow, so to speak - even if it's at a stationary target. Even against a dummy in Fable can a new initiate learn how to become basically competent with a sword, spell, or bow. Translated into LoL terminology, this sword, spell, and bow analogy is respectively describing 'Garen', 'Ryze', and 'Ashe' - all the 3 fundamental champs that any new player needs to learn how to swing a melee attack ('Garen'), fling spells ('Ryze'), or fire from a distance ('Ashe').\n\n\nAfter they know how to swing their sword at a dummy (or fling off spells or fire their arrow), then they can go in against a moving target with more confidence.\n\nAnd there's 1 bot match setting that was essentially made with null champ ability in mind. In addition there's 'Tutorial' mode, which is what I played until I felt ready to pick 'bow' as my initial weapon. That means picking 'Ashe' by the way.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-06-30T09:19:12.432+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You needed to teach your friend the value of the mute button, first and foremost.\nI doubt he didn't want to play anymore thanks to toxic people as every corner of the internet is littered with it.

I didn't play with high level friends tho so maybe that limited the amount of smurfs we played against / They just weren't as prevalent early on in the game.
