I've done both Warrior and Devourer builds and they both work really well.  Warrior helps scale my Q/R but not my E/W, gives me solid armor pen for my ganks, and just in general is a nice immediate power boost, even if it falls off later in the game.  \r\n\r\nDevourer scales slowly but ramps into being incredibly powerful, gives me a decent amount of mixed damage but doesn't scale any of my abilities. However it gives me a little more freedom when building because I can go tankier earlier and just farm up a  little to get some damage.\r\n\r\nWhat's the \"optimal\" build for Xin?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2015-01-15T18:58:29.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a lot of success on xin, I typically build devourer into shyv+lvl 1 boots.  After that I build tank.  It's worked out pretty well for me.  With this item configuration I end up with a 60/40 phys/magic damage split.  What's good about this setup is that it gives you a lot of AS which means that you are more likely to get your knockup off, and that's what I find important for Xin; landing the slow and then landing your knockup.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-01-15T19:04:10.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And getting more heals off from his W.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-01-15T15:37:03.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both are fine choices, but personally I woul go Devourer. The mixed damage and increased AS will make you much harder to counter, and it synergizes nicely with lifesteal items should you choose to build them.","replies":[{"poster":"IronChefBoyardee","date":"2015-01-15T15:42:59.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Devourer than either Phage or Furor/Berzerkers, then go tank, finish trinity later?

I think I'm going to go warrior with xin every time now.","replies":[]}]}
