I'd highly recommend going to \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KalistaMains/ or the kalista mains discord and getting advice there. \nYour build is a very very standard kalista build. I'd suggest trying berserks > vampiric/cutlass though rather than vampiric > berserkers and see how you like it.\nYou might also be good to get a GA before bloodthirster, but that's situational. Also I'd generally suggest shield over blade start for most adcs with a weak laning phase. Unless I'm confident I'm going to be stronger in lane, I'll start shield on kalista, vayne, kai'sa, etc.\nBlade is good if you're laning against similar scaling champs, but shield is usually better if you're against lucian, mf, draven, etc.\n\nWhat runes are you running? How are you making use of your E and Q? Are you last hitting with E to get the reset or using Q to last hit and transer your stacked spears to whatever's behind your target? \nAre you making good use of your ult? It can be good engage or disengage if your support overextends \nHave you practiced wall hopping with your passive? \n\nAlso note that kalista is a hard champion to pick up. You're probably going to do poorly on her for a while, but once you get the hang of her play style, she's good.","replies":[{"poster":"JeaneGreene","date":"2018-12-12T00:02:41.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For runes I usually do Lethal Tempo -> Triumph -> alacrity -> coup de grace and sudden impact -> Eyeball collection.\n\nImma go check out the subreddit too.

Small number changes and bugfixes (for critical things) are the most she'll get. Riot has no plans for the level of work she would need to have a healthy, balanceable kit and be viable in more than pro play. Her current 47% or so (according to champion.gg) is better than it could be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IOffMeta GtOvrIt","date":"2018-12-11T22:47:08.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"believe it or not Kalista is actually getting a buff or two soon to her Q and her base AD, that might help some.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nullstar","date":"2018-12-11T22:21:01.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a few games on her, I am by no means a main of the champion. Your build is pretty standard for her and it is a good build, though a few things I think you can do, if you aren't already doing;\n1. Attack/A Click, it allows you to auto attack a certain target and move, its good for using your jump easier while attacking, rather than clicking back and forth like I would, I'm not sure if it works exactly like that as I don't use it, though I know a lot of people use it.\n\n2. Swapping Guinsoo's for IE, having the extra crit is good for Kalista, and I think the extra AD from IE is better for her, though that is just my opinion.\n\n3. Using your E more, with the fact it resets off of minion kills, you should practice CSing with your E and also making sure you have a spear in your lane opponent while not drawing minion aggro. It can do some serious poke and it will add up after a while.\n\n4. Using your Q with its run through, practicing throwing your Q through minions and getting used to which minions it will kill in order to spear it through minions and surprise your enemy. If you lower the minions yourself, getting spears in them already, it can transfer the spears on the targets it kills and apply the amount onto your target the spear stops in. \n\nOtherwise, I'm not sure. Sorry if none of this helps, I really hope it does for you and good luck in your next games!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elf0491","date":"2018-12-11T22:29:40.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, I'm not really a fan of ADC's, but I think I can spot your problems right off the bat. Building BotRK as your first full item will contribute significantly less damage than almost any other ADC option. Keep in mind, BotRK is an item designed to help kill tanks, which is why it sacrifices raw AD for the % health damage. Against most champions in the botlane, this is a very poor tradeoff, and you should be focusing more on building damage that will be effective against squishier targets (like the opposing ADC).\n\nSecond, you shouldn't be building Guinsoo's Rageblade for any reason as Kalista. Half of the item gives you AP, which Kalista doesn't scale with at all. That means you waste a ton of money to get an item that does very little for you. Again, you want to invest into more traditional stats for an ADC, such as raw AD or perhaps attack speed and critical chance, as this will dramatically increase your overall damage.\n\nFinally, if you are grabbing any item with critical chance, such as randuins, you really want to max out your critical chance. It tends to be something of an all or nothing stat, otherwise it is a lot less valuable.","replies":[]}]}
