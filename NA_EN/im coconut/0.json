Each time you try before that waiting period is up can extend the amount of time that you're locked out. We do this as a way to help prevent card fraud. You'll need to wait the full 24 hours before trying again, but if you still can't get that code to work shoot our billing team a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to help.","replies":[]}]}
