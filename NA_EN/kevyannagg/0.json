Or I have to play more rank games in order to get the gold tier rewards?\n\nLooking forward to hear from you guys soon.\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2013-09-26T20:15:00.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to qualify for the gold rewards currently, but if you don't keep playing enough to stay active, then there is a chance that your rank could decay. However, if you keep playing, this will not be an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-27T21:40:09.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanted to build on this comment here:  If you played your 10 placement matches in another region, and placed into a tier, and then subsequently transferred to a new region, this can cause some confusion.  After you complete your one ranked game in the new region, you are re-seeded into the Ranked System in this region.  For example, you went from Gold 5, to Gold 3.  Because you already placed in your previous region, and played your one game to get re-seeded here, you will earn Gold rewards as long as you do not decay out of gold due to inactivity.\n\nIn another example, lets say that a Summoner was Gold in EUNE, and then transferred to EUW.  After playing their one game in EUW, they were re-seeded into Silver.  In this case, they would only earn Silver rewards, since they were seeded into Silver on the new region.\n\nI hope this alleviates some confusion!","replies":[]}]}]}
