Me and a bunch of my friends have noticed about a 40-50 ping jump over the last two days as well. We all live in Edmonton, Canada and are on Shaw internet. We used to get a flat 46 ping at all times and last night we noticed it had jumped to 86 ping and stayed there - its a noticeable chance in game but its ONLY League that has changed.\n\nIs there anything you can do on your end to figure out what may have changed to cause this?\n\nThe fact that its only League indicates that its not an ISP problem and its not a local problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Str8 Riippin","date":"2016-11-26T05:12:25.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me in game we should play some time...Str8 Riippin     Im in Edmonton Alberta aswell :D......Gold 3 currently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"eng egyption","date":"2016-10-25T19:58:47.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kantoweru.\n\nYou are absolutely right.  No one that i know seems to have been effected but i live in Victoria BC\nwith Shaw ISP and my ping has gone up by exactly 30.  A stable 60 ms has turned to a stable 90(effectively unplayable at my rank)\nIt does not fluctuate whatsoever and feels as if the servers have moved further again TBH.  It is either our ISP or something to do with 6.21.\nWould love someone from riot to get back to this ASAP its been already 4 days..   and ye not just to tell us to reset modems.. something that would require actual work would be nice.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"wo zhen de ca1 B","date":"2016-10-27T01:16:03.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phelixx","date":"2016-10-26T02:16:03.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ping went from 50 to 90.
