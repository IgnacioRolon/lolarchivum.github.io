I don't know if there have been a recent data leak or if there's a new malware out there feeding a boosting service their accounts, but either way it's odd that there have been a lot of recent cases coming to the board about this.\n\nEdit:\nI'm going to start throwing in other cases I spot since I feel like I'm linking to this thread a lot.\n\n4 - KRapter231 (in this thread) has had their situation resolved and resumed playing games.\n5 - [Account recovered, admitted by OP.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/hGdGjUAK-account-hacked-thereafter-perma-banned)\n6 - [This person even had their name changed](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/xAjkAXnZ-have-i-been-hacked-perma-banned-from-false-accusations).

OP edited in \"Resolved\" in their post.\n9 - Nyxae in this thread said they've had their issue resolved.\n10 - [OP came back with the news that they got their account back.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/EP2qEOHG-permanent-ban-for-third-party-softwarei-never-used-any-of-any-kind-this-is-100-mistake) Very fast response from Riot on this.\n11 - Although wasn't as quick as the last one, [OP still came back to state it was resolved.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/eKE8xQKI-what-is-wrong-with-riots-security-permabanned)\n12 - [A commenter in #10 thread had their ban reversed.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/EP2qEOHG-permanent-ban-for-third-party-softwarei-never-used-any-of-any-kind-this-is-100-mistake?comment=00050000)\n13 - [Came back after several years to discover they were banned.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/OieAmsJ7-permanent-ban)\n14 - [Another user in #10](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/EP2qEOHG-permanent-ban-for-third-party-softwarei-never-used-any-of-any-kind-this-is-100-mistake?comment=0006).

Those people were banned and unbanned because third-party programs were used while their account was compromised.\n\nIn your case, if you're getting banned for thirdparty programs and you're sure that you've been in control over your account the whole time then it's something on your end causing Riot to think your account was cheating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xXDeathZReaperXx","date":"2019-11-18T06:19:40.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reading this gives me hope. thank you","replies":[]},{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2019-10-27T07:46:56.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"Riot must dare try this bullshit with me.\ni will ragdoll them","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-10-27T11:47:02.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SadLootBoxAwards,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=uVnmlJde,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-10-27T07:46:56.205+0000)\n>\n> i will ragdoll them\n\nhow exactly?","replies":[]}]}]}
