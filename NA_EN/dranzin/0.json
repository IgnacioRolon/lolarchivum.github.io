It occurs randomly. Sometimes my computer won't crash, other times my computer freezes and I'm forced to completely turn off my computer and turn it back on. If this occurs, it only does so during the first load into the game, otherwise it doesn't happen. This only happens with League. I'm up to a 20 minute queue wait due to the amount of times this has happened. Does anyone know a solution? My computer isn't terrible, it is capable of running League on it's highest settings and I get 100 fps doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T18:43:52.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspect this may be related to a fairly common issue going around with the Windows Game Bar that was recently updated to provide *Game DVR*.
