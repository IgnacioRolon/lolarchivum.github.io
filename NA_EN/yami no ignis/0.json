Diversity is having multiple options. It is not completely shoving an entire class out of the one lane they've been allowed to inhabit for seasons by destroying their viability. There are only three truly viable ADCs at the moment. That is, in fact, the opposite of diversity.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-06-02T09:15:02.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> they've been allowed to inhabit for seasons\n\nThey dominated that lane, not just inhabited.

Marksman seem to remain dominant in bot lane, however.\n\nThe only ADC's I ever see top or mid are ADC's that cannot make it in botlane(Quinn and Graves and, for a short period, Lucian and Ezreal). All ADC's go bot lane because any time they're in a spot they can function in a solo lane, solo laners blow a gasket and are like,\"ADC CAN\"T BE IN MUH LANE.\" For seasons *all* lanes have been dominated by specific classes and any attempts to branch out are met with complete rebuttal. ADC's aren't allowed to go anywhere else because the playerbase has pidgeon holed them botlane. \n\nWhat ADC's go top or mid right now, right this second? The only things I see top are the ridiculously over tuned bruisers right now who have a million different items that they can abuse; bruisers are *literally* worse the ADC's in that not only do they get to do ridiculous damage early, mid, and late but they also get to be tanky. They literally can use every item in the entire game effectively and even before ADC itemization got fucked over and made outlandishly expensive, they could have one of the cheapest item builds. What other class currently is allowed to use assassin, bruiser, tank, on-hit, and, now, ADC items to just steam roll the game? \n\nThe fact of the matter is, ADC's go bot lane because that's the only place they *can* go. If they go top, the team loses out on engage or tankiness. If they go mid, they can't stand up to the burst there. And if they can go to either of these lanes and survive or not screw up comps, then they're considered broken, the boards instantly whine, and they're gutted and made to go back bot lane.\n\nSo forgive the class that's only allowed to be botlane and to function botlane for dominating the lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-06-02T05:37:45.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"top, mid, jungle and even support (briefly) or ashe (an off-meta).

Then, to add to that, the other classes are outright beaten by the generalist marksmen class.
