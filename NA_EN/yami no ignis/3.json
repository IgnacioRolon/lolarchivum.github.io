I don't understand why you want to protect them. Is it because you do it also? Blame the entire team and then rage quit? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-25T08:44:46.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I AFK, not counting disconnects or crashes, it is because _every_ ally on my team is working against my efforts in game, not just being verbally toxic.

You treat Rage quitters like they deserve to not be punished for rage quitting. Don't play the game at all if you're just going to rage quit? Why are you so persistent on protecting them for rage quitting?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-25T20:28:00.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because more severe punishments are not the answer to everything wrong with people.","replies":[{"poster":"Yami No Ignis","date":"2020-01-27T10:36:23.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightsky Pirate,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Y3yMJEul,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2020-01-25T20:28:00.179+0000)\n>\n> Because more severe punishments are not the answer to everything wrong with people.\n\nIt is an answer, maybe not the one you approve of.\nAlright here's another answer. Riot can stop them from playing ranked for a good week. Those who keep rage quitting over and over, should get marked for afk. When they afk too much we prevent it by banning those people when they are marked more than 3 times. Therefore we have less rage quitters, because they cant play ranked for 1 week once they rage quit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
