Even leblanc, with her endless safety. These guys do their job of killing one target without a ton of incidental damage to the rest of your team.

The problem is, it's come at the cost of his ability to do his job of eliminating one target. I'd much rather fight a fed fizz now than a fed... almost any other assassin. Which is saying something, because before, fizz was pretty high up there on my list of fed ~~one-man armies~~ assassins I never want to fight, along with akali, katarina, and yi. \n\nI would consider fizz more of a split pusher now.

His strength is in the early and mid game, before people group, by snowballing lanes.\nTalon: If he gets *very* fed, he can use his ult as an escape. Often ends up having to use it to secure a kill instead. \nKZ: Damage is low unless target is isolated. He actually tends to build more bruiser as a result, since otherwise he just blows up in teamfights. His ult is annoying, but I honestly don't mind this champ much.\nLB: Admittedly, I can't stand this champ. Every *minute*, she gets a free safety net from her passive that makes her inordinately difficult to kill, even when she gets caught. Not dying against her requires staying *very* far outside of her range, but if she isn't using her distortion to damage you, you can usually survive long enough to at least react.

Just learn how to go Fizz top if you want a safe route out as top is easier as Fizz than mid now.","replies":[{"poster":"Opistach","date":"2015-02-01T06:13:13.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"But that's not good!!!\n\nYes, he can do his old burst IF his Fizz lands. It 90% of the time goes right through em' because League hit boxes. But you also HAVE to use E now for damage because his Q does absolutely NO damage. You are a sitting duck for 8-16 secs (with no cd) once you use it. This is basically death row in League. \n\nChamps like Kha are still viable like this because they have resets after kills. Fizz has to wait stuff out now. 8-16 seconds that the fish is completely defenseless.\n\nYou shouldn't have to rely on your most defensive ability for damage when they rest of your kit does nothing while it is down.","replies":[{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-01T06:23:24.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A champ who can put out damage without taking any in return (by timing his E correctly) should not be able to freely kill champions of equal or higher level without his ult. Moving his damage to his ult changes it so that Fizz has to work like other Assassins like Talon and Zed where they have very high kill potential when their ult is up, and much lower when it is down. These champs are not going to 100-0 your carry and then get out free literally every second of the game. Only when their ult is up, and to a lot of people even that is too often.","replies":[{"poster":"Opistach","date":"2015-02-01T06:27:16.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed is exactly this.\n\nTalon has issues.\n\nFizz was healthy before, maybe needing some CDR tunage on his E to keep him from spamming it so much.\n\nI honestly don't know what they will do about Talon, I love that guy as well!","replies":[{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-01T06:36:10.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I currently have no issue with Talon.

I scrolled down the Discussion and like 90 per cent of the people are just talking without any understanding of the game or a group setup (pro. and con. fizz changes).\nI play Fizz main since good 2-3 years now and from my point of view, champions like Fizz, Akali and Kassadin got killed by riot (in higher elo) for the sake of casual player. They are the sacrifice for keeping the game easy enough that bronze/silver solo queue wont rent 2 much about assasins. \n\nMy argue-points:\n-First off, we have to get something straight: I am talking about ap-assassin-fizz. He can offer mainly glasscanon-, solo target dmg and re-positioning -> assassin-characteristics. He is not an carry with reliable dps or a bruiser with much disruption/control.\n\n-Did u guys ever asked urself why fizz wasnt played in championpools of high elo player ever? Its because he was midtier regarding winning/ending 5v5-Teamgames in every patch until probably the now patched AS-bruiser fizz-changes and thats a fact (go watch lcs and high-elo-stream recordings if u dont believe me). Fizzes chances to carry the game as an melee ap-assassin gets lowered every minute after lvl 6, because he has to get ahead to be relevant in lategame and end the game before maxing items. (Team 5v5 has longer avarage games then solo because of lower solo carry potential)\n\n-So what about solo-ranked? The problem with solo ranked is the lack of teamplay and communication. I played almost every elo with different accounts in euw now and i have to say that playing assasins is OP in bronze/silver, just because the role of an assasins want fullfill is so easy 2 achieve against unorganised opponents. But if u climb up the elo-ladder facing better organised teams, who wont let 1v1 fighting against other carries, will crush you as assasins. Thats why assassins have to get ahead in early-mid game for carrying and without dfg this isnt as easy as it sounds in higher elo(plat/dia). \n-> Regarding the 2 ONLY PERIODS, some month before (as ap-assassin) and some weeks after dfg-remove-patch (as AS-Bruiser), he actually was top-tier in solo-ranked ONLY in Bronze/Silver, like almost every assassin normally is(higher solo-snowball-potential).\n\n-About the \"broken\" mechanic of fizz e -> Its the only ability who can make fizz work as an late assasin 1 w-q combo never ever kills an adc (even without any armor/mr/hp built), thats why he NEEDS that invulnarability, he has no veigar/syndra ult in his kit. His e doesnt make him broken, he makes him competitive against other assasins in a tf-scenario. He has to be able to kill a carry, like a carry has to be able to kill a bruiser and a bruiser to kill an assasin, thats how the game is built up. If he cant be invulnerable he would die against a carry just focusing him down after his w-q burst.\n\n-Conclusion: Is it healthy to nerf assassins so much, that bronze/silver can handle them? -> for the game targeting casual-gamer, it is (this is, what i suspect, are riots plans for LOL).\n...BUT...\nIs it healthy for a balanced moba including Assassins(aka. anti-carrys) as a role to fullfill? -> NOOOO it is not! \nRiot abviously wants to get the casual-players back from HotS to play more league. And the mainpart of the community in the forums im following want to have a game ranged carrys vs. melee bruisers, without the diversity it has now....\n\n-My suggestion to riot: Try to make ur game special, harder, and with more diversity. Casual games will lose their community much faster..\nMy suggestion for Fizz: Remove the latest changes about fizz. Taking away the dfg and forcing a morello's in his assassin-build nerfed him enough to be mid-tier assassin. If u think u cant remove anything, probably keep the flashable q.\n\nPS to the forum arguments for keeping fizz: \n-Bann-rates of Fizz in solo-ranked were medium some month before, some weeks after dfg-removal-patch and some weeks after fizz release. The bigger part of the time for fizz as a champion were rare played and banned. (Go watch statistics on op.gg or LolKing before arguing about this.)\n\n-Fizz has no counterplay? lol, my duo partner would screw me over every game if i would play against his leona/janna/morgana... there is so much counterplay against him, every silence, stun, exhaust totally annihalates fizz, while getting focused by a carry. Probably u think there is no counterplay because the supp/bruiser already used all the lockdown on the frontline? -> well nvm u are in the wrong elo my friend.\n\n-For all them carries, who hate these \"op\" assassins: climb the ladder, they get easier to handle with a team actually playing WITH u! or better go play leona/ali/janna/morg when u face an assassin and lock em down when theyre try to snatch a carry. Its actually easy as that\n\ngreetings Chillsection","replies":[]}]}
