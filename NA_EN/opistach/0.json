What I can do is try and help you resolve whatever is causing you to crash and get you back in game.  If you are crashing in champion select or when the game starts, there may be a few factors that can be adjusted to resolve it.  For your first step, get rid of any third party programs you are using that interacts with League.  Examples of this include Play.tv and Overwolf.   Secondly, if you recently updated Windows 10 then there may be an issue where the[ Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) is causing the game to crash.  In this case, disable it and give it another shot.  \n\nTroubleshoot this in a custom game to prevent further penalties.  That should get you fixed up.","replies":[{"poster":"Opistach","date":"2016-08-20T15:30:00.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use no third party programs and I am on Windows 7.
