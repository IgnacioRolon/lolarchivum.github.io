I had entirely forgotten it existed, until i was looking at the preseason patch preview that was posted today and someone pointed the site out to me. \r\n\r\nI wanted to see where I sat in regards to which emote I'd receive for my time spent in game, but the hour count is no longer accurate - I presume this is a result of Riot's changes to their API. Is there any way to know my hours spent on the game now? Would I be able to submit a ticket for this information, or would I just have to sit and wait to see what reward I get when preseason hits for an approximate? Thanks for the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T02:17:28.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't actually have that data in my tools, but it does look like you've got around 4k games played with an average of about 25 min per game. Seems to be around the 70 days mark! This is absolutely just a roundabout guess on my part though.","replies":[]}]}
