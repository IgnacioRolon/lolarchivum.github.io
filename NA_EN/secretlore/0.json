How old are these two men?\n\nFor all intents and purposes Vladimir is a vampire.  I mean, he uses blood magic, and if you bother (I don't know why you would) to look up blood magic which is a variation of necrotic magic...you can extend your life (or at least age your physical appearance) more slowly.\n\nWith that said, despite how...\"youthful\" Vladimir looks, he may be as old as Swain if not even older.  And I mean, \"way\" older.\n\nOh, and I can agree with the theory put forth. I mean, Vlad just made Darius's predecessor (and possible inspiration, role model, hero) into a mindless, undead behemoth.  I'd be rather pissed about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2014-09-30T21:59:57.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't be surprised if the blood kept him young, but feels sorta ineffective regarding the several ways other characters maintain their youth.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-30T22:40:44.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such as?
