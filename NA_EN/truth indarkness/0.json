Jinx ults while stunned?","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Dear Riot team,\r\n\r\nCan you explain to me PLEASE why (as Vayne) i tumbled into jinx getting the perfect angle, apparently as i e&#039;d Jinx into the wall she must have been mid ult because she managed to get her ult off after being stunned for a good .5 seconds. Is this some kind of bug that being stunned somehow doesn&#039;t stop Jinx&#039;s ult? If it is NOT a bug, then you really need to nerf that because not only is that a extremely huge troll, but it&#039;s insanely OP and literally costed me my game. I can 100% guarantee this is no misjudgment on my end when i say, Jinx finished casting her ultimate mid stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-10-26T23:17:19.320+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excluding channeling spells, you can't interrupt a spell, or autoattack during its cast time with a stun.

What I still can't get past, though, is that some spells have extremely short channel times, and therefore *can* be cancelled, presumably by accident. The example I'm most salty about on this is Kennen's ult. It should basically be an instant-cast ability, or at the very least shouldn't be able to be cancelled. But since it's technically a super-short channel, I've had it cancelled mid-cast by very unfortunately timed CC...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truth InDarkness","date":"2015-10-29T11:11:14.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the information Rito, i appreciate it.
