The problem is for some reason I recently started getting lag spikes. My speedtest and pingtests are both ok, 20/10 mbps and 10 ping to the nearest server. Every other game I tried plays ok, Battlefield 1 etc. \n\nI got placed in a low priority queue and now I have to wait 20 minutes. Why, you ask? Because I couldn't reconnect to the game, every time I tried I would get the message I couldn't reconnect. Tried shutting off the services, restarting the PC (takes couple of seconds with an ssd). Now what?\n\nI can't wait 20 minutes to play 1 game, I barely have time for that, and I have to do it 5 times?\n\nEDIT: \n\nnow that I've tried joining a game, someone declined and I got pushed out of the queue, needing to start it again? \nWhat?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-18T01:31:46.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes that's pretty rough. I can understand how frustrated you'd be having to wait 20 min to get into a game, but those LPQ's shouldn't hit your account unless you start to show a history of left game. Even then they should start out at 5 min. \n\nIf you were constantly getting that attempting to reconnect message, there's a pretty good chance that something was blocking your network from reaching that server somehow. I'd first double check that firewalls/antivirus weren't getting in the way, but I'd also be sure to check off the other steps listed in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to be sure.","replies":[]}]}
