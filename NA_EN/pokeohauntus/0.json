I was wondering if it is possible to get banned though, due to this continually happening. I've bought a 25 dollar League of Legends card, but I don't want to cash it in if I will get banned like in a few days just because of my computer crashing. Also, is there a way to remove my low queues? I wouldn't leave any game on purpose, unless it was one of those really bad games with like everyone flaming me for nothing, or if there's too many trolls. Thank you to anyone who can answer my questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T23:27:23.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we cannot remove low-priority queues for any reason.
