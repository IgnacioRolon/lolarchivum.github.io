In person I&#039;m quiet and hardly talk but when it comes to video games holy shit... I won&#039;t get into that.\r\nI&#039;m a bronze player right now and something recently has been getting in my way.\r\nMyself. \r\nI can&#039;t help myself from flaming. If the jungle never ganks my lane but the enemy jgl is camping me, I resort to: Trash talking JGL, spam pinging and eventually abandoning lane completely which results in me getting reported.\r\nIf there&#039;s a way to completely stop myself from typing on LoL I&#039;d like it because then I couldn&#039;t get these suspensions from being toxic. Any ideas? + If you&#039;ll just comment calling me bad so I shouldn&#039;t flame I&#039;ve heard it a million times, that&#039;s not the question. Plus don&#039;t leave a witty response if you want to be smart or something.\r\n\r\n- Looking for a way to stop flaming/tilting when it comes to the teams JGL.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-05-14T03:21:10.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i have an easy solution for you.

I have met so many people who are so toxic, but do it with the attitude like they are the mesiah or something. They think they belong in diamond, but every teammate they're paired with holds them down.\nYou are not one for them, you know you are toxic, and that's an important step to cleaning it up. Way to go, comrade!","replies":[]},{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2018-05-13T03:16:28.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am at honor 0 (I will not deny some of it being my fault, but I do think it needed a better review. I.e getting flamed for learning ivern jungle, support ditching me as a 4 man premade). I have noticed the following helps.\n\n* Tell everyone about the situation before minions spawn. At the beginning of the game, say something like \"I'm honor 0 trying to reform.\" If your problem is responding to toxicity, this will help. I do this and the rest of the team typically would leave me alone after knowing this. Sometimes you get some honors because of it (either out of pity or because you went out of your way to fight toxic urges).\n* Avoid trying to learn new champions if your honor is low. This is how I got in my mess in the first place. I mean I'm only going Nocturne jungle from here on out.\n* Try playing during the weekdays. I know this idea may cause some controversy, but playing when the kids are in school means the only ones left are (generally) more mature.\n* An obvious one is to discord with a premade. Harder to flame your buddies than some strangers. The drawback is that honors from your premade lobby will only provide half the points, so keep that in mind when trying to unlock honor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-12T23:23:01.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can stop talking, although it sounds like that is difficult.\n\nThere is no miracle cure for learning self-control.
