I can't even turn off the cliend in task manager window... It is just stuck at loading window(i hear the game starting). Lost 5 games cus of this issue... Lost mmr/Time/grind... I'm pissed cus of this... Connection issues? I doubt that's the problem. It happened after new windows update... One more bug/// Not seeing healthbar of enemy/ally/myn champion or names above their character. My graphic drivers are up to date/internet connection is the same from last year/windows up to date.
