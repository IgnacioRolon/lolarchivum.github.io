Her Q does damage by range, limiting her range or her ways to target you, will make a difference.

I do not understand how people are so mad about her E since this item exist.

The same amount as Kha'Zix's ult when it's maxed actually. And sure, you can't move away from it, but the smoke circle lets you control an area for that time and anyone who goes near it is as good as dead. It makes Akali extremely strong at contesting objectives. If you want the Drake or Baron the enemy team is getting then you will have to enter that circle of death for most of if not its entire duration. \n\nZhonya's is far more effective against Kha'Zix because when he emerges from stealth he needs to wait a bit before being able to use it again and is left vulnerable. Even if you CC Akali she will re-enter her shroud so long as she's standing in it, and her Q has a base 1.5 second CD so Zhonya's will only really help against her ult, but if she uses it your health is likely low and she'll kill you anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-10-26T14:13:32.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not care at this point.

Akali is far more mobile and even if you catch her out with CC she'll go into stealth again meaning unless most of your damage is from skillshots you're fucked.\n\n> Akali cannot 1v5 thanks to the shroud, she needs her team, especially if she wants to contest.

In one of my first games (I think 3rd or 4th) I got a triple kill on enemies who were all behind their base walls with every single inhibitor tower up on my own, escaping with about 60% health.

Poke mages deal damage to targets  at a range while being vulnerable close.  Zoning mages keep targets away from an area they designate.  See how this is a problem?\n\n* next, let's look at how she makes it where the opponent is punished for using summoner spells, something so powerful that they are on ridiculous cooldowns only matched by ultimate abilities and even then, those are half the duration in a lot of cases\n#in line with this, she can deal three instances of ignite damage that all count as separate damage!\n\n* next, her kit makes use of true damage in high amounts.  She can either gain an ignite from a minion or an opponent, or her E changes a portion of her damage into true damage in the amount of several hundred\n\n* She suffers from the old nidalee problem with an effective range on her Q of about 1400 if she uses her ultimate\n\n* her W passive deals damage for any instance of using a pickup and can be combined with her passive to deal large amounts of targeted damage\n\n* Her W has a 1 second cooldown between uses of arguably the most powerful ability in the game and its only limitation is if the zoe player messes up their play\n\nNext, let's look at her matchups.  she has no real bad matchup and is strong at all phases of the game\n\n* Her primary counters are any champion that can outperform her with macro play, which sets a precedent that she can not be overcome if this fails to happen, or that she needs jungler interference to be handled at all\n\n* she has no mana issues, so is not punished by opponents with sustain.  Although she can not spam easily, her kit is almost free compared to most.  Her ultimate, a double blink with safety attached, only costs her 50 mana and can be used in seconds that are affected by cooldown reduction. The only champion allowed to have that much pressure has been Kassadin, who has been utterly destroyed with nerfs since the dawn of his existence\n\n* with her kit being designed with very few weaknesses, it is up to the zoe to misplay in order to gain an advantage against her and not the opponent to outplay.

For starters, Nidalee Q, is unstoppable, meaning it will not stop till it hits something or reaches its end. Zoe Q is a double cast spell, which if you warded, would be easy to identify if she cast it or not. Secondly, Zoe must be in range for it to travel longer, which can or will get her out of position.

As I said, \"better than others.\" But he hates burst champions, and Eve is in that category. Meaning he wants her gutted further, which I strictly disagree on because then she will be gone from the game. She may hold a 51% WR, but that is thanks to her mains and the pros who play her. Same goes for Zoe, who is barely useable, unless if you are a main or pro.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2018-10-23T00:36:27.095+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HyperTechno,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=FG361gI5,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2018-10-23T00:16:18.047+0000)\n>\n> Ok, why not gut this then. {{champion:99}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:84}} \n> \n> By your fucking logic, all of those champions are Broken and cancer.

I gave him 22 champions Riot should gut as well because those champions can burst or 1 to 0 you. I did not say, gut them, I said, then you are saying Riot should nerf all of those champions because they are cancer.
