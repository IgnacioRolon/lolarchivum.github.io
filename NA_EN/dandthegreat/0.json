I  saw a lot of people are using Fraps, but a lot complain, so help me :D {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-24T22:34:19.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since League textures look pretty good even at low settings, I'd recommend to worry less about video quality (textures) and focus more on framerate (FPS) and stability of your recordings. A good goal would be to cap your FPS in-game to 60FPS and record at 30FPS for the best balance between quality and balancing the load on your PC. \n\nWhile I can't suggest a specific program, I can say that no matter what it is you use, you may get the best experience recording at 30FPS/720P if you don't have the most powerful PC. Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-07-25T16:06:49.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a good base guideline. If you want to be able to make better quality recordings, it's worth looking to upgrade a few components. I recently upgraded my video card for like $250, and it's made a huge difference. If you can save up for it, it's likely worth it if you are interested in streaming and having generally higher quality for other games you play!","replies":[]}]}]}
