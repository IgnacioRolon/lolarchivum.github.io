I have ended up playing against quite a few Zyra&#039;s lately. Is it me, or does everyone feel that Zyra&#039;s Gameplay super unhealthy correctly?\r\nMultiple times have I ran into a match with her where we should have won, but Zyra no matter what role she goes into just ends up carry the match so hard because of her kit being so overwhelming. Like the player was not even good and missed allot of skill shots; but that doesn&#039;t stop the bullshit plants from 100% to 0% in matter of seconds.\r\nI feel that the Gameplay rewards the player to much for missing skillshots or those plant&#039;s do way to much damage without being empowered by her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-07-13T02:22:38.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low ELO problems.
