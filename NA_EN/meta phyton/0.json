Right now when I play Omega Teemo though, going back out of stealth still keeps the beams sticking out of his goggles, so it looks like he has green bunny ears bobbing around on his head.\r\nDo others have that same issue?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-10T18:39:10.738+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report! This isn't an issue that would be isolated to your computer, it would happen to all players. We're aware of the issue and will be working on a fix. ^-^\n\n**EDIT:** I poked our VFX friend and he's working to get a fix in. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Meta Phyton","date":"2017-01-10T22:23:25.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yw yw :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-10T23:04:47.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Np!
