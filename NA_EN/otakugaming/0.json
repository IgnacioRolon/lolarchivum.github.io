Her 1v1 in lane is one of the most (potentially) infuriating, oppressive, rage inducing experiences in all of League. She tends to either counter or get countered rather hard by different champions. That means she needs kit changes, not a damage buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2016-07-01T05:31:04.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dBppTkuF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-06-30T22:41:41.711+0000)\n>\n> Fiora - early game&#x27;s a bit too punishing after our last changes.

She was one  of the few mages to be left out the mage update and item changes weren't particularly beneficial towards her. There also seems to be very split opinions from the community when it comes to her; there are those who love her long-range burst playstyle and those that find her too oppressive being long-ranged and burst. You've etched out her weaknesses by reducing the strength of her shield, but do you still find her problematic to balance (it's been stated before that she's been difficult to balance), do you think she is suitable for a light-Ryze style update?(get it? :D)\n\nWhat were some of the other changes you were/are considering? (This latest one is the only one to be PBE'd)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-07-01T00:30:37.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she and a couple of other artillery ish mages are a bit overlapped (Lux/Vel'Koz/Xerath). Overall though her design seems pretty solid to me, can't see the sense in a Ryze level update. \n\nWe looked at things like lowering E mana cost (felt ok, made for some oppressive lanes) and decreasing E missile speed while putting more power elsewhere (improved playing against experience significantly, felt really rough for the Lux player though).","replies":[{"poster":"DoubLL","date":"2016-07-02T14:59:12.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play almost exclusively Lux, and I feel like a mana cost reduction for her E would be the most reasonable buff you could give her, could you elaborate what \"made for some oppressive lanes\" means?\n\nIn my experience, Lux is struggling against a lot of the stronger midlaners at the moment, she can only really bully them at level 2/3 and get out traded afterwards - so changing her E mana cost from 70-130 to something like 70-110 could help her clear wave reliably in match ups she has problems in while not giving her enough mana to constantly throw around Es.\n\nI really don't like these current \"buffs\", because they only really kick in by the late midgame, and by then a Lux should have no problems killing a target outright, and 2-8 more damage on her passive does almost nothing to address her weakness in early laning.\n\n\nBut, to be completely honest, I would be most happy if you did not buff her at all, but instead brought down some of the really strong mid lane picks just a little bit - about the same amount you would otherwise buff Lux. Champions like Viktor, Anivia, Swain and maybe Vladimir just seem a bit too strong, and unfortunately, if you pick Lux in the current Meta, people will almost always pick one of them against you. (Fizz/Zed too, but their entire purpose is killing Lux, and tbh she has a lot she can do against them, unlike Viktor who fills a similar role but just outperforms Lux on almost every level.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lüc","date":"2016-07-01T02:38:18.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I absolutely love her kit, and feel that while she does have some overlap with those you mention (maybe Ziggs as well), I feel its more of an issue with artillery in general not having a consistent niche in the ever changing meta that can't be answered by less artillery-ish mages like Viktor and Azir.\n\nI agree that she doesn't need an overhaul, was just curious seeing as there are some(many?) that have a burning hatred for Lux and her long range burst. Glad to hear that you feel her kit is in a place though :).\n\nPerhaps have her E size increase over time. Decrease the initial missile/aoe for less oppressive poke, while still allowing her to hit a burst combo. Or maybe just decrease the E size in general, but have her passive apply to targets(minions, champions) that pass through it rather than when her E is popped - so she can still apply her passive consistently, but the aoe will be less of an issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ofart","date":"2016-07-02T22:38:33.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like that you're encouraging higher risk plays with the Lux passive buffs. I think the same can be done for Ziggs' W. Due to its 26 second CD and mere 35% AP ratio, it's used almost exclusively as an escape. Considering that Ziggs is the slowest mage in the game, it's risky to use W offensively. I love Ziggs but I feel a bit constrained in my playstyle because even his full rotation is often not enough to kill a target (with me using W offensively).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-06-30T23:37:02.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler how do you feel about Ryze's current state on PBE? don't you think the ult is a bit too much?","replies":[]},{"poster":"OtakuGaming","date":"2016-06-30T22:55:30.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty for the answer.

Also all your targets are multi hit so while playing lux before i have got 6+ proc of passive off in a fight before that is going to be 2more dmg for every level on each of those proc so in a team fight you might get do you know 80+ more dmg every team fight if you are good at hitting multiple people with your spells and weaving auto's inbetween your spells.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2016-06-30T23:07:11.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still not projectile speed change on Lux E.\nOnly people that can dodge is are those with dashes.","replies":[{"poster":"rugg1999","date":"2016-07-01T15:28:45.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just move out of the way when you see her throw it.
