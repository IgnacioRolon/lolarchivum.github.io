So they attacked his auto attack. Taking 10% off AD at all stages of the game is HUGE though and maybe had we had done that first before some other nerfs we wouldn't be this far down.\n\nI used to be an avid Corki player especially into solo lanes in the previous season abusing the 6 potion start and the mixed dmg we had before. Honestly he was extremely strong then too (stronger in solo queue than previous patches imo). Today though I feel he's such a suboptimal pick. I can't find a powerspike at all now since a negatron cloak now completely counters his damage. He kinda has a scarier 4-5 item but that's it. Even that was hammered by the 10% auto attack nerf. Most of my solo games are gonna be decided before that.\n\nPros spammed him and riot acted. But as a result I feel he's now in the worst spot in a long time. Pretty much as I expected.\n\nHe's in a bad enough spot I'm hesitant to pick Corki for ADC even if the rest of the team is physical. In a way the hybrid damage yet mostly magical dmg is soo bad for Corki's options because if tanks get too fed or if he falls behind he has no way to afford penetration until like the 4th item as it hardly benefits him at all. Though I guess that's not too far off from most ADCs needing 2 items before armor pen.","replies":[{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2016-05-22T22:59:11.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I'm not really of the fan of the \"Corki is gonna do mostly magic damage\" role riot shoehorned him in. AS it is now tanks with one armor and one magic resist item (2 items) are near impenetrable to Corki's damage alone til he has the luxary to afford his penetration (usually void staff) usually as the 4th item AT THE EARLIEST (because he NEEDS the crit/ad/as to make it worth it first). And then at that point this Corki kinda hyperscales, but only because most tanks are used to building 2/3rds armor, 1/3rds magic resist.\n\nCorki's old damage split was actually much more beneficial to him (with his autos doing full physical, +10% true damage, and then his abilities doing substantial magic damage.) It meant no laner could possibly itemize sufficient defenses vs. him to easily turtle up. This lane dominance was something I was used to exploiting mid lane and on rare occasions top lane.\n\nHis current setup gave him a hyper late game but the pros abused that and his package endlessly til it was nerfed to where we are now.\n\nMaybe just maybe we should go all the way and make Corki do **100% magic damage?** Because this half and half auto is hurting his options itemwise. But maybe it's a terrible idea. Another idea is some kind of ap stat to auto attacker stat scaling.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-05-22T11:16:51.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Hl4AQwpz,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-21T23:20:03.885+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, we&#x27;ll likely do something for Corki.
