A while ago, Microsoft released the Anniversary update for Win 10, which introduced *Game DVR* in the Game Bar. This causes FPS issues and system crashes for some players, so I'd recommend disabling the game bar using [this guide](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"curry mee","date":"2016-11-22T19:56:21.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so sorry, i tried disabling GAME DVR and it still didnt work.... this is srsly making me quit league..
