It's likely caused by a security setting that either blocked a proper installation for a game file from being accessed.  Run through the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to restore access.\n\nOnce completed, grab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a force repatch to make sure your game files are installed without issue.
