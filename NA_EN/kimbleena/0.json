Twitch clip included.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Was just 14 day banned in a game where we had an immediate inting ezreal. Like hard run it down lane inting ezreal. While asking for reports and talking with my team, the zed on the other team became toxic and claimed he wouldnt report him because we killed him. He went on to say we are all just pissy and bad.\r\n\r\nThis game continued with him just inting and trolling as seen in the clip. Here is the chat logs of what I said in this game. It is this one single game that got me the 14 day ban according to riots report. This was the enemy team, or the inting ezreal reporting me as the others were my premade except for rammus who quit the game due to the inting ezreal.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nKimbleeNA: nvm\r\nKimbleeNA: please report ( he is 0-4 now)\r\nKimbleeNA: goodbye promos\r\nKimbleeNA: just push mid\r\nKimbleeNA: open\r\nKimbleeNA: please? (team agreed to the above as he kept running it down bot lane and mid)\r\nKimbleeNA: same, clipped him on twitch will send a ticket in to get him banned\r\nKimbleeNA: he will probably report you (this was telling my team to not go afk and keep playing)\r\nKimbleeNA: night\r\nKimbleeNA: i mean, im gonna afk also, i had 1 more game before bed...the game was over before it started so why stay (didnt afk nor was it a threat)\r\nKimbleeNA: rather get an extra 20-30 mins of sleep\r\nKimbleeNA: night boss\r\nKimbleeNA: it only takes one, also reporting that as well thanks for the clip (this is when zed became toxic)\r\nKimbleeNA: thanks for your permission\r\nKimbleeNA: you will not report intentional feeding because you die...nothing wrong with that? lol (reiterating what zed said)\r\nKimbleeNA: that is the definition of toxic\r\nKimbleeNA: i love the people that get all big and bad when they get a free win lol\r\nKimbleeNA: for what?\r\nKimbleeNA: being trolled by ezreal?>\r\nKimbleeNA: anyone reporting ezreal, reporting zed. Enjoy the win you wouldnt normally have zed and lets all move on\r\nKimbleeNA: anyway*\r\nKimbleeNA: panties in a twist, wont report if i die, i mean im offended by it (reiterating what zed had said about us)\r\nKimbleeNA: hm we will see\r\nKimbleeNA: swearing now, man so toxic\r\nPost-Game\r\nKimbleeNA: Supported the intentional feeder and claimed to refuse to support because he died, also swore multiple times and claimed that we are pissy and have our \"panties in a bunch\" (was the text in the report)\r\nKimbleeNA: enjoy that report\r\nKimbleeNA: seems like it in chat\r\nKimbleeNA: good luck proving otherwise (claims he wont get banned for supporting an intentional feeder)\r\nKimbleeNA: enjoy that banm\r\n\r\nMaybe im just confused as to what the world considers offensive now. Maybe I just dont understand league anymore and its better to be an inting player than someone vocal about reporting him. Anyway guys, I really just can't do it anymore, everything is way more toxic than this but none of them are punished (friend added the ezreal to get proof, he is in another game as we speak, through spectate he is inting again.) Hope you all find a way to enjoy this game, I think chat should just be removed baseline at this point.","replies":[]}
