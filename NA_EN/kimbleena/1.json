The original evidence was removed from the support ticket, removed from forums, and specialist ran in to say that I faked the videos.

The feedback notification in game is unreliable.\n\nThe video was removed from your other post because it broke a forum rule.","replies":[{"poster":"KimbleeNA","date":"2019-09-04T05:48:03.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"When did I say specialist were staff? In fact I specifically seperated specialist and moderators for that reason. \n\nI accepted I was punished for responding to \"report ezreal?\" and saying yes to report him. I have said in other post that if I am feeling tilted or toxic I will avoid chat and just int the entire time. Nothing happens as long as it does not seem like im inting. Maybe I am just having a bad game.\n\nI never asked riot to tell me if he was punished, where are you getting this? Nor was the feedback notification mentioned. I had my friend add him to flist to see him play games after the fact.\n\nI know why the post was removed, to protect the intentional feeder. Funny how they say you need evidence he was actually inting, but the only evidence you can actually provide is breaking the rules for providing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-09-04T06:03:19.492+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a clarity statement. So many people seem to think mods and specialist are Riot Employees. Glad you knew, now someone who didn't but sees your post knows too.\n\nThink something was misunderstood here. You can also turn ally chat off now. Could always voice with a premade.\n\nAgain this is more of a clarity thing. Many people seem to go \"why was I punished but not them\" but assume you always get a notification which isn't true.\n\nWhat is proof going to do for us? Whether he fed or not doesn't actually matter to the board community. We can't punish them. Unless you want vigilante justice or people trying to add the person and spamming them with chat.\n\nI can't really see the clip details as I typically use my mobile to access the forums.

The Ezreal in question HAS NOT PLAYED A GAME SINCE THE 0-17 GAME.\nThey're probably closing the ticket BECAUSE HE GOT PUNISHED, yet you keep spamming them over and over. They do not have to tell you that he got punished.\n\nYou will not be unbanned, because the ban was given correctly. Someone else can't make you do something in this video game, you have control over your actions. The inting Ezreal didn't make you try to get a rise out of the enemy zed, you did. You kept spamming \"report this, why won't you report\" all game, which is against the rules. 1 report in a game = 9 reports in a game, or any number inbetween. \n\nThere are 4 levels of punishments. 10 game chat restriction, 25 game chat restriction, 14 day ban, and perma ban. Each level, the amount of rudeness/negativity required to go to the next is lowered. At this point, you will be banned for one game with any negativity. I advise mute and ignore other players. If someone ints, just ignore it and report at end of game.\n\nHowever, if you \"don't care because you can buy an account for $1\" as you said in your other post, well, why are you making such a big deal out of it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-04T05:15:22.444+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't this have been added to your existing thread?","replies":[{"poster":"KimbleeNA","date":"2019-09-04T05:16:42.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"A whole new topic with an entirely different video regarding an entirely different issue within the spectrum of the last post is spam...got it.
