Well you know how you also make completely different artwork for champions, and even change blood effects and such for China? Why not simply give graves his cigar back for us Americans and the Europians, and just leave the Chinese one alone without his cigar? Wouldn&#039;t that not only abide by the Chinese law, but also let Graves have his cigar for the rest of us?","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-08-05T15:17:23.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because, as they said, they don't want different regions to have need different splash arts or whatever because of cultural sensitivity. They'd rather just not have the cigar for everyone than have it for some and not for others. That's the whole reason why Karthus is a withered necromancer now and not very skeletony anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-08-05T15:27:59.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, they make different splash arts and even in game effects, for China alone. Thus they cannot use that argument as they already make differences based on national law and cultural sensitivity.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-08-05T15:47:22.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's something they want to change though, and they've said that. They don't want to have to censor for one particular part of the world; they want everyone to have the same experience regardless of where you are.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-08-07T01:48:18.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But we aren't talking about gameplay. We are talking about a single splash art that does not effect the gameplay at all. Giving graves his cigar for western players will have no more effect than Leona having both a western and Chinese splash art, which she does.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-08-07T02:41:57.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who said we were talking about gameplay? Riot doesn't want the game to be different across regions for whatever reason; they want a consistent experience. That's why they're willing to get rid of a cigar. The art is also a part of the game, and they want that to be consistent to and not have to censor for some people. They'll likely continue with this in the future so that there _won't be_ a chinese version of a splash art. There won't need to be, because the art will be able to work everywhere. They'd rather everyone have the same experience all around. That's the point.
