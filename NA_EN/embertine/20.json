She can reduce the cooldown to 4.5 seconds with 40% CDR.\n\nAnnie can stun 7.75 times over the course of 80 seconds, for 1.75 seconds each. She can reduce this to 7.75 times every 48 seconds, or about once every 6 seconds. Her stuns, however, are not evenly spread out.\n\nSion can stun once every 6 seconds, for 2.25 seconds, but has to wait for a 2 second windup to get his full stun. He can reduce the CD to 3.6 seconds, for a net total of 5.6 seconds.\n\nTwisted Fate can stun once every 6 seconds, for 2 seconds, but has to wait for his card to hit the right option and fire before he starts his CD. He can reduce the CD to 3.6 seconds.\n\nSimilarly, Brand can stun once every 6 seconds, for 2 seconds, and can reduce the CD to 3.6 seconds. However, he doesn't need to wait to use his stun.\n\nBetween TF and Brand, I think you could probably keep someone down permanently, given enough mana regen and perfect play(instant chain gold cards). With any of the others, you could definitely hold someone down permanently.\n\nIf you're counting roots, Morgana roots for 3 seconds with 11 second CD, reduced 6.6. \nKarma (w/ult) roots for 3.25 seconds every 12 seconds, reduced 7.2. With passive, she can have her ult up every 6.6 seconds(2 autos + Q)","replies":[]},{"poster":"NewFoundAbility","date":"2015-10-03T04:15:05.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i wonder how long you could chain cc someone.\n\n{{champion:111}} I've been glued to the floor before on Nautilus.
