Because I make mistakes.\n\nI sometimes forget to ward. I sometimes initiate fights we can&#039;t win. I sometimes miss my skill shots, and fail to dodge the enemy&#039;s. I sometimes pick a champion that doesn&#039;t work well with the rest of my team&#039;s champions. Sometimes I make a mistake that causes my lane opponent to snowball out of control. I sometimes get fed off my ass and do not make the proper decisions to carry our team&#039;s momentum and achieve victory.\n\nDo I get trolls, and afkers? Yeah we all do. But I admit that for the most part, I am bronze because of my own mistakes. After all I can't improve unless I fix what I'm doing wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"SpearKitty","date":"2016-05-20T19:14:28.811+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ok, congratulations, you're on your way _out_ of bronze. Acknowledging your faults is the first step in the right direction. Now you just need to fix those issues. Having trouble hitting skillshots? Go into customs and practice, even bots can help (try intermediate bots because they actually use dodging scripts) Having trouble warding? Set a timer to beep every 10 seconds and every time it goes off, look at the minimap and determine where you need to put vision, and then put vision there (put a sticky note on your monitor near the map if you want some extra help remembering to ward). Having trouble with your lane? Play safe. Ward entry points, stick to tower, ask for ganks (your jungler will have a much easier time ganking if you call out wards and are pushed in) The learning teamfights part is probably the hardest thing to practice, but it can be practiced. Play some normals and test your limits. Once you find your limit in teamfights, push it and try to get better at it before going into ranked again. :) Sorry if this was a bit too rambly, but I hope i could help you in climbing out of bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2016-05-21T09:07:16.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"^^This.\n\nPractise skillshots by playing URF or urfbots. For teamfighting, I have 2 useful tactics: during loading predict how the teamfights will play out and your optimal role in them and build accordingly. Re-evaluate later in case one particular person is fed (and its bronze they will be). Step 2 is to record your games and at least watch the teamfights, to see the flow and get a grasp of the threats and opportunities teamfights afford.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WeedTits","date":"2016-05-20T19:10:25.802+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":85,"body":"Yeah when they said you needed to acknowledge your own mistakes to get better they didn't mean for you to post it on the bloody forums.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2016-05-20T19:16:11.014+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":2,"body":"I was making a point.
