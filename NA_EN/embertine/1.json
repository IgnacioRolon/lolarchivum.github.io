People knew what to expect for 2015. They knew (most) of who was good and who wasn't. And as is the case for almost every random game mode, people started taking it too seriously. IF you weren't picking one of the OP champs, then what was even then point?!\n\nBut it is the problem the mode runs into. Some champions are just so broken on it that you can't go against them unless you're also one of the broken champions. So the pool of \"viable\" champions shrinks really small really quickly. I'd have to imagine this was the biggest change between first and second years. The ability to try out new stuff died much faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Kairya","date":"2016-01-28T16:38:15.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well thats certainly true. But the problem were also the truly broken champs, which were either urf-sized or disabled from the beginning. In 2014 you still had to face those champs, and even if you lost it was kinda funny to watch. Then they got disabled after a few days and that was good too, because we had to move on.\n\nPerhaps that's the trick. They should just randomly disable a few champs everyday so people are forced to pick something else up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mael bro","date":"2016-01-26T23:06:57.399+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kairya,realm=EUW,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=wewPhErx,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-01-26T22:12:05.090+0000)\n>\n> I really liked ascension and would love to see that back.\n\nYES PLEASE {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2016-01-27T08:15:39.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ascension is the most underrated gamemode along with Doom bots.","replies":[{"poster":"Kairya","date":"2016-01-27T08:30:23.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought those two should stick around.\nAscension to make use of a Map, that is otherwise not reallly played on.\nDoom-bots so we could actually have challenging practice opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2016-01-27T11:21:31.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
