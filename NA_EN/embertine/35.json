But there are so many more of this minority speaking out against Dynamic Queue, than there are of the extremely fewer minority of people whom are defending it.\n\nThis tells me two things.\n\nOne, that with millions of players not speaking out in either case, that the actual majority of players don&#039;t really care about Dynamic at all, and just like to play the game, go to cons, and root for LCS teams.\n\nTwo, that there are in fact a much greater amount of people that want Dynamic gone, than there are of people whom want it to stay.\n\nThe vocal minority has a vocal minority basically.\n\nAm I defending Dynamic Queue? No, because it is painfully obvious that it has caused problems, and that it isn&#039;t performing as it was intended to.\n\nAm I against Dynamic Queue? When it comes to going up against premades, yes.\n\nWhile I am a solo player, and I more than fully realize that the mistakes I make are what keep me from climbing up, It is frustrating to know that Riot has purposely set it up so that premades are matched up against solos on purpose, and that the more premades on a team, the more the game searches out higher skilled solos to match them against.\n\nIt makes no sense for me to get my mmr up by doing well and winning 5 matches in a row, get promoted, and then the game searches my slightly higher mmr out to match me against premade teams, of which have much better communication and coordination then my team, and then for the next three to five matches I lose against premades and get demoted back down. All just because I was doing well on my own.\n\nTo me this is the system punishing the player for succeeding and isn&#039;t right.\n\nYes I know that my teams also get premades in them, but most often they will have less premades than the opposing team, because I&#039;m a solo player picked solely to fill in the gaps and offer a little more challenge for the enemy premades.\n\nAnd before anyone goes on about my rank, premades are effecting every elo, not just the higher ups.\n\nEverything I&#039;ve said here is based on personal experience and what Riot has stated.\n\nSolo Queue had no problems at all, and there was no reason for Dynamic Queue other then to allow three and four man premades to play ranked together, as we already had duo tied into solo, and five man teams was a queue all it&#039;s own.\n\nAnd before someone says anything about trolls, lane picks, afks, and the like, that has nothing to do with actual queue, and is just a player to player thing.\n\nReally the only good thing Riot did when they released Dynamic Queue was releasing the new champion selection with it.\n\nAm I going to stop playing ranked? No. Ranked is my primary play mode simply because for me there's more meaning to winning.\n\nAm I an idiot for complaining about DQ and still playing ranked anyway? Sure why not?\n\nRiot will change it in the future. Maybe they will keep it, maybe they wont. I don't know.\n\nAnyway that's my piece. I've said enough.\n\n**td;dr** The people speaking against the &quot;vocal minority&quot; are just a vocal minority of that vocal minority. You shouldn&#039;t get punished for succeeding. and new champ select was good, DQ wasn&#039;t.\n\nPS. Sorry about this post everyone. I just had a very bad day and had to let off some steam.

Yes, not everyone knows about them and that's part of why we don't represent a larger portion of the playerbase. But no matter what is being discussed it shouldn't be something that drives people away from the boards. We have several subsections. You should take some time to stop by all of them, see what different discussions are being had, and give your input on topics that interest you. I post mostly in G&B, GD, and PB&M. Most of my posts are in regards to helping newer players learn the nuances of the game, critical issues that affect all players in a negative fashion, strategy in high level play, or friendly banter in GD about any random subject.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Fidori","date":"2016-06-08T18:10:46.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I've been around for almost a year now and explored everything on here (I read Player Behavior for fun to see people's \"why you ban me?\" posts) but originally I  came from a random link I think.","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-06-08T18:33:22.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mr Fidori,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=I60ub8Pj,comment-id=0001000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-08T18:10:46.268+0000)\n>\n> Snip\n\nThe coolest stuff is found on GD!

The old forums pre season 5 basically only had traffic on that one subsection and nothing happening on the others. It made the boards a cluttered mess, imagine if ALL the subsections now were combined into just ONE section. It was tough to keep track of a conversation or topic because the pages moved so fast and new threads were created non stop. The new boards, after originally being very poor, have become quite an improvement now over what we had in season 1-4. As much as I use the other board subsections I still hang out mostly in GD as its the \"chill spot\" for the boards, the place where daily forum goers come to hang out and chat with one another about life, world events, the game, other games, share interesting stories, make/play with friends etc. All the oldest and most veteran posters can be found there and while we occasionally venture to other subsections we all hang out there more than anywhere else.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2016-06-08T04:18:38.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jaymc1130,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=I60ub8Pj,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-06-07T15:47:55.117+0000)\n>\n> Of course it does...

In a premade they will automatically be able to coordinate, and you have a lot more influence over them. You have little to no influence or power over the trolling Disco Nunu(which doesn't exist anymore, but you get the idea). You have limited time during champ select. You have infinite time with premades,and can plan before champ select happens. Premades don't have to type a manifesto, so we have to. What's the guarantee that they'll listen and cooperate like premades do?\n\nThere's also a limit to the amount of characters you can put in at a time; You'll have to type the manifesto on another document, and keep copy+pasting it in intervals.\n\nIt's up to them to cooperate. So when you get a team with 4 other soloers, it's a gamble. No influence, they  can do whatever they want.\n\nYou go premade with 4 other people,the gamble becomes guaranteed cooperation, and even more teamwork and communication  than if you had a solo team that did try to cooperate.\n\n\n> Its no different than getting bad players on your team. You just have to hope for ppl who want to communicate.\n\nAnother thing. In solo Q, you have the random chance to have bad players. If you premade(I assume you premade to win), you are guaranteed to not have a bad player.\n\nIf you get matched with 4 other solo que players , 4 of them could be bad. The opposing side has a 3 man premade; 3 of them aren't going to be \"bad\" because they group together to win. This doesn't account for the elo boosting that happens a lot. Riot actually supports this. At least, they have no issues with watching  a Platinum Rengar main  smurf boosting his viewers on twitch.\n\n>  But if you're going to make excuses\n\nThere's a difference between flaws in the system and excuses. These are flaws in the system; Being in a premade gives you a significant advantage over nonpremades. It's a fact. \n\n> Until Riot gets numerical evidence that DQ isn't satisfying the rest of the community, that is when they might (most likely) will revert to Solo Queue.\n\nThey won't do that. They had one biased survey, that's it. No update. When was the last time they counter their playerbase? It's been a while since that too. There have been a large sum of surveys which point towards SoloQ being more popular. The recent roundtable discussion by Riot is another example of DynaQ being less popular; It's the only recent official Riot video that has had that kind of dislike: like ratio. They can pull the numbers out of their hats, and people will suck it up. On the other hand, the surveys used by the playerbase have their methodology more laid out, so it's less manipulative. \n\nDude. Anti DynaQ has roused the greatest amount of animosity and players, despite their lack of power have tried everything they can; Petitions, numerical data, arguing, debates, pro players debating on Riot, trying to get everyone to quit playing ranked(the increased queue times are noticeable, especially at higher elos). Pro players have just abandoned Riot's servers to play on their own.\n\nOnce again, trying to communicate.

In a premade they will automatically be able to coordinate, and you have a lot more influence over them. You have little to no influence or power over the trolling Disco Nunu(which doesn't exist anymore, but you get the idea). You have limited time during champ select. You have infinite time with premades,and can plan before champ select happens. Premades don't have to type a manifesto, so we have to. What's the guarantee that they'll listen and cooperate like premades do?\n\nI **know** that premades do get an advantage but if you look at it that way, you wont get anything done as a solo player. It is still possible to climb and many solo players have given up over this. Trust me, I know premades have advantages.

The opposing side has a 3 man premade; 3 of them aren't going to be \"bad\" because they group together to win. This doesn't account for the elo boosting that happens a lot. Riot actually supports this. At least, they have no issues with watching a Platinum Rengar main smurf boosting his viewers on twitch.\n\nI honestly cannot respond to that. You got me there :(\n\nI just wanted to make it clear that I do not like Dyanmic Queue but if I sit around and mope about how it is the reason that I've been demoted more than 15 times in Platinum then I wont get anything done. \n\nFinally I will say this, \"Not everyone wants to communicate\" wont cut it in a team game.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-06-10T15:19:50.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Just another reason why the unwillingness to communicate is the real reason people are losing games despite the disadvantages of dynamic queue.

Thing is most people do not post their like/love of something like this. So that will lead to showing more people against it then in favor of it on boards. Another thing is given the number of dislike post on a subject, people that are in of  favor it again feel like they're beating a dead horse. It feels silly trying to shed light onto others who are going to hate everything you say since you did not agree with them across so many posts. So for people like myself I post here and there to really silly posts about DQ, but I am in favor of it. \n\nThat is real majority of players. The case for DQ the real number of players DQ is targeted at favor or simply do not care. Lets face it they're there to play with friends and have fun, Riot is trying to get them another sense of enjoyment through rank play.\n\nThe amount of premades you say you face after winning 5 games is stupid high. Or it was the same number of people as in old soloq. I see the same people often, and yet to see the same premade 3+ in a game. Speaking of my own odds, it still feels the same as soloq. Getting the same duo in the game on one team or another. Out of the 2 games I have played solo vs 4+ the games were much easier. Even if they could talk, they were still easy to kill as support blitz. As I stated above already, this is so old typing this out. People have to remember League is a team based game, it should be a skill you improve at even when soloq. You should have some skills how to act like a team mate to randoms. Team work is a skill on its own, watching minimap alerting others of what is going on. Assist team members with roams/teleports. Just because you can talk to someone does not mean you gain the team work skill set.\n\nFor premades on your side or on other team, most people remember losses more then wins in ranked matches. Unless some funny or crazy thing happen on a win, I know I mainly forget about that game. Though I can count the number of games I lost in a day due to someone afk,dc, someone losing lane bad, crazy bad call, etc. etc.. Those are the games you want to remember though, you simply do not say GG bad game and go on to next. Something bad happened here which cased the loss. If you can find a way to fix it, odds are you win more. Simply put learn from mistakes. \n\nHow did soloq have no problems... It had problems that Riot is trying to address with DQ. I had friends that refused to play league because of how bad soloq was. They only did rank 3/5 because they felt soloq was just stupid thing to be in place. Then there is another problem you pointed out. What if you have 4 people? Are you forever stuck playing nonranked games? How often was rank 3/5 really played? I know I never touched them for years on end. Even when I had 5+ friends playing with me. Making a rank 5s team just seemed like a waste of time.\n\nI feel bad because really don't want to come off sounding like attacking you. It is really just myself trying to bring other points into what is being said.

I'm going to play it no matter what Riot does as with every change they make, it's something more I must overcome, allowing me to become more skilled over time.\n\nWill I ever rise out of the lower ranks?
