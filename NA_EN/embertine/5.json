She exposed as much skin as possible, not for sake of exposing skin but for showing dominance. Showing how much she does not care. How much stronger than anyone else she is.

SEE this company totally doesn't oversexualize everything! So stop complaining!'\n\nI mean, lol. It's FINE to create and enjoy something sexual, like erotic video game fanart. But stop defending it with the most idiotic of reasons.

Should I go get more?","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-08-30T00:49:43.917+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":18,"body":"I'm going to quote you with this said by another user:\n\n> You don't need to have all your skin showing to be sexualized...\n> \n> See : Huge boobs, huge ass\n\nAnd leave you be. IMO boobplates and purposely arching a woman's back to seem 'sexy' are not good examples.\n1) The way Riven is standing in Championship? That's not a natural posture, and neither is it comfortable. \n2) Kayle's individual, METAL boob socks on her breastplate. That's not how armour works.\nProject Leona is very good, that's a great breastplate design! Individual pockets for each breast... is dumb and uncessary.\n\n'If no boobs, how woman?' comes to mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-08-30T00:56:48.522+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":10,"body":"Well the \"boob\" plate actually existed in real life, so it's not hard to see a game company use it on a medieval warrior woman.\n\nAnd also, Just because a woman has huge boobs does not mean she is sexualized. There are plenty of real life woman whom have large breasts without implants. So it's no surprise that a gaming company will also include large breasted woman in their game, especially if they want to appeal to both genders and want the female gamers to have characters they can identify with. The same can be said of butts too. Now if the character is designed in such a way that the most prominent feature and the only thing you even notice when looking at them, is their breasts and ass, then that is overly sexualized. However just because a female character has large breasts and/or ass, does not mean they are sexualized, only that they have that body type. There are plenty of woman in real life whom have busts and butt sizes like those of the woman in league.","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-08-30T01:11:41.270+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":6,"body":"http://io9.com/why-boob-plate-armor-would-actually-kill-you-496925522\n\nThe only 'boobplate' that exists are for modern day LARP. Cosplay recreated from a work of fiction. It does not belong on an actual human figure on the battlefield.\nI wouldn't want to wear a piece of metal with cups cut out of it specifically for my breasts. I already have the underwire of my bra poking my ribcage. Metal? lol no thanks. \n\nI was merely quoting the other person that showing skin isn't the only way to sexualize someone, but okay. Why does Orianna, a clockwork ROBOT. A METAL CREATION, have breasts? Because if no boobs, how know female?\\\n\n I'm reiterating that it's fine to have oversexualization. Just stop defending it by saying 'It's okay guys, this handful of other characters aren't sexualized so it balances out!'","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-08-30T01:57:59.986+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":8,"body":"Well actually it has been found to have existed. However the fact that woman were not typically found on the battlefield meant that blacksmiths never really made any, with the exception of a few rare instances of which wealthy families wanted them for their daughters or wives. While it looked nothing like the boobplate you see in games, it did infact take into account the female chest in its design, leaving room for her bust. It wasn't made with cups, but instead had the front of the plate sloped outward to provide room.\n\nAnd Oriana's body was designed to appear as a woman. So of course she would have her chest plate shaped as it is. In lore that is what she was designed as. If her following lore is a problem then it is the lore that needs to be changed.\n\nAnd it isn't just a handful of female champions. If when you look at a female champion and you immediately think sex, than you are the one with the problem, not Riot. Just because a woman happens to be in a bikini does not means she's sexualized. She's just in a bikini. Just because a woman has large breasts and butt doesn't mean she's sexualized either, it's simply her genetics. And if you want to blame that then you need to start going to god about it and not complaining about people making fictional characters in a fictional world based in a game, that has no actual impact on anything of importance in real life.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
