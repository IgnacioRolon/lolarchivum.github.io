I&#039;m not saying she&#039;s sexualized, because she's not. I&#039;m saying that she&#039;s a little too humanized, being that the artists are trying to make her look too human in shape. When I think of a mythical lamb, I imagine fluffy wool and graceful movements.\n\nI think they need to widen Lamb&#039;s waist a bit. I&#039;m not saying get rid of her curves entirely, just make it so her waist isn&#039;t so narrow.","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-09-25T14:29:59.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She looks like Midna from Twilight Princess more than a human imho.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-09-25T14:32:30.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that you mention it she does bring a fiery Midna to mind.
