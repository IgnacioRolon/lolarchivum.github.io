Bringing you the latest news on Riot News Network! Today we are covering what is becoming known as, The Vote Wars. First let&#039;s get some insight from the player base.\r\n\r\nhttp://img.memecdn.com/league-of-legends-problem_o_2369883.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/maxresdefault_zps0abpb6op.jpg Okay. . .moving on! Let&#039;s instead get some insight from Embertine. Now Embertine, in your own words could you describe The Vote Wars for us?\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/Lorana_zps6bvfd4yb.png Uh, well I don&#039;t know why you would call it that. I mean for the most part it&#039;s been pretty one sided.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/maxresdefault_zps0abpb6op.jpg So what you&#039;re saying is that the posters on the Memes &amp; Games boards are making headway in the battle against salt on the boards?\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/Lorana_zps6bvfd4yb.png I don&#039;t know about that. We try and all, but we really just want to make people laugh. I mean if we can get even just a few people to smile or laugh, then it&#039;s been worth the effort.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/maxresdefault_zps0abpb6op.jpg It has been speculated that you and the other posters are actually farming upvotes to create a Weapon of Mass Upvotes, or WMU for short. Is it true that you all are making a Upvote Bomb, and if so exactly what will it do?\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/Lorana_zps6bvfd4yb.png No comment.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/maxresdefault_zps0abpb6op.jpg Are you intending to use this Upvote Bomb against the salt on the boards, or on Riot itself?\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/Lorana_zps6bvfd4yb.png **NO COMMENT!**\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/maxresdefault_zps0abpb6op.jpg  It seems we&#039;ve lost connection with Embertine. Let&#039;s move on to our next guest, the person whom many believe to have started the Gif Wars that once rocked the Memes &amp; Games boards, none other than Laughing fish himself!\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/Laughing%20Fish_zpslsaymnlb.gif \r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/maxresdefault_zps0abpb6op.jpg I&#039;m sorry could you repeat that? You don&#039;t seem to be coming in clearly?\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/Laughing%20Fish_zpslsaymnlb.gif\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/maxresdefault_zps0abpb6op.jpg Okay we&#039;ll have to come back to you later. Now let&#039;s go to my identical twin sister, (who is nowhere near as attractive as me) and see what&#039;s happening on the front!\r\n\r\nhttp://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah116/Daniel_Fritsch/maxresdefault_zps0abpb6op.jpg Thank you Janna! (and I heard that you know!) Right now I&#039;m standing outside the military operations zone where the war is being raged!

If only Riot would push more funding towards the upvoters it might bring an end to this conflict so much sooner. Now back to you Janna!
