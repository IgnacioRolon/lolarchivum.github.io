Too late to do any more than morn. He tried a 92nd time and finally reaches him in his last moments in life. Ekko realizes then that no matter how many times he goes back, he would always be too late. However this time he receives a clue from his dying friend. And so Ekko goes back for the 93rd time. This time he attempts to kill the man whom has robbed him of his friend. However in the confrontation Ekko&#039;s device is damaged, and he is forced to go back one final time. With his device broken he has only one chance left. This time he has a decision to make. To kill the man whom has murdered his friend in cold blood, or to once again race to his friend&#039;s side? Having already arrived to find his friend dead 91 times, and having already reached and watched him die once. . . .Ekko forgoes vengeance. On his 94th rewind, he returns to his friend. And instead of exacting revenge for his murder, Ekko chooses to remain by his friend&#039;s side, and comfort him as he passes.\r\n\r\nTo me this speaks volumes of whom Ekko is as a person. While some people are complaining about the lack of lore and how Ekko has no ties with other champions, I feel that there is lore within the characters themselves. While it is not everything I want from lore, it is enough for me (at least for now) and gets me interested in the champion.\r\n\r\nI know you all in the lore department are hard at work despite what many believe. And I hope you the best of luck and much inspiration for your writing!\r\n\r\nSincerely, Embertine.","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2015-05-23T16:37:21.091+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"On the surface the comic is pretty shallow, but dang there was a lot hidden in the details.\n\nMy only fear is that they won't follow up on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Wakamune","date":"2015-05-23T18:23:36.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zenthon127,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=N0oEdoUp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-23T16:37:21.091+0000)\n>\n> On the surface the comic is pretty shallow, but dang there was a lot hidden in the details.\n> \n> My only fear is that they won't follow up on this.\n\nThey still have a chance to connect the whistling man to other champions, tbh.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-05-23T21:14:52.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does it matter his friend died because he did pull his device too late even thou he had a feeling that his friend was in trouble i for example would comfort my friend in his final minutes and then i go rewind and kill the evil guy who killed my friend and why ? because i in place of ekko would not forget the final minutes with my friend and i wont forget the feeling how good it felt to kill that evil guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunice","date":"2015-05-24T01:22:15.475+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Ekko, it's not about whether or not he saw the final moments of his friend's life.\n\nIt's about whether or not his friend had someone with him during the final moments of his life.","replies":[{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-05-24T01:24:09.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hm but his memory would be the same you know ? dead is dead.","replies":[{"poster":"Delioth","date":"2015-05-24T21:03:38.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen the baddie once or twice, I can seek that vengeance any day.\nI can only comfort my friend's dying breath once.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Desmond Law","date":"2015-05-23T19:15:18.041+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ekko ran 91 times for about 4 minutes each run.

It's inconsistent what changes though. Inconsistency kills suspension of disbelief.

His body is fine. But his mind remembers having run all over the place, being beaten up, and even having an arm broken. And as we all know, the brain rules the body. Ekko appears to be out of breath and has phantom pain because his brain thinks that he is damaged and tired, despite his body telling him otherwise.\n\nNot sure about the aging thing though. Maybe a side effect of the rewind? A story fail safe to make him mortal? Bleh, too much conjecture for my taste.","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-05-24T20:28:24.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if his body doesn't actually need the extra oxygen, he wouldn't be breathing heavily.
