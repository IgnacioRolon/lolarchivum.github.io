Most games will end between 16 and 23 minutes.\n\nI know that League is supposed to be a fast paced heart pounding experience but this is crazy. I remember a day way back when when I could build full tank as Leona and last 8 seconds with 3 people on me and get back up with GA to last another 4 seconds while my team came in. Now even at full tank I&#039;m lucky to last 3 seconds against 2 people. There&#039;s also the problem of not being able to build tank because by the time I&#039;ve finished two tank items we are down to our inhibitor turrets.\n\nIt feels like the game is set up now days so that there is no stalling to catch the enemy team out anymore. You either win as soon as possible or you survive long enough to start a surrender vote.\n\nIs it just my games this is happening in? Or has League matches become too short altogether?","replies":[{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2016-09-07T16:33:29.045+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They last until 45 minutes, but they are over by 12.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2016-09-07T16:26:08.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've kind of noticed this too... The snowball effect is getting very rough.\n\nI've had maybe 5 to 10 *close* games in my time playing, the others are getting stomped or stomping with no real in between. Then again, this happens up on the LCS stage too.\n\nOnce a team gets a momentum going, it feels nigh impossible to stop, and this whether winning or losing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-07T16:29:58.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Depending on your elo. Bronze - silver ( half the time gold, sometimes plat)\ny'all give up a few kills and basically tilt out and have no thoughts of Objectives so the enemy team can just take their power lead and force it down your throats so the game will end quicker. ( General assumption of the Elo, not directed towards you specifically)\n\nBut tbh, thats kind of the gist of it, most people instantly give up and become upset by that point and don't understand wave control as well as obj control so the games just get punished. \n\nThe games were meant to be shorter overall because alot of people started complaning, so theres been changes to where if you get a lead it's easier to snowball, but at the same time if played right can be stalled out, but that comes back up to Obj control and things like picking people off while having alot of wards out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2016-09-07T16:30:22.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really feels like every other game for me is nearly an hour long, it's probably more like 1 in 4 games but still.","replies":[]}]}
