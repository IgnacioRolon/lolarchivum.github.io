Everyone else was AFK while trying to reconnect. It was funny. Cracked me up, since this is NOT the first time it has happened and with 5.22 happens a bit more often than it use to.

Damn near brought a tear to my eye at how funny it was. Free farmed a bit, free dragon, got killed by Baron. And then people start reconnecting once i respawn.\n\nAnoying when it stutters, but great when everyone dc's from a Riot Server issue  XD.\n\nI even noted that certain ppl with crappy connections make me lag if i get close to them, and if they dc, i stop lagging XD.
