For the most part cats reduce a lot of their momentum by their landing, some kind of bio mechanism they use with their feet. But cats are injured and killed all the time from falling from extreme heights.\n\nMost of the reason a cat won't be injured for the most part has to do with the physics of its fall, including the way its body relaxes enough to allow it to turn back onto its feet, and spread out to increase drag, and thus reduce velocity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FistOfSharkiesha","date":"2015-09-21T07:53:08.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't it depend heavily on the surface they land on?

A little bit of grass on top of dirt isn't much softer than straight up concrete, but even so, it wouldn't matter. Basically, as long as they're able to get their feet under them, it's physically impossible for them to fall fast enough that landing would kill them. They just have too much drag for their weight to pick up a lethal speed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-09-21T00:19:05.360+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"When he jumps the wrong {{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-09-21T03:46:42.101+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"The wrong AP {{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-09-21T20:10:16.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boxes would kill rengar faster than rengar can kill a squishy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-09-20T22:57:28.820+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"When {{champion:157}} hits Rengar with a tornado mid jump.","replies":[{"poster":"HighH1","date":"2015-09-20T23:03:40.747+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"When{{champion:268}} ults him mid jump","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-09-20T23:09:01.470+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"when {{champion:33}} Powerballs him mid jump","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-09-20T23:38:06.758+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"When {{champion:79}} ults him mid jump","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-09-21T00:05:06.950+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"when {{champion:79}} body slams him mid jump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2015-09-21T00:01:19.704+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"When {{champion:266}} decides not to Q jump.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fowus","date":"2015-09-20T23:46:47.397+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:34}} walls him","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-09-21T20:11:39.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would honor that anivia.\n\nWalling a rengar mid jump *and* denying a jump?
