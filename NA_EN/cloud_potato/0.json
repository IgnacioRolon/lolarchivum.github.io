Each hit gives 10 Edge, up to a maximum of 100, and each point of Edge gives 0.1% bonus damage, up to 10%. Additionally, Wind Slash no longer deals extra damage based on lower enemy HP, but based on Edge instead (and consumes it).\n\nThese changes are aimed on making Riven have a ramp up on her damage. This lessens the ability for her to roll her face across the keyboard when she&#039;s ahead and win. In general Edge does not provide that much damage outside of her R, where it is now a significant factor. This curbs a major source of snowballing, where a Riven with R ready could kill people quite easily due to the massive power increase it gives. Now Riven will always need to fight for an extended period of time unless she gets really really far ahead.\n\nNow why does this gut her? Because now she always needs to fight for an extended period of time. Riven has an absolutely awful time fighting when she is behind her opponent, because she is entirely melee and does not build defensively. The only chance she has at the moment is the extreme power behind R giving her an opening to catch up, and Edge will remove its ability to do this.\n\nEdge is a good first step to a better Riven, but Riven&#039;s inability to play when behind is something that needs to be addressed, otherwise this is just a fat nerf across the board.","replies":[{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2015-10-01T04:13:03.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"good. ruck fiven\n\nher kit should take some actual skill to use ffs.  suck it up","replies":[{"poster":"Cloud Potato","date":"2015-10-01T15:06:38.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't increase her skill requirement.

It makes her gameplay more involved while at the same time taking away some of the cheesey stunts she pulls. Overall seems like a healthy change, though may need some stat tweaking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"seasonedfox","date":"2015-10-01T15:49:08.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and what champion do you play that takes soooo much skill {{champion:157}} ? a qq ....q r? q e q q q e qqqqqqqq e qqqqq miss qqqqqqqqqq yeeeah","replies":[]},{"poster":"Indrift","date":"2015-10-01T04:14:19.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"you,my man,know what you're talking about\nhttp://junkee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/facebook-thumbs-up-1024x952.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2015-10-01T15:15:09.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realize that she gets an overall 10% damage amp from the new passive, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Cloud Potato","date":"2015-10-02T03:52:19.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She can only access that damage by spending an extended period of time attacking enemies. A Riven who is behind will die before she can get her damage up, and in teamfights she will rarely be able to build it up for free. It only really helps Riven when she's able to fight her foe in lane, and due to the fact that Riven snowballs easily, it will make it easier for Riven to spin out of control.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erotic Terrorist","date":"2015-10-01T16:04:03.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Riven has an absolutely awful time fighting when she is behind her opponent, because she is entirely melee and does not build defensively.\n\n\nYou mean you don't build Tank Riven?
