I tried to find solutions in many many threads and/or youtube videos. There's about 10+ fixes that I tried to apply but none of them worked for me. Including changing the DNS, turning off firewall, changing the IE settings, resintalling the game, repairing the client - you name it, I've done it. \r\n\r\nEverytime I try to log in, it's like the client doesn't even connect to the goddamn Login server to check the validity of the username/password. I can put in ANY information into the username/password and I always get the same message. \r\n\r\nInterestingly enough a few days ago I was playing normally and then all of a sudden something happened and I can't figure out what -__-\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful if some1 could offer a solution :) Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nAwnyi","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T16:25:30.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network seems to be having problems establishing a connection to our authentication servers.

As i mentioned above, I went trough all these \"connection issues\" guides and no tips there helped me. However, I restored my PC to the point where it worked, installed a fresh Korean client and played normally. Now it doesnt work again. I think I know the turning point now.\n\nIn my dorimitory I play on a wired connection. It worked fine untill I went to school where I connected to a WiFi. Once I returned back to my dorm and connected the wired connection, I'm getting the same error again. I tried to trun off my WiFi adapter to ensure that I'm 100% only on the wired connection, however it still deosn't work. At least now I know the cause of the problem. Any suggestion, knowing this information? Thanks in advance.\n\nAwnyi","replies":[{"poster":"Awnyi","date":"2016-09-07T04:42:37.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I tried a couple more things, which all didn't work, but I'll list them anyway to save some time and provide more info and hope somebody maybe one day contacts me with a solution ^_^ \n\nSyncing the windows clock\nDisabling firewall completely (also added the 5 exceptions)\nI don't have any antivirus program\nAll the CMD prompt stuff (flushdns, renew, etc)\nChanging stuff in my hosts file\nChanging stuff in my IE9 (default browser, advanced settings [revocation suttf etc.], loging into my acc in the browser)\nRestarting my laptop a thousand times\nChanging wired/wireless connections, none work\nTrying to find and cancel lolreplay processes\nRunning the hextech repair tool, which doesnt work for Korea tho (still ran it and also repatched the game)\nI do not use a VPN\n\nHopefuly some1 will get back to me.
