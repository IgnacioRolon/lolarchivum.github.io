From what I've seen (which tbh isn't much) she's considered more of a kite-mage in pro play, which Riot does tend to weigh much of their balancing against. But I could see it happening - I remember a few Rioters mentioning that a goal for them is to generally adjust the strength of mobility and allow mages to have defence against highly mobile assassins, which I think Ahri would be a necessary part of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crokinole Ace","date":"2016-04-14T22:18:49.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but\n\nbut\n\nbut\n\nAhri is awesome already.","replies":[{"poster":"Lanofrose","date":"2016-04-14T22:37:25.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using my example again as someone who likes mage ahri changes to her would be minimal as maybe only one or two things would be added to the passive, and maybe the W being reworked.\n\nThis would not be like the BIG SIX of the mage rework this would be one of the small projects joining the big assassin reworks, seeing as she does not need a VU, passive Q and R all work fine for the most part (upgrades to passive but it works for mage ahri part) , so unless im underestimating the change to W and some particle effect changes it wouldn't be a massive overhaul or anything like that.\n\nSomeone choosing Assassin Ahri would be the one noticing most of the changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Crokinole Ace","date":"2016-04-15T15:04:53.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, a closer read of your post helped me to understand what you're saying.

From what it sounds like, you pick the passive (or don't lol) at level 1 and cannot change it for the rest of the match. As much as I like it, there are some issues inherent within this type of concept.\n\nFirst, it would be difficult to balance, as it will inevitably boil down to \"this passive is better 9/10\" which would defeat it's purpose in the first place.\n\nSecond, that type of versatility could possibly crowd out other picks. Champs have clearly defined strengths and weaknesses, which is useful to keep in mind for champ select. If the passive changes her too much then it makes her too safe of a pick in champ select, as you cannot really counter her well. If the passive does not change her much at all, then it would also make it less attractive of a mechanic overall to implement.\n\nIt may be best to wait and see how she is after the Mage item update. Things like hextech actives may have a huge impact on mages in general","replies":[{"poster":"Lanofrose","date":"2016-04-14T23:10:52.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yepp that is the big issue im seeing with this\n\nI can see what u guys mean thought based on the idea of trading utility for damage\nThe issues would be\n1.\tWould this changes even be worth implementing as would her different “sides” be distinguishable enough\n2.\tOne side or the other would almost always be taken over the other (viktor old hexcore issue)\n3.     seems in general most ahri players are sick of adjusting to her changes in balance directions.\nIll think on this and see if there are any ways around this....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lanofrose","date":"2016-04-14T23:00:36.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was just posting on Vertigal stream about the idea of the rework but everyone seems pretty against the idea expect for the main idea behind the rework, **Being able to trade in utility for damage and visa versa **which was the main concept behind my mockup idea, so now im wondering if their is a better way to do this?","replies":[]}]}
