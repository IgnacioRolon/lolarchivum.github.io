They legit said &quot;It&#039;s flex queue so I do not have to try. If it was solo/duo I would try.&quot; I didn&#039;t realize ranked flex was for not trying and was intended for trolling. Did I miss something? I thought all ranked was for the serious and for trying your best. There are rewards to be had. I have the hardest time moving forward and getting out of low elo because trolls make it impossible to move forward. Well trolls and player who are just generally bad and should not be playing ranked yet, but that is another story.\r\n\r\nI honestly hate that there are 2 ranked queues now because this is not the first time I have had this happen. Where someone claims that ranked flex is beneath solo/duo so it does not matter. Then wtf are normals for? I like playing joke builds in normals or playing champs that don&#039;t normally go to a certain position. I have 2 friends that like to play ranked and we used to never be able to play together. Then S6 made it possible. But now it&#039;s S7 and flex queue is apparently the new normal but with actual built in disappointment in the form of demotions and lost promotions.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else witnessed this? It is rage inducing to say the least.","replies":[{"poster":"Astrovert","date":"2017-03-28T05:42:56.647+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its ranked, if people start admitting they are not trying then that is the same as throwing the game and that's bannable.\n\nYou aren't going to be able to convince them of the rules so just report the situation out and let it be dealt with.\nIt is easy to deal with someone who is stupid enough to convict themselves by saying something illegal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-28T01:05:08.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they can duo in solo queue. Flex queue was dead the moment Riot decided to go back on their word and not make Solo queue true solo because people who are serious about premaking just go there. When you have two sources offering the same experience, it's only natural that only one of them is taken seriously.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GeminiRune","date":"2017-03-28T01:13:00.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been against a Morde mid, Nunu and Pre-RW Galio bot duo in a recent Flex game if memory serves. We suffered a formidable loss. Frankly Flex is one of those semi-casual modes when it comes down to it. Unfortunately there's nothing that can be done about it. At least fortunately it doesn't affect your post season ranked rewards unless you want that bonus.","replies":[]}]}
