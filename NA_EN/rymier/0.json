The message said I needed to complete 10 games until I get rid of it... now that I've played 10 games I cant earn loot like hextec chests or fragments. Back to the end of season awards, i was wondering if I will be able to earn the rewards like the loading border, because I cant earn the loot?\r\nThank you in advance for your help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-05T23:03:35.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hextech crafting eligibility is independent of ranked reward requirements.  As long as you have finished your restrictions before the end of the season, you should be fine.  If you have anymore concerns about that, feel free to hit up the [PB Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation).  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Rymier","date":"2016-11-05T23:40:33.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much!!! Helped a lot!","replies":[]}]}]}
