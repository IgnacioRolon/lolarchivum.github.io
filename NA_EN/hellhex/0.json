It just started today. A few games will go fine, then in the middle of one, I get the \"attempting to reconnect\" box. It never actually does, so I have to close out an manually try to reconnect. This NEVER WORKS. Most times, I just get a black screen with the standard connection failure prompt. However, sporadically, i'll get to the loading screen, then when it gets to 100% I'll get a different \"Failled to connect\" message. (That one is titled \"network warning or something.)\n\nDuring all of this, my internet is fine. Everything else works on the same machine I'm trying to run league on, even other online games. The computer absolutely has a connection. I've tried restarting everything, shutting off my firewall, refreshing the DNS, etc, etc, etc. I have absolutely no idea what the issue could even be at this point, but now I have 10 minute waits to evens tart queues because i'm in low priority, and it's incredibly frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-23T23:54:46.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you mentioned that this happened with the latest patch, is this the only game where you experienced this issue?
