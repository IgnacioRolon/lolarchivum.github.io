My problem is though recently the game does load after champ select and I'm stuck with the League of Legends logo in the middle of my screen and if I try to even relaunch the client or wait it just says not responding. I don't know if anyone else is having this issue, but its gotten really annoying since it gave me lower priority queue after not loading in for so many games. Now I probably could of avoided this issue by going back to the legacy client sooner, but obviously its too late. I don't think riot can in fact change anything about leaverbuster affecting its players since its automated although I would just like to say I find it extremely unfair because I haven't left any games intentionally in a long time.

It's equally sucky for players in the match that don't have context as to why you're absent and negatively impacting **everyone** in the match. This is a primary reason as to why the system is designed to treat all disconnections as equals and why we cannot modify Leaverbuster penalties.\n\nCan you try using the Legacy Client and test in a few custom matches so you can let me know if these issues persist?","replies":[{"poster":"MadeofPurple","date":"2017-02-23T23:43:49.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I discovered I had leaverbuster once I went back to the legacy client. I can certainly try today or tomorrow although its going to take some time to wait for the timer to go down. I'm wondering though if it continued to happen would it be my computer's fault. If it would be I'd find that weird since I just got a new computer a month ago. The main thing I'm confused about is why I have a 20 minute wait time. Is it because of the past time before? I'll admit I used to leave games left and right when I first got into league two years ago, but I've broke that bad habit of just leaving games. Although I think it doesn't necessarily suck for the people playing with or against me since to my knowledge they just remade the game after I restarted league and rejoined minutes after. Thank you for responding though, I appreciate it.\n\nEdit: I started 3 custom games so far and they loaded fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-26T22:27:20.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A 20-minute queue indicates that there was a *recent trend* of disconnecting, which eventually resulted in the 20min queue times. Since you've isolated this issue to the Beta Client, I'd recommend using the Legacy Client for now.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WillingToSeeYou","date":"2017-02-23T15:32:33.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here{{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"DrCottonBalls","date":"2017-04-06T03:33:15.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I having been experiencing the same issues, and I already sent a bug report in, and as soon as I did I got booted again.  So now it has me at a 10min queue.  Like its unfair, I havent done anything just like this other guy, and im getting punished.  Like there has to be a way for you guys to know when its us leaving vs us not being able to get on.  Maybe i could get back on if that new 3min rule was in place, but by the time I can load it up I am at the end game screen.  Like if it happens again what should I do?  I cant go back to the old client cause I dont even think its open anymore and if it is, then tell me how and I will go back quickly.  Like this is completely unfair, I understand you want to punish AFK/dodging players, but its affecting someone who isn't trying to do any of that.  My game runs fine without problem most of the time, so there is no way of me knowing if the next game wont load.  I have put alot of money into this game and I love this game, but if I have to wait 20min to play a match, then thats complete crap!","replies":[]}]}]}
