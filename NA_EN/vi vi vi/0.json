Last time I checked Shadow Assault was coded as a single mass, hence why the entire thing is deleted if it encounters Yasuo's Wind Wall.\n\n\nHowever, I don't believe anything will be immediately done until they retune Talon.\n\nIssues such as:\n  \n* Coding Shadow Assault's projectiles to be individuals instead of a single mass.  \n* A less tedious Innate.  \n* Stealth synergy baked into his kit.\n* Retooling Cutthroat to give much needed flexibility that doesn't force Talons to engage with it for the % damage bonus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2014-02-18T11:10:33.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If I had a smurf army i would gladly bump this for visibility.
