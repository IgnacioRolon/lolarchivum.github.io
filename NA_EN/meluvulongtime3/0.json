I try to use that thing in the bottom left where you click on a champion and it will go to them but as soon as I move the mouse it unlocks again. It's really frustrating.

There are default key bindings to change camera modes, so you may be hitting one or more of those keys.\n\nIf this still happens simply by moving your mouse after selecting a champ to lock onto, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"meluvulongtime3","date":"2017-02-28T16:48:24.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way I could get the camera to stay was if I held down the key assigned to the champion I was following. So \"q\" for red team player 1. The camera would unlock again as soon as I released the key.

I just tested this in spectate mode and if you use the drop-down menu to select a champion to lock the camera to, it will stay locked until you move the mouse to the edge of the screen enough to move the camera.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues after ensuring you're using the feature properly, I recommend reporting this on our [**Bug Tracker.**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
