Anyways, I am currently debating on whether or not to transfer my current account to another region because of the possibility that I may or may not retain rank rewards from the new region upon transferring back.\r\n\r\nBasically, lets say I transfer to EUW for the rest of the season and I rank and grind all the way up to lets say Masters in Solo Q and Challenger in 5v5s. After the season ends and the rewards are distributed, will I get the masters/challenger rewards in NA as well once I transfer back? \r\n\r\nAnyone with any clarification, please reply :) \r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-22T21:46:19.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you transfer to another region before the season's end then you may lose progress.  Each region has it's own skillset and MMR unique to them, so you will have to compete and place for that region.  You can transfer after the season ends, and the stats should continue along with you.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
