Other times he says it's not up to him how the game is balanced. He only shows up to answer easy superficial questions in Wired or when DoubleLift makes a video talking about problems the game has had for a long time. I even feel bad for him when people blame him for the mess the game is in, because as far as I understand, he doesn't really do anything, and that lead me to this question I'm just curious. What does he do in Riot?","replies":[]}
