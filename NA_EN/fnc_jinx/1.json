Don't ever solo the dragon like that over something like baron unless it's your 5th dragon. They were supposed to be contesting baron. Doublelift was around 9/2 I believe and he should have been more useful at baron with some kind of initiation ult with yellowstar. It was technically a 3v5 at baron because yellowstar couldn't jump into the fight without doublelift ult. A well coordinated doubelift ult could've turned favor to TSM and get baron to end the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2016-03-21T04:10:28.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-03-21T18:21:07.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He is saying that it is an overall team shotcall and its impossible to know if doublelift is the one who made the decision or if it was someone else and doublelift was just listening to the call.","replies":[{"poster":"FNC Jinx","date":"2016-03-21T21:48:45.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I'm just making fun of the idiot.\nThis is Solo Queue Level\n\nTeam: _\"Kalista, they are doing Baron and you are doing dragon all by yourself\"_\nKalista: _\"stfu i get pentakill i carry u pentakill wins games oh we lost\"_","replies":[{"poster":"foinhas","date":"2016-03-22T00:30:27.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both TSM and NRG were competing for the \"Yolo queue award\" in this game...\n\nTSM-> mute the chat, play by themselves\n\nNRG->afk farm into ARAM into ace\n\nIsn't this what you do at yolo queue?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-03-21T21:53:33.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"he\" is refering to Astrophel.
