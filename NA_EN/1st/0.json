I've been wanting to save it for when I have a decent computer and internet connection, which will hopefully be in a few months. If you're willing to wait just a little bit on ranked, I could be interested in climbing with you. This time would be good for getting to understand each other's tactics, as well. I'm moving across state in a month and after I secure a job over there I would feel more comfortable dishing out my savings on a computer.\n\nMy forte is usually tactics and map control. I regularly queued with a group of high gold and plat players, and they all seemed to value my calls. My weakness is undoubtedly my mechanics and overcoming my nerves. I have a hard time picking champions or roles that I don't play regularly because I'm afraid of failing and upsetting people, or wasting their time. It's something I'm trying to correct. I'm a little rusty; life has been rough and it's been a long time since I've been able to play as regularly as I used to. I think that's starting to change now, though. I play the game for fun and I think in the history of my account, I've been reported once. I don't mind winning or losing, so long as I enjoy my time with the person or people I play with.\n\nMy go-to supports would include: {{champion:25}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:16}} \nOther supports that I play on occasion: {{champion:89}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:143}} \nAaaaand, supports that I want to learn or be more comfortable with: {{champion:12}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:44}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"9tt2","date":"2016-05-09T15:50:32.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sup Main, not a smurf but add me if you at least want to try out a couple games.
