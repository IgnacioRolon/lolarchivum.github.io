But I'd really like some help to better improve my mechanics, and skill on League of Legends. I'm a VERY determined individual, and I am ALWAYS open to feedback.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy playing Vayne &amp; Sivir, they're usually my go-to ADCs bot lane.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in learning more about Ezreal &amp; Jinx, as well though.\r\n\r\nIf there's anyone out there willing to just help teach me even basic things I may not know, it would REALLY help.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking for any sarcastic remarks commented either, as this is a serious post and I am craving to get better at this game.","replies":[]}
