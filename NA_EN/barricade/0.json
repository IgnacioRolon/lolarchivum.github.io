I looked through 'roles' and sorted by alphabetical and still did not see {{champion:72}}. My friends also did not see him when they tried to find him. It's not a major issue i'm just wondering if I missed something or why he is removed, or if it's just me and some others having this issue. Just want to know where my first champion I ever played went.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellpyre","date":"2016-11-28T08:23:35.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you own him, he would not show up unless you tick \"show owned\" (which I see you didn't in the pictures\"","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-11-28T09:07:51.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That means he doesn't own Sivir...\n\nWhy...\n\nWhy don't you own all the 450 champs...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T03:45:35.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...
