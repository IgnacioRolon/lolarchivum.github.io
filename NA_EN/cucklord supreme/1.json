Don't give a simple yes or no answer.\r\n\r\n**Is it possible to be religious and accept homosexuality, transgenderism and bisexuality?**\r\n\r\n**Judaism **defense of anti-homosexuality: The book of Vayiqra (Leviticus) is traditionally regarded as classifying sexual intercourse between males as a to'eivah (something abhorred or detested) that can be subject to capital punishment under halakha (Jewish law)\r\n**Christianity **defense of anti-homosexuality: Passages in the Old Testament book Leviticus that prohibit \"lying with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination\" and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah have historically been interpreted as condemning homosexual acts, as have several Pauline passages.\r\n**Islam** defense of anti-homosexuality: In more than one place in the Holy Koran, Allah recounts to us the story of Lot's people, and how He destroyed them for their wicked practice. There is consensus among both Muslims and the followers of all other religions that sodomy is an enormity. It is even viler and uglier than adultery.\r\n\r\nAllah Most High says: \"Do you approach the males of humanity, leaving the wives that Allah has created for you? But you are a people who transgress\" Koran (26:165-66)\r\n\r\n(1) The Prophet (saws) said: (1) \"Kill the one who sodomizes and the one who lets if be done to him.\" (Tirmidhi, a sahih (authentic) hadith)\r\n\r\n(2) \"May Allah curse him who does that Lot's people did.\" (Ibn Hibban, sahih (authentic))\r\n\r\n(3) \"Lesbianism by women is adultery between them.\" (Tabarani, sahih)\"\r\n\r\n(\"Lot's people\" are the people of Sodom)\r\n\r\n_** This thread is not made to offend anyone.
