I have never given out my personal info or any passwords or usernames... It was HACKED. I kept it at Diamond 5 O LP making sure not to play within 28 days so I would keep diamond border locked in. I get word from a friend \"why are you deranking on your other account into plat.\" I sign in and someone hacked my account and inted and left 7 games to derank me out of diamond into plat. There has to be something riot can do here like find out the ip address of the hacker so i can press charges, also used my credit card.\r\nWhy doesn't RIOT use 2 step verification, its literally as simple as finding the password to the account and the password to the email.... there is no phone verification. I now lost diamond rewards to lack of security features. Now I'm sitting here at 6am grinding to try to get back into diamond... And I will have to sit here for another 20 hrs to make sure its not hacked again before season ends... I changed passwords and everything as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-08T00:59:44.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your account was *legitimately* hacked and this wasn't caused by something related to *account sharing*, write in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll see if there's anything we can do about this.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Pap","date":"2016-11-08T15:52:41.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wrote in a support ticket and they told me im responsible for anything that happens on my account.
