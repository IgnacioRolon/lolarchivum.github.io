Hell, maybe swap the build paths with Zzrot cuz that's def not an MR item yet it has tons of MR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Professor Ward","date":"2018-02-23T19:40:03.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sohleks,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r0E8LKB6,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-02-22T22:18:10.328+0000)\n>\n> With its current build path it&#x27;s not possible but I agree.

You're almost certain to get killed 1v1, and (even now!) they only need to show up nearby a minion wave to fuck your entire plan up. You shouldn't be overextending, you should be playing safer than normal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2018-02-23T03:16:44.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like to rush it first, you would be surprised how much ad damage mages deal early when they attack poke you.
