Considering how auto-attack dependent Draven is, this can be quite game breaking.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this as soon as possible.\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Report Me Please","date":"2015-05-25T08:19:11.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can confirmed that this catching bug is happening.
