ticket was reassigned to someone NEW and they closed it, deleted every message i sent to the ticket. i replied to the ticket again to get it reopened.\n\n**SO BASICALLY, i didn't do anything.**\n\n- paid the $70 i owed back in january on the 6th.\n\n- payment randomly OUT OF THE BLUE OUT OF NOWHERE \"gets reversed\" april 30, 2019.\n\n- talked to my bank and paypal to prove i didn't start another dispute or ask for reversal of payment.\n\n- sent all of the screenshots of my bank account balance and paypal balance AND all of the transaction history for both accounts to riot, as well as the conversation with my bank from the first day.\n\n- riot ignores all of this and continues to tell me i'm suspended over something that clearly has to be an issue on riot's end. there has to be a mistake in their records because my bank and paypal can attest that i did not ask for any refunds.\n\nriot support has been doing nothing but shutting me down and continuing to say the same exact copy and paste message to me.\n\n- riot keeps claiming that there was a reversal of payment on my account, but are refusing to show proof of it.\n\n- asked them to show me what they are seeing on their end after they continued to not show me proof because i'm not going to simply take their word for it when i know i didn't ask for a refund of any kind. i gave them proof of everything i have to prove my innocence.\n\nriot support is just being incredibly unhelpful and i think it's ridiculous that i'm permanently suspended over something i didn't do and i've been giving them PROOF that i didn't do what i'm being accused of.\n\n- i have willingly spent money on this game, and in recent months as well.\n\n- why would i ask for a reversal of payment and then spend more money. i have thrown so much money at riot in the year and a half i've been playing league. why would i reverse a payment now.\n\nany bumps to get this seen would be appreciated because i'm not going to take being permanently suspended over a mistake that is on riot's end that they are refusing to acknowledge or admit.\n\ni'm getting punished for something i didn't do instead of them helping me investigate what could've possibly happened.\n\nEDIT: riot support gave me their final answer and seems to be finished with their \"negotiating: and \"investigating\" and [this is what they said](https://imgur.com/czVfoCq). they COMPLETELY IGNORED my reasonable request for proof from THEIR END that the payment was reversed but they effectively ignored it. nice going riot.\n\nalso (may 3): i stupidly didn't sign into my imgur account BEFORE uploading that album, so it's under i guess an anonymous thing, so if i get anymore evidence i'll have to upload it into a new album. i'll remember to sign in this time :')\n\nEDIT, may 4: [i have submitted another support ticket ](https://imgur.com/a/uEe0Y4b)and i've asked to speak to a rioter to get some help. i linked this thread to them, i've explained the situation to them, and i'm really not going to take no for an answer. it is not acceptable. i'm not at fault here and i am begging them to help me get this figured out.\n\nUPDATE, may 5: the SAME support agent, ThermalLamp, replied to my NEW support ticket, closed it with one reply, in which he gave me the same bullshit copy and paste answer he did the first time. i put the screenshot in the 2nd imgur album btw. this is ridiculous. this is unfair. it's unfair that riot games made a mistake and is refusing to own up to it and take responsibility, and instead they're choosing to punish ME for THEIR mistake. I AM THE VICTIM HERE.","replies":[]}
