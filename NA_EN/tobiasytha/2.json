And I'm always the one who gets this type of shit mid, never the other team. So it cannot be a coincidence : riot deliberatelly give me trash mids to ruin the game.\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4126879555/2033735263136736?tab=overview\r\ndespite what kda says, yorrick fed by trolling. He constantely let mundo roam and gank me, and while we could kill him, he stayed behind and watched us die. Then he said \"Im not the one who died\" lol. Typical deadweight. Ekko was plain bad, bot lost lane AND jungle by letting their bot constantely steal our blue with lee 3v1.\r\n\r\nAnd of course you never see streamers having teams like that more than once. It's very rare.\r\nBecause riot deliberatelly does this.","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2019-07-27T23:47:36.620+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"this implies a couple of things:\n\n1) that they KNOW who is going to feed and when, and then purposefully match them with you \n2) if streamers are just getting \"lucky\" youre basically just saying they have no skill and dont deserve their rank\n3) that someone not doing what you want immediately means their trolling\n\nthis is all simply disproven by the fact that people smurfing CONSISTENTLY get to their elo. if riot was selecting who climbs to where, it would look like 1-2 accounts in diamond, but the rest not getting out of high bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-28T00:15:23.194+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is more likely:\n\nA: there is a huge, complicated conspiracy to keep _you_ in wood V, which benefits nobody.
