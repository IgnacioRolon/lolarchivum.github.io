Unfortunately I wasn't around when it came out.  What I'm wondering is, is there any way to get one now?  I doubt there is, and I don't have the RP atm, but I thought I'd ask because of how much I love Fiddlesticks and the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T22:36:50.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zombiemaster has some good info!  I'd like to add that legacy skins can be found through mystery gifts and hextech chests as well!  You can wait for any events in the future, or test your luck as well!  Good luck!  :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-17T06:26:19.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes there is. Most skins that are not currently in the store are labeled as Legacy skins, which means that they do have a chance of coming back in the future (and they pretty much always do at least once a year).\n\nAs for the specific Pumpkin Head Fiddlesticks skin, it is a Legacy skin, so it will come back, and because it is a Harrowing skin, it usually makes a return to the store during the Harrowing event each year, which is sometime around Halloween.","replies":[{"poster":"Wert the Wacky","date":"2016-09-17T21:44:18.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zombiemaster,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=kN5F1zQ7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-17T06:26:19.165+0000)\n>\n> Yes there is.
