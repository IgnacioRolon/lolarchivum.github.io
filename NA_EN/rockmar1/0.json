I'm sure that none of you recognize my name.  But I got on and read posts every day.  Maybe if I didn't become a part of the community, the community at least became a part of me.  It was a fun place to go relax and I enjoyed it very much.\r\n\r\nIn truth, it was mostly shitposting.  Probably 75% of threads were stupid, and posts that talked about religion got more attention than intelligent discussions about league.  But you know what?  That wasn't that bad.  It was stupid but it was stupid in a fun, lighthearted sort of way.  It was a good place to go to just unwind.  And the best part about it was the community and the way it interacted.  Because of GD, I know that if I ever see a thread by Bulbasaur Girl it's going to be bitching about Nasus.  And if IRLNasus shows up, it'll get a whole lot steamier.  ARCDRIVEFINISH threads are going to be bitching about Lissandra.  Rackier will be taking his daily dump on bronzies.  Who else knows how Maximum LeBroken got the name Maximum LeSilver?\r\n\r\nThe main reason that I'm going to miss GD is because of the personal attachment I have to it, and I think that's what everyone else is feeling too.  Riot keeps approaching this from the wrong angle.  They keep asking us what we don't like about it, but I think that the simple fact is that we don't like it because it isn't GD.  It's like trying to convince a little kid to upgrade their teddy bear that they've had their whole life to the new SuperPlush TeddyMax Teddy Bear 2.0 â„¢.  Riot is baffled because their \"teddy bear\" is softer, squishier, and harder to rip.  Objectively, it's superior (except the color :/ ).  But we all don't like it because it's not ours.  It's not about the features, it's not about the mechanics of the boards.  It's the fact that we all grew to love GD, and there's nothing that can replace it.  I think that if Riot would just realize that, the transition would be a lot easier on all of us","replies":[]}
