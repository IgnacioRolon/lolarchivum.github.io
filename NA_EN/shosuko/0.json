If you watched him against AHQ and some of the other group stage games you see that Faker does not always come out 5-0 in these games.  Sometimes he barely breaks even...\n\nBut look at these team fights.  You&#039;ll see every CD on the enemy team DOWN for Faker... and not one left to stop Marin or Bang from slashing the rest of the team apart.  It&#039;s such a bait for Faker to play dangerously because it causes the opponent to stick their neck out just barely too far... and boy do they sink their teeth in.  You can almost hear it on their mics &quot;OMG I HIT FAKER WITH BINDING DIVE DIVE DIVE&quot;  10 seconds later it&#039;s 1 for an ace, and SKT winning.\n\nSecond off - the way you play your power should not always be front loaded.  Just like in a fight in lane, you don&#039;t always throw out your biggest nukes first.  Sometimes you chip them down, bit by bit, so you can insta-nuke them as soon as they pass that threshold of death.  Because they aren&#039;t used to the big dunk, but just the little chips, they don&#039;t even realize they&#039;re dead.\n\nWhat SKTT1 has that NO other team has, is a VERY capable sub who has live experience against the best players on the biggest stages.  When another team has to play with a sub, it&#039;s because one of their stars isn&#039;t shining, and it often means they are playing on their heels, at a disadvantage.\n\nSKTT1 puts Easyhoon up there front and center.  Not just a sub for when Faker is out, but a fully experienced member of the team every bit as deserving of a place on the team as anyone else, even Faker himself.  Easyhoon knows that he must perform when he is given these opportunities, but SKTT1 constantly extend these to him, and he delivers.  Any other team would be lucky to START Easyhoon, let alone sub such a strong player.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-10-24T22:56:34.647+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Easyhoon plays some champions better than faker imo, I think he specializes in control mages like {{champion:268}} , {{champion:61}}  and {{champion:112}} . Faker is great when picking assasins like {{champion:7}} and {{champion:238}} . This is just my opinion, though.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2015-10-26T04:54:22.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir and TF are what the hoon is better at. Cassio too, but she isnt meta. Faker is MUCH better at viktor (i cant even remember watching a game where easyhoon played viktor...) and Orianna (straight up hard carried games in S3 with his crazy shockwaves). Faker is better on the champs you said, along with his Ryze. Honestly the only reason i think they played easyhoon vs Origen was so that they could go the entire tournament without revealing Faker's champion pool for this patch (only showed ryze and azir so far..)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-10-25T02:22:28.039+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shosuko,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=zJvqfqiF,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-24T17:59:30.093+0000)\n>\n> What SKTT1 has that NO other team has, is a VERY capable sub who has live experience against the best players on the biggest stages.  \n\nYes, Faker is an excellent sub, way better than any other team have.  XD\n\nSeriously though, with Azir being such a beast this patch, it makes sense to start Easyhoon and see if xPeke could do anything against him.  And then it might be difficult to shift his playstyle when the next game is against Faker.\n\nI was a bit surprised in the interview when Faker said that Easyhoon puts more pressure on the opposing mid laner than he does... but I think he meant *lane* pressure, as in pushing them in, which of course is something that waveclear mages are great at, and assassins usually not.  Maybe \"kill pressure\" is just an NA term and they call it something else in Korea?\n\nHaving *two* world class midlaners with *different* styles is an amazing asset for SKT that will surely be difficult for Fanatic/KOO to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"Shosuko","date":"2015-10-25T02:34:46.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hehehe yeah, you get it.

Every team plays it like they need to do something extra special to beat them instead of just playing a normal game of league. They just end up walking to SKT's beat and lose out in map pressure... not saying SKT hasn't earned their victories but I think someone would have taken a game off them by now if they didn't have the intimidation factor on top of their skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Shosuko","date":"2015-10-25T02:34:01.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this.\n\nSKT is a strong team, but other teams just crack under the pressure.  Like today's game against Origin, they actually did a great job early game of gaining a good advantage, AHQ did last week too.  Both teams cracked under the pressure, and all it took was a single winning team fight in the late game and BAM SKT wins.  When Faker was switched in against Origin today, it was like they gave up at that point.  The 3rd game was cake walk for SKT.\n\nSKT is a model for end game though - no one closes games as strongly as they do.  I think a smart team should forget about the laning phase and really look at their end game.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2015-10-25T03:37:11.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's less about cracking under pressure and more about strategy. SKT constantly switches up their strategy, making it difficult to keep up and counter-strategize.\n\nFocusing a dive for top lane? Push a bot lane turret.\nBut wait, now they've defended their turret and have taken dragon while invading the jungle. Time to put wards and-\nThey just aced us. Our inhibitor is gone and now they have Baron.\n\nSee? One misplay and SKT turns an inch into a mile. One wrong shot-call and you get punished harder than you thought imaginable. That's how SKT does it, and their strategy is to play a mind game with their opponent to force mistakes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JazzPolice","date":"2015-10-24T21:46:14.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"All valid points, actually.  Plus it can even mess with the heads of the enemy when it seems that they aren't \"worthy\" of fighting Faker.  This can make it seem like the game is over before it began.

Junglers would often ignore bot lane if mid lane could get a kill and snowball. Champions like {{champion:238}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:103}} were very mobile and very skill-dependent champions that could outplay and juke entire teams in uneven fights. They could go aggressive and get kills, and that is where Faker shines. He has some of, if not the best, mechanics on mobile mid laners.\n\nNow that the meta is centered around top lane, you don't see Faker in the spotlight anymore. But his skill is scary for any team to deal with, and they often over-commit to killing him off first even though Marin will have a 6-2 KDA on Fiora.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SunLillie","date":"2015-10-24T22:18:51.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Faker focus is real.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yxgl222HaX","date":"2015-10-26T06:56:57.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Scott Free ","date":"2015-10-25T00:45:07.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure he is a better azir than faker too","replies":[{"poster":"EPIKON","date":"2015-10-26T05:11:14.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Faker did say Easyhoon was better than him at a couple of champions that probably include {{champion:268}} and {{champion:117}} but this list should include {{champion:61}} that Faker himself will probably hate to admit that includes myself because I watched Faker's Orianna to main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whismurmur","date":"2015-10-25T01:30:48.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for sure easyhoon's azir is insane , imo he plays most control mages way better than Faker , Faker is better on assassins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EPIKON","date":"2015-10-26T05:07:56.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easyhoon can start for all other LCK teams and all but a few literally a few teams in the world.\n\nI'm going to miss Easyhoon next season when he's playing for Samsung.\n\nI'm hoping he heads to Najin but I'm afraid it's going to be Samsung.\n\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
