It is a brutal lane that is usually decided in champ select, and is cut off from most of the gameplay and thus prevents you learning a lot of things. If you dont like having zero control and throwing lane, stay away from top.","replies":[{"poster":"Kim Jin Seon","date":"2019-09-29T04:47:18.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I'll try adc but where's practice tool?...and how do you get out of sub 30?","replies":[{"poster":"Destello Azul","date":"2019-09-29T10:07:18.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kim Jin Seon,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=LFAHQc0i,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-09-29T04:47:18.237+0000)\n>\n> ...and how do you get out of sub 30?\n\nReach level 30.

If they don't have anything nice to say then they aren't worth hearing, they aren't going to suddenly start being nice to you either after you mute them so you're not missing anything.","replies":[]}]}
