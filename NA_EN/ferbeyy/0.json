All my other games have the same ping also. What is the deal? Not only has the ping increased, but I also get some random packet loss and quick lag spikes. These are things I've never experienced before. Would just like to be informed on what is happening and when I can expect my old ping back.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-21T17:18:44.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If other servers with your internet are fine except with your connection to our servers, then your ISP might be routing a long distance to reach our servers.
