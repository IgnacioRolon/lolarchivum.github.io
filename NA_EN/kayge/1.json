But right clicking works elsewhere?  Do you have another mouse you might be able to troubleshoot with, to rule out a possible hardware issue?  Try a config rest as well in case your input is not reading properly anymore:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
