Since all your connections leading up to the actual game itself starting, it kinda make me think something is blocking you once you get into the game. I'd try checking out your firewalls and other backgrounds programs to really make sure that isn't the case, but also hit up the other steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to cover your other bases too.","replies":[]}]}
