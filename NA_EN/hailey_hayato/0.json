Effectively banning anyone who triggers it with certain keywords.\r\n\r\nI have factual evidence of this as well. Albeit I cannot post such evidence considering there the whole \"no naming and shaming rule\"(which I am completely against for valid reasons).\r\nNow, my question is. Why is a word(or better yet, an abbriviation) like \"k.y.s\" triggermarked with a 2 week suspension for saying it. \r\nBut people can spam \"ez\" more times than I care to count and get away scott free, REGARDLESS if they are reported or not.\r\n100% of the time I've reported such a player, I have never once been told they got punished for it. Therefore it is very safe to assume they weren't.\r\n\r\nConsidering that saying \"ez\" is the equivalent of(physically) kicking the enemy team while their down, spitting in their face while you're at it. \r\nA much, much much harsher and punishable version of \"You are bad. stop playing\" more or less.\r\nIf something as stupid as \"k.y.s\" is triggermarked then SURELY \"ez\" should be as well. \r\n\"Ez\"  as in \"Easy\".\r\n\r\nMy point. If saying an enemy player(Read: Human who plays) should off themselves is punishable with a automatic 2week ban without previous punishments(as they should stack. Chat restrictions, a day, week, 2 weeks etc etc). Then so should \"easy\" and all of its variants(as it is worse. \"oh hey, I'm gonna spit on you now and kick you while you are down). Either all of them are \"ok\"(read, average below 2week suspension) or none of them are(2weeks).\r\n\r\nWorse is that I see people defending this sort of behavior by either saying \"no, that's too harsh\" or not saying/doing anything about it at all. And yes, you are defending such behavior by saying \"ez should not warrant a 2week suspension. that is too much\". Yeah, well. So is \"k.y.s\" too, as the example triggerword here.\r\n\r\nIs a little consistency really too much to ask for?\r\nWhich reminds me, when will I get my own personal contactee at Riot? Should I want them to investigate cases that is. Player support is out of the question too considering that is a whole other department.(and if you couldn't tell. This part is of course satire cause no one should have that. Not casuals, pros, streamers. None of them. Having one should be punishable with a 2 week ban.\r\n\r\nEven the guideline for player behavior says it's about fostering a healthy community. \"easy\" and all its forms are not healthy(And saying it is and you might as well say \"k.y.s\" is healthy too...).\r\n\r\nTl;Dr. I want consistency.\r\nPS. I also want int'ers banned. Don't care how long it takes. Just ban them once they are caught(which they literally never are in my experience).","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-08-02T23:43:03.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> We can pretty safely assume at this point that since Riot is neglecting their duties, they put a bot in charge. Effectively banning anyone who triggers it with certain keywords.\n\nThere are a couple of misconceptions in this sentence alone.\n\nFirst of all, Riot isn't \"neglecting their duties\". I'm going to assume by that, you mean \"hand-reviewing every single report that gets filed\", which, as far as any company is concerned, is beyond impractical and expensive, to the point where it's better to consider it impossible.\n\nYou could not staff the Player Behavior team with enough people to scratch the _surface_ of how many reports get filed in a day, much less handle millions upon millions of reports _daily_. Automation, in this case, is an absolute necessity.\n\nBeyond this, your other misconception is that the IFS works strictly off of keywords. It doesn't. Sure, it uses keywords for zero-tolerance behavior (encouragements of self-harm and hate speech), but by and large, the IFS reads through the chat logs to discern patterns of unsportsmanlike behavior and determine whether or not someone is breaking the rules.\n\nThere are _tons_ of cases out there where you'd be hard-pressed to find anything resembling a keyword without stretching that logic to the point of breaking, because the IFS punishes people for their behavior, not, generally speaking, for their words.\n\n> Now, my question is. Why is a word(or better yet, an abbriviation) like \"k.y.s\" triggermarked with a 2 week suspension for saying it.\n\nWell, let me ask a counterquestion; why _shouldn't_ it be? You're (figurative \"you're\" there) basically telling someone to kill themselves over a videogame. At what point would that _ever_ be considered acceptable behavior?\n\n> But people can spam \"ez\" more times than I care to count and get away scott free, REGARDLESS if they are reported or not.\n\nCalling a match \"ez\" is poor sportsmanship, but it's not on the same level as, y'know, _telling someone to kill themselves over a videogame._ It isn't bad enough to merit a punishment on its own, but paired with other offenses (passive-aggressive behavior, flaming, spam, etc.) can warrant a punishment.\n\nNow, my question is, why are you comparing BM to encouraging suicide?\n\n> 100% of the time I've reported such a player, I have never once been told they got punished for it. Therefore it is very safe to assume they weren't.\n\nThe Instant Feedback Report is unreliable at best, and even if it _were_ reliable, it still wouldn't tell you if behavior you reported was flagged. It's _not_ safe to assume that nothing happened. \"If a tree falls in the forest\", etc.\n\n> Considering that saying \"ez\" is the equivalent of(physically) kicking the enemy team while their down, spitting in their face while you're at it.\n> A much, much much harsher and punishable version of \"You are bad. stop playing\" more or less.\n> If something as stupid as \"k.y.s\" is triggermarked then SURELY \"ez\" should be as well.\n> \"Ez\" as in \"Easy\".\n\nAgain, why are you comparing bad manners/poor sportsmanship to _literally **telling someone to kill themselves over a videogame**_? Those two things aren't even remotely comparable.\n\n> My point. If saying an enemy player(Read: Human who plays) should off themselves is punishable with a automatic 2week ban without previous punishments(as they should stack. Chat restrictions, a day, week, 2 weeks etc etc). Then so should \"easy\" and all of its variants(as it is worse...\n\nAaaaaand nope. There is nothing more left to discuss here. If you seriously think that being a jerk and disrespecting people is _worse_ than encouraging someone to end their life over a videogame - you're placing human life _below_ sportsmanship and disrespect, and so I see no valid discussion to be had here.

You can observe that people still get banned/restricted by observing their game history.\n\nThe system works just fine, as you can tell by hanging around this board. What it needs is more clarity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2019-08-03T00:02:03.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not how it works.\nAlso, it's not about what YOU want because the world does not revolve around you.\nFind another interest if you're looking to get what YOU want.

Machine Learning system \n1. Zero Tolerance system\n\nML system learns from our reports,  digital media,  and the web in general to understand what are insults.

Of course,  if you are able to demonstrate clean behavior over many games, you will drop a punishment tier.\n\nZT system detects things like hate speech, racism,  homophobia, sexual slurs and encouraging others to harm themselves. \n\nRiot will punish those whom use those words regardless of context and can oftenly skip punishment tiers.\n\nAll in all, the system is pretty consistent,  it just lacks the clarity and education to let people know it is consistent.
