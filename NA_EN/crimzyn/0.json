This is something we should all do but sadly it does not happen.\r\n\r\n**DONT BE TOXIC**! - Just don&#039;t.  If you have a teammate that just sucks, made a bad play, caused you to lose a team fight or a gank... it doesn&#039;t matter.  If you curse out that player you are going to tilt them and they are going to try less.  If you weren&#039;t going to lose... you will probably lose now,  This is a fact.  People will say F you and troll, give up, make bad or worse plays...  so just don&#039;t.\r\n\r\n**Be Supportive!** - As silly as it sounds, GJ, Nice!, wtg!  Are all nice little quick comments that teammates love hearing when they make a good play.   Supportive comments have the opposite affect of negative ones.  People tend to perk up, want to continue playing better, realize that they are able to play well and will want to work with the team more to be affective and will not want to throw the game by losing a lead they have (Generally speaking lol)\r\n\r\nCan we work on making this a common practice?  At least with the people who are on my team... :)","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2017-04-21T16:25:01.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's true.

Being toxic is the one thing you can do to guarantee you lose, yet those who care about winning the most do it. So, let go! Relax! Have fun! And remember, it's just a game. No need to be an asshole when someone does something stupid, they can see it's stupid. Maybe suggest something they could've done better and help them improve as a player with constructive criticism (though in my experience this sometimes sets people off just as much as if you had been toxic).","replies":[{"poster":"Restless Slumber","date":"2017-04-21T15:36:58.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This exactly. If you watch professional players play, they usually aren't very toxic in solo queue. They tend to just have fun, and win while doing it. And that is exactly what everyone else should strive to be: have fun, and try to win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-04-21T17:04:58.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't change the fact that my support still doesn't have sighstone 15minutes in and bot lanes getting ganked by mid/jung for the 7th time now.\n\ni can only get so big and push so far in my own respective lane, but i communicate and give them every opportunity to succeed and all they want to do is ff at 20 because *they* aren't big.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2017-04-21T14:45:36.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Somehow this is a concept that many people cannot grasp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2017-04-22T04:35:59.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just proves this game has too many liberals playing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-21T13:38:24.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Challengers HATE him!","replies":[]}]}
