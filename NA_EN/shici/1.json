She just pushed the wave and sat tower all game didn't even try and fight even if i go in and waist everything because she just picked a counter pick not that champion she wanted to play when she q'ed for the game. I feel this just made the game suck for both of us she couldn't carry because she picked a counter and i had no fun because she picked a counter.\r\n\r\n When i say no counter pick im talking things like this were you just push and run from all fights hoping the team carrys when grouped. Liss is the other example of this you can just play safe and wait for team fights and hope the team carrys. They didn't play on playing these champions but they do because the Lobby system is the main flaw of this game. Play the champion you want not the one you think will win the game for you.","replies":[]}
