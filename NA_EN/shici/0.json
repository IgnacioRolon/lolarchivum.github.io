I get these people are just mad but i would like to point out the fact that its the game has never changed in terms of the lack of balance. I have recently started posting idea&#039;s but when i think about it the odd&#039;s off some one else doing this before me over the years is so high its clearly just the game. Game is impossible to balance because they didn&#039;t make the game with the intent of balance. This leads me to my final point if you think this game is R.I.P you just lack education please put down the game and stop being monkey&#039;s instead of humans.\r\nThanks.","replies":[]}
