Your not suffering for getting trolled, your suffering for your lack of control when it comes to typing.\n\nAs for the rest, you gotta remember your playing an online game with 9 other random people, if you go off in chat people are going to take offense and report you or whatever it is they gunna do, why take that risk? The mute button doesn't exist to give you an out for typing in chat.

However, the only people who wouldn't even see that first sign are those who /mute all at the start of every game. Everyone else would get that initial taste of your toxicity. The rules are intended to make chat _positive and useful_. If your presence means that anyone making the slightest effort to communicate in a team game has to deal with the sort of chat messages you've displayed here, that's on you, not on them. _Behave yourself._\n\nYour opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.","replies":[{"poster":"Do The Nocturne","date":"2019-07-27T22:21:21.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"Tldr i can say what i want last i checked this is America lol your analogy is dumb.

This right only protects you from the governnment, which is restricted from passing laws that infringe on your right to free speech, assembly, and so on. It doesn't force other private entities, such as Riot Games, to provide you with a platform and compel everyone to listen to you. We all have the right not only to speak freely, but also to not listen if we so choose. When Riot restricts your chat privileges (not a right - a privilege), they are choosing not to listen to what you have to say, and choosing not to transmit it to other players. If a theater employee asks you to quiet down during a movie, or a friend tells you not to swear at their house, or a newspaper rejects your submission, they are not infringing on your right to free speech. They are exercising their own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-07-27T22:37:31.672+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can say what you want, but a private corporation may punish you within reason for violating guidelines.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-07-27T22:57:33.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Do The Nocturne,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AWHL3Zng,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-07-27T22:21:21.861+0000)\n>\n> Tldr i can say what i want last i checked this is America lol your analogy is dumb.

While you did have some lines dedicated to specific champs like pyke ults and champ kits most of the time it was you being antagonistic towards your allies.\n\nIf they were intentionally misbehaving then all you did was encourage them to continue on. Yes AFKs and other problematic behavior is annoying and frustrating at times but stooping down to their level solves nothing and only makes the situation and environment worse than it already is. Furthermore just because someone else is acting up doesn't mean your own poor behavior is ignored. As for your other complaints: \n\n1) The mute button =/= a get out of jail free card and is meant to be a band-aid solution at most.\n2) Freedom of speech =/= freedom of speech consequences and doesn't apply to privately owned entities such as Riot Games.\n3) Who's really the sensitive ones here: The ones who don't like being held accountable for their behavior or the ones who won't put up with other peoples poor behavior and holds them accountable for it?\n\nWith all that in mind your chat restriction (not a ban a restriction) is deserved, and considering you had a 10-game CR before this you should already have a good idea of what behavior is considered unacceptable.
