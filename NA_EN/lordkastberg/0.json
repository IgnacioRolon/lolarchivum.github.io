I ran it as admin and it fixed that problem. If you don't know how to do this the simple way is to right click LoL and select **run as administrator**. It will then ask you if it's okay, just hit yes and the download should work from there. I still don't know if a fresh download will work as I'm still patching. Will post back when done.\n\n**!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!**\nAfter a fresh install it worked for me. I did not have the new launcher until now so I'm curious how many people here also had the old launcher. \n\nTo round up what I did:\n\n1. I uninstalled LoL from my control Panel.\n\n2. Downloaded the client from Riot's website -  https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload\n\n3. Patched the client under administrator. An easy way to do this is to right click the icon made when downloading the game and selecting \"RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR\".\n\n4. Have fun.\n\nSadly I couldn't find a way around doing a fresh download, but it does work. I closed out and ran several games both as administrator and not and everything is working now.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Sovoy","date":"2016-07-27T21:28:55.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue, and I also got the old launcher.
