I've tried multiple way of fixing this problem but none of them seem to work rather it be uninstalling the game (the correct way) multiple times over, or trying to repair my client (which when i click repair actually nothing happens, just takes me back to the broken launch button. I have noticed that the discord app on my computer hasn't been working at all either for the exact amount of time that my league client started bugging. Just wanted to see if someone could help me because none of my friends understand why this is happening.\r\n\r\n-plshelpimtryinagrind.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T23:40:35.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since both League and Discord rely on a stable connection to their respective servers to operate, I suspect your issue is caused by a *poor connection*.
