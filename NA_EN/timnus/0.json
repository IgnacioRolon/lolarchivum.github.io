I will be in the middle of the game and all of a sudden LOL freezes completely. I try CTRL ALT DELETE but the screen for that doesn't come up until the freeze ends making it useless. (ALT TAB doesn't work either) This happens completely randomly, sometimes it doesn't happen, and sometimes it happens multiple times per game. It usually lasts for 20 to 10 seconds before unfreezing. Its really frustrating and it usually causes me to die. My fps is good and my ms is usually good too so i have no idea what is happening.\r\n\r\nThis is what i have tried to do to fix it:\r\n\r\n- full repair (multiple times)\r\n- updating my graphics drivers\r\n- uninstalling apps i don't use\r\n- disabling game bar\r\n\r\nThe game doesn't do this on my desktop PC, and i can't remember when this started happening but please help!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T01:36:13.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's definitely not good, even a small freeze like that is enough to make or break a game that's for sure. Go ahead and run through this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to make sure everything is still working properly, but if that doesn't seem to help to much go ahead and reach out to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to dig a little deeper to see what's going wrong!","replies":[{"poster":"Timnus","date":"2017-09-08T20:08:30.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for getting back to me. i have tried most of the solutions on there however i don't believe fps is the problem because my fps is usually in the 80s - 100s and shows no signs of slowing before it freezes. I tried playing practice mode multiple times to see if the problem would occur but it wouldn't happen. So i am not sure if this is a connection problem or something else because when this happens i can still hear the music and repeating sounds like Amumu's crying ability, No reconnection sign appears and I canno't leave the app until the freeze is over, not even through CTRL ALT DELETE or ALT TAB or ALT f4. Thank you for getting back to me just thought i would add more detail to what happens...","replies":[]}]}]}
