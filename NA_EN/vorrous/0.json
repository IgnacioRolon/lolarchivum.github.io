The light goes away when the ability timer runs out. However I was not able to test if the light would give other champions a shield. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce, play Dark Star Thresh and have another champion use Thresh&#039;s Dark Passage to move to Thresh. \r\n\r\nI do know that this bug affects Victor as it happened every time he used my lantern, but Victor was the only one on my team to use it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-23T19:12:19.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
