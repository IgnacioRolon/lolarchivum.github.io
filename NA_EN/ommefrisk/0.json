Essentially, parts of the data going from your network to our servers just isn't making it all the way and gets lost. If our servers don't get all the data, then it can't be 100% sure what was going on, which can cause that weird teleporting stuff and lag without your ping going up. \n\nHit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and throw your recent network logs that had this issue in. It will give you an image detailing your ping and packet loss over time. Take a screenshot using something like Gyazo, post it here, and I can go over it with you!","replies":[{"poster":"OmmeFrisk","date":"2017-06-05T13:22:24.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/wn2pg\n\nhere is the logs\nI need to point out that there were two major spikes wich sucks, even tough the anomaly of the fact is that these laggs happen only with lol\nAlso what the heck 44 average ping but 25% packet loss WHUT, my teamspeak during the game pointed out something around 3% \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}\n\nP.S.\nthanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"OmmeFrisk","date":"2017-06-05T13:27:10.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd also like to add another screen from a game that  i played in the same day but earlier in the morning\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/deBM2\n\nthe games from the day before this one also show abnormally huge packet loss at a ping between 40 and 50 like the first image i posted","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T20:46:39.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So yeeeaaaa....that 40-50% packet loss in the first image is a pretty big deal. That is most likely the cause of that lagless lag. Sometimes it can be fixed but there's a chance that it's coming from your ISP's side of things. Reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they might be able to help out!\n\nAbout that second picture coming from a game played at a different time of day: the difference is probably coming from a number of people using the internet around you at that time of day.","replies":[{"poster":"OmmeFrisk","date":"2017-06-06T11:56:50.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey broporo thanks again for the help, ticket sent\n\nI've been asking around and it might actually be a problem with TELECOM and League specifically\nit seems some ISPs in fact do have poor IP management with league servers\nI say it seems because telecom at least refuses to mark it as a problem\nthis is a link ( in italian ) that a friend of mine sent so at least it could be used for telecom user to make a petition of sort\nhttps://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/it/c/aiuto-e-supporto-it/OWzJyZ9f-segnalazione-riot-problemi-di-connessione-con-telecom\n\nso it's either that or no lol for me anymore :(","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"callmefraga","date":"2017-06-05T12:41:31.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/v9Y54\nhi Broporo, thank you for replying, i hope this website works since i don't use Gyazo, as you said it has to do something with packet loss.\nFrom the image i have 42 average milliseconds with 99 as the highest spike ( totally playable ) and 25.19% of packet loss, and just as it happened in my game, i started lagging slightly at the beginning and it got way worse over the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T20:49:48.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you're having the same packet loss issues as well =\\ . That 30% packet loss is enough to cause some pretty weird things to happen in game, like if it looks like champions are \"moonwalking\" or teleporting around.
