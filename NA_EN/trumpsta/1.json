These are only a few of many chat logs that displayed negative behavior. Please know that this suspension is a warning before a possible permanent suspension.\n\nI do want to point out that you are correct in saying that most of your games played were with a pre-made team. Since that is the case, I removed any chat that was in team chat. The games pulled were from either Normal Blind, Normal Draft, TT Blind, or TT ranked.\n\nGame 1:\n\n[6:21] Angler Jax [ALL]: wow nice mechanics \n[6:24] Angler Jax [ALL]: press q to make melee useless \n[6:29] Angler Jax [ALL]: and run around xDDDD \n[6:51] Angler Jax [ALL]: im salty i have wrong runes \n[6:58] Angler Jax [ALL]: and im sad that people play teemo in general \n[8:28] Angler Jax [ALL]: akward \n[10:51] Angler Jax [ALL]: WTF \n[10:52] Angler Jax [ALL]: NERF \n[11:17] Angler Jax [ALL]: wtf i was sarcastic \n[11:27] Angler Jax [ALL]: good to know you care enough to bother to replay to me \n[11:44] Angler Jax [ALL]: wow did you jsut threaten to report him \n[12:02] Angler Jax [ALL]: +1 \n[15:27] Angler Jax [ALL]: no assist for you young man \n[17:59] Angler Jax [ALL]: friends called me on skype rip \n[18:06] Angler Jax [ALL]: lol \n[18:09] Angler Jax [ALL]: i love how u came \n[18:12] Angler Jax [ALL]: from that way \n[18:24] Angler Jax [ALL]: oo `~~` \n[18:57] Angler Jax [ALL]: chodes are \n[19:00] Angler Jax [ALL]: kawaii desu \n[20:17] Angler Jax [ALL]: OH THE DODGE \n[20:20] Angler Jax [ALL]: THE GODCIAN \n[29:56] Angler Jax [ALL]: no escape \n[30:16] Angler Jax [ALL]: ks \n[30:27] Angler Jax [ALL]: pls do \n[33:00] Angler Jax [ALL]: more lifesteal needed \n[33:06] Angler Jax [ALL]: pls \n[33:12] Angler Jax [ALL]: amumu is better at full tank damage \n[33:15] Angler Jax [ALL]: i need muh damage items \n[34:53] Angler Jax [ALL]: STOP THE 2v1 \n[34:54] Angler Jax [ALL]: PLS \n[34:59] Angler Jax [ALL]: cant we have a manly duel \n[35:03] Angler Jax [ALL]: you can beat me anyways \n[35:38] Angler Jax [ALL]: do you actually ward in normals \n[36:59] Angler Jax [ALL]: :O atmas impaer \n[37:02] Angler Jax [ALL]: what a man \n[37:03] Angler Jax [ALL]: a true bruiser \n[37:38] Angler Jax [ALL]: yea \n[37:40] Angler Jax [ALL]: what a man \n[37:42] Angler Jax [ALL]: you have 2much damage tho \n[37:45] Angler Jax [ALL]: i need some offense \n[37:57] Angler Jax [ALL]: i tried to last hit u with my e \n[37:58] Angler Jax [ALL]: but \n[38:03] Angler Jax [ALL]: i have 0.25 sec delayt \n[40:13] Angler Jax [ALL]: not cool \n[40:16] Angler Jax [ALL]: my mom died from cancer \n[41:27] Angler Jax [ALL]: mercy \n[41:29] Angler Jax [ALL]: upon me \n[41:39] Angler Jax [ALL]: wtf \n[41:42] Angler Jax [ALL]: oh \n[41:48] Angler Jax [ALL]: i need to regnarok first \n[41:49] Angler Jax [ALL]: i think \n[43:01] Angler Jax [ALL]: . \n[43:02] Angler Jax [ALL]: ok \n[43:47] Angler Jax [ALL]: 1v1 him \n[43:49] Angler Jax [ALL]: dont run \n[43:50] Angler Jax [ALL]: be manly \n[43:52] Angler Jax [ALL]: wow minions \n[43:54] Angler Jax [ALL]: Are winning it fo ru \n[44:16] Angler Jax [ALL]: report shaco interrupting duel \n[44:37] Angler Jax [ALL]: wow olaf can 1v10 minions \n[49:08] Angler Jax [ALL]: 2much damage \n[49:09] Angler Jax [ALL]: wtf \n[49:22] Angler Jax [ALL]: normals are no longe rfun\n\nGame 2:\n\n[0:59] Angler Jax [ALL]: i have the emo poppy skin \n[1:00] Angler Jax [ALL]: no backtalk \n[3:12] Angler Jax [ALL]: so cheesy \n[5:39] Angler Jax [ALL]: like \n[5:39] Angler Jax [ALL]: pls \n[5:40] Angler Jax [ALL]: rofl \n[6:38] Angler Jax [ALL]: o somebody testing his drophack \n[8:26] Angler Jax [ALL]: like \n[8:28] Angler Jax [ALL]: Were premade too \n[8:30] Angler Jax [ALL]: but we play for fun \n[8:36] Angler Jax [ALL]: not tryhard like mad plebs \n[9:53] Angler Jax [ALL]: honestly \n[9:56] Angler Jax [ALL]: enjoy your normals win \n[10:00] Angler Jax [ALL]: stay gold \n[14:25] Angler Jax [ALL]: poppy \n[14:32] Angler Jax [ALL]: getting carried by your diamond rammus main friend in blinds \n[14:35] Angler Jax [ALL]: isnt going to make you any better \n[15:12] Angler Jax [ALL]: im not even salty \n[15:19] Angler Jax [ALL]: just frustrated by people like you \n[15:23] Angler Jax [ALL]: im annoyed \n[15:34] Angler Jax [ALL]: but im just going to surrender and queue for a 3v3s where tryhards dont exist \n[16:01] Angler Jax [ALL]: im diamond in 3s ranked \n[16:59] Angler Jax [ALL]: only 3 minutes till you get your blinds win \n[17:15] Angler Jax [ALL]: i dont wanna waste my time for \n[17:17] Angler Jax [ALL]: skype premades \n[17:39] Angler Jax [ALL]: look at our comps \n[17:46] Angler Jax [ALL]: comp* \n[17:47] Angler Jax [ALL]: and builds \n[20:01] Angler Jax [ALL]: a premade skype team with rammus main got placed vs 4 melee adcs \n[20:02] Angler Jax [ALL]: ads* \n[20:40] Angler Jax [ALL]: have fun\n\nGame 3:\n\n[2:31] Angler Jax [ALL]: welp \n[9:20] Angler Jax [ALL]: you dont even feel guilty?
