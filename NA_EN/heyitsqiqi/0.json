And I'm sorry, champs with that kind of kit should never be buffed into being meta, which she IS atm (unless you believe a champ with a 80% pick/ban in higher elo, and the second most pick/ban champ in tournament [http://gol.gg/champion/list/season-S8/split-Summer/tournament-ALL/patch-ALL/role-ALL/league-ALL/ ], is not considered meta for some reason).\n\nEDIT:\n\n> {{champion:266}} has a very mechanically intensive kit, but is in the gutters with his nerf.\n> \n> 50% win rate:\n> http://na.op.gg/champion/aatrox/statistics/top\n\nAlso, 50% win rate is NOT \"in the gutters\", mate...\n\nWhat's more, Aatrox currently has a 54% win rate in Diamond with a nearly 50% pick/ban (36% ban rate) there. [https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Aatrox/graphs/ ] He is played very badly in Bronze tho, so I guess the \"mechanically intensive\" part is at the very least partially correct, but definitely not the \"in the gutters\" bit.
