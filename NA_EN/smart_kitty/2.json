In either case TSM and FNC need to stop being aggressive early game... not only do they backfire every time, but they start up the snowball against them.\n\n\nThey need tanky teams, or high mobility, and just focus on AFK farming/dodging ganks.  If they can make it to mid game they may have a chance.\n\n\nMust say you are definitely getting a good show for your money though if you attended MSI.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-08T21:23:19.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely getting my moneys worth.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-05-08T21:28:41.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vixanys,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=hpH0uJWO,comment-id=000300000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-08T21:23:19.663+0000)\n>\n> Definitely getting my moneys worth.\n\nLoL you know who isn't getting their monies worth?

No, lol, Yellowstar is one of my favorite players ever.\n2. It's not luck that AHQ won, FNC planned poorly and got punished just as much as Alliance got punished for planning poorly vs Kabum.\n3. I am an elements fan, that's about the only thing you did state correctly about me, even though it's quite obvious.\n4. I'm rooting for AHQ because they are the only team I was rooting for that made it to MSI. The other teams I wanted to make it all fell to 2nd, which I stated in a previous post before MSI. Also in that post I said I was conflicted on which team to root for, and one of them was guess who? FNC.\n5. Underdog victories are always awesome imo.\n6. You're probably just a FNC fan who's salty over the loss, not that I blame you.\n\nAnyways, yeah I was really confused about the Urgot pick. Yellow is a good naut, and yes leona's ult does have to be precise since it only stuns in the center. Stunning two carries might be better than hitting 4 with the slow on the outer radius. I do agree that leona probably would've been a better pick though.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say, the only team I want to fail horribly at MSI is SKT, cuz the SKT fanboys are more annoying than the TSM ones (only slightly).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-05-09T03:37:58.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just played very well against SKT too, I'm really happy for AHQ right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-05-08T21:09:32.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry...
