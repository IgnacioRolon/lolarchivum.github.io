This had a lot of debate around it because there are quite a few metal ones, haha (Bloodthirster, Liandry's Torment, etc). As for Ohmwrecker specifically, we gravitated towards that item almost immediately because it sounded exactly like what a lot of prog/djent metal bands name their albums/songs.\n\n- We all had different phases of metal that we went through, so we just drove towards a style of metal that fit best with all of us.\n\n- We're always trying new things and seeing where LoL, music, etc takes us--we don't know the answer to this one, but that's kind of what makes it fun, haha.\n\n- We'll see :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZylotheWolfbane","date":"2014-06-12T22:12:34.263+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":2,"body":"Will Sona ever get any sound effects for her Pentakill skin, since right now she uses the standard Sona sound effects, which is EXTREMELY unfitting, what with it being these light, happy harp-like sounds that clash with her awesome heavy metal skin, and it just makes the skin incredibly disappointing, which is unfortunate, since the skin is so awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"kyugene","date":"2014-06-12T22:26:54.741+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually work in SFX for skins specifically, and this is something I've wanted to update for some time.
