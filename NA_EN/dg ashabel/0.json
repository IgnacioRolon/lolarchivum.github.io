It opened him up to such opportunities as meeting people and forming bonds, discovering things about himself and his condition that potentially involved other people, and generally let him interact with the surrounding world in ways other than decay and murder.\n\nTherefore we are going to open up his story by turning him into the \"creepy child\" horror trope that forbids him from interacting with the world around him in ways other than decay and murder. We feel it really opens him up to all the random decay and murder-related storylines. Also, creepy children obviously sell, given that they're present in 85% of horror movies.\"\n\n\nNot that the video isn't pretty (it really is), but what it does to Amumu's future as a character is upsetting. He no longer has a reason to interact with anyone or anything because even if he does, he will accidentally murder everyone involved. He's no longer really a character, unless you count every ghostly crying child that randomly shrieks and explodes in old Ghostbusters cartoons to be characters.\n\nAlso, he adds yet another apocalypse to the long-suffering neo-Valoran's list of world-spanning disasters. Between the devastating mage war between Azir and Xerath, rabid bugbear infestations, a civil war in Freljord that has potential to grow out into the summoning of Cthulhu, an annual zombie apocalypse and Amumu randomly exploding cities, how is Valoran still standing?\n\nI still struggle to figure out who this new lore is supposed to interest *as lore*, as opposed to as *pretty pictures*.

You certainly don't make a living writing League of Legends lore, so you can be forgiven for not being able to come up with a good story for that.\n\nNarrative does not benefit from that same luxury.  The simple fact that they felt the need to jettison the League, not simply and adequately explained desire, is proof enough to me that they are bad at their jobs.  They did not say, \"We don't really like the League, and we feel we would enjoy writing the stories more and you would enjoy reading them without it.\"  No, they said, \"We can't do it.  It's too hard to write with the League being there.  It's in our way and we can't get around it, so.... poof!  It's gone.\"\n\nGood writers don't write themselves into a corner.

Good times.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Journal_of_Justice:_Volume_1,_Issue_13\n\n\"Has there been any investigation as to if Amumu is the victim of a Noxian experiment in Necromancy, perhaps hidden in a lab in the Shurima Desert? If so, it would appear to have failed, seeing as how Amumu is not in the least bit evil. Is there any hope of finding out his past?\" – Xulsigae\n\nThis is interesting speculation, Xulsigae, although I have some reason to believe that Noxus would view it as an “unfounded accusation”. To date, no investigation has been undertaken on Noxian soil pertaining to Amumu’s origins. It’s possible that there may be something in the Shurima Desert, but it is a vast desert that’s difficult to cover and extremely dangerous to travel through. The League discourages civilians from venturing south of the Great Barrier as entire platoons of soldiers have been lost on expeditions there.\n\nRegarding hope for discovering his past, I thought the best answer would come from Amumu himself:\n\n\"Of course I have hope; otherwise I never would have found my way out of that pyramid. I’m still looking, and many people have helped me in more ways than I can count. I’m so grateful! One day I’ll find my parents, I know it.
