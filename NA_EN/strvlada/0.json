Her tribe is also the largest and best-supplied at the moment, which means she has a lot more resources to throw at problems.  She can exploit the Winter's Claw's small size, try to break bonds between Sejuani and Volibear, and try to direct Udyr against Lissandra.  Lissandra's own forces consist mostly of cultists and trolls, and those trolls are *not* loyal to her.  Trundle has shown himself to be a turncoat already, it's not hard to imagine he'll pound Lissandra to pulp if Ashe makes him a better offer.\n\n{{champion:113}} is playing a longer game.  She's the best leader, though worst diplomat, of the three and she's eroding Ashe's tribe slowly but surely, destroying some but also actively recruiting from them and expanding her influence at their expense.  She has the best active military of the three and we know she can take down Lissandra in a fight - Voli's people blinded Lissandra in the first place and Udyr stomped her one on one.  Trundle turning on her when faced with that sort of force is highly likely.  If she's given time to continue leeching resources away from Ashe then not only does she gain more support but it makes Demacia a lot less likely to intervene since they won't want to enter a war on the losing side.\n\n{{champion:127}} wins the longest game, though, because she can simply stay in her fortress in the most inhospitable part of the Freljord and outlive the other two.  Once Trundle dies off she'll have an ironclad hold over the trolls, giving her a strong military presence, and she'll have all the time in the world to do her thing and summon the Watchers without interference from most of the other Champions.  Without eyes that deep in the Freljord the other nations won't be able to respond until it's way too late and the only real obstacles to world domination at that point will be the Void, the Shadow Isles, and immortal champions like Kayle, Brand, or Azir.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Hero","date":"2015-04-01T08:16:56.724+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I more or less agree with your evaluation. \n\nMost wars are won by managing resources and if you take this into account, it becomes clear who's the winner. \n\n{{champion:22}} has more food, more land and more allies.

And even the Mongols had mounted archers. So unless Riot confirms that Sejuani has more than melee bruisers, Ashe's ADCs will pick them off from a distance on the frozen PLAINS of Avarosa. \n\nI would argue with a few of these assessments.  Some points to consider.\n\n1)  I think you're reading too much into the tribes from their champions.  Ashe is an archer, but that doesn't mean her people are predominantly archers.  Just like Sejuani and friends being melee doesn't mean she doesn't have any archers of her own.  And we know the Winter's Claw have shields and armor - Sejuani herself used to have a shield, didn't like it, and switched to full plate.  Don't mistake the champions for an average representation of the people they lead - They're champions for a reason.\n\n2)  According to Quinn, Ashe's people can't hold their towns and villages.  This makes sense - As farmers, they can't really fortify.  They need a lot of open space, which means they can't just put walls around everything.  Even if they do, those outlying farms are extremely vulnerable, especially during harvest - All Sej would have to do is show up right after harvest and she could steal a year's worth of food from them while they're hiding behind their walls unable to do anything about it.\n\n3)  You got the replenishment numbers backwards - Sejuani can replace melee troops a lot cheaper and easier than Ashe could replace archers.  Archery requires years of training to be even remotely competent at in battle, but 'Take this axe and hit someone with it' is not a particularly advanced discipline.  Historically, this was why England formally banned every sport except archery for decades during their wars with France, to ensure that they could replace any longbowmen they lost, but they could easily draft armies of melee troops without any effort.\n\n4)  You have a lot of speculation in there that's not grounded in canon and it's coloring your views a bit.  Be careful of this.  From what we know from Quinn, Sejuani isn't a tyrannical dictator like you suggest; she's cool, distant, and detached, but not ruling by fear.  In fact, Quinn noted that the Winter's Claw seemed *happier* than the Avarosans, and she'd also noted that many Avarosans that Sejuani was raiding against didn't fight them but joined them willingly.  Not the mark of a dictatorship where dissenters are executed and failures are punishable by death.\n\nThat's why I drew the conclusions I did.  The Avarosans have an advantage if they go to war -right now- because they presently do have the resources to win.  But Sejuani is bleeding them of those resources and if they don't pull the trigger soon Winter's Claw is going to literally recruit their army from under them.  Lissandra, she just needs to watch and wait for the other two to die off somehow.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Hero","date":"2015-04-01T13:44:04.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Trylobyte\n\n1) Archers v/s melee. We don't know anything about their troop composition. And I'm basing myself on their lore and splash art. Right now Sej's official splash has a big ass flail and no shield while her traditional Splash had 1. I will not argue which is canon or not but if this was real life, Sejuani would have to get a shield ASAP or else be relegated to the back lines to \"inspire\". You are right I shouldn't base myself on their splash to calculate their troop composition but it is reasonable to assume that Ashe being an archer would train better archers and Sej would train better melees. \n\n2)  Acc. to Quinn. Where did you read that they can't fortify? These were isolated farms. Whereas Ashe's capital has trade, food and civilisation AKA a tribal stronghold, fortifications. Sejuani rode out to war on the first day of winter. (Sej Lore) I cannot stress how much this is stupid. If she attacks Ashe in the middle of winter she willl be caught in snow storms in her temporary camps while Ashe will have gathered all her people at her capital in warm wood/ stone fortifications with plenty of food. \n\n3) Actually, training GOOD archers takes a lot of time I agree but training decent archers to fire through arrow slots takes 2 weeks tops. I know because I did archery. Meanwhile, your axe wielders have to be toughened and brain washed to launch a melee attack. Real life medieval battles usually consisted of two lines shouting insults at each other for hours before they finally got the courage to charge. So yes, you have a point, melees are easier to replace but then they are only useful as meat shields for the archers until they are seasoned. And Sejuani STILL has less people. You said it earlier, we don't know if Sej has archers or if Ashe has melees. But we do know that Sej imposes very harsh conditions on her troops so her mortality rate is higher BECAUSE they have the mentality that if you die it's because you are weak.\n\n4) Sejuani may not be tyranical I agree.  But \"Through her ordeals, she learned that to thrive in the endless winter, one must become just as cold and unforgiving. In Sejuani's eyes, her followers either have the mettle to endure or the right to die.\" She's harsh and unforgiving. It's her leadership style. She leads by showing power and it is not a stretch to assume that she takes the failure or disobedience of her generals lightly.\n4b) Villagers joining Sejuani. What you are seeing are looters. Plague of all wars. All historians will tell you. These guys do more damage than any army because they make fertile land sterile and eat all wildlife. They are also cowardly, have no fighting experience and desert at any opportunity. They will rebel if they don't have enough booze and they will rebel because they are not toughened like Sejuani's original tribe and not as disciplined. They are a burden for Sej except if she uses them as meat shields. \n\nFinally, \n\"On the first day of winter, envoys from Ashe's tribe approached Sejuani's camp...Sejuani gathered her people and set the grain alight. As the grain burned behind them, Sejuani rode out with her warband to inflict the first of many painful lessons to come.\" \n\n= Sej starts war on the first day of winter. \n= long after harvest\n= after all the food has been gathered and secured\n= she will reach Ashe's capital in mid winter\n= she will attack when living in leather tents. \n= her tribe may survive the winter but not her recruits.\n\nConclusion\nAshe must not go to war. She just needs to sit it out after winter has decimated 3/4 of Sejuani's recruit army.","replies":[{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2015-04-01T14:43:29.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nameless Hero,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=7lNkPcBG,comment-id=000b000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-01T13:44:04.402+0000)\n>\n*snip*\n\n1)  We could debate this one for a while and drag all sorts of real-world comparisons into it.  Let's not do that, it makes for interesting but ultimately rather meaningless discussion.\n\n2)  That's just it.  The Avarosans *depend* on those isolated farms.  If they can't hold those (and they can't) they lose their resource advantage and their food supply.  So sure, they can bunker up in their capital, but with their food supplies cut off they can't really do a whole lot except get sieged.\n\n3)  Sure, you can learn the basics of firing a bow in a few weeks, but good luck actually hitting anything past a hundred feet.  Especially when that target is moving and armored, knowing that if you miss (and maybe even if you hit nonfatally) it's axe meet face time. And sure, you can sit behind fortifications, but then you run into the problem of #2 - You're easily outmaneuvered, and the Avarosans have a lot more territory to protect.\n\n4a)  Sej is cold, distant, and has a very Noxian 'Strength is everything' mindset, but that doesn't make her a tyrant.  That makes her a jerk.  Actually, it makes her a perfect match for Darius, but let's not go there.  She can likely tolerate failure - Failure happens even to strong people - but she doesn't deal with incompetence very well.\n\n4b)  We don't know who joined her and who didn't, just that a lot of Avarosans she runs into seem to prefer joining her to fighting her and wind up liking the place.  The 'burn, pillage, and loot' is something the whole of the tribe does, because they're modeled after the Mongols or Huns in that regard.  Besides, why leave perfectly usable resources just lying around for the enemy when you can take or destroy them?\n\n5)  Sejuani burning the offering of grain from Ashe wasn't really a short-sighted mistake.  It was a diplomatic middle finger to the Avarosans, a declaration saying 'We don't need your charity.'  One assumes that a tribe calling itself the *Winter's* Claw knows a thing or two about surviving in the cold and can teach it to others...  just like the Inuits or anyone from Siberia in real life.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Hero","date":"2015-04-01T18:36:53.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Trylobyte,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=7lNkPcBG,comment-id=000b0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-01T14:43:29.605+0000)\n> 3)  Sure, you can learn the basics of firing a bow in a few weeks, but good luck actually hitting anything past a hundred feet.

And then firing large quantities of arrows at point blank range behind arrow slits while the enemies line up for the shots.\n\nAnd Sejuani is harsh and unforgiving. It's in her lore.

Google it. \n\nIn 1941, Hitler who had the greatest army in the world famed for its lighting strikes, heavy armor and superior firepower, lost WW3 when it was forced to siege Moscow who had the worst army in the world during Winter. Russia simply burned all the food provisions between Hitler and their fortress and bunkered up in Moscow. Hitler lost and retreated.\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon, greatest general of the world at that time led the greatest army of the world at that time to capture Moscow. They managed to capture Moscow. But the citizens burned 3/4 of the whole city and the supplies and Napoleon had to retreat so that his army didn't starve. \n\nBut what about the Inuits and the Mongols and the Siberians? How do they wage way in Winter? Glad you asked.\n- The Inuits are hunters. They move with the quarry and follow the food. Google says they rarely fight.\n- The Siberians, aka the Russians bunker up in their cities. \n- The mongols on the other hand liked to attack in Winter! Point for you. So what kind of tactic did they use?\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n- The mongols recruited the male nomads to their armies if they only surrendered but were never able to gain long-term loyalty from the settled peoples that they conquered. Point for you\n- The Kharash - \"During a siege the Mongols would gather a crowd of local residents or soldiers surrendered from previous battles, and would drive them forward in sieges and battles. These \"living boards\" or \"human shields\" would often take the brunt of enemy arrows and crossbow bolts, thus leaving the Mongol warriors safer. The kharash were also often forced ahead to breach walls\"\n- Mongols used intimidation to make cities surrender without a fight. Exactly what Sej does, good\n- Mongols used catapults and machines... Does Sejuani have them? Big question. It requires engineers and a literate population. This is stretching thin here. \n- They use mounted archery... Again this is stretching thin here. Sej is feared for her berserkers, armored bears and axe warriors not for her archery.\n- Mongol armies traveled very light, and were able to live largely off the land. They would have 4-5 horses, would milk them and eat them. BUT for heavier equipment they relied on large, well organised supply trains. Yet they had a lot of difficulty against the Mamluks who burned their provisions and land to prevent the Mongols from having food and foraging. \n- And finally the Mongols carefully scouted out and spied on their enemies ten years before any invasion. Sejuani declared War after 5 minutes. \n\n\nConclusion:\nIf Ashe fights like the Siberians using a scorched earth policy, evacuating villages and burning provisions so that Sej cannot make use of them and bunkers up at ther capital she will have a huge advantage. She can simply wait until Winter is over and attack a weakened and famished Winter's claw.\nIf Sejuani only raids the outer cities then she is not a direct threat to Ashe's claim to the throne. But Sejuani is trying to conquer the Freljord. She will have to meet Ashe at her fortified capital.\nSejuani can only win through a direct confrontation. She needs to capture the capital fast.\nSejuani cannot conquer Ashe's tribe until she gets siege engines.\nSejuani despises farming. She is forced to raid to get food. She can capture villages through intimidation but these villages will turn coat the moment she leaves. UNLESS she leaves a large armored force in the conquered cities.\nAshe sent Sej a gift of grain that was supposedly enough to last for the winter. That means they have a LOT of grain to spare. Grain is harvested in autumn. Sej started war in Winter. All the grain has therefore been harvested 1 month ago. Ashe has probably requested her taxes. Meaning that the capital is well stocked in food. Raiding the outer villages while terrible for the kingdom doesn't mean much to Ashe's security.\nMeanwhile, Sej did not plan her war, burnt 4 months of food. Moves in raiding camps = has no supply lines. Counts of pillaging and foraging to feed her army and recruits more and more people to her cause everyday. \n\nTherefore Sejuani will inevitably have a food and logistics disaster...\n\n..unless she kills her armored bears to have furs and eats her new recruits that she planned to use as human shields anyway. It is therefore very likely that Volibear and his tribe won't remain allies for long given that he needs even more food and that her new found recruits will desert at the slightest hardship. \n\nTherefore Sejuani cannot win.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Migrañaboy","date":"2015-03-30T22:39:49.476+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't Rito stated that the lore would evolve dependening on which faction gained more votes according to icons?

The other three are basically just coming on their own to the fight, not really bringing any more armies, they just support Ashe's ideology.  They can act as generals and commanders though, so that could potentially sway the course of a battle if they're good at it, but only Anivia seems to have the potential for that anyway.  She is however allied with Demacia so they could get involved, and they are one of the strongest forces in all of Valoran.\n\nLissandra has the Watchers so that gives her an advantage, as well as the Troll army lead by Trundle so she has two armies who alone could probably take on that of Ashe's.  The downside is it's just Liss and Trundle leading everything, they have no generals or commanders or anything to lead in the field, and if I remember correctly in Trundle's lore he did swear that HE would rule the Freljord once he'd helped Liss beat the other two forces, so there could be some fracturing between those two armies.  If another of the armies of Valoran, like Demacia or Noxus got involved it could mean trouble for them as was, since none of the other nations would support Lissandra's army.  maybe except Zaun, they like to see new and strange things and tend to get involved in the most random of places just for the sake of experimentation, but they don't really have their own army.\n\nNow looking at Sejuani, her tribe is bred for war, so they could potentially match the forces of Lissandra's and they far surpass that of Ashe's.  On top of that Volibear is bringing the whole of the Ursine to join her, which together with the Winter's Claw would easily decimate Ashe's forces and could very likely stand up to Lissandra's and Trundle's.  She also has Olaf who will most definitely be leading \"troops\" into battle, working as a field commander of sorts, which can easily sway the course of a battle against a force who lacks such a role.  And ofc Udyr, who also can act as a commander, but is also friends with Lee Sin who is from Ionia so that could potentially pull that whole nation into the conflict.  They however have had a kind of stand off-ish history, only fighting when being attacked, so I doubt it.  That being said though should Demacia join to help out the extreme underdog that is Ashe's forces then Noxus would most likely join Sejuani.  Sejuani and Noxus have similar ideals and Noxus would join any fight against Demacia at this point, and they would not side with the Watchers, cause no one would want to give Lissandra the chance to take over the whole of Valoran.\n\nSo yeah I see Sejuani taking the crown lore wise, Ashe's forces being irrelevant and Lissandra's not having the potential for any outside assistance, where as Sejuani has a couple potential reinforcements.  The only thing that would change this is if Aatrox got involved, but he hasn't bothered with pretty much any of Valoran's current conflicts and now he's also made himself known, so I don't see him jumping in to sway the tide of battle this time.  Not too mention if he did it would most likely be for Ashe, but then Tryndamere would definitely attack him and then Aatrox would have to fight him instead of helping Ashe.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-03-31T11:13:11.009+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually if I remember correctly Tryndamere does have a tribe,his original tribe was wiped out by aatrox,then he ventured to the different tribes to become stronger,then he united the remaining barbarian tribes and THEN he married ashe.\nAnd I generally wouldn't think of the avarosans as weak,considering that lissandra even called them the strongest tribe(in the freljord video she described them this way)\n\nHowever I wouldn't count that much on the number of champs on each side,because champions are generally created first and then they'll see into which faction they fit the most and not \"oh faction X doesn't have that much,we need to add a few guys to them\"\nAlso the frostguard are still a rather recent addition,so it is only natural that they don't have such a huge number of champs yet(only one freljord champ was released after Lissandra)\n\nAlso it was confirmed that Braum is a supporter of the avarosans;)","replies":[{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2015-04-01T05:56:15.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually Tryndamere roamed the tundra and challenged the other warrior tribes to battle, as like an out let for his rage and a way to get stronger so he could one day face Aatrox.

This of course is a really great source of strength in just about every novel or story about war and battle, maybe even in real life but I've never fought in a war so I wouldn't know, but Sejuani's people are also united and bred more for war.  Their rivalry feels very much like that of Sparta and Athens from ancient Greece, where the Spartans were far superior in most ways but the Athenias stood strong and out smarted the Spartans when they could manage it.  But in a strait up fight the Winter's Claw would most likely trample over the Avarosans.\n\nAlso on where each champion goes, I placed them based on their lore and the lore from the Freljord saga Riot did a while back.  I mean the full list I originally gave is the same that Riot themselves gave for each faction, then my assumptions on who else might join in was based 100% on lore facts, so I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say about \"them choosing where to go,\" cause I covered that.\n\nAs for Braum, he simply wasn't on the official allegiance page so I forgot to add him, but him alone doesn't change my opinion even slightly.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-04-01T13:19:45.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is that Tryndameres old lore was pretty much the same except for who killed his tribe:\n1.His tribe got slaughtered\n2.Then he went to the other tribes to train\n3.Then he united the tribes\n4.And then he married ashe because ashe wanted to unite tryndameres tribe with hers.\n\nHis new lore only changes the first aspect and talks about the second.\nHowever we know that he is still married to ashe,which was a result of number 3,so it is safe to say that he still got his hands on a barbarian tribe,otherwise it wouldn't make sense for ashe to marry him.\nand generally the riot members say that if something hasn't been explicitly retconned,then it is still canon,which would be the case here.\n\nAlso Lissandra flat out called the avarosans the strongest and largest tribe,she didn't imply that they are only strong in a united sense or anything,if she wanted to say that she would have just called them the biggest tribe.\nThe avarosans might be more peace oriented,but that doesn't mean that their military is weaker than sejuanis and even if their individual warriors are weaker,they still have the superior numbers.\n\nAnd what I meant about \"choosing where to go\" is basically champion design.Riot doesn't create a champion to make a certain faction stronger,they simply create a champion and then look where said champ would fit the most.\nThey made {{champion:201}} an avarosan because it fits his character the most and not because they felt the avarosans don't have enough champions.\n{{champion:238}} s order of the shadows overpowered the kinkou order,despite zed being the only named member of his clan and the kinkou having 3 champions,so measuring the strenght of a faction based on champion numbers is kinda futile","replies":[{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2015-04-02T10:27:39.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I did some more reading into this just to make sure I have all the facts straight.\n\nFirstly, yes you are right it is still very much implied that Trynd brought his \"barbarian horde\" to join Ashe's forces.  So you are correct in that.\n\nSecondly, Lissandra has never said anything about Ashe's people being the largest and strongest.  In the two speeches we have heard Ashe is only even mentioned in one of them, the other being about Lissandra's sisters and her one sister called Avarosa being the strongest and most unruly of the 3 of them.  And when she talks about Ashe she is putting on an act to gain her trust so she could begin to manipulate her, so whatever she says about Ashe and her people in that speech isn't necessarily true and is meant to cater to the Avarosans.\n\nFinally one of the interesting things I discovered is that Ashe and Tryndamere don't really have an alliance with Demacia, they do not trust or approve of some of Demacia's decisions but they have relations so they can have a voice in the rest of Valoran.  Where as Noxus is apparently a direct enemy to Trynd's barbarian people, trying a few times to \"quell the barbarians,\" so it's actually far more likely for Noxus to join Sejuani then it is for Demacia to join Ashe, even though one joining would almost definitely mean the other would as well.\n\nAnd as for the champions, I did take all of that into account, I even gave specific lore based reasons why each champion would assist which faction that wasn't specifically stated to already be a member of one of them.  The list I originally stated at first is an irrefutable truth of where those champions loyalties lie, because as I've already stated Riot themselves made that list of champions.\n\nAlso I'm not trying to rank each of Freljord's faction's strength based on the number of champions, I thought that would be incredibly obvious since the faction with the most champions is the one I still believe to be the weakest and least likely to win.

Thankfully this is one of my favorite subjects.\n\nWho said Sejuani had to launch attacks in the winter?  Hell, I explicitly said Ashe has the advantage if the war touches off *right now* but Sejuani will have an advantage if nothing happens for a few years and she's allowed to keep doing her thing for a while, whittling away at Ashe's powerbase.  Thus my use of the terms cold and hot war.  The war isn't hot right now, it's actually fairly cold.  There haven't been any great clashes of armies, there's more low-level raiding and skirmishing and harsh nasty words that have no real immediate consequence.  Until one of the three does something significant the war is going to remain cold, too.\n\nYou seem set on the idea that the war is immediately going to go hot, and if it did I agree Ashe has the advantage.  But it's not going to because Ashe is overly nice and diplomatic and isn't going to force the issue.  *Sejuani knows this and is ruthlessly exploiting it.*  If allowed to continue, she will eventually gain the upper hand.\n\nNow for more specific responses to more specific points.\n\n- Yes, if Ashe goes all General Sherman on the countryside she will beat Sejuani.  But both of them know Ashe isn't going to do this because that's not the type of person Ashe is.  Ashe is the 'Good' in the Good/Neutral/Evil conflict of the Freljord.  She wants to talk things out peacefully and  help everyone.  She's not going to go burning down farms and villages - Most of them hers - to deny resources.  That would be militarily sound but politically, socially, ethically, and morally suicidal.\n\n- Sejuani never actually needs to attack Ashe's capital.  Like I said, Sejuani's advantage is the long game.  If she can take control of the supplies she never needs to go after Ashe directly at all.  This is how sieges work - Take out the supply lines and wait for the enemy to come fight you on your terms or surrender from starvation.  Want a historical example? The Siege of Vicksburg in the American Civil War worked exactly like this.  Big, massively fortified, nearly unassailable position...  that had to surrender because they had no access to outside supply for three months.\n\n- Sejuani doesn't need to fortify captured cities.  She's the Neutral in the conflict.  If it benefits her to loot the city and raze it to the ground then tell the people 'You're allowed to stay in this ash pile if you want, or you can come help us' then she'll probably do that.  It's a dick move, but militarily effective.  Don't give them a choice to turn coat and they won't.\n\n- The sort of logistics disaster you describe isn't as inevitable as you make it sound.  Sej may not be much of a farmer, but there's clearly something else to eat up there since her tribe has already been there for a while already.  Hunters and fishers, probably.  Perfectly capable of sustaining a tribe for a while, especially if they supplement things with raiding all those newly-filled grain stores hanging around all those undefended farmsteads and villages.  She'll have to wind up dealing with farms eventually if the tribe gets too big - You can't sustain a huge population off hunting alone - but she'll burn that bridge when she gets to it.  She's not there yet.\n\n- So Sejuani is harsh and unforgiving.  So was my history professor.  That didn't mean he shot us if we gave a wrong answer.  It's possible to be harsh and unforgiving without being Josef Stalin or Darth Vader, killing people for failing you.  It's possible to be harsh but fair.\n\n\nBoy did this thread get derailed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-04-01T12:42:17.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lissandra is a powerful to be sure, but she is also arrogant as all get out.
