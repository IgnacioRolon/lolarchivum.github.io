Did someone not mention Hitler? Paradox.  \nBUT since we are talking about science lets point out the fact that natural selection will probably never be able to eliminate the mental illness. Mental illness has been around for ages and it can't be, for lack of a better word, eliminated because there are factors like recessive genes, dormant genes that show up later in life after reproduction already occurred, etc. Therefore by natural selection standards, is mental illness considered something that should be taken out of the picture? Yes. near sight and other illness? Yes. Will it? No. The world rarely operates on what should happen and so let's focus on what is happening. If you lost a friend to depression, then prevent another from experiencing the same by contributing to the national suicide prevention hotline.

In fact, since we're talking about mental weakness, it's more than plausible that he was talking about suicide.\n\nI mean, your comments seem to give off the impression that you are unfamiliar with the term. People who wear glasses have bad vision. They invented glasses to make up for this. That's natural selection at it's finest sir, the ability to adapt. If you have a mental weakness, chose not to take steps to better the situation, you are not the fittest. That's quite clearly what OP is saying. If you have a mental weakness and some random person on the internet telling you to kill yourself ACTUALLY makes you do it, then why not mute everyone? You cannot control what they say, so it's only obvious to take steps to do what YOU can. If you do not, and you end up killing yourself, that's natural selection. Those with mental weaknesses that seek help and mute until their emotional state is better, are more fit than those who sit in a corner and cry. Natural selection. OP never hinted that people with weak minds should be murdered. So your comparison that people with glasses should be killed is completely irrelevant. Stupid even. If you want to compare with people with glasses, a better comparison would be something like, \"It's someone's own fault if they need glasses and don't get them and decide to drive a car and crash into a pole and die.\" Because that is true. Just as playing a game known for it's shitty community and not muting players the person's fault. \n\nPeople have rage issues, no? Is that not a mental issue just the same as depression, just on the opposite spectrum? So you're going to run into people that are going to be dicks. You are never going to be able to avoid that. If you don't use the tools given to you to avoid such things while in an unstable environment, then you only have yourself to blame to be honest. Killing people is bad, right? People obviously shouldn't do it. Yet if I walked around downtown Youngstown wearing a KKK outfit, you best believe I'm going to get shot. While that person shouldn't shoot me, it's still my fault for being a dumbass about it.\n\nFor someone claiming to be in the area of science, you surely don't seem like it.","replies":[{"poster":"mikemcparty","date":"2017-01-09T21:15:05.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"First off, when UnboundCreator stated that he was against bans for telling people to kill themselves because it was \"better for natural selection.\" Natural selection implies death, as it doesn't work unless death occurs. Death before reproduction actually. His statement said he was okay with people killing themselves because, according to him, it would make the human population healthier and more fit.\n\nHumans essentially cheat natural selection with our intelligence. Without the invention of glasses and eyewear, you would die in nature without the ability to see. Cooperation has allowed our population to thrive over the years. Mental illness is something which we, as a population, have recognized as something that needs treatment. We use medicine to treat this, ultimately cheating natural selection yet again. Your logic is flawed because you are under the assumption that people who actually commit suicide are doing it with no actual mental illness nor are they choosing seek any type of treatment.\n\nWhat you are doing is victim blaming. You cannot blame the victim, as they cannot predict how their harasser will act. This is like me walking into a store and beating someone. They weren't prepared to be beaten, so they are mentally weak and should be killed anyways. In an easily predictable situation, like walking down the street dressed in KKK garb, then the outcome is easily predicted and victim blaming doesn't hold true. It cannot be predicted that you are going to play a game online and people are going to repeatedly tell you to kill yourself. \n\nIt is also important to realize that, for many with mental illness, video games are a way for them to get away from some of the conflict that they have in their lives. Who are you to tell them that they can't do this because they are too \"mentally weak.\"","replies":[{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2017-01-10T00:49:14.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Humans do not \"cheat\" natural selection with intelligence. Intelligence is just one form of natural selection lol. It's not as applicable in todays world of safety, but the concept stands. A man creating fire to survive through the winter isn't \"cheating\" natural selection, he is an example of it.\n\nNo, my assumption does not assume that people are committing suicide without mental illness. My assumption is that people with mental illnesses that kill themselves where unable/unwilling to utilize tools to enable them to survive. That's the concept behind natural selection. The ability to adapt. If you're unable to adapt by seeking treatment or something as easy as hitting the mute button, you are not adapting to your environment. That's why you die off. So while Darwin used genes and mutations as his example, the concept still applies to intelligence. It's all about adapting. Whether that be by intelligence in creating tools to adapt, or the traditional theory genetics. It's still adaptation.\n\nThat's not victim blaming. It's just the definition of natural selection. If they aren't strong enough to adapt, they will be killed off (in this scenario, kill themselves). Just because that may be \"insensitive\" (or quite frankly, just being a dick), doesn't mean it's incorrect. They cannot predict how their harasser may act, agreed. Which is why being intelligent and proactively muting is the smart thing to do, just as not walking around downtown Youngstown dressed in KKK clothing is the smart thing to do. You say it cannot be predicted, but yet this community is literally known for being a shit storm. So yes, it is predictable.\n\nAnd what do you say to those suffering from mental illnesses that cause them to rage out in video games? Anger issues if you will. Do you just say fuck them and they shouldn't be able to play? Because that's the same exact thing as telling someone with depressive issues that they should just deal with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GotTilt","date":"2017-01-10T00:25:57.102+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mikemcparty,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pkgaET0J,comment-id=001d0000,timestamp=2017-01-09T03:37:12.785+0000)\n>\n> So everyone who wears glasses, is handicapped, or has any type of sickness should be killed?\n> \n> Do you realize how stupid you are?
