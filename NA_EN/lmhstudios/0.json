On this website, na.leagueoflegends.com, I have not been able to view or access my match history for a few weeks. I thought the issue would just go away, but it has not yet. Is there anyway or anything I can do to get to see it? When I click on the match history tab under my profile, it just sits there on the match history page, but doesn't ever load in. The link I provided shows you what I see when I click Match History tab on the website.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-29T02:49:51.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm..
