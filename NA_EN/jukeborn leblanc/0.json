Yes, not the best way to start off this post but I don't care.\r\nBack on topic, I'd like to bring up the fact that us players can get chat restricted, and banned for being toxic. Us being negative in the chat is such a problem apparently. If only there was a solution to it...   oh yea\r\n**MUTE  THE PLAYER**\r\nI would understand players being punished for being toxic if there wasn't a mute button. I believe if they  want to punish us for being toxic, then they should remove the mute button. If players aren't going to use it for toxic players, then why have it in the first place. I believe that a big part of video games is being able to be better than other players and brag about it. Growing up, I'd love being able to out-skill someone else and be able to brag about it. It made it rewarding. I am unable to beat someone in a 1v1 and call them bad, I am unable to tell my 0/10 top laner that he's bad. Am I being toxic or am I just stating the facts ? O_o  I honestly believe that not allowing people to shit talk in a video game is stupid. Do people not have tough skin anymore? Does a simple \"you're trash\", \"stay out of ranked\", \"Monkey\" really upset you that much? I personally could care less, if someone is being annoying and just being toxic, I mute them. Problem solved. Should they be banned ? No, it didn't bother me and it shouldn't have bothered my team-mates or the enemy team. They should have just muted him just as I did. \r\nX     \r\nMy main point being that if Riot wants to punish players for being toxic. they should remove the mute button. If there was no way to deal with toxic players such as the mute button, then punishments would be completely justifiable. They should focus on players hacking, players purposeless losing games.\r\nNot players crying over a {{champion:92}}  main calling them trash. I'd like to here what the community thinks of this.

If you're getting muted and reported over and over again, the problem is with you. \n\nIf your door knob cut you every time you opened the door, would you just keep putting Band-Aids on your fingers every time you opened the door or would you fix/replace the door knob? Same idea. Chat restriction is your hint you need to fix something before you get removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Jukeborn Leblanc","date":"2017-08-01T16:39:30.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"So you're telling me I'm not allowed to be mad when I get a 0/10 top laner.

I'm saying you can find a better way to deal with that anger. \n\nYou're not the only one here who has experienced that, we all have. You just have to find a better way to vent. If you want, bring it all here to the Boards and start a discussion about it, plenty of people do that (just leave out the names, board rules).\n\nOne thing that helps me keep my calm is focusing on my own play. Yes, we probably lost that game because of the 0/10 top and the DC, but I could have warded up their jungle better and looked for an opportunity to take some camps. Or I should have realized when I was overextended and backed away. Or I should have pushed that one time. When you do all that it's easier to realize it wasn't all your teammates fault (even if a majority of the problems came from them).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2017-08-01T16:37:05.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't communicate annymore with 25%! of your teammates after you have to mute only one person ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"aZ3R0n","date":"2017-08-01T16:31:44.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Terms of Service, that's why.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-08-02T12:42:36.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You misunderstand.
