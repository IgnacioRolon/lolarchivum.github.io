Specifically how to properly use Player Attack Move, Player Attack Move Click, and Player Attack Only Click. \r\n\r\nI have seen the reddit post about binding your Left Click to, Player Attack Move Click, and tested it out some, but ultimately went back to the defaults since it kinda screwed up my communication pings. \r\n\r\nI would be interested in hearing from some experienced ADC's what the best key bindings are, and how to use them in game.","replies":[{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-01T18:33:24.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only use auto attack click (set to T), and I walk around with my right click.","replies":[]}]}
