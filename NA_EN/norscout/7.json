Well thats pretty stupid because like, the minions don&#039;t get gold for that, so why are they always taking your farm?? Check this.  So for every minion killed by your minions, all the gold goes into..i dunno..like a bucket.  Okay?  Now.  The team captain can use that bucket gold to upgrade the team&#039;s minions and structures.  This is pretty cool, because even if someone who missed a farm every now and then like myself, can still contribute to the team victory.  Anyway, this is a really good idea and I&#039;d appreciate positive feedback only.  Thank you very much!\n\nEDIT: Please don't downvote, we need to get this to the top of the boards\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KK3Xuh7.jpg[/img]\n\nhttp://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/31300000/Cute-anime-girls-anime-31331973-490-600.jpg","replies":[]}
