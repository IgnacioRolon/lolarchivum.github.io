It keeps ruining my games over and over again, so I basically can't play properly. Any solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Spárkie","date":"2017-02-24T19:14:38.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the DNS suggestion, firewall and flushing my IP. Still doesn't seem like it solved the issue, is it even safe port forwarding the provided ports there? Because it doesn't seem like i need it, I am not having connection issues or anything, it's just the game starts lagging with normal ping - champs teleporting around and what not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T02:27:34.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're describing are common symptoms of *Packet loss*, which occurs if there are problems between your PC and our servers.
