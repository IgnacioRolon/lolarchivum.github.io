A QoL change for Shunpo.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":15,"body":"Not sure if everyone is experiencing this, but Shunpo cancels everything following its use. \r\n\r\nSeeing as Katarina is whose someone that demands quick reflexes and reaction, its disappointing to face one of those cock blocking moments when you Q-E and expecting to R your way to a good fight, and then suddenly everything stops dead in the track, even your movement. \r\n\r\nHer animation screws her over. And leaves player feeling dazed and confused with what just happened. \r\n\r\nAside from that, her W could use a ratio buff for its horrifically low base. Unless she snowballs, that skill is useless on its own. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s also one thing she could use, clearer particles to indicate the actual range of her abilities. I get that her blade models don&#039;t have much going for her, but it would be nice to have a clear view of her blades, her W and R particles are small as heck and its hard to see if it hits.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-03-14T18:49:08.684+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I'm missing something here, not quite sure what the issue you're describing is though? Shunpo's an instant cast spell that allows you to cast other spells immediately after its use and can be buffered during Bouncing Blade. It does cancel any existing movement commands on use, that's due to existing movement orders too often resulting in unintended movement post Shunpo though, making preservation of order more frustrating than helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"faresb2000","date":"2016-03-14T19:11:42.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4qrhAw3e,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-14T18:49:08.684+0000)\n>\n> Maybe I'm missing something here, not quite sure what the issue you're describing is though?

The TL;DR of the thread is to point out that Katarina's E is clunky to use and the fluidity of her combo execution is affected in the way. Enabling Katarina to E-R smoothly is akin to allowing Ahri to R-E, or Lux to Q-E-R. \n\nNot a matter of skill cap, but the fluidity of her abilities. The problem is her Shunpo cancels everything dead in its track, including movements.","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2016-03-15T22:26:38.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing is lux stays mostly still for q-e-r where its basically you q you land it then double click e and as it launches you ult","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"9L9L9L9L9L9L9L","date":"2016-03-14T17:52:51.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vincenttnecniv,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4qrhAw3e,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-14T17:44:27.378+0000)\n>\n> Why not...They already made the Alistar combo impossible to mess up.
