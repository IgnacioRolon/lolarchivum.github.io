However this new skin also includes for each form a new Ingame Profile Art (Those Circles you can find in your hud next to your your Stats and your Passive). So basically you&#039;re getting for each form when you&#039;re chaning it a new Profile Art. But now I was wondering if that could be made with Sonas Ultimate Skin (DJ Sona) as well? Since she also is capable of chaning her Forms I&#039;d really appreciate it if Riot would add that little Extra on the Next Patch, because right now her Profile Art only includes the First Form but DOENS&#039;T change when changing your Music and your Form. \r\nFriendly Greetings~ BigMemoire","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-11T20:10:41.780+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"We generally don't go back and make changes for content on live, unless we're talking about a champion update, or a bug. However, I'd be happy to bring this up for discussion. :) As a heads up, this isn't something we'd be able to accomodate for next patch, should it be something we'd like to move forward with (due to getting ready to ship the next patch, and the dev/testing time this would require).","replies":[]}]}
