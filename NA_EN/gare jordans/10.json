I mean you lets take this into perspective. 1000 health  = 25 ap if you use the passive for only health.  You see how stupid that is.

Irelia's stuns easily prevent vlads sustain, and the true damage makes things that much more difficult because vlad's early game is weak. \nCho'gath will easily shut vlad down. Vlad has no percent damage and cho'gath usually gets tanky. Plus a silence, and slow, with true damage ult that goes up to a 1000 true damage. Cho'gath also out sustains Vlad in technicality cause Vlad has cool downs, cho'gath heals on minion death. If Cho'gath were to wait till vlad used q and e then silenced him and slowed. Cho'gath would technically win trades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oliver Trist","date":"2015-07-02T00:34:19.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"err.. as someone who plays Vlad a lot probably the only lanes I find difficult are Chogath/Riven/Swain. Chogath clears the waves too fast and so vlad cant poke him eith his spells. Also chogath has his own sustain so he can really sit in lane practically forever and just keep pushing it up. Swain is strong against him and doesnt go oom so much because of his passive but he pushes slow so if Vlad can push Swain to tower swain will be too busy last hitting creeps to actually go on the aggresive. against riven is the same as going against Jax/Irelia. The lane itself isnt that hard if you sit back and farm up and poke when u can. Vlad can go practically even in any lane when he's played right as I think most champions in this game are able to do","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Player of Games","date":"2015-07-01T22:37:16.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you beat Vlad early, and I mean beat him down good in lane, there's no way he should come back unless YOU let him comeback. As a Vladimir main I played a game recently against a stacked team of Diamonds in teambuilder, their shaco literally camped me for the first 6 minutes of the game. As soon as I got back to lane to CS I was already getting ganked, wound up going 1-5 or something like that, and was set really far behind. Thing is, I roamed botlane, got a double kill, and came back with Ionians+Wota and became really strong.\n\nYou have to understand and respect champions powerspikes, level 9 is a big one for vlad, as well as finishing WOTA and having a good bit of CDR. It doesn't matter if he's already behind you at that point, that is where he gets a NOTICEABLE spike in damage/efficiency, if you don't care to respect that Vlad will always have an easy time bouncing back.\n\nAlso you seem to be complaining a lot about the fact that he gets loads of free health, meanwhile ANY good mage that can utilitze Liandries will dumpster him constantly. Azir does very well against Vladimir. Laning phase is sketchy because with enough MS Vlad can bypass his Q for harass, but after that Azir has enough CDR and damage to put a dent in him. Brand shits on Vlad hands down. Only way Vlad wins is if Brand misses something vital or gets outplayed, even then his passive combined with Liandries (not even including Rylai's) means you only have to hit Conflagrate to do a ton of damage.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to stop and work around Vlad, I will agree though, as a Vlad player he can be very obnoxious especially if he gets ahead in the slightest, but his early game is delicate and you must abuse his cooldown windows before he caps out on CDR. All in him, Vlad loves short trades, you need to be in his face blowing him up whenever possible, do not let the pressure down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2015-07-01T21:45:32.033+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"I can't play Vs a champ so I think they'll nerf him for me.\"\nHe's a bit too strong maybe (I don't know) but it's not like you make it look like","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-07-01T23:04:59.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"weird that i never saw a vlad 1v3 once he had wota. \n\nHec, i didn't even see a vlad 1v3 at full build (when his enemies wasn't behind).","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2015-07-02T04:44:11.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZeusHasRefresher,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZhU5MMVo,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-07-01T23:04:59.940+0000)\n>\n> weird that i never saw a vlad 1v3 once he had wota. \n> \n> Hec, i didn't even see a vlad 1v3 at full build (when his enemies wasn't behind).\n\nWell, if whether we see it or not determines anything, I had a vlad on my team get a pentakill 1v5 a week or 2 ago.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RepubIique","date":"2015-07-02T00:19:51.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't even have to read this.

While true he gets really strong when he gets ahead, theres still a lot of counterplay when going against him. You need to respect him and you need to kite him. tell your support early in the game to get a locket. And abuse the fact that he has no cc. Moreso than most other champs when someone dies to Vlad its the players fault for staying in lane too long for cs and just not respecting Vlads all in. just play around him and respect his powerspike (lv 9.) and you can still win. Also look at the Vlads build. Some players like to go tanky vlad and the damage isn't always there. Others like to go pure ap (as i do) and are always surprised by the damage he dishes out in his full rotation. Basically, look at his items and atttempt to analyze the damage he is capable of. If he's full ap and youre sitting at your tower at half health he is going to dive you","replies":[]},{"poster":"3tyson","date":"2015-07-01T21:13:23.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say kat amumu is more bulshit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-01T20:56:35.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is the problem with several champions right now.
