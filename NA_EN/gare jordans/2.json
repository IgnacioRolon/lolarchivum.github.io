My normals mmr is so much lower than my ranked mmr, the only way the game isn't pretty stompy (at least in lane, and usually the whole game) is if I don't play my favorite champs and play stuff I'm learning or not good at. So for me normals end up not being very competitive because I and everyone I play with just screw around if we're playing normals. I don't have a friend who I've played w/ this season in ranked who will play their ranked mains in normals. I don't know about other people, but for me at least, it's not super fun to go from laning against mid gold players w/ a champ to laning against mid/low bronze players (where my normals mmr is) with the same champ. I get lazy and complacent and there's the risk that will show up in my ranked games so I just don't do it.\n\nAlso, it may be different in bronze (I started the season in bronze but still don't remember it having more rage/trolls than blind pick) but blind pick is definitely more toxic than ranked at high silver/gold level. Yeah you get rage and stuff in ranked, but blind pick is all about \"how fast do you connect and call stuff\" and personally I like having pick order so people (myself included in blind pick) don't just argue about roles.

When he was 4.20 Weedwick, the general practice was farm uninteractively until 6, gank. Repeat until you no longer need ult to win fights.\nComparatively, Vladimir has a steeper learning curve than Warwick (while he's not {{champion:268}} , he's certainly harder to play than {{champion:1}} ) - between managing E stacks, knowing when and how to use your W, and dealing with the early laning and his short-range, high cd Q.\n\nSecondly, Warwick's ease-to-play makes him incredibly accessible as a Champion, meaning that non-Warwick players could easily pick him up during his reign of terror and wreck face, whereas Vladimir's higher difficulty (as well as his much-cited abysmal pre-9 laning) makes him less accessible and thus has a lower chance to be in that bracket of 80-100% of games.\n\nAgain, Vladimir isnt super hard to learn, but he's not as easy as Warwick and thus wouldn't have as much of an impact since not as many people would be willing to play him.\n\nFurthermore, on your opinion of nerf-then-buff - there are inherit problems with that. While on the one hand the example doesnt cause problems by being overpowered and impacting games, we get the dual problem of a) not knowing what about them made them overpowered and b) leaving them (and their playerbase) in the gutter.\nWhy was Warwick strong? The immense synergy of his ult's on-hit and the new Devourer item + red smite, as well as the ease of which he could be played.

Just look at what happened with Warwick when Devour came, he had a 60% win rate and pretty much HAD to be banned or you would basically lose even if the person picking Warwick was bad. Then there was the issue with Sej, already one of the best junglers who then got Cinder and ended up with a high ban rate for a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"JimmyNtheKudos","date":"2015-06-22T22:35:10.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look are WW now thou...

His own personal kit may not have gotten changed in that time, but he is certainly far stronger due to several item and meta changes. All of you people who say \"X hasn't changed since Y time, so they're just as strong.\" are legitimately clueless about how balance works. You're almost as bad as the people who think that win rate means everything/nothing.\n\nVlad isn't broken, I'll give you that, but he is most definitely not the same as what he was last season.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2015-06-22T23:36:02.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People picking champs that can't capitalize on the weaknesses of his early game does not mean the meta made Vlad OP.
