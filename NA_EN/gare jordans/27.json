We just want to help contribute to the team. For the many times we've assisted to you getting kills, or saved your behind in an intense situation, all we want is for you to grow that mutual respect for us. However, such respect we have for you is lost when you tell us how to play our role or blame your failures on us. Therefore, on behalf of all supports, we will now be supporting top lane until you learn to stop abusing our presence. As quoted from a famous song, \"You don't know what you have 'til it's gone.\"\r\n                        Good riddance,\r\n                        Support Mains","replies":[]}
