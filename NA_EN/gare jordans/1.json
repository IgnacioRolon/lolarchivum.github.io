Increase the power of assists.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":51,"down_votes":14,"body":"There are many ways to do this. They seem to all be based on assists. Here are some of my ideas. Feel free to chime in.\n1. Start tracking and announcing assist sprees. Supports, from the opinion of the majority of LoL players, aren't supposed to have any kills. This could really help because it gives supports recognition for not dying, and helping get kills. (EDIT: The main counter-logic used against this idea has been that it would be spammy and annoying to hear after every fight. I never said how many assists in a row you'd need to get an assist spree. I'm not in love with any set number, but if I had to name a number off the top of my head, it'd be around seven assists in a row without dying. That's roughly two team fights worth. If a support can help win about two team fights without dying, that's commendable.)\n2. Start adding Assists where wards were placed, which granted vision of an enemy and led to a kill. Supports are often though of being \"warding mules\". They often are the only one on the team giving vision on the team through wards.\n3. Increase the amount of gold that is given per assist. This would increase the amount of gold income the supports would have, making it easier to get items to help the team. (EDIT: I understand why doing this would be a bad idea. These were just thoughts off the top of my head to kick this discussion off. Riot wants to eliminate snowballing, and these would be counterproductive to that cause.)\n4. Make it so item auras give assists. For example, say a support has a frozen heart. The said support deals no damage in the fight, but slows every enemy's attack speed during the fight with the aura. That support should have received an assist with every enemy that was slain because he directly effected the enemy's fighting potential. (EDIT: Of course, global or passive auras should not be included in this mix.)\n\nEDIT: I'm amending the main post so people reading this get the point of this thread.\nSupports have very few choices of what to do outside of laning phase and even during laning phase their choices are very few. They can't farm, or take kills. They're expected to set their adc up to farm, get kills, and stay alive. During grouping phase every support on low income is expected to ward, keep the carries alive (even all teammates if possible), and set their team up for success by acing the enemy.\n\nIt's very easy to say that supports have the most demanding job while having the least amount of gold to do it. This isn't just an advocacy campaign for more gold income for supports. Sure, it'd be nice, but it may just introduce unwanted mid-laners down there for the gold. \n\nThe real goal here is making supporting seem more appealing, whether that be through announcements of assist sprees or by some other means. *What can we do to get more players interested in learning this role? Is there a way that we can encourage positive development for players trying to learn this role?*","replies":[{"poster":"AhhShucks","date":"2014-10-08T19:42:32.654+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"You get plenty of gold for assists right now. The issue with supports is that in low kill games, or games where you are behind the support falls behind much faster than everyone else. The support can't farm up and play safe, and while everyone else is trying to do that the support is just falling even more behind. They aren't getting minions, they aren't getting gold from harassing, they are spending gold on pinks, and risking death to try and play a vision game to keep their team safe, but they are gaining nothing.\n\nIts not fun spending 15 minutes twideling your thumbs hoping someone else on your team gets strong enough to make the game work. I don't want ways to get more ahead when I'm getting assists and am already ahead. I want something meaningful to do when behind aside from praying for someone else to get strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RoboLions","date":"2014-10-09T18:09:28.309+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"But wait, you forgot to make the case for support being undesirable in its current state!

Also, this season, supports are earning more gold and buying more items than ever before.\n\nI'm not trying to knock your assertion, really I'm trying to understand what it is you want to solve for. It seems you want supports to get more assists and get more recognition for assists. But is that because supports are still gold starved or because supports need higher KDAs to stay satisfied with their role?\n\nWhen we have a better understanding of the problem we can do a better job of working toward the solution :)","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-09T18:31:03.262+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still get treated like absolute shit by a surprising amount of players, you don't get any recognition for your hard work, and most of the stuff you do is functional and boring rather than flashy and awesome-looking (guess why Thresh is so popular no matter how much you nerf him? It's because he does a lot of very flashy things for a support).\n\nSupport mains like myself like the role because we *know* that we're crucial to victory and that we can turn the tides of a teamfight. There's also a special kind of pleasure to be had when you have the \"support Cold War\", as you sabotage and get sabotaged by the enemy support in a quiet little war that nobody else notices. It's this private duel of wits with the enemy support that often decides the outcome of bot lane or a teamfight (or an objective). It's you and them, pitting skill and intelligence against skill and intelligence. It's the Howling Gale against the Zenith Blade, the Dark Binding against the Death Sentence, the warding and dewarding, the Tidal Wave that turns the teamfight.\n\nThe problem is that only support mains see this. And it's not just the players themselves that are clueless, the game itself seems to forget us. We don't get any recognition for the things we are supposed to do (warding, dewarding, assisting). When someone gets a kill, the game proudly announces it. Killing streaks are celebrated by an increasingly awed announcer. When a jungler takes Baron/Dragon, there's a message in the screen and a sound announcement in spectator mode. We don't get any of that.","replies":[{"poster":"Gare Jordans","date":"2014-10-09T19:48:15.799+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read this...And smiled out of respect. You get it.

Its understandable that at higher level play like in diamond and higher the team ends up selling trinkets for oracle trinket later in the stages of the game.

Thanks for stopping by! I had no clue this discussion would become this popular. Now back to the discussion!\n\nI think everyone needs recognition for something they do during a game to stay happy with their job. For instance, (I'm going to use two examples, a real-world application and a LoL one to explain my point.) in the workplace, workers who excel at their respective jobs do get some sort of recognition. There may be that one worker who never uses his sick days. There also may be, possibly at a store, a reward for the worker who sells the most items, or scans the most items within a certain period of time. Being recognized at the workplace isn't something the employer is required to do, but *they want to set the example to the other workers of what other workers should be doing and how it should be done and also encourage positive working habits with the recognized person*.\n\nIn League right now, it's true to say that everyone has their own playstyles. However, supporting doesn't give too many options for playstyles outside of laning phase. *\"Do I pick a poke support or a peel support? Do I play aggressive or passive?\"* And to do a good job outside of laning phase is often times even harder. It's pretty stressful trying to make sure keeping my team alive, warding with little to no vision because it's \"my job\", and making sure we ace the enemy. Supports take a lot of heat. I figure if we're under that much of a microscope we deserve to be recognized for doing well.\n\nWhen I see supports do a great job, the first thought that comes to mind is, \"Hey! This dude deserves some sort of recognition for what he did.\" Then I look, and all I can do is honor him, which has little to no value anymore. Riot, you have a chance to not only encourage support mains who excel at their job to keep up the good work. Not only that, but you can encourage a healthy playstyle with people learning the role through assist auras and assist sprees. That'll lead people truly wanting to learn the role down the right path.","replies":[{"poster":"RoboLions","date":"2014-10-09T20:44:37.384+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is definitely a lack of clarity as far as what measuring stick to use when gauging a support's contribution to the team.

No assist shout-outs for toplaners, midlaners and ADCs. That way, it keeps the audio from getting cluttered.\n* Only count from 3 assists onwards (double assist isn't worth it).\n* Only shout the biggest assist tally. Don't do \"TRIPLE ASSIST! QUADRA ASSIST! **PENTA** ASSIST!\", go straight for the penta. Keeps the audio from getting cluttered.\n* Keep the time window for multi-assists short (around 5-10 seconds), and only do the announcement when the window closes.\n* Always put the assist announcement at the very end of all others, to remind the players who made it happen.

I loved sivir pre-rework, and there were a bunch of people who did. We enjoyed her role as this split pusher who could instantly nuke a wave. However, the majority of the community didn't like her. So there was an obvious disconnect between the people who liked her (or who liked any prerework champion) and the people who didn't.\n\nMaybe you're right and 1/5 people love support and main support.  When I play ranked, people generally don't want to be the support. When I used to play blind pick, that was always the last role chosen, and when I play Teambuilder, we're almost always waiting on a support player, anywhere from 2-10 minutes.  I know personal experience isn't the best tool to use, but from over 1000 games of experience I do think that 2-3/5 players either actively dislike, or simply have no interest in the support role. \n\nI think that's because you don't have as many 'big moments'. As the midlaner or adc you're a carry and you're getting the kills and making plays.  Top laners are very similar, but you also feel powerful and tanky. Junglers get to feel like these predators, cruising the map, sniping off unsuspecting people. \n\nFor the support, you're more behind the scenes. Sometimes you land those clutch tornado's or sona ults, or heal someone and they just barely survive, and they does feel awesome, but for a lot of people that's not enough. For a lot of people seeing your name appear as a tiny assist portrait beside a kill just doesn't feel satisfying enough. \n\nSo I think the idea of assist announcements is a wonderful idea. It highlights your contributions, without having to necessarily buff support gold (and fall back into the mage support meta), and without radically changing things. I personally enjoy the role, but it'd be nice to see others enjoy it too, especially when I want to play a different role and my friends are humming and hawing about who'll take up the mantle of support.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2014-10-09T18:37:26.381+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> But wait, you forgot to make the case for support being undesirable in its current state!

You give us ap utility scaling on our skills but you give us terrible items that gives low AP  (sometimes even none) to scale our utility.  Its not fair that tanky supports like leona, braum and taric have wide variety of items (that also have utility)  to scale from because they either scale from health or resistance stats. Just look at sightstone it only gives health why cant you build an AP sightstone. On top of that if you do want a lot of AP you got to get it from expensive ap items like rabbadon death cap, which takes forever for us to buy due to our small income. Honestly, solo lane of these support can scale their utility better then duo lane support which doesnt make any sense, because they are suppose to have stronger utility which was the whole point of season 4 changes.   Example look at solo lane Lulu who got nerf like crazy.\n\nBut I have to say these support items are not terrible when it comes to utility and their cheap for a support income. I wish their is a way to scale our utility skills (to their maximum late game) but also buy cheap support utility items. Sometime I would go to bot game once a day just so I can buy a lot ap and actually feel what its like to having strong utility, because you cannot build something like that in normal or in rank game.

A well placed Sona ult can be gamechanging, but only if your allies are fed enough to take advantage of the window you provided them.  There's no point in raising Braum's shield up for a 0/12 teammate with pitiful farm.  Force-feeding allies some gold by doing kill-lanes (blitz and thresh for example) are probably the best way to carry, but you can't do that with Soraka.\n\nI don't really have an answer to your question \"why do you want to improve supports, they're fine!\"  \n\nYes, they're fine, but nobody really knows that.  There are endgame stats for damage, kills, assists, and healing, but supports do more than that, and there's no record of it.\n\n- no CC duration stat\n- no shield amount stat\n- no ward stats\n- no buff stat\netc.\n\nFor example, when I use Sona's Q, I have absolutely no idea if I'm even contributing.  Do my allies use the buff?  Nobody knows. Is Janna's AD buff better than Sona's Q or Nami's E?  I want to know these things, but that information is hidden.  Did I ward enough in-game?  Dunno, have to check the website to find out (I like the website in-depth stats btw).  How much damage did I mitigate with Braum's shield?  That's a mystery.\n\nIt's stuff like that that makes me want to play a different role.  \n\nAnother example:  Now that Soraka is healing focused and healing is a visible stat, you can actually see just how much she healed.  Even if you lose, everyone saw her healing 50k; it feels satisfactory as Soraka, and the rest of the team can see your contribution as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2014-10-09T20:27:56.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspect it might have something to do with ingame feedback. \n\nWhen you get a kill, there's an incredible rush, especially if it's from something like a clutch Jayce Q or Darius ult.

Another, slightly iffy case would be if you couldn't quite get to someone in time to get on the kill (spells too short range, on cooldown, or can't auto in time), so you drop a ward as close as possible to get in on the action.\n> \n> Coding wise, vision wouldn't be a nightmare I'd wager, but I can see pros and cons on both sides of it, which would lead to some interesting discussions. \n> \n> Auras that give assists would be the most natural one for it out of that list, I'd wager. Reason being, there is a tangible reason your Corki may have outdueled their Tristana, if you had Zeke's up and giving him that extra life steal/attack damage (hey, it's still an item, and as far as I know, the aura from it doesn't give you an assist no?)\n> \n> While I'm not sure this is the right way to make players want to play Support more, or to try and change them away from the opinion of 'ward mule,' discussions like these are great to have, since they may lead to something striking that does end up as a goal or hope.*\n\nWhat amazes me the most about this argument, and its counter argument, about supports getting extra gold for ward vision / assists, and how that could snowball other laners (which I actually agree with), is the fact that you have the best way to prevent abuse of the system already built into the game. \n\nYou call them \"Masteries\", or specifically the \"Utility\" tree. The last couple points in the utility tree could be vastly improved for supports. 21 points in utlity could = 5% discount at the shop or more gold for an assist. Of course they can't be so strong as to sway people from giving up their 21--0-9, 21-9-0, or 9-21-0, but there are certainly ways to give support's more options / rewarding feelings that I think aren't really being utilized.","replies":[{"poster":"Gare Jordans","date":"2015-03-23T21:05:57.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point.

They seem to all be based on assists. Here are some of my ideas. Feel free to chime in.\n> 1. Start tracking and announcing assist sprees. Supports, from the opinion of the majority of LoL players, aren't supposed to have any kills. This could really help because it gives supports recognition for not dying, and helping get kills.\n> 2. Start adding Assists where wards were placed, which granted vision of an enemy and led to a kill. Supports are often though tof being \"warding mules\". They often are the only one on the team giving vision on the team through wards.\n> 3. Increase the amount of gold that is given per assist. This would increase the amount of gold income the supports would have, making it easier to get items to help the team.\n> 4. Make it so item auras give assists. For example, say a support has a frozen heart. The said support deals no damage in the fight, but slows every enemy's attack speed during the fight with the aura. That support should have received an assist with every enemy that was slain because he directly effected the enemy's fighting potential.\n\n1) This could be problematic, because other players who are often involved in teamfights would get all of this bonus gold as well. This would be more of a buff to players who play with their team and not only supports.\n2) This would be extremely difficult to code and is not necessarily fair; the player may or may not actually use the ward and it could also give too many assists to players who didn't contribute to the fight.\n3) Same problem as #1.\n4) Auras and buffs already give assists.\n\nI do enjoy playing support and the only thing that I would change is the limit on wards.\n\nEDIT: I just realized everything I said had already been brought up and feel entirely useless now.

Most suggestions have been discussed thoroughly, but there are a couple of things I'd like to share from my perspective of playing support:\n\nFor gold, I don't really feel poor as a support (I'll expand on this more below).  I don't think with the current gold flow of the game supports need a higher injection of gold.  Supports don't really have big item thresholds outside of getting that Sightstone and Mikael's usually... so unless the game is a complete stomp or you AFK in base, you'll regularly be completing those items.\n\nThe second point I want to touch on, and it actually expands on the idea of non-reliance on gold, is idea that supports don't get the satisfaction of being a playmaker, or having a significant impact on a fight, being a highlight reel, etc....  This is really interesting because I see a lot of people hate on champions like Thresh and Lulu because their kits are overloaded with utility.\n**UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME**, I would prefer supports to have more kits like Thresh's: make abilities that aren't reliant on raw power/item+gold reliant, and it would probably be more appealing to play support in general because you can have an impact on fights as long as you have good game sense.  For Lulu's case, we can look at her rise in popularity this season in the LCS.  She is appealing as a *solo laner* because she can lane bully and then scale into team fights with utility.  This is especially relevant with the Protect the Tristana comps teams at Worlds are running, because even though she has somewhat diminished lane bully power vs popular picks like Ryze, pros will still pick her for the extra protection.  What's funny is that she has that same amount of power in the support role... but hey she can farm as a solo laner and clear waves, so you simply add more protection by putting another champion like Janna in the support.  I think at Worlds there was a TSM game where Dyrus was far behind and had a lot of deaths, yet still fit into his team's game plan late game with only a few AP items in hand. That's why I think Lulu is a great champion for support: effective without an ideal gold/stat line.\nEven without an overloaded utility kit, champions with some level of utility and minimal item reliance are pretty good at support.  Zyra for example: all I need is Liandry's and Sightstone, and I can peel, ward, and do the most damage to champions at the end of a game.  I'd also recommend Syndra support ;)\nSupport item builds also play a huge role in having significant impact in fights, and you don't need an entire pack of them to be useful late game. Just by themselves: Mikael's is super valuable, and I've had several cleanses that made the difference of us winning the game or throwing it because our carry got caught with a snare.  Locket for the shield/aura, Randuin's for the slow (and being tanky as a support is amazing), Twin Shadows for mobility, slow, and an easy way to pop Banshee Veil's shield.  Even Banner of Command is great for 20% CDR, and nobody suspects the split pushing super minion!\nI actually think a very appealing part of support is not having to worry (too much) about builds or farming, and just making plays and enabling your team to do cool things around the map (I think taking a tower for free is cool).\n\nAssist announcements sound cool, but they'd probably have to have higher thresholds than kills to avoid spam/clutter.

One of the reasons I generally stand opposed to the forced AP scaling of traditionally non-scaling facets of abilities (AP increasing Lulu's movespeed boost and things like that), is that supports as a whole should have both the lowest gold reliance and lowest gold scaling among the roles (with carries being the opposite, needing purchased stats and having the tools necessary to multiply their effectiveness greatly, usually seen as steroids--hence why the support/carry combo is the most optimal lane income-wise). \n\nSupports in general should be defined by abilities with high base impact (Thresh's hook and Morgana's snare are scary regardless of whether you have 0 AP or 300), that retain relevance throughout the game and scale primarily off of %CDR, which tends to be a core stat on many support items. Sticking to this sort of design philosophy with supports is a pretty straightforward way of making playing a support feel gratified, without having to pile on more gold or items onto them.

It should of been a cheap stat that support can afford and usually found on a support items.\n\nAlso going back to your point, if they were to remove the ability power utility scaling they would have to remove braum, leona and taric health and resistance scaling which will cause them to be less tanky or have lower damage.","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2014-10-10T14:41:39.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding utility supports not scaling into the lategame through damage or durability, that is mostly due to them primarily scaling through utility--and ideally, utility that requires no additional income to make worthwhile (whereas Lulu's movespeed boost, for example, is noticeably less powerful without AP). I agree with you in that AP (an offense-scaling stat, and thus one of the more expensive ones) should not be the primary source of a utility support's scaling into lategame, due to the pricetag associated with it and the minimal income of the average support. You suggest that perhaps another scaling stat be found for this purpose, and I maintain that cooldown reduction is that stat--as it directly improves that utility by increasing its uptime. It also happens that this stat tends to be found on many durability-centric items (Frozen Heart, Face of the Mountain) and utility-centric items (Talisman of Ascension, Twin Shadows), leaving two primary paths for utility supports: durability for longer uptime within fights, or largely improved utility. \n\nAlso, I'm not really sure how you reached the conclusion that melee support defensive stat scaling would have to be removed if ranged support offensive stat scaling on traditionally non-scaling utility is removed, since A) those values are allowed to be much lower on offensive abilities (eg. Braum's Q) due to already serving a purpose by directly increasing survivability, B) those champions will end up buying those stats anyway, since they generally need to put themselves in harm's way to be effective and the scaling either acts as a defensive steroid (Leona) or to prevent the champion from being able to deal damage on top of having access to everything else on their kit (Braum), and C) these champions also have no scaling on their utility (you can't increase the duration of any of their CC etc.) so the two examples aren't really comparable. \n\nOne of the only reasons that support scaling and itemization hasn't fallen completely on its head is due to the sheer amount of gold that was thrown at supports in S4, which is partially why you can send Annie or Morgana or Zyra or any other mage that is outclassed by other mages (and some that aren't) down bot with your ADC and end up with both a competent support earlygame and a second mage lategame. This is partially a problem with support item design (without those items fitting a pattern of being very gold efficient but equally slot inefficient, you'd have supports struggling to get items without all of the extra gold they currently find themselves with) and support kit design (many of the older supports save for maybe Janna and the new Soraka tend to be outclassed by newer supports due to not being specialists and adhering to relics of design, such as Taric having a click-stun instead of something with more power and counterplay).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2014-10-09T14:28:54.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two ways to implement this:\n\n1) Make a mastery that grants gold for ward assists, or aura assists, or extra gold for assist streaks (whichever you prefer).

Giving supports more gold is going to increase the selection of non-traditional support champions, as it enables the use of champions who don't function well without gold.\n\nIf you did want to do this, however, I really like the idea of tying it to incentivizing players to ward.  Riot likes to talk about \"hidden power\", and seems to not be a fan of it (see, e.g., treatment of auras).  Well wards, although ironically granting vision, are in some ways semi-hidden power, in that they collectively provide a benefit far greater than what is traditionally perceived at lower ELOs.  This is why competitive play involves running around sweeping while the map is largely dark in bronze solo queue.\n\nI believe that at certain ELOs (around the silver/gold level), taking away the ability to place unlimited wards even if compensated with slightly more gold actually negatively impacted a support's ability to impact games.  That is, last season's preseason changes aimed at increasing people's willingness to play support simultaneously in some ways made it more frustrating to play support.\n\nAccordingly, I like the idea of incentivizing players to ward.  Rather than having a separate gold generation item and a separate warding item, why not have a sightstone provide x gold per ten seconds when you have at least one ward out.  Its effect could be disabled for x seconds when you kill a minion/monster.  I suspect supports at low ELO would buy a sightstone sooner and make sure to have their wards out.
