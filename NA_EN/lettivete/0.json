The decision will be made on the 1st of Jan 2016 at 11.00 am UTC.  However,  the candidates are  : CS:GO, DOTA 2, Hearthstone, WoT and League of legends. Can LoL beat all these games and actually win the quota or does CS:GO has more chances of winning that ?","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-12-29T05:42:45.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, they could include all of them. \n\nMaybe I'd actually pay attention to the Winter Olympics then.
