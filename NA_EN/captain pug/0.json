I'm a Top and Support main. I find Gnar pretty fun and good at playmaking but I also like Braum as a support since everyone loves who when you shield them from a global ult. And then Rek'sai, I find him very good at jungling but I also like the AP Rek'sai sniper (can someone confirm if Riot is really gonna change her 100% AP ratio for her Q intp a 70% ratio?).","replies":[{"poster":"EchorimTV","date":"2015-05-20T10:04:29.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get Baum{{champion:201}}  Hes op and good at saving w and e combo :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zense","date":"2014-12-27T15:45:18.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say Braum, I have Gnar and he is fun but he is just kind of hard to use because of his fury to manage.

I have all three and have played Rek more since her release than any of them and I support more than any other role, but Rek has really gotten me into playing the jungle which isn't a role I played/enjoyed before. She also does well top lane. \n\nGnar is very strong and fun top lane, and Braum does really well with his kit as a support tank. \n\nIf you can't decide, def look up some gameplay vids, but I would definitely chose Rek'sai based on my games with her.","replies":[]}]}
