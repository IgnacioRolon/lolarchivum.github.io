So, if your friend refunded the purchase, the content would be removed from your account, since it wasn't actually purchased.\n\nIf you believe that content you have received on your account has gone missing and is not due to this, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  We can look into your account and investigate further!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-06-03T05:23:53.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"umm, check and see if you accidentally somehow refunded her, and yh Lumiva is right, ur more likely to get faster assistance with a support ticket being filed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lumiva","date":"2017-06-03T05:23:01.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"instead of putting this in bugs try filling out an actual support ticket so you don't have to hope a rioter sees this","replies":[]}]}
