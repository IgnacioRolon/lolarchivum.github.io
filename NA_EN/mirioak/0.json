Some girls dance on poles. Its a legal profession which they chose and get paid for and now it is a popular exercise program as well. I don't think that the animation was offensive. As it was depicting a legal and normal activity. I feel that if I want to buy the skin and express my femininity by dancing on a pole i should be able to do so.  \r\n\r\nI realize that some people may not be so fond of the animation, and so all i propose (and beg for) is a simple check box accompanying the skin allowing you to select whether or not you'd like to dance on a pole.  \r\n\r\nMerry Snowdown!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2014-12-20T19:07:58.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":30,"body":"\"First, I'd like to say that I'm a female gamer and doctor.\"\n\"female gamer\"\n**Female gamer**\nnothing to see here folks","replies":[{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2014-12-20T19:09:37.635+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, they probably just mentioned that as a matter of perspective because people tend to assume if you're a male saying something of this nature you're a sexist pig.","replies":[{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2014-12-20T19:19:43.794+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ginnjii,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=AlT36nBT,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2014-12-20T19:09:37.635+0000)\n>\n> To be fair, they probably just mentioned that as a matter of perspective because people tend to assume if you're a male saying something of this nature you're a sexist pig.\n\nsexist means you hate the opposite gender, and i really don't think anyone would really care if it was a  guy saying this, most agree that the pole dancing animation shouldn't of been taking away.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmurGIqiPgg\n\non a serious note, i think this also has to do with graves cigar getting removed because it promoted tobacco usage. as you can see at the very beginning of rek'sai trailer. i think the pole dancing was removed because riot found it to suggestive for the T esbr rating.","replies":[{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2014-12-20T19:24:26.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, and people shouldn't care, but some do so what I was saying was that, that might be why they said what they said.

Out of the last 5 female champions that have been released we have; a scary void creature who is female in name alone (i.e. no sexual characteristics whatsoever) {{champion:421}} , a lich who's only sexy if you enjoy claws and necrophilia {{champion:429}}, a flat chested albino who's batshit crazy, and the only thing remotely sexualizing her is her combat bikini {{champion:222}}, an ice witch who's human characteristics are marred by being mostly ice {{champion:127}}, and an extremely conservatively dressed, yet beautiful girl who has a fondness for birds and knock-knock jokes {{champion:133}}.

Yes having large breasts does not mean sexualized. However the way that riot creates its champions is that most female champs are sexualized. To a extent this makes sense because the people who would actually be fighting in league would be the top of their class and this is reflected by male and female champs. However that doesn't mean every champ has to be sexualized and I personally would enjoy more monster champs for one and more quirky champs like Gragas and hiemer. As far as I am concerned you do not have to be athletic and a Olympic athlete to be in the league and we should have that reflected with more quirky and monsters. Rek'sai is a great addition and love her and would love to see more like her. \n\nAlso a complaint that I think is fair is that when you look at the art of most of the female champs in league you will see that most you will know they have breasts because of the way the art is done. This bothers me because it makes the art samey and kind of makes me feel like it is lazy. Here is what I mean. In {{champion:131}} splash [(http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-vVitMqWQDc/maxresdefault.jpg)] you will notice that the armor she wears doesn't push boobs into your face but everything down to the high heels screams that she is a woman. A very sexy woman. Now compare that to {{champion:89}} or {{champion:10}} who are both armored females but instead of armor that accents their character or their abilities we get armor that goes out of its way to show you just how big their boobs are. [(http://i.ytimg.com/vi/q4clnpomEwo/maxresdefault.jpg)] or [(http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TA9OyOPfy1I/VDwpOe6TikI/AAAAAAAAbJ8/a5CY8Pd7f4o/s1600/Kayle_Splash_0.jpg)]. Now their is a place for this type of stuff but that is primarily what Riot has put forward up to date and like I said before that makes it seem samey in terms of splashes. I think they should find more ways to accent the character not the boobs in both art and animation another example I think is good is aether wing kayle. [(http://img1.leaguecraft.com/lol-splash-art/asset/wallpaper_760px_7652.jpg)] again you can tell she is a sexy woman but it isn't necessarily because of boobs like in the other splash art. The complaint of over sexualizing females can get a bit stale and old but Riot time and time again can get stuck in their ways on how they think art should be done which isn't necessarily the best. Look at all the action poses that came out recently. Would it benefit, say heimer, to have a action pose? Or would it do him more justice to have say a pose that shows off how smart he is? Same with animation? Does the recall match the character or in this case, does the recall match the theme of the skin? In the case of snow down kat I think the recall totally does match the theme of the skin and should have been left.\n\nI know this is a bit ranty but hopefully it helps you understand why some people have a problem with stuff like this.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2014-12-20T20:18:36.295+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"katarina poll dancing?\nI don't remember that.\nI remember nidalee doing that.\n\nI thought kat did a dance based on a song..or some famous person..will smith? idk\noh wait\nmaybe the christmas kat skin did do that.\nI never bought that one.\nI've had kitty kat since release.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-12-20T22:32:08.105+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was on Slay Belle Katarina's recall.
