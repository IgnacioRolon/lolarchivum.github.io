Then when your the only human player on your team and you let the other team push to win so you can get out of this hell then riot punishes you with a afk charge.  What the hell is that Riot? you expect the only human player to come out and try hard 1v5 the whole game and just end up feeding?  You going to punish for feeding then too?  What a piece of crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Harvey Rabbit","date":"2016-09-03T00:39:15.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, that sucks. Well trying your best in 1 v 5 can be a good training exercise, even though it's very frustrating.\n\nIt's not Riot that puts the bots in the game, Riot just doesn't do very much to prevent the people who do.","replies":[{"poster":"imaBamfmf","date":"2016-09-03T23:21:00.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, well riot needs to do something because I hold the wallet and next time one of my 3 kids asks for money to buy skins the answer is going to be no.  I think the only way to get riot to do anything is hit them where it hurts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-03T00:41:07.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider this. 1v5 skills will help you when you try ranked and the other 4 HUMANS on your team are feeding. :)","replies":[]}]}
