I'm tired of being only human on my team and if I want to sit aside and let other team push and win riot punishes me with afk warning or 5 long wait times for leaving/afk.  Riot needs to fix this shit.  I end up with same bots all day long but I get the punishment? FFS i'm boycotting spending any money and I urge you to as well.  The only way to get riot to do something is hit them where it hurts.","replies":[{"poster":"Treeofwar","date":"2016-09-03T23:57:06.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"your level 10 there are leveling bots but if you play pvp like a real player then you will find real players imagin that.

Lol, what.\n\nNobody is going to boycott anything because you are bad and get destroyed by better players. Maybe just accept they are better than you instead of trying to blame it on hacking. \nLeague is not hackable in a game-exploitation sense, everything is server-side. Even if it was, it would do no good. a computer cannot play league anywhere near as well as a decent real player, there is no possible aimbotting or ways to micro input effectively.\n\nMaybe find a game more suited to your age range.","replies":[{"poster":"imaBamfmf","date":"2016-09-04T00:01:13.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-04T01:18:54.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=imaBamfmf,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Eex1X4s0,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-09-04T00:01:13.530+0000)\n>\n> Not talking about hacking and being good retard, i&#x27;m talking about the same 3-4 bots running the same script in the game and they just go stand in the exact same spot not dodging a damn thing and all end up 0/16 in aram.
