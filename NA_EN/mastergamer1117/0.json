That said, we can agree with wanting to spice things up a bit with a random selection; that's what ARAM is for! If you want it specifically for Draft though, you might need to wait for another rotating game mode where your Champion is chosen for you, like Nemesis Draft.\n\nYou could suggest a feature similar to your idea in the [**gameplay channel**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) though to discuss with others. Maybe something like a random button for a select pool of Champions depending on your role in Normal games? That could be cool! :)","replies":[]}]}
