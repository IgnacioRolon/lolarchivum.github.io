However, there are a lot of ports that needs to be opened for the client to work properly, so the easy solution is to set up your PC as a DMZ on the router.\nA DMZ means that the computer will not be protected by the firewalls of the router, which puts your computer at risk, so keep that in mind.\n\nFirst, you need to know what is the IP address of your computer. You can find out by opening CMD and typing \"ifconfig\". It will show you something like \"192.168.8.15\". That is your computer's IP inside your home network. Do not go to google and type \"what is my ip\" because that will give you the external IP of your home, and not the internal IP of your computer inside your home network.\n\nAfter getting your computer's IP, go into your router's settings and find a setting named DMZ or DMZ server, and put your computer's IP there.\nENJOY.\n\nP.S.\nEvery time you restart your router, your computer gets a different IP address, so you can either set a static IP address to your computer via the network settings in the computer itself, or via DHCP reservation in your router.","replies":[{"poster":"Royal Vlad","date":"2017-12-01T21:45:15.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks!!!! suffered for long monthes from this annoying thing. your solution was the only one worked!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-03T03:45:16.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This specific message crops up if your connection to our platform services is *poor or unstable*.

This as been going on since the launch of the new client and drives us all insane. because of that i got into lower priority Q and every time i wanna play a game, it does it again. kicks me out of the Q and the count down of the lower priority never went down because if didn't put me in a game to begin with, and it's even worse when i wanna play with friends because it wont let them play as well,meaning so i wont ruin it to them, they play and i'm the one who taking the leave. thanks to a friend of mine i got rid of it, he played on my account on his PC and it didn't happen to him, MEANING it has to do something with our IP of our PC and not the client. please look into the matter, i would LOVE if i can play normally again and not just ARAM just cuz the Q time is lower and faster to find a game.
