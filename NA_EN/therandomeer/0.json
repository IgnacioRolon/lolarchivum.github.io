Going forward about a month, I went to go pick the ward for a game and it was gone. Figured it was just a Riot problem, sent a request, but it hasn't come back yet. I was told by Support user Legendary to submit a Recovery ticket and waited, but to no avail. I did some digging today and found that not only were all three items supposedly refunded (with me missing the 2,365 RP it cost), but that my account gifted skins to another player (Mecha Malphite and Headhunter Caitlyn) that was on my friend's list that I don't remember putting there, nor have I talked to them. I will include a Summoner Name if necessary to prove my point.\r\n\r\nI have updated my Recovery ticket with this news but it has been three days and no one has even commented on it to say it has been seen. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to fix this? I changed the password on my account, and I only access it from the laptop I am using now, through Steam client (so I can voice chat with my friends in a game)\r\n\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T20:04:10.372+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We want to help you out with this and find out what happened, so the specialist in your initial ticket wanted to get you prepared for our account team to take a look.
