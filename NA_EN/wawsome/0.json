Then it goes black, the mouse moves but I can't do anything. Thought I can still hear my music from the web browser and I am forced to just turn my computer off after like 15 min. Then i log back into the launcher later and just get leave busted, this is really annoying any ideas on how not to get leave busted on this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T00:27:52.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to make sure you don't get any more leaverbuster punishments for those disconnections is to first take a step back and address those crashes before you queue up for another match. \n\nSince it seems like your pc is running into some rough spots with League open, there might be some sort of bad interaction between League and your software.
