First of all, he is very strong at the moment and I mean too strong. I&#039;ve started playing some games of ranked as season 7 started. In 2 of my games I&#039;ve played, the other team had Garen and though we were winning in kills, dragons/barons, and towers, he just turned the whole game around. In one game, he was against a Darius top and our Darius got extremely fed upon him. Even though Garen had a bad creep score and kda, in the late game he managed to build a few tank items. When we fought in 5 v 5s, he basically was what I&#039;ll describe as the most unbreakable boulder that could kill anyone. Also, in lane, Garen has no second bar so he can spam anything without worrying about mana or energy to regenerate along with a passive that has free health regen if doesn't take damage. It amazed me how a Garen that wasn&#039;t fed whatsoever could change a whole game around. I think he needs a nerf or at least a little changes in his kit. \n\nGood Luck On The Rift, \nIlegit321{{champion:86}} &lt;----- BROKEN","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-31T04:57:47.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Garen was just minorly buffed due to him being absolutely useless.\n\nLowELOProblems.

Today I was against another Garen, he wasn't fed at all, but all of a sudden he did random damage out of no where. When your doing 5 v 5s, and the other team has a Garen, it's just difficult. If they have an adc which you must kill and a Garen, the Garen puts out way too much damage and is so tanky you can't even kill him. What I mean is Garen is a champion which you must kill in 5 v 5s, but its VERY hard to kill him. I mean you usually can't even kill him if everyone goes for him. If you manage to kill him, you have their whole rest of their team to kill and your probably already damaged from Garen, so i doubt you'll be able to ace or even get some good kills. Just admit Garen is very broken, some people agree and even the Garen I was against said, \"I'm only playing Garen to get out of bronze because he's a better champion to boost with than Tryndamere.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-12-31T04:44:23.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Outdated kit with limited options and limited counterplay, very linear, unstoppable when ahead otherwise worthless.
