So I've been haunted that I couldn't use my favourite sivir skin anymore and then I got the aatrox skin that I will never use even if I did know how to play top. \r\n\r\nEnough about my problems, I think its a good idea for Riot to enable players to swap the victorious skins that they get each season for the ones that they actually want. i.e. mid main swapping the sivir skin for the ori skin and etc. What do you guys think? I think its a solid idea","replies":[]}
