So I panicked and downloaded the Hextech repair tool immediately. I checked the reinstall option with a different region (because I can't see the region I'm currently in). But after the new client got up and ran perfectly I saw it downloading the whole game all over again and I thought I could just copy the other game files from the different region and skip the download process. I have also repaired the other game client so now I have two clients in one computer. So is it possible to just copy the game files from one folder to another or there are some files which are region-specific? Thank you in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-08T22:11:08.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a client for Garena or an unsupported region, keep in mind it's not compatible with Riot supported regions and won't allow you to connect.  aving 2 different client's is really weird, though.  You'll want to keep one saved to your primary internal drive.\n\nThe NA client supports NA, EU, OCE, and other Riot supported regions so you should be okay using the HRT regardless.  Once complete, you can make sure you're on the correct region on the login screen, with a field just below where you input your credentials.  You might get a small patch to connect you to the specified region, and you're set!

My previous region was the Philippines btw and I didn't see it in the HRT. But thank you for clearing that up.","replies":[]}]}]}
