The first time not opening upon the start of the game, and the second time completely shutting down my computer, and somehow this disconnect during champion select lead to a game starting up and this lead to me getting game restarts twice. It is not fair that I am being punished for this bug, and if somehow this is related to my hardware it does not make sense as i have used this laptop to play League of Legends for 2 years and it has not crashed prior to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-03T03:25:52.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you give me a few more details as to what happened during these incidents?
