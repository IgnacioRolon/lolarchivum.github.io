For the moment it requires coordination, it could be hard to fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Archadria","date":"2015-01-18T04:30:11.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do believe you could add an easy tag such as\nTarget:Champion=Yes(else:handle=false)\n\nLike i said in posts before It has been awhile since I touched a code system and my last was a heavily modified C# var","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-01-18T02:21:57.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any possibility we could get this kind of thing documented on the Service Status page, so we can see it in client?\n\nMaybe this bug isn't worth disabling Kalista for, but I think Kalista players would like to know that she's bugged before they head into game with her (especially ranked).","replies":[]},{"poster":"KlaverKlave","date":"2015-01-17T19:44:53.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where can we check to see if this is fixed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"googly4646","date":"2015-01-17T08:31:57.099+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks dude, pleased to know it is not a ninja nerf :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Care Bear","date":"2015-01-17T16:40:22.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This response literally made my entire day, thanks for the update :).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Effly","date":"2015-01-21T21:26:01.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"SO.
