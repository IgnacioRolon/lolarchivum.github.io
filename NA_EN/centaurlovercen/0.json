He's got an empowered auto every 10 seconds, god-tier poke if you know how to hit his Q, CC with his W and kind of with his E, and if you trade with the enemy laners and they just barely survive, you can ult them to finish the job. Not to mention the fact that it's much easier to win lane through satcheling the tower if your ADC doesn't mind sharing the first tower XP.\n\n{{champion:63}} Same reason as Ziggs, he's a fun AP support.
