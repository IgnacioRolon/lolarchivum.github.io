You have Vayne classified the same as Caitlyn and Ashe classified the same as Miss Fortune and Lucian and it is very clear that they operate differently. Thinking about the windows of power in lane phase, ability to scale into lategame, key item/stat purchases (such as prioritizing Armor pen and CDR over AS and Crit), ability to eliminate structures (as opposed to eliminating champions), the ways they interact with or depend on teammates, and the very simple consideration of \"how do I play this champion?\", it is clear that needs to be more separation.\n\nI think that by not separating Marksmen more thoroughly, this is leading to poor balance decisions being brought to the live server. The lack of separation in the Marksman class is leading to less focus on the itemization, playstyles, windows of power and overall team functionality of different kinds of Marksmen. Instead, I see that the balance team is focusing on champions uniquely in a vacuum - this type of focus is what leads to over/underpowering champions through balance changes once their ecosystem is disturbed. I think that the problem with Lucian on live right now isn't just a Lucian problem, but a problem with the entire \"subclass\" that can use Ghostblade and Black Cleaver - Lucian synergizes the best with the build, yes, but the problem is that the marksmen that can use those items are rising in power (MF, Draven and Twitch) and they are essentially using items that were not designed for their class. Save for Caitlyn and Ezreal, many marksmen cannot compete in botlane with the raw power of the Ghost-Cleaver champions. While I encourage using unique builds and using champions in unique ways, I think it's very telling if lots of champions in one subclass begin using items targeted at a different subclass and begin trending higher than they should be (think Spirit of the Elder Lizard Ezreal). However, this analysis is muddied when there is not enough separation between subclasses of Marksmen.\n\nBy separating Marksmen more thoroughly, more analysis can be done towards how subclasses interact with the game, how problems form and how they can be solved, but as long as Lucian and Ezreal are considered entirely on par with Kog'Maw and Vayne, there will be missteps in balancing the entire class (and honestly, the entire Botlane).\n\nthoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"ricklessabandon","date":"2016-06-02T02:26:10.356+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"speaking from the perspective of someone that works on patch-to-patch balance, we definitely don't view all marksmen as belonging to a single bucketâ€”for the past several years at least we've weighed marksmen against a collection of attributes (e.g., power curves, team reliance, 1v1 potential, utility, etc) and used those assessments as tools to try to keep marksmen feeling unique. that's part of why sivir, vayne, and varus (for example) have still felt very different from each other over the years.\n\njust because they don't have unique labels doesn't mean we won't think of them as having very different functions beyond being able to answer \"why do we have a marksmen on our team?\" at a very basic level.","replies":[{"poster":"Cpt Shaq Sparrow","date":"2016-06-02T06:39:20.096+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true, I didn't mean to imply that the balance team thought that they could just be swapped in and out for each teamcomp or that they aren't unique. As far as I can tell, the entire point of this particular project is to separate champions into classes based on criteria that define their playstyles while still acknowledging their unique characteristics and identities, and to give this information to the balance teams and Champ Update teams so that they can more clearly identify where each champion should fit into the grand scheme of LoL.\n\nHowever, Marksmen are the only class that not only don't have separate subclasses - this worries me because not only do they generally occupy an entire Champ Select role in the Bot selection (unless you're a premade of some sort running something silly) but they have for many seasons been dealing with the problem of the old Renekton bar (currently the Lucian bar). In addition, it seems that the balance team has often not always had the greatest answers for creating a healthier marksman experience (I'm thinking way back to when old S2 when Bloodthirster rush was the hands-down best build, and you basically played a BT-rush champ or suffered until the BT nerf came through, through the period a year or so back when IE rush was the hands-down best build, all the way to two months ago when new Rageblade was broken and today where it seems that Ghostblade is the new hands-down best build).\n\nI know there are a lot of moving parts to botlane balance and it's a different topic from the one in this thread, but the reason I brought it up is that I feel like a clear, acknowledged distinction between marksmen can at the very least assist the balance team in identifying problems in the ecosystem. I worry that perhaps instead of considering \"Are auto-attack based Marksmen underperforming?\" you will consider \"Are Marksmen underperforming?\" and get an incomplete picture. Bot is often considered a homogenous entity by players that don't understand it, and I don't want to feel like Riot sees it that way as well.\n\nI'm just kind of confused that the separations between Lux and Zyra are clear but the separations between Tristana/Kog'Maw and Lucian/Miss Fortune aren't. To me they're very clear, and every Ashe Tristana Kog player could tell you right now on patch 6.10 that they are very clear. I could easily separate the groups and list out what I feel are defining criteria for two different subclasses of Marksmen. I come here from ranked where Lucian is everywhere with an incredibly stupid powerspike riding on the back of a Ghostblade-Cleaver build that he can abuse to the fullest, come into this thread and see that the literal _official_ list doesn't even think he occupies a different class of champion than Kog'Maw. Nerfs to Lucian are a band-aid to the actual problem, because another will just rise in its place (depending on how hard the nerfs hit, it'll either remain Lucian or turn into MF/Ezreal). It just makes me feel like the mark for botlane health, diversity, and balance won't be hit for a long time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2016-06-01T21:10:07.851+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unique Playstyles\nAKA: We don't really know what to do with them","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2016-06-01T21:12:23.605+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":4,"body":"AKA: we can't contain the amount of awesome in these champs.  \"you do you fiddlesticks\"","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-06-01T21:23:48.916+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't Cho a battlemage/warden?

Maybe I'm wrong here.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2016-06-02T01:01:00.566+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of Rek'Sai... A while back somebody (I think it was Meddler but maybe somebody else) mentioned that you guys would be taking a look at some tweaks for her because she has satisfaction problems. Any word on that? It was quite a long time ago so I'm assuming it's been shelved, which is really disappointing. Rek'Sai isn't a weak champion, but she definitely FEELS weak.\n\nSince she was originally designed to be a skirmisher, most of her abilities are designed around doing damage and nothing else, but because she's now balanced around being a tank yet lacks any built-in survivability, she's unable to build any damage items or else she just gets blown up without accomplishing anything. This makes it so that using Q and E just feels BAD, especially late game when her base damage is too low to accomplish anything. She's basically reduced to being a knock up bot because her damage is so low. And since the only thing of relevance she can do is her knock up, it means going down and back up too frequently to build her rage, completely invalidating the resource she's supposed to be trying to manage. So, yes, her ult and knock up and vision are all unique and cool and powerful, but she **feels terrible**.\n\nI'd really like to see something done with her, anything, whether it be tweaks to push her back in a skirmisher direction, or tweaks to make her skills something more fitting for a tank, just something, anything to make her more satisfying to play as. She's one of only two champs I have mastery level 5 with because I used to love playing her so much but nowadays it's just too unenjoyable.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
