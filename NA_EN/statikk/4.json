I'm a designer on the live gameplay & balance team, but in the past I've also handled reworks for {{champion:15}} , {{champion:28}}  and{{champion:38}} . These days I'm focused mostly on the changes we make to the live game, so whether youâ€™re wondering how champs are picked for modifications or you want to talk about recent changes we've made (or haven't made), feel free to ask here. \n\nEdit: The Q&A is now over. Thanks for the questions everyone!\n\n-Statikk","replies":[{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2014-07-18T22:44:29.911+0000","up_votes":269,"down_votes":26,"body":"\"Oldschool\" mages such as {{champion:63}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:112}}  or even the newest {{champion:161}} are pretty much nonexistent in middle lane, especially in competitve play. This has been the issue for ***years***. Is there anything you guys are willing to do about that?\n\n---\n\n**EDIT: It's not about what the current meta favours.** Ziggs, Lux and Xerath, for example, are just as skillshot based as the ones on my list, but have absurdly high range and utility (stun/snare/Satchel Charge, AoE slow) that works *okay*, and therefore can surface again from time to time. Xerath is already frequent in EU LCS, and NA will quickly catch on.\n\nBrand, Malzahar and Cassiopeia are season 1 mages. Let me list the midlaners released after Brand: {{champion:91}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:157}} . Every single one of them but Viktor (who joined  the \"bad mages\" club) either shits on combo mages like Brand and Cassiopeia in lane (just look at their mobility), roams better, picks people off better or outranges the \"old squad\".\n\nIt's not like S1 mages have a low winrate - their raw damage is quite high - but at competitive levels of play, they are outclassed by everyone else. The point is that **when a champion is so reliant on hitting their skillshots and has no mobility, all the initiative is given to the enemy** who then can make the \"flashy plays\". In coordinated teams it's even easier to break the channeled ultimates (Malazhar, Vel'Koz) or spread out in a way to deny AoE ultimates (Brand, Galio). And it takes only one good play (Zhonya, Flash, Fizz trollpole, Windwall, Braum's Unbreakable, the list goes on) to break the whole Pyroclasm chain.\n\nSuggestion: All the popular mages build the holy trinity of midlane items: {{item:3174}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} , while the \"oldschool\" mages, especially Cassiopeia, Malzahar and Brand, make a great use of Liandrylai {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} combo. The problem is that Liandrylai provides zero mana regen and way too much health (800 HP, 130 AP). Maybe reworking those two items could be the way to broaden up the midlane champion pool? Rylai could have a tier 2 component with its passive, a 1800 g blasting wand + sapphire crystal item. Or even blasting wand + chalice. Crystal Maiden (Rylai from Dota) has mana regeneration in her kit as well as slows ;)\n\n---\n\nOldschool mages are getting screwed over by the mobility creep. **New champions have the tools to outplay the old ones, but old champions don't have the tools to outplay the  new ones.** I wonder if there is any way to give the oldschool mages their own niche?","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2014-07-21T20:00:03.339+0000","up_votes":84,"down_votes":5,"body":"This is definitely an issue that we have struggled with a lot internally. We call this class of characters the \"Immobile Mid-Lane Mages\" and I 100% agree with your identification and breakdown of the problem.\n\nI'm definitely on the same page with you when you say Mobility Creep is one of the largest contributors to this. As we've added more and more mobility to the champions in our game (for good reasons - mobile champions are really fun to play, create a lot of \"outplay\" moments, etc.), the Immobile Mid Mages have fallen off especially in the competitive scene. \n\nThe bottom line is that we have done a poor job of valuing Mobility as it relates to the amount of power it gives to a champion's kit. Champions with high mobility need to be paying a larger cost for having that strength, and this is obvious with examples like Kassadin, LeBlanc, or Lee Sin. Mobility is actually a tool that scales extremely well with player skill, pros are able to exploit both the strategic map mobility and tactical in-combat mobility to its fullest extent.\n\nAs far as itemization goes, I know the Systems team is looking into different the lesser used items such as Rylai's. The lack of Mana Regen in the Rylai's  + Liandry's combo is interesting (I believe most stack a few Doran's Rings to try to get around this), but overall I think it might be pointing out a larger issue in our game which is our ever-growing pool of Resourceless champions and how we have maybe warped the game to allow Mana users to compete with the resourceless guys over time. A big example of this is how strong Athene's is at the moment. When you look at the item objectively, Athene's is pretty insane in terms of gold-efficiency, but this leads to a scenario where the only mages that are viable are the ones who can leverage Athene's effectively. This is something I'll definitely bring up to the other guys on the team to see if this is another avenue we can help attack the problem.\n\nOverall, I don't think there's an easy fix to this problem. I think we'll have to do a lot of systematic changes to the game in order to get Immobile Mid Lane Mages back into the game in a healthy way, but it's something definitely on our radar (just not right at this moment since we are prepping for Worlds).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gartoz","date":"2014-07-19T00:14:57.180+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":28,"body":"I agree with this entirely, for many of these champs have little options when jumped on. \n\n{{champion:161}} Seems to have been designed to be able to knock back melee champions that jump on him, and follow up with a Q to slow them, however {{champion:161}} 's knock back isint enough if {{champion:161}}  is slower, slowed, or the enemy has a low cool down on his gap closer. Make no mistake, {{champion:161}} is great at kiting, but olny if his enemies are already at a distance.\n\n {{champion:63}} has a stun that he can theoretically use to escape bad situations, however it isint long enough, and making it longer would make him over-powered in most other situations. \n\n{{champion:90}} has a silence that he can use to prevent enemies from using their gap closers, but if he is taken my surprise, he has little other option then to attempt to face his attacker. However that forces him to stay still which leaves him vulnerable to other nearby enemies.\n\nAs for {{champion:3}}, he  has a movement speed boost, and also a slow. I have been informed by a comment below (Thanks Chrigeta) that {{champion:3}} is not played for other reasons, mainly mana.\n\n\n {{champion:112}} has his E, which is great CC against a pursuer, however if the enemy chasing them uses their gap closer afterwords its cool down is too long to save you again. If he buys his mobility or CC augment he sacrifices a lot of damage. (I'm not sure if its really that much but those who play him say its a lot).\n\nAll of these escapes sound more then viable on paper, however in the game they don't seem to be as effective. Slows and temporary stuns on long cool downs aren't enough to counter a {{champion:64}}  Q or a {{champion:11}}  Alpha Strike. These built in escape spells aren't enough to protect them, yet they cant be buffed without making them an offensive monster that would break the game. Perhaps these AP casters are meant to be glass cannons, however those have no place in the current meta.\n\n I don't know how this can be fixed, but unless a way is found, these champions and many others like them will remain unpopular unless the meta dramatically changes, or you dev's come up with something brilliant (I'm counting on you guys).\n\nI would love to see some of these champs in higher levels of play someday, so I ask just as the person above me did, what are you willing to do?\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-07-20T20:51:51.355+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":5,"body":"The bigger problem with Viktor (I play him) is that you are almost forced to get red augment due to the other ones being hugely lackluster.

You completely ignore all the threads pointing out all of the problems with Kha'zix. Your attempt to bring him back to any bit of fun at all was to give insignificant love-taps. Your attempt to make W less worthless was a whole bunch of pointless \"buffs\" that has no impact.\n\nWhy won't you start a discussion thread talking about Kha'zix? Why do you continue to force him into the AD Assassin role despite the fact that AD Assassins have proven to be your achilles heel of your balance team?\n-----------\nAs for Hecarim{{champion:120}} , this is simple. His late game is pretty strong. His early to mid game is REALLY weak. Why does his mana costs have to be so ridiculously oppressive? Why must Blue Buff be so essential for a champion so easily counter-jungled?\n\nWhy does his W and E have over 20 seconds of cooldown? Especially when his W serves such a vital function to his existence? He NEEDS his W to stay alive in a fight against champions. But at the same time, he needs his W to stay health while jungling.\n\n\nYou nerfed every part of his kit because you felt he was too strong. You nerfed him without hesitation. Yet with Lee Sin{{champion:64}} , you treat him like a precious baby and you're trying so frustratingly hard to retain his strengths, you're trying so UNFAIRLY hard to keep Lee Sin FUN to play for Lee Sin players.\n\nBut what about Hecarim and Kha'zix players? You guys nerfed them without a second thought. You never thought about how players of those champions would feel. But Lee Sin? Lee Sin  is immune to nerfs because you are afraid of angering Lee Sin players?\n-----\nFor Kha'zix{{champion:121}} , mind if I throw in my suggestion? I've seen your balance team's track record, and I have come to the conclusion that** AD Assassins are a lost cause.** AD Assassins have always been the worse in terms of balance. So, for Kha'zix, why not make him a jack-of-all-trades champion that can literally switch role depending on combination of evolutions? This will give Kha'zix two things. \n\n1) A unique niche that literally no other champion has, where he is an adaptive champion that switches as the game goes on depending on what his team needs. A tanky bruiser, a squishy assassin, a backline caster, etc.\n\n2) It would thematically fit him, this you can not disagree with as evolving to adapt is his entire schtick, but as you can CLEARLY see, was a theme he has been struggling to fit as his evolutions have always been badly balanced.\n\n\nFor Hecarim{{champion:120}} give his E a QoL buff by showing an indicator to tell players how much distance it'd let him cover ala Nocturne/TF's ultimate.\n\nOr...how does this sound? **Take his Q's CDR mechanic, and extend it to his W and E too**?\n\n\n\n**PS** - I know this sounds a little too impassioned, but when I look at Kha'zix's horrible treatment and Riot's silence over such extended period of time, and then I look at how Lucian{{champion:236}}  was changed into a ranged AD Kassadin{{champion:38}}  after his own supposed nerf, and then compare how hesitant you all are at nerfing Lee Sin...well, *it's very hard to not see some serious favouritism in your balance team*.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitchcrank","date":"2014-07-19T21:51:39.053+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"So true.

I haven't been able to play him in a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2014-07-21T20:27:49.854+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":32,"body":"You have made a ton of comments, and I'll try my best to address them all.\n\n**1) Kha'Zix**\nFirstly, I actually think Kha'zix isn't far off from being balanced. In fact, we have seen him get spot-picked in Korean pro games even in his arguably currently \"underpowered\" state (I believe they are actually evolving E first). \n\nThe changes to Q and its evolution path were actually largely motivated by Game Health concerns with the Isolation mechanic. Essentially, Isolation is a mechanic that works super well later on in the game when you are more heavily grouping up since you have allies to play around, but early on in the game (especially pre-6) avoiding Isolation is not really an option for some roles (ex: the opposing jungler). We think it's appropriate that Kha'Zix has to invest in his Q to apply this kind of pressure to the enemy team that Isolation brings, and it's clear that at least some evolutions such as E are still competing with it.\n\nI think Volty (Kha'Zix's original designer) kind of nailed it on the head when we released Kha'Zix. He claimed that Kha'Zix is a champion we have to normally re-visit in order to re-balance his evolutions to be competitive with one another, and I honestly agree with that. The game and our understanding of the game changes so much even on a daily basis. I suspect we'll have to revisit his evolutions in the future, but for now we want to monitor how the Q buffs in 4.12 have affected him.\n\n**2) Hecarim**\nAgreed 100% that we went overboard with the Q Mana cost tuning the last time we changed him. This is something we're looking to change with the next upcoming patch. His Q Mana cost will now be in the middle ground between where it was before and where it is now.\n\n**3) Balance \"Favoritism\"**\nI think it's a bit unfair to jump to conclusions about why we are hesitant to nerf X champion versus Y champion. Firstly, there's always going to be variance in the power of champions after we change them. Getting them right 100% out of the game is honestly unrealistic, as it takes time for everyone to understand how to optimize champions after we change them.\n\nLucian was a case where we were more concerned with ensuring that he was still functional post Attack Range changes. Yes, we went overboard on our first shot, but this is something that can be and will be corrected in the upcoming patches (everybody deserves a second shot amirite?).\n\nLee Sin is a different beast altogether. Firstly, we didn't go through with our first initial larger changelist months ago due to a legitimate concern that players brought to us which was that we were fundamentally altering his gameplay identity with our changes. This made us go rethink our approach to Lee Sin and instead of normalizing him into a champion we know fits the game, we are trying to fit his unique identity (early game gambit, late game falloff) into the game. This is something we will be pursuing fairly aggressively with Lee Sin.\n\nIn addition, we always have to assess what each champion brings to the game and how that can affect our analysis of the situation. Let's be honest, Lee Sin is one of the most fun and exciting champions in our game, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone why he is so popular. We'll continue to adjust his power as we always have (and if you don't think we've changed him a ton...go look at his patch history), but Lee Sin is a champion that as a design team we feel brings a lot of positives to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ringthree","date":"2014-07-21T20:41:53.210+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"I knew that he was going to say \"it was picked in one game in Korea\" it was a loss and Kha'Zix was a complete non-factor.  Kha'Zix is not \"close to balanced\" when his Ult ability can have zero effect if an enemy groups, or even gets near a minion, or turret or anything.  Regular Q is still massively underpowered, and evolved Q is horrible.  Just because E can be evolved first doesn't make up for the fact that he can do no damage even if he closes. \n\nHow can you say isolation works late, when that is the exact time that people group up making isolation completely irrelevant?  You are essentially saying that it is good thing that using a Ult point on evolving Q and then having it do no damage.  Maybe there are other members of the balance team that handle Kha'Zix (sometimes, the way that buffs and nerfs happen it definitely feels like different teams handle different champs) and you are just reporting what they are telling you, but any time playing Kha'Zix and it is very easy to see how poorly he is designed right now.  You only do more damage if you enemy makes a mistake, and you can do nothing to determine the situation.  \n\nHonestly, I question if you even read the original question about Kha'Zix.  You claim that you have to invest in Q, but that investment is completely determined by the other team and completely negates a level of Ult.  Just because E is now compelling does not resolve the issues involved with stacks of nerfs that you have done the champ.  Sitting on your hands while you wait to see what is already reported (that Kha'Zix now has the 6th lowest win rate, only above other broken champs) just deters players from enjoying the game.\n\nI am highly disappointed in your answer.  It makes people feel like you aren't paying attention to all of the champs (there are other champs that are treated this way).  Imposing a massive nerf and then viewing the outcome as if it is going to get better when the mechanical problems are obvious is just Olafing another champ.  It feels like you are in the same position you put yourself in with lots of champs anymore, where you don't know what to do with them, so you overnerf until you can come around to them.  That is really disappointing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GankMeHardrDaddy","date":"2014-07-20T20:12:53.666+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":9,"body":"As a {{champion:121}}  Main, i really really like your idea.

The balance team made a big point to say that it didn't seem right that a high mobility carry with good poke could do decent damage or provide utility so you guys hit his attack speed, movement speed, ult damage, w damage, w width, passive duration, and completely removed the slow of his w.\n\nWhen the balance team tried to solidify Ezreal as a mobility chracter they nerfed his movement speed to the lowest possible (325) and made sure not to touch his incredibly low health at what is the fifth lowest in the game and the lowest of any marksman (350+80) and also relatively low attack (47.2+3), yet when Riot made Lucian {{champion:236}} an  even higher mobility character with a ridiculously low cooldown dash that removes slows (that also is the fastest speed of any dash) you guys BUFFED Lucian's movement speed (335), health (420+80), and damage (49+3).  Both are considered caster carries yet Lucian has higher mobility (14-10 seconds, 425 range, no start of time, remove slows, -2 seconds per hit vs. 19-11 seconds, 475 range, .25 second start-up time, -1 per mystic shot hit) attack speed, attack speed per level, health, attack, wave clear, stronger trading, and a greater reward in his passive for hitting skills while Ezreal has an extra 50 range and better poke.\n\nEzreal has sat at a 46-47.5% win rate since his nerfs. Would it be safe balance wise to give him compensation buffs like Lucian got, but buffs that would fit Ezreal's kit? His kit is fine, the only issue is that his power level was made too low. Ezreal's low health and unreliable wave clear are understandable tradeoffs since he is meant to be tricky and quick, but right now compared to Lucian he does not feel that way. It would make sense to revert the movement speed nerf (Meddler recently stated that it is safe to increase movement speed on marksmen with dashes/blinks) and implement a change to his ultimate since Ezreal is all about his range and mobility. A few years ago there was an incredibly popular suggestion that Ezreal's ult fall-off should be reduced by his AP, but a Rioter named Morello said it would be too confusing for players. A while later, Riot did big support changes and did that very thing to Nami's {{champion:267}} Ebb and Flow. Clearly it would not be too confusing to implement so would it be possible to put that in? I know that change is more suited for AP Ezreal but I don't understand why it hasn't been put in.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2014-07-19T22:37:30.434+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":47,"body":"Just don't forget Ezreal's range, which is 550, when Lucian's range is only 500, the lowest of all ADCs.

Flat out, he's just currently overtuned and that will be corrected soon. This means that Lucian's current state is not really a useful grounds of comparison when it comes to power level.\n\nTo address Ezreal, we honestly feel Ezreal is still fitting the vision we set for him. He's a long-range, mobile, poke ADC and he fits that pretty well. In fact, Ezreal is still being valued in the Korean competitive scene. I don't think it can be easily assumed that Ezreal is \"weak\" at the moment. He has things that Lucian doesn't have (long range) and Lucian has things that Ezreal doesn't have (hyper mobility). That's a great place to be in when they can be valued for different reasons. I think something to clarify is that Ezreal should probably not be the most mobile ADC in the game given that he has such high range. He can be mobile sure (and he is because of his E), but being the most mobile is probably not ideal given his other strengths. I think it's easy to forget, once a champion has not been dominant for a while, the times they actually were dominant and how small of a change it takes for us to revert back to those times.\n\nPurely using Win Rates averaged over all skill levels is a dangerous way to approach game balance. In fact, I think this kind of mentality has heavily contributed to the Mobility Creep that continues to grow in our game. Some things simply scale extremely well with player skill level - it turns out that Mobility is one of these things. The fact that a lot of our more mobile champions do have \"lower\" win rates is not an accident or mistake. It takes a ton of mastery and skill to leverage Mobility to its maximum potential.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sayath","date":"2014-07-20T04:33:53.594+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hello Statikk,\nit's been a year since we last spoke through a public channel. I hope you still remember me. To refresh your memory (if necessary): \nI only play {{champion:84}} since her release on 11th May 2010, > 5000 games. Akali is the reason I play League of Legends. My level of play is around low Diamond I (0 - 40 LP).\nIn the past, we've discussed Akali balance in the following threads:\n\n* [Original thread](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3402930)\n* [Follow up](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3485169)\n\n-----\n\nWe have come to the following conclusions:\nAkali has little individual counterplay. Instead, her counterplay revolves around team coordination: Grouping, focus firing, peeling for allies.\nThis situation creates a disparity between high and low ELO. Hence, when Akali is balanced for competitive play, she becomes unhealthy for the lower levels since her counterplay depends on teammates not screwing up. After all, Akali punishes mistakes severely.\n\nTo resolve this problem, Akali's skill ceiling should be increased, which in turn would allow for more individual counterplay and balance the disparity.\n\nHowever, in our discussions it also became apparent that finding a great solution, one which preserved the identity of Akali, respected player attachment and allowed for significant gameplay improvements, was very difficult. Indeed, only a senior designer would be able to execute such a demanding project up to our high expectations.\n\nFurthermore, we can not view Akali in isolation. Riot has a responsibility to all 119 champions in League of Legends. Akali is definitely in no state like Sion, Poppy or similar champions requiring a full rework. Akali is the [36th](http://loldb.gameguyz.com/statistics) most popular champion. Her popularity and win rate have been stable for a long time. Also, her ban rate is quite low (ca. 1%). Thus, she requires no immediate action and every change needs to weighed in terms of benefits and disruption created.\n\nGiven these priorities, a change to Akali should be small in scope, at least in terms of necessary resources, or coincident with a larger project.\n\n-----\nBased on our previous findings, I once again invite you to a constructive discussion about Akali, stealth, spellvamp and the position of squishy melee champions in general. Feel free to speak your mind.\n-----\n\nSince our initial discussion the game has changed quite extensively. Oracle's Elixir was removed and replaced by Oracle's Lens. Vision wards became visible and permanent. Supports gained a lot of impact and at least 12 champions have received a gameplay update, among them Master Yi and Kassadin. On the horizon are reworks for Sion and Fiora. Beyond, Diana has also been identified as a champion in need of work, but no actions taken so far.\n\nI bring up these changes specifically because they either defined the season as a whole, modified a champion in a similar position to Akali or impacted Akali directly.\n\nMaster Yi, Fiora and Akali belong to a class of squishy melee champions, which have been difficult to integrate into the game in a healthy fashion for all levels of play. From your experiences with the Master Yi rework and the upcoming Fiora gameplay update, can you share **any new insights regarding the intended position of these champions in League of Legends or any new ways of skill expression and individual counterplay in the squishy melee design space?** For example, RiotSeb posted on [Champion Updates](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-skins/txxQETbY-champion-updateupdate) that you plan on making Fiora more mechanically intense, giving her more depth.\n\n-----\n[Next section](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/xAQdUGK8-statikk-qa-begins-july-21st-but-submit-your-questions-now?sort_type=best&comment=01990000)","replies":[{"poster":"Sayath","date":"2014-07-20T04:35:36.468+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":5,"body":"The most recent addition to the squishy melee class is Yasuo, released during December 2013. Has he been able to overcome some of the issues seen with his peers? I estimate his focus on teamfights instead of 1v1 as a best case scenario was very beneficial to game health.\n\nAkali herself was first impacted by the stealth reveal changes. Twilight Shroud became a little more relevant because of it, but teamfights still revolved around placing a vision ward once she used the ability. Beyond, the Lich Bane nerf was an indirect nerf to Akali if she bought the item.\n\nThe change in patch 4.2 \"Shadow Dance: The number of stacks can now (once again) be seen in her buff bar. \" introduced an old bug / visual glitch, see [PBE bug report](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bugs/AGyYioci-akali-missing-pixels-on-shadow-dance-buff-icon) for details. I understand the intention of telegraphing this important information to opponents, but **please make it look properly**, i. e. no missing pixels. Or is this caused by some hard to track legacy code?\n\n-----\nWith a whole year having passed, **what's your current take on Akali and her state in the game?** Personally, I'm content with it. Akali might not be a viable LCS pick, but I'm no LCS player either or intend to be one. At the most I want to be Challenger and that's very much possible as demonstrated by some other Akali players. In my opinion, preserving Akali's identity and flow carries far more weight.\n\nHowever, as hinted at earlier, some small scope skill ceiling improvements would be generally appreciated. The major question is how to achieve that with a change that is supposed to be small in scope, but meaningful in terms of skill ceiling. I think a great example is Twilight Shroud now granting vision. We need something similar, but more impactful.\n\nMaybe we should take a look at the innate or detonation gameplay. CertainlyT thought of the Crescent Slash detonation as a major deterrent to individual counterplay. Indeed, it makes detonation much easier, but also creates some gameplay by itself (double detonation). Instead of detonating MotA, Crescent Slash could reset the AA timer. Unsure whether that would be an improvement. In general, removing automation might be a good approach (e.g., no AA right after SD).\n\n-----\nRecently, Kassadin's gameplay has been updated. He shares a lot of similarities with Akali. Both have a very powerful ultimate impacting the power level of the non-ultimate abilities. It goes as far as the ultimate actually defining their identity. Kassadin is all about his free mobility, having a flash every  7 / 5 / 3 seconds. Likewise, Akali is defined by her extreme gap closing capabilities and stickiness made possible by an ammo system and a reset on kill mechanic. Hence, why they are supposed to be weak pre-6.\n\nOf course, that's how far the similarity goes. The champions themselves have a very different set of problems. However, I'd like to thank you for investing the time to make the necessary adjustments without just reworking Kassadin's ultimate. After all, toning down a champion's strong points instead of creating actual weaknesses is far easier, but ends in a homogenized cast of empty shells.\n\n-----\nA fundamental building block of Akali is spellvamp. However, the stat in general leads a shadowy existence. Two of the three items providing spellvamp are of hybrid nature - Hextech Gunblade being an Akali only item and Guinsoo's Rageblade being non-existent. Meanwhile, Will of the Ancients despite its stats of +80 AP, 10% CDR and 20% SV is never bought, at least by a mage audience. I estimate it competing in price range with Void Staff and a mana item like Athene's Unholy Grail being a prerequisite to spam spells makes the item undesirable from a mage perspective. **What's your opinion on the state of spellvamp?** Should burst sustain even be more broadly available, e.g. to mages?\n-----\n\n[Next section](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/xAQdUGK8-statikk-qa-begins-july-21st-but-submit-your-questions-now?sort_type=best&comment=019900000001)","replies":[{"poster":"Sayath","date":"2014-07-21T09:02:34.010+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lastly, stealth in League of Legends is quite binary.

I'll answer the questions in your Summary as best as I can:\n\n**1) State of Akali**\n Akali currently looks to be in a decent spot, and as I hear she is starting to gain more popularity recently especially in solo queue. I also think she will be benefiting from the changes we are making to the overall game to make it less anti-Assassin. As far as Game Health goes, I still believe she is a champion with a lot of flaws. When she gets ahead, there is usually very little individuals can do to overcome the situation due to her simplistic mechanics (tons of just \"I click you and hope you die\" abilities) and when she's behind she has very little power to come back since she doesn't have any strong \"fallback\" patterns and the her primary defensive ability (W) is still tied to our primitive and hard counter-y stealth system.\n\n**2) Squishy Melee**\nWe are still exploring what it means to be a squishy melee in the game. Yasuo was obviously an experiment in this field. I see 2 possible positions for them:\n\n**1. Enemy backline (Assassin):** I think everyone is familiar with this pattern. In my mind there are 2 inherent steps in this pattern - 1. The Infiltration to get to the right target and 2. The Execution when they arrive at the target to take them out. Assassins should be champions who rely on flanking and other creative ways of infiltrating towards the enemy's high-priority targets. I think a large part missing in a lot of our Assassins is an interesting Execution phase, where they still need to make a play once they reach the target to finish them (maybe Zed after the more recent changes meets the bar now).\n\n**2. Ally backline (Melee Carry):** This is a term we've thrown around a ton but have never truly delivered upon. A lot of the supposed Melee Carries we've put into the game are honestly very Assassin-like in their pattern since we often give them the tool to access the enemy backline. The idea behind this character would be similar to that of a Ranged Carry mindset - start with whatever targets present themselves, usually the enemy frontline and eventually make their way through the team to clean up the enemy's backline. \n\nYasuo was a champion I believe had a lot of potential of fulfilling this role due to mechanics such as Wind Wall which keeps him safe from the enemy backline while he deals with the enemy frontline, but once again we ended up giving him a way to easily access the backling via his ult which I think really undermines this role's purpose and essentially turned him into an Assassin. To me it feels like a somewhat lost opportunity.\n\n**3) Spell Vamp**\nSpell Vamp is honestly another old system that we probably need to revisit and re-set the goals around its purpose in the game. I would say in its current state, Spell Vamp being any more prominent would probably just lead to abuse cases. One of the largest problems with Spell Vamp is how much it favors resourceless champions vs. Mana champions. This is something we'd have have to take a hard look at if we wanted to adjust it, but I don't think there are any immediate plans.\n\n**4) Stealth**\nI don't just think it would be beneificial, I think it is integral to the health of all stealth champions that we figure out a better system for them to work under. The current binary / hard-counter system is one that provides little gameplay and disallows these champions to scale with player skill effectively. It's something I'm very personally interested in investigating but have never found the time to.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stampthelamp","date":"2014-07-18T22:42:58.224+0000","up_votes":77,"down_votes":32,"body":"Why does Lee Sin continue to dodge nerfs or changes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enchirideon","date":"2014-07-19T16:33:52.466+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":6,"body":"A lot of questions and inquiries here. \n\nCurrently, some of the older supports such as {{champion:44}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:26}} and even {{champion:16}} seem to be looked over in favor of more versatile supports such as {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:201}}, even {{champion:1}}. \nI partially blame lack of power and utility(Or at best, limited utility), as well as a bad or un-tweaked kit. But I also think they are just tarnished. And I don't think stat tweaks are what will fix them. When you compare someone like Alistar to someone like Thresh, It becomes apparent that Thresh is just better in most situations. Both are tanky, both have cc, but Thresh also has lockdown-cc, a shield(that out-scales Alistars heal in short fights and bursts, which seem to be the current meta) very strong area denial, and one of the most powerful mobility-utility spells in the game. When comparing someone like Zilean to someone like Lulu, it's almost always a no-brainer. Lulu has  better poke and a slow combined in one, a haste, **an extremely powerful cc**, a shield/steroid and a very powerful \"*heal*\" and disengage tool. Overall, we see about 4 Thresh's per Soraka and even more per Zilean.\n---\n* {{champion:44}} in particular has become near Sion-levels of old and almost useless(This doesn't mean he **IS** useless, this means that Taric will most of the time have a huge disadvantage in both helping and defending(which, for a gem paladin, he does very little of...)). Taric's main problem is that he's meant to be like one of those aura champions like what Sona was, but the current iteration of the game is too far ahead for something like that and even if it worked properly, it would merely come out as seeming op or unfair. I think he needs a rework. *A complete rework*. If he were reworked into a true gem aura paladin, is a passive that actually incentives aura items by making them gain extra aura stats and range if he buys them viable***?*** Do you think that a mere stat-tweak is not enough***?***\n\n* {{champion:26}} Is bad. There are only two Zilean's, ones that make it anti-fun for the enemy team and ones that make it anti-fun for your team. Both can be found on either team. The only real reason anyone ever takes Zilean is because of his ultimate. Basically the ultimate means **Don't hit me if you don't have the advantage to follow up for 7 seconds because then I'm just going to get a short period of invulnerability and then get a lot of HP back but if you do have the advantage, then I'm pretty much dead anyway.** This is not a disengage unless your team can follow up or you are deep under a turret. And if it is left unused or the target survives without popping it, it feels like a massive waste. The bombs are also very broken. Simply being near a Zilean has the potential threat of getting bombed by something that cannot be countered in any way other than standing away. Its like a constantly active but less powerful Urgot E-Q combo. In my opinions he should be up there with Sion in terms of how badly he needs a rework. People often emphasize that he should have the time-mage aesthetic. How much of this is in your hands to change and alter***?*** In general what are your thoughts on Zileans current condition***?*** And has anyone considered making his ultimate literally an ability that rewinds the game back a few seconds, erasing all actions made(This would not be the \"soraka heal\" problem, as merely information is exchanged between the teams)***?***\n\n* {{champion:12}} seems to me like a decent champion that simply has rare situations where he is truly needed. I have taken him against people like Lee Sin, Morgana, Xin Zhao and Zed to simply keep them away from the ADC. But one thing that always seemed weird to me was the Headbut-knockup combo. Why does the combo(which is technically a glitch?) exist and why is it allowed to exist***?*** On a side note, his heal seems very mana costly and weak unless you build some form of ap. Do you think the heal has a thematic basis to even exist in his kit***?***\n---\nThan","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2014-07-21T23:37:37.952+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"**1) Taric**\nSimilar to Garen, I think Taric is at a place where we have to weigh simplicity vs. mastery. If we were to change Taric, I doubt we would put more emphasis on Auras as they are biggest examples of \"Power without Gameplay.\" Stat-based Auras typically have to be fairly game-warping before they are noticeable and satisfying, which is why we usually avoid them. Overall, I think we need to find a more interesting core gameplay pattern than \"stand near an enemy and press all your buttons\" for Taric. I don't want to get your guys' hopes up, but we actually do have some experimental Taric changes that are pretty different from his current kit. No guarantees on if it will ever release or when, but he is someone who the Reworks team is looking at potentially changing.\n\n**2) Zilean**\nZilean's kit unfortunately has very little counterplay, and it's the large reason why it's hard for us to find a place for him in the game. Currently when he's powerful, he creates an extremely frustrating experience for the enemy laner. He is also one of the champions that is higher up on the Reworks priority list, but because we would have to change his kit so drastically to make him healthy for the game, it will definitely be a while until we can release changes.\n\n**3) Alistar**\nThe W+Q combo is something that we never intended to exist, but it's something that Alistar players have gotten used to and is honestly integral to his current balance and gameplay. If we were to revisit him in a Reworks style approach, I think there's a high likelihood that we would remove the combo and instead give him more ways to create situations where he can W enemies into walls to setup a follow-up Q. This is probably a healthier version of his combo, but it's not something we'd do unless we supplemented the kit with ways to function and succeed without the combo.\n\nI agree the heal is also something that doesn't necessarily mesh well with his kit - both from a game health perspective and a thematic perspective. Functionally it is honestly just a bunch of sustain in lane (arguably not a \"bunch\" anymore now that we've tuned it down over time) and then falls off in usefulness once it gets to late game. It creates a fairly un-interactive lane pattern that is diametrically opposed to his all-in initiation combo style. It's something I think we'd have no qualms of removing if we found something better to replace it with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eph289","date":"2014-07-18T22:08:43.810+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":28,"body":"Statikk, \n\nI have a question about Garen.

No skillshots, no resource management, relatively simple combination management . . . there's just not a lot of mechanical difficulty to Garen.

A major one that seems to get little attention is Thresh. Since his release, he's seen about an 80% pick/ban rate across *all competitive play*. Does the balance team even view that as a problem? If so, why does it take them seemingly so long to act on those issues?\n\nI have loved playing and watching League since season 1, yet I can't help but notice that I'm getting less interested in both. Seeing the same 5-6 champions be in a \"pick or ban\" state for *so long* is just making it less interesting for me. I think I'll keep playing the game for a long time to come, but I'd just like it to feel more exciting and less predictable as far as team comps go.","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2014-07-22T00:18:09.475+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"1) The short answer is a lot. This is something that is hard to gauge since we have a lot of internal playtests (usually 2 full playtests per day, also several lane tests) in addition to the ones we play on Live. It really depends on the individual at the end of the day.\n\n2) Making sure things don't get stale whether it's competitive or normal play is important to us, but at the same time we have to weigh the other things we value when we make changes. It's important that the champions in competitive play are inherently exciting to watch. It's important that the champions we nerf in competitive play don't become unusable at other levels of play. There are so many things we consider whenever we make changes (or decisions to NOT make changes) that aren't readily apparent. Competitive is only 1 aspect of the entire game, and we can't make decisions only solely off the data we have from the competitive scene (although it a large contributor).","replies":[{"poster":"ofart","date":"2014-07-22T00:42:35.574+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's important that the champions in competitive play are inherently exciting to watch. \n\nThat suggests not all champions are given equal treatment when balanced. How \"exciting\" a champion is should never even be a factor in the equation if you're looking to balance objectively. Otherwise, you're intentionally playing favorites and defining the meta in such a way that the champions you like overshadow others.\n\nI'm not saying that I'd want to see a bunch of Garens in LCS but if every champion is actually given a fair chance, he should be just as competitive of a pick as any other for his niche. The fact that more exciting champions are made higher tier is antithetical to the very concept of balance. To balance a game means to allow as many equally viable strategic choices as possible rather than narrowing them to a rigid few. By ensuring that the champions in LCS are those you deem exciting, you're distorting the game to match your preferences rather than encouraging diversity. Balance by definition is NOT supposed to be a colored approach.\n\nPerhaps Riot considers forcing pro players to pick what they deem \"exciting\" champions a commercially smart decision since such champions might attract more people to the game. While I doubt many people pick-up LoL based on LCS play, it might keep existing players more interested. This is understandable but if you see part of \"balance\" as favoring such champions, you work in marketing at least as much as in gameplay balance.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YellowtÃ¡il","date":"2014-07-18T23:54:26.410+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":20,"body":"Is there any update on the {{champion:35}} rework; is it still happening?

Her hawkshot is in same stance as her passive: its bonus gold is too small when consider Draven's passive and duration for sighiting when used is short that it doesn't help you getting away from ganks(and long cooldown really makes Ashe vulnerable from gank) \n\n**If she's got low damage potential, than why did Riot make her very vulnerable that its difficult to mend the loss that she got from ganks?**\n\n I mean Kog, Lucian and Ms. Fortune, they can still kick ass when ganked but Ashe cannot because she got neither strong damage nor an escape skill. Shouldn't she at least given an escape if early level frost arrow and hawkshot is useless? She's not that strong in lane phase as well, so she deserves some mobility instead of high damage, or more CC so that it can cover up her lack of mobility at least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hollow rei","date":"2014-07-20T02:22:26.854+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hello Statikk!\n\nTo what extent has the live balance team looked towards overall game speed and momentum?\n\nPlaying League and watching the LCS/OGN, there seems to be a slowdown of a lot of games this season, and not just for lack of knowledge of how to close games out. It feels like there's a handful of issues sticking out right now:\n\n1) There's been a \"waveclear creep\" that's snuck into the game, where newer champions (or reworked older ones, ala Xerath) have fantastic, long-range abilities that can quickly or instantly clear large minion waves with little danger to themselves. This removes a lot of the protection against skillshots that minions afford during pushes without forcing the opponent into a dangerous position in trying to get rid of the waves.\n\n2) There are few sources of hard initiation in the game as a consequence of tanks generally not doing well in most of the current lane matchups. Most initiation in the professional scene (and even in normal games like the ones I play) comes from long-range pick abilities like Elise's Cocoon, or displacements like Gragas' Exploding Keg. There's a real dearth of tough, tanky folks in the game who can get into the enemy team and cause havoc without exploding instantly, leading to constant standoffs.\n\n3) The ubiquitous nature of warding and the lack of strong ward clearing ala old Oracles can lead to lags in gameplay. Having too much knowledge of the enemy team's movements (along with heavier waveclear) can make it difficult to push in any non-monster objectives due to how easy it is to (accidentally) telegraph your movements to the enemy in advance.\n\nDo you think that the speed/length of gameplay is alright as it is? If not, what sort of changes have you been looking at?","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2014-07-22T03:10:27.620+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"**1) Wave Clear Creep**\nWave Clear Creep is certainly something that's been on our radar ever since the days of Mid Morgana and AP Sion. I think a lot of designers have tried to make steps towards making champions who have to interact with each other to succeed, but haven't necessarily carried through with the correct tuning to make it happen. For example, Xerath's Mana Passive was designed to force him nearer to the minions, but through Mana itemization like Athene's or the Blue Buff, Xerath can completely undermine this his Passive pattern and just wave clear at long range.\n\n**2) Initiation**\nAgreed there is a lack of effective initiation in competitive games at the moment which leads to long, stalled-out games and only siege / poke team comps. There's a lot of factors that go into this though and I'll tally some of my thoughts below:\n\n1. Our old style tanks are built around AoE initiation, and pro players have evolved to have much better spacing in fights to avoid the \"wombo combos.\"\n\n2. Mikael's is now a staple item on Supports which makes long CD initiation abilities much less effective, and thus as you identified the lower CD, repeatable pick abilities (Morgana Q, Elise Human E, etc.) are the only ones finding success in the game.\n\n3. We have reduced the prevalence of Assassins in the game both through Champion changes (Zed, Kha'Zix, etc.) and Systems changes (such as Heal) which has allowed long-range gameplay to become too dominant of a strategy.\n\n**3) Warding / Vision Control**\nThis is another question where I don't have great insight into (something more appropriate for the Systems team), but I can understand how the new vision system has caused teams that are ahead to not be able secure vision control as easily. I don't think we want to go back to a world where the team that was ahead can easily black out the map and just suffocate the enemy team, but we may be too far in the other direction at this point.\n\nOverall we feel the pace of the game is probably a bit too slow and drawn out at the moment, and I think the upcoming Champion and Systems changes in the next couple of patches will help shake that up a bit heading into Worlds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chess435","date":"2014-07-18T23:44:46.919+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":14,"body":"1.
