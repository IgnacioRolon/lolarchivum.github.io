Ultimately, we want to start conversations earlier on so that 1) there's fewer surprises and 2) there's time for us to chat with you guys, get your feedback, and continue to iterate on our goals and changes.\r\n\r\nSo without further ado, here's some of the primary projects we're looking at for the next patch:\r\n\r\n**1) Reworks Follow-up**\r\n\r\nWe released several reworks in the last couple of patches, so this patch we're focusing on ensuring they're all in a good state. We think we undershot a bit on the power level of all 3 of the recent large reworks to Kassadin, Gragas, and Rengar, so here's a sneak peak at the current directions of the changes:\r\n\r\n**Kassadin:** We're looking to give Kassadin more favorable opportunities to close into melee with his targets and make sure he is rewarded correctly when he successfully does so. We also want to continue to focus on amplifying Kassadin's unique strengths against magic damage.\r\n\r\n**Gragas:** We're looking to free up some of the constraints we put on Gragas' mobility so he can more readily initiate and better function as a tank in fights.\r\n\r\n**Rengar:** We're looking at cleaning up some of the responsiveness issues we may have introduced with the rework and want to make sure Rengar can better compete during the early game in Top Lane and in the Jungle.\r\n\r\n**2) Top Lane and the \"Renekton Bar\"**\r\n\r\nAs with any lane, we are definitely aware and concerned that there may not be enough champion diversity in the Top Lane, especially at the competitive level. This is largely due to what we believe are \"lane bullies\" who essentially represent the relative early game power level needed to enter and compete in the lane. Currently, that bar is the \"Renekton Bar.\"\r\n\r\nOne way to reduce the severity of the \"Renekton Bar\" would be simply to tone down Renekton's power a notch. In this case, directly lowering the bar would potentially create an even more unhealthy situation where a different champion rises to the top and acts as the new \"bar.\" We actually see Renekton as one of the more interesting top lane champions in the game, and so instead of nerfing here, we're looking to buff.\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of looking at champions that we think provide interesting and healthy gameplay in the top lane, and finding ways to nudge them up to be able to better compete in the current Top Lane environment. This doesn't mean these guys should just now outright beat champions like Renekton, but it hopefully means they have a better chance of going toe-to-toe with him or maybe even just surviving the lane against him and then providing some unique strengths to their team later on.\r\n\r\nAs a note, since we can't address every single top laner we'd like in one patch, this will be an ongoing project as we continue to bring more and more champions into the fold.\r\n\r\n**Remember, these are all currently in iteration and may change at any point before we actually release the patch.**\r\n\r\nIn addition, I'd like to give you guys some insight into a couple of hot topics we're currently analyzing to see if we need to make any adjustments:\r\n\r\n**1) Lulu**\r\n\r\nWe think we dropped the ball a bit here by failing to make sure we kept Bot Lane Support Lulu fully intact when we made adjustments to her Mid Lane harrass patterns last patch. We're currently in a heavy analysis phase to gauge where her power level is at as a Bot Lane Support.\r\n\r\nWe also want to continue to monitor her presence in Mid Lane and see if she is still presenting a large diversity issue there even after our changes.\r\n\r\nOnce again, this simply means we need more time here to gather data and feedback before deciding if and how to move forward.\r\n\r\n**2) Jungle Items**\r\n\r\nThere are actually 2 potential issues here we have been discussing a ton internally:\r\n\r\n**1. The Lack of Class Diversity in the Jungle **\r\n\r\nWe are currently investigating why other classes of Junglers such as Jungle Tanks like Maokai and Nautilus are not valued in the current game. We feel it largely has to do with the way Spirit Stone and its upgrades scale their effectiveness based purely on the amount of damage dealt.\r\n\r\nWe think there's some complex work to be done here in order to open the jungle back up to more classes of champions, so we're doing a deep dive at the moment to make sure we have a solid direction before moving forward.\r\n\r\n**2. Is Feral Flare too strong?**\r\n\r\nWe are currently monitoring the power level of Feral Flare after its recent release, as our current thinking is that it may be a bit over-tuned. \r\n\r\nWe prefer to let it settle a bit on the Live servers before making any changes, but it's possible some adjustments to Feral Flare may make it into 4.6.","replies":[{"poster":"ElderPartridge","date":"2014-04-08T03:33:12.584+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":19,"body":"I think if there's one thing URF showed us, its that champions like {{champion:6}} , {{champion:14}} , {{champion:57}} , and {{champion:120}} could be more viable with slight buffs to their mana/cooldowns.

Fighters are just that, people who fight. I thought the Renekton bar (which has been mentioned by Morello before this update) was meant to stall for a high priority fighter rework. Not a new balance philosophy.\n\nAround this design, the already god-like laners become more god-like as they try to ascend to the king of laning himself. I like Renekton as a champion, his design would promote heavy amounts of interaction, if he didn't beat anyone who tried to contest with him by a landslide and also hold the title of \"biggest wall NA\".\n\nPrevious Renekton main talking here, I say for the present, cut Renektons Q sustain (at least on minions, and still not being overbearing or underwhelming on champions) so he is promoted to try and win fights with his current kit whilst trying to escape with the least scrapes possible. This allows healthy counters to come in without being next on the chopping block. Balance from there until this fabled fighter rework (which will be a huge mess of its own, if it even exists) comes and gives every bruiser/fighter/anyone-riot-hates a more defined niche.\n\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nIf this is the path you truly wish to tread, here are my suggestions.\n\n- Cho'gath: Despite being an older champion, Cho'gath is a tank that brings lots of CC not usually found in the top lane. He has clear cut weakness that include his lack of mobility, and skillful maneuvering over rupture. This is one of the few guys that, if given some love, can beat Renekton while still having clear cut counters (including those in lane) of his own.\n\n- Jax: Actually, don't touch this guy. He can't beat Renekton, and he shouldn't, but he's still a good top pick, just underestimated/undervalued.\n\n- Olaf: This guy used to be a really potent lizard slayer. Give him some more HP5 and a bit more damage on his E or later levels of his Q and he'll go right back to slicing off the reptile's tail. I could list the counterplay and weaknesses he already has, but you guys basically wrote a thesis on it when you remade him so I don't really see a point.\n\n- Malphite: Going the full mile and making this guy super anti-AD while making him vulnerable to AP isn't a bad idea. Low risk too.\n\n- Rumble: These changes are already in the works, but Rumble is pretty well designed. MR and camping hurt the mechanized bugger, and hey, you just released a new skin for him. Win win.\n\n- Shen: Probably shouldn't buff this guy in fear of him already being good, just not utilized. But increasing the damage on Vorpal Blade probably wouldn't hurt. Well designed tank.\n\n- Udyr: Giving this tiger a bit a love will put this lizard slayer of old in a good spot. Weaknesses are pretty close to Cho's.\n\n- Warwick: Risky due to his end-game potential, but giving this guy some mana freedom would go a long way.\n\n- Xin Zhao: Not too risky after his rework, and the guy actually has a lot of reason why he should beat Renekton.\n\n**\nWHO NOT TO BUFF**\n\n- Aatrox: Give this guy an inch and he goes a mile, the dangerous combination of high damage potential and innate life steal make this a risky guy to buff.\n\n- Darius: Lack of mobility and high bases mean that there probably isn't a way to buff this guy without having him destroy everything, including Renekton.\n\n- Dr. Mundo: I love this guy, I really do, but he's a huge problem top lane. Either he absolutely wrecks and becomes unkillable or he gets camped and he's worthless. The best buffs you can give him would be to tailor him back into the jungle, where he has unique trade-offs for amazing strengths.\n\n- Jayce: Poke damage. Enough said, this guy is the melee Nidalee.\n\n- Nasus: If you give Nasus enough early game power to beat guys like Renekton, there is no counter.\n\n- Riven: Too much mobility, shouldn't beat Renekton in the first place.\n\n- Singed: See Nasus.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobasco da Gama","date":"2014-04-08T12:31:38.219+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"It pains me to say this, as an Irelia main in late S2 and early S3, but she's also in my \"DO NOT BUFF\" list, for similar reasons as the ones you give for Aatrox.","replies":[{"poster":"Xohs","date":"2014-04-08T12:49:40.831+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Oh definitely.

To be specific, I'm talking about the single target jungle and certain single target champions. I'm looking at the top junglers right now, like Kha'zix, Pantheon, Wukong, Elise, Vi, etc.\n\nWhy are they better than everything else? Well, it's because most of the things that \"should\" be their weaknesses have been taken away. For the most part, any champion that does good single target damage while having some form of CC on their kit is going to be a good ganker too, because single target damage is really good in ganks for killing the enemy laner, a single target. The thing is, though, that these single target junglers no longer have to pay for their strong ganking and dueling. They clear the jungle really well too, and now they also sustain through it well, because the jungle has been structured to favor their type of damage. The big wight camp in particular is a problem, because any champion that can clear that thing well is going to have a big advantage over a champion that cannot. None of those support tank junglers, like Maokai, Nautilus, etc can clear that wraith well at all.\n\nRemember how Shyvana jungle used to be? You had super good clearing and super good dueling, but it came at a cost. No innate sustain + somewhat dangerous first clear. Horrible ganks, and taking exhaust to remedy that means that you lose flash (and her ganks were still mediocre even with exhaust).\n\nNowadays, it's like most junglers are like the old S2 Shyvana, except they don't have the weaknesses.\n\nThe solution? Shift the balance back toward AoE junglers a little more, so that the best gankers and duelists aren't also the best farmers (a lot of them even scale well too).","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMercyLoL","date":"2014-04-08T05:20:20.672+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">We are currently investigating why other classes of Junglers such as Jungle Tanks like Maokai and Nautilus are not valued in the current game.

If you look at games where people test Renekton and suddenly go to PVP or for ranked (God only knows why), then you have a problem. If you buff or make changes to top laners to compete or survive against Renekton.. You are actually helping the opposite team by giving their top laner a HUGE advantage over the newly played Renekton.\n\nI know it's not often that it happens, but still a possibility. Another possibility are the off-games we come to know and truly hate. Say this particular Renekton is having a uniquely bad game, what would happen if laners were able to compete with him (when he's at his best) now that he's at his worst? It would cause a major issue and could overpower other top laners against that Renekton.\n\nI may have misread or misinterpreted what your intentions for top lane against Renekton were, but these are factors that are ultimately important.\n\nJungling. This is a good topic to go on. I was listening to a few people talk about Nautilus. He's viable, but he's slow. That's apparently an issue. I've never actually used Nautilus, so I apologize for any seemingly stupid thoughts, but I believe that is true as well. His base movement speed may be lacking to make him a good jungler. Some who use him are probably against that or may be with it, I'm not sure. I've seen a few Nautilus jungles here and there, but not many were effective.\n\nNautilus' key move would be his hook (I don't use him, so I don't know it's hot key). The problem is, if he misses it.. Well, he's useless now. Unless he's right there, he just wasted mana, time, and other possible things. Moakai, well. You have me on that, I'm not sure why he isn't used as a jungler. I can say this, the Spirit Stone and Spirit of the Ancient Golem are kind of troublesome. The passives could be tweaked to be more compatible with tanks. Maybe having a percentage of hp deal damage or restore a percentage of health back? Something similar could be useful.\n\nI'm not sure how effective these possibilities are or if they help. One last thing I have for suggestion is this.. I'm sure things could work quicker for ideas if you gathered up some players (preferably those who come up with the best ideas) and did a bit of brainstorming with them until you came up with something. Of course, having it all separated in different groups. Jungle ideas for one group, Top lane for another group, and so on. It could work, but I don't know, I'm not one to decide. \n\n~Legacy Ninja","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChroniclerC","date":"2014-04-08T09:17:41.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I've got you talking about her, I'm really confused as to why Lulu's E (Help, Pix!) got minion shielding removed.

I understand why the reveal duration and enemy damage got softened a little, but that change makes no sense to me.

That makes you heavily dependent on runes/masteries and unless you have a way to clear camps in a fast manner, non-tanky champs are completely unviable.\n\nYou have to be able to start at one of the buffs in the current meta and grab both of them before you base.

The notification that he's nearby is a huge tradeoff on his ult now.\n\nThe Renekton bar is a bit weird. I found that just buying a Wardens Mail/Ninja Tabi and I could safely farm as a melee champ against Renekton. But is it really fair that to survive the lane you have to build super defensive? I don't know how I really feel about it.\n\nAs a support main, I actually appreciated the Lulu mid reappearing. However Lulu support is still really good if you go into support with mid-lane masteries/runes. I got destroyed in a Lulu lane yesterday where she went full magic penetration and AP runes. Not sure what that says about her base values.\n\nI used to play a lot of Rammus in the jungle. He's a champion that I felt fit my playstyle and like Nautilus, becomes a monster late game where he can duel anyone to a degree. However with attack damage champions heavily dominating the pick list right now, he's unviable. If I was playing Rammus and their enemy jungler was Master Yi, Lee Sin, Jarvan, I could never win that duel in the early game. It's so easy to punish weak(tank) junglers in the early game, completely making them a non-factor.

I've seen videos of people soloing baron early on and I played a game with Tiger Udyr yesterday with it and it was very strong. But compared to the plethora of stats that the Spirit Stone line gives you, not sure what the tradeoff should be.\n\n\nThose videos posted on Reddit were of WW farming in a **custom game** where he had access to both sides camps, or the yi video where he constantly farmed, ignored his team and was counter jungling an enemy who could have easily killed him, not to mention the yi bought both a spirit item, plus the the wriggles= more% damage to minions. *Most of those soloing videos are of extreme condition that, for the most part, cannot be done in game, unless there is a huge disparity of skill between your team and their team.\n*\n\nThere is a **huge trade off** for building Feral Flare already, first being the fact that you need twenty five camps to clear. By this fact alone, it means that if you actually want to get this item before the thirty minute mark, you need to constantly farm the jungle. By doing so, you are not putting any lane pressure on your opposing team's laners by really ganking except if the enemy is low or you are six with red buff. If you do not gank, enemy lanes can easily spiral out of control because they are receiving ganks and constant help. If this happens, then not only will your team's laners be behind but it will **make farming camps impossible** because they will be in your jungle, taking your camps.\n\n\nNext lets talk about gold efficiency; currently the spirit stone items are are all gold efficient, as is the newest version of wriggle's lantern. What separates the gold gains are the ways they are used to farm. I particularly love the design of these items because they allow for the play-styles Riot is trying to push. The three spirit stone items allow for both single taget and aoe damage to be used and the 80 stack of gold allows for constant ganks and map pressure, while still allowing junglers to receive gold. While wriggles does the exact opposite, by gaining a 35% gold gain on killing monsters **you will not receive the same amount of bonus gold as the spirit stone line unless you are constantly farming for it**. By this mechanic, if a wriggle's user stops farming they are penalized for the possible gold they could have gained.\n\n\nNow, that I have talked about the trade offs, lets assume the best case scenario and the enemy team does not push their advantages, take towers, and does not counter jungle you, **all this should happens due to your lack of pressure**. If this happens, then yes, you will annihilate your enemies late game (45 to 50 minutes in)with your feral flare. **You will be unkillable and will be able to solo baron with ease**; a constant jungle clear in a real game can produce around 60 to 70 stacks around the forty minute mark. This means you will be doing around around 100 magical damage with each auto attack healing for around 80 and will be doing around three hundred magical damage to minions. This is is bit strong, and needs to be changed somewhat.\n\n\nRiot was trying to reintroduce carry jungles to the game to **relieve the constant jungle pressures** and to allow other champions to be viable junglers, as well as introduce an item to champions who rely on auto attacks or use mana, to come into play.\n\n\n\nNow, how can this item be changed? First, it needs to be changed where it c**annot stack with the spirit line**. Next the problem with the current live item is not the damage that it gives, one damage is meager when you compare it to so many other champions. The problem is the **life steal like passive that you gain with the damage, it needs to scale a lot lower or be removed**. It is what allows for constant sustain in team fights, easy baron, and allows you to stay in the jungle longer. If health gain can be lowered, I think this item with be seen how it should be; a niche jungle item for auto attack champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxPierrot","date":"2014-04-08T13:58:31.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Long post incoming!\n\nTank option junglers that benefit of golem used to be a thing in season 3, down to the point where a tank is highly beneficial for the team and I loved the item myself, nowadays, Elise is the only viable golem around since she has decent base damages, an execute and sustain to keep her decently high in the jungle.\n\nNow all other golem options (your nautilus' and tanky ponys) became an underwhelming choice because of the fact that they can't duel the lizard option on a jungle invade, now lizard was good, I'm a big fan of the item and I don't see the necessity to nerf it to the ground so it's AS BAD as golem right now, but it's a good time to think as to why golem was nerfed in the first place.\n\nThe ammount of health that it gives for the money it costs makes it not an appealing option, tenacity is a great stat but you can't afford early tenacity it if you are getting smashed because the enemy used that same gold on damage and it's bullying you.\n\nNow tank junglers are viable, we saw it in urf, and I'd love to see more jungle sions and nauts and zacs flying around, I think their cooldowns should be looked at in game and tweaked a little, same with mana values to allow a tank to duel and try and outplay an invading jungler with skill and OUTSUSTAIN to wait for incoming help from lanes that's always a danger to an invading jungler.\n\nMake the item clear in the direction it's supposed to go, I'll stay in my jungle, farm and gank lanes when I see the opportunity, spend my money on wards for the team for them to be safe, become a tanky beast and help my teammates, and while I have no damage to bring forth in a duel, the low cd in my abilities combined with good cdr in my golem allows me to outplay, outsustain and, if I get help from my lane and a rapid response from my laner, get good damage and outtrade the invading jungler, as a reward for an active laner with good awareness.\n\nI feel riot in the fact that we need more diversity in junglers, and that lizard is vastly dominant, but reason is, both other options are underwhelming, all other champion playstyles are atypical, SHIFT the item direction into early game power for all 3 options (we have feral flare option for late game), higher base AP on wraith, gain less AP from each camp, Higher base health on golem, maybe gain hp per camp we kill or stack over time like ROA, look on tanky champs cooldowns and mana costs, not deliberatly go for the easy way out nerfing lizard because it's a popular pick but evaluate why noone is picking the other options.\n\nSorry for long post <3\n\n// TL,DR //, stop hitting elder lizard with a nerf bat just 'cause everyone and their sister is building it and try and make both other options, wraith and golem more appealing, trying to make different kinds of jungle styles be more appealing as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"HappilySoulbound","date":"2014-04-08T13:29:38.696+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"One issue with why tank junglers are not popular is that bruiser tops are currently hard to get away with.
