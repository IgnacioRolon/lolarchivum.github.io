Ever since graduating 5 and a half years ago, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege to work here at Riot on League. I started out in QA, eventually found myself in Design, led the Live Gameplay team for several years, and now I&rsquo;m getting the opportunity to lead the Champion Update team. \r\n\r\nTo me, gaming isn&rsquo;t just a hobby, it&rsquo;s a lifestyle. I prefer games that allow you to deeply invest into them, and that ultimately reward you with awesome, memorable experiences when you do so. Some people would also say I really just like games with &ldquo;phat loot,&rdquo; which I really can&rsquo;t deny. Before joining Riot, I played Call of Duty 1 and 2 competitively, dueled countless others in Diablo 2, and placed in the top 10 during LoL&rsquo;s beta before release.\r\n\r\nOutside of games, I am big into music and hip hop dance. I am also infamously overly invested into KPop.\r\n\r\n**WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT? WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT NEXT YEAR?**\r\nThis year, I focused on doing some of the larger-scale reworks including Gangplank, Darius, Miss Fortune, and Corki (I know some of you already have your pitchforks out - sorry!). Going into the next year, I&rsquo;ll be stepping into a leadership role on the Champion Update team, helping set the vision for which champions we work on and helping guide the designers on the team to ensure that we consistently deliver faithful reworks that don&rsquo;t just simply change a champion, but rather enhance who they are.\r\n\r\nOutside of individual champions, the Champion Update team has also done a lot of work to better identify and categorize the classes of champions that actually exist in LoL. As League and our shared understand of the game has matured, the generic vocabulary and concepts we used have (until recently)  somehow stayed exactly the same (&ldquo;Fighter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mage,&rdquo; etc.). Terms like the &ldquo;Juggernaut&rdquo; originate from the team&rsquo;s analysis across the entire roster of champions, and we&rsquo;re looking to continue to expand upon these class definitions in the coming year.\r\n\r\n**WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?**\r\nI will largely be focusing on each of the individual reworks we&#039;ve recently released and the ones we plan to release in the coming year. Specifically, we want to continue to give you guys more insight into who we&rsquo;re working on, why we&rsquo;re working on them, and where we think we succeeded and failed on each project after they&rsquo;ve had time to breathe on the live servers. You may also see posts from me talking a bit more in-depth about our updated perspectives on the champion classes as we continue to define and explore our roster.\r\n\r\n**WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME?**\r\nThis is definitely an open question that I&rsquo;d be interested to know about. I&rsquo;ve experienced a ton of League as it has evolved over its history, so I feel I can provide pretty broad insights about the game as a whole. Hopefully you guys give me easy questions, but you probably won&#039;t. =/","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2015-12-17T21:59:05.471+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Do you feel like Mordekaiser's rework was a success and that you're able to balance him accordingly for the longer term?\n\nHow about his thematics, does he really fit the vision of an undead General bent on eternal Conquest?\n\nI personally think he doesn't really live up to his expectations and that he's got a LOT of potential that's simply left untapped due to him having received a pretty low scale rework instead of a full blown one that would have explored his themes and really made him a character befitting the title of Iron Revenant.\n\n\nWhat's your personal opinion on the matter and would it be too crazy to assume he'd be on that fabled rework list once more?","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2015-12-18T00:20:44.341+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hopefully we largely addressed this with the previous Morde threads, but I'll reiterate again.

There apparently was consensus that it is better to then move on to other champs. What are your thoughts on this and why? \n\nI found his trust argument lacking. I have a lot more trust towards following through on work and finishing a job instead of leaving it half done, for (let's be honest) years at a time. Cass, in the opinion of the design team from what I understand, moved from a C to a B. For me she moved from a C+/B- to whatever grade champs I don't want to play are (F?). She isn't going to get any more work probably until 2017 with the focus on Yorick, Taric (both justified) and Shen (not so much).\n\nYou can find the post in here a few questions down:\n\nhttps://m.ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2015-12-18T18:30:24.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'm still with Ghostcrawler on this one.\n\nWe should be prioritizing whatever work delivers the most value to the game, so if we get a champion from a C to a B, even if we were shooting for an A, that champion is still better off than the other champions who are still C's.\n\nTrust me, it doesn't feel good to leave work in a non-ideal state, but that's an honest part of any job.

This is as big of a problem as the health of a champion. And probably the bigger problem is they are left in a still, at least, a somewhat unhealthy state. So the champion is stuck in a kind of unhealthy state for at least a year (probably longer) where people who enjoyed playing them before don't want to play them.\n\nThis is like replacing the bags of potato chips in a lunch line with salads with ranch dressing. But what's the point of replacing the chips with the salads if nobody buys the salads and the salads are only a little bit healthier than the chips.

I really don't think we made him less fun - our big fault is that we failed to move the needle and make him undoubtedly more fun.\n\nWell I'm not talking about playrate. I was a Poppy main before the rework, so I know all about low playrate does not mean not fun as old Poppy was really fun to play as. What I'm talking about is that before, yes a lot of people didn't exactly like playing him, but there was some that did. Now I haven't talked to a single person I know, or have really seen any posts, or really any comment anywhere saying that they enjoy the new Mordekaiser. Yes, I know the lack of seeing such comments does not mean these new Morde lovers don't exist. I am sure they do. And statistically they must. And there are some really cool and fun things about new Morde, like Ghost Dragon. But when in general the overwhelming people in a game don't enjoy having the champion in their game whether it is on their team (i.e. supports supporting morde), the enemy, or the morde player itself, this speaks to a bigger issue.\n\nAlso a little off topic, but from my perspective I don't find most of the new champions that have come out fun to play as. So I'm not the biggest fan of the modern standards of fun (yes I understand that this might be tainting my position in this Morde/Cass discussion, but I am trying my best to be neutral - probably failing though). In general new champions are too bloated mechanically or have a mini game which I don't like. I prefer simple champions that are more point and click and have very grokable power. In fact only two of my commonly played champions over the years haven't been significantly reworked in some way - Leona and Nasus. The rest - AP Yi, Gragas, Garen, Morde, Poppy, Zilean - have all been changed in some pretty big ways. And out of all those the only one that I still enjoy playing is Poppy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SettDownShutUp","date":"2015-12-19T15:05:55.674+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm rather interested then what the numbers will show next patch with W on Allied minions becoming a thing.

The question should rather be how many people are fine with Poppy as-is, vs how many people want her to change. Once again, undecided people can't be used as a positive or a negative, they're ambivalent.

Setting it up to land its Malphite R on enemies by locking them down or forcing them into choke points was always exciting. It was also just fun to follow-up on it if it ever managed to connect with the Malphite R.\n\nThat said, it was extremely tank-y and represented a lot of raw power that enemies had to deal with - this made it fairly frustrating to play against since you often felt you were fighting a 1v2, 2v3 or 5v6. It also would have required a ton of art resources to create an entire new model with animations and the such.\n\nWe even brainstormed ideas where the Pirate Gundam would detonate barrels for GP or even set him up with interesting barrel patterns for GP to utilize but we never got to test any of that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2015-12-17T22:48:13.583+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any updates on getting Zyra a new passive?\n\nAlso, if Nocturne were to be reworked, which direction would you possibly take him?

So my question is, how far along is this rework, and can you comment on how much of his current theme will be staying (shovel, hunchbacked lumbering giant)?  Because aesthetically Yorick is FAR from the worst champ in the game, he is solidly in the middle for visual fidelity.  This rework excuse for the no skins is wearing thin.   \n\nAnother quick question, do you have any insight into why it seems like certain champions are tweaked and tweaked and tweaked relentlessly patch after patch until they are where you guys feel they should be?  Examples would be Nidd, Kass, Rengar and Kha off the top of my head.  all of these champs went through what felt like months of every single patch had small changes or full on ability reworks.   From a player point of view, it was annoying to see what seemed like Riot's pet champions of the moment getting change after change where champions like Nocturne for example didn't see a single positive change for over 3 years.\n\nThanks for your time, you k-pop obsessed b-boy","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2015-12-18T00:25:21.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick is on our current list, but the team is currently more largely focused on Taric.
