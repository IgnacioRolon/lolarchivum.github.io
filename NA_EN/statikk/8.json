Unfortunately, this won&#039;t exactly be happy news, but it&#039;s important for us to be honest with you guys on our analysis and direction.\n\nSo here&#039;s our thoughts on Solo Morde:\n\n* **Solo Morde currently has a very brittle, unhealthy gameplay pattern**\n * Majority of his gameplay is unavoidable and inevitable (especially for melee opponents) - Morde can often feel like a brick wall of statistics where neither sides&#039; actions or skill matter\n  * Morde has poor fallback patterns - he lacks effective ways to respond or contribute meaningfully when he gets behind due to his pure damage focus\n* **Pushing Morde into the duo lane helps remedy a lot of these issues by adding teammate and enemy interactions into the mix**\n * Morde&#039;s (or his opponents&#039;) success cases are much more nuanced and variable in a duo lane - many more elements are at play\n* **Morde&#039;s kit naturally lends itself to duo lane interactions**\n * Unlike champions like Garen who are completely self-focused, Morde has tools like an ally-shield and extreme dependence on ally utility like CC to succeed\n * Although very melee, Morde&#039;s E gives him some ability to engage with and shrug off ranged opponents\n * Morde&#039;s juiciest and primary R targets are Marksmen who he can consistently encounter in the duo lane\n* **Morde will continue to be primarily balanced around his duo lane potential**\n * Pushing Morde into the duo lane gives him a unique and interesting place in the League roster\n * We strive to keep Solo Morde viable as an alternative playstyle, and want to look for ways to add or improve his gameplay health in solo lanes\n\nCurrently, we see Morde as a bit on the weak side as a whole, so we&#039;re looking into potential changes to bump his power up a bit across the board in the near future. We are also looking at opportunities to experiment with giving Morde healthier ways to interact in the solo lane so that we can better tune him between the different playstyles.\n\nOnce again, I know this is not the most exciting news for some, but it is our honest direction. I&#039;ll try to stop by to clarify or elaborate on any points that need it.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2015-12-12T07:31:53.604+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know why Mordekaiser's Solo lane used to be so \"unhealthy\"?\n\nBecause besides him not really interacting with his opponents he lacked windows of power.\nDarius has his Noxian Might\nGaren got his Villain Mechanic\nSkarner has his Spires\nRyze got his passive\n\nMordekaiser could work as a solo laner if he'd be given windows of power where he'd excel in while giving ways to his opponents to abuse the downtime of said power.\n\nSomewhere along the lines of nerfing his shield gain down to 10-20% but making his W increase his shield gain over its duration and maybe give him MR/Armor to make the best out of the shield he'll gain.\n\n\nI think this is where you guys could definitely work on.\n\nAlso, His Base stats are so laughably weak that he gets bullied by almost anyone in lane.\nI'm not asking for giving him Darius levels of health (2300) but his low base MS, Armor and Health make him susceptible to ganks, especially top.\nBumping his health a bit up wouldn't hurt all that much I guess.\n\n\nEdit;\nI've reached the point where I think a full blown rework's NEEDED.\nHeck, I wouldn't even mind him losing all of his abilities as long as he finally lives up to his champion vision.

I don't think there was ever a single *serious* Morde player who actually enjoyed that change (or at least I certainly didn't). The problem is that if Morde gets dragon, a team-wide buff objective, then he ALSO gets at least one tower and maybe a kill or two. It is *WAY* too much power loaded into a single skill when he doesn't really need it.\n\nIf it really is absolutely necessary, at least make it so that Morde has to **cast his ult on dragon** to actually capture it, so at least there is some resemblance of risk/tradeoff/decision making. Simply autoing the dragon once and walking away in order to get that kind of massive boost in power seems like something that was majorly overlooked.\n\n* **Third:** PLEASE for all that is unholy and Mordekaiser-esque, STOP balancing Morde around his ultimate. The defining characteristic of Morde, playing as him, playing against him, and the entire possibility that he could even be considered a juggernaut is **HIS PASSIVE SHIELD**. Quit loading more and more power into his ult, and *making his shield the gimmick* What Morde truly needs is a whole redefining on how his shield works for him, and then basing his kit around that.\n______________________________\nHonestly, Morde needs a full-blown rework. Again. He needed one before this rework, and he certainly needs one now. I honestly don't mind playing Morde in a bot lane, I just do not agree with how it was done. In order to make Morde less of a binary and simple champion, what he really needs is **interesting ability interaction (both with enemies and his own abilities)**, **a thought-provoking means of counterplay (not simply \"kiting\")**, and **abilities that involve a certain degree of skill to use most effectively**. I understand that this is extremely hard to pull off without giving Morde CC, mobility, or absurd gimmicks (regular gimmicks are fine, just not dragon-sized ones) but I believe that it can be done because Rito has done such an excellent job with so many other characters and reworks. But sometimes you need to go back to the drawing board.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArithianFlame","date":"2015-12-12T01:54:05.669+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":8,"body":"_Very brittle, unhealthy gameplay pattern_\n\nYou mean like outleveling the enemy botlane with a shoe-horned passive, and playing whackamole with that utterly broken Q?\n\nBuffs.

My only interest in this discussion is that I am a support main (when I eventually, hopefully do finally reclaim a computer setup that is reliable enough to play the game for real again) and therefore the health of the duo lane impacts my enjoyment of the game. \n\nJust getting that statement out of the way. I have a couple of rambling questions I'd like made in regards to my particular perspective.\n\n1) I know it's probably not in the cards for the short term, but do you think Mordekaiser is going to need a more extensive rework to make him a livable experience in the duo lane? More precisely, do you intend to alter his \"ball of stats\" feeling in the long run? \n\nAs a support player, I was overjoyed to see some new depth added to the marksman class recently. I guess this is the opposite side of the grudge which solo Mordekaiser players would feel being tethered to me, but it doesn't particularly excite me to have Mordekaiser as a lane partner. The \"point your statball in a direction and help them not die\" gameplay can be fun later in the game at sporadic intervals when this kind of champion which is usually found alone in top lane finally has some relevance on your life, but I think he feels like a bit of a drudge to play beside during the laning phase compared to who my alternative partners might be.\n\n2) If you did find that Mordekaiser needs a really hefty rework to the point of losing significantly more traditional elements to really feel healthy in the duo lane experience, would you instead be more inclined to try rebuilding the champion towards his solo lane roots or do you think there is a better opportunity to be explored in the duo lane?","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2015-12-12T05:33:51.817+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"1. That's a good point. We probably should have invested even more efforts into making the \"playing with\" Mordekaiser experience more enjoyable especially given how dramatic the shift was.

Given the feedback I'm currently seeing in this thread, it feels like we may have missed on all 3 fronts, which frankly sucks if it's true.\n\n2. Mordekaiser was definitely a lesson in picking the right scope for the right project. In a lot of ways, we over-reached on the Mordekaiser project and it's bitten us pretty badly. If we are limited to doing smaller scope explorations, work is probably best suited towards optimizing the duo lane experience that he is directed towards.

Riot may have \"heard\" players before the rework was released. (almost universally hated being forced duo) But Riot seemed to go ahead with the thought \"we know best\". And for as long as Riot tries to make him a duo lane champion, he will either be very over powered just off numbers, or he will be useless. There is NO possible way to balance him with his current kit. So he's just going to be dumpstered until he either gets put back into solo lane (as an AP juggernaut) or has a Sion level rework.

I think a lot of his problems would be solved if he either got some sort of more reliable repositioning ability or some utility that isn't reliant on damage.

Fair enough, but what was delivered in the end was a huge burst opportunity on something that required enemy mionions to be around and have flash off CD.\n\n2) You wanted him to be in a duo lane and for this you made his kit heavily reliant on the presence of a team mate.

At least Nasus in particular they have historically stated being okay with from a gameplay perspective.

However in your attempt to preserve the morde feel you shoved him bot lane and changed his kit enough to strip him of his identity...quite frankly I'm not getting the morde feel at all. He functions like a completely different champ. Yet you still want to keep him bot lane as kiting practice? He is a joke....running around getting kited and laughed at by both enemies and allies. It's a train-wreck. Stop worrying about preserving morde because there is nothing to preserve. I don't know how many people will agree with me but instead of maintaining this pathetic iteration of his identity, I would rather you rebuild morde into a solo lane juggernaut that has some feel of the old morde but not necessarily the same kit. Bot lane morde still feels like a giant middle finger to me. Even before the nerf when he was considered extremely strong, he just wasn't satisfying to play as.

You have a guy who's undying, because no matter how many times they tear him apart, he comes right back to life because of his remains. \n\nNow you have gone from the man using the Black Mist to his benefits and coming back from the dead no matter how many times you try banishing him.\n\nTo a guy who is stuck with a duo lane partner to really make him shine. And when he does it's in an unhealthy manner.\n\nI think it's in the best interest of everyone that you just do a full rework. His fantasy should be of a one-man wrecking crew, a true warlord as he was depicted. He also just needs base stat buffs. His movement speed is just downright atrocious, and can't catch up to people without having to rely on other people. That's not how Mordekaiser works as a character, and should not work like that in terms of gameplay either. He's slow, clunky, and just overall weird. He needs a full rework, a new model even to make his slow movements look more smooth like Garen or Illaoi.\n\nDo something with the Black Mist even. We keep hearing about how he has the ability to enhance his powers through the use of the Black Mist, yet we don't get to really see it put to action. We get the satisfaction of \"no escape\" from Thresh, the fast moving onslaught of terror that's Hecarim (or at least USE to), and the powerful magics of Karthus (also use to). Kalista's concept of binding together as a contract for vengeance is also clearly conveyed in the game, yet Mordekaiser is the odd man out. You talked about how spamming E and building glass mage was contradictory to this man and yet not only our we increasing his AP scaling ratios_ yet again but now we're buffing the E as well._\n\nIt's just silly to try and rework him, get something wrong, and then try to buff him only to have him slowly inch back to square 1. You may just have to change his abilities around. Keep the Q for sure, but maybe change the E a bit, and even the W. Throw in the Black Mist too to convey who he is. Hell, even Leoric's passive from Heroes of the Storm, or even Leoric as a whole would be a good reference to how Mordekaiser should feel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlasimuthe","date":"2015-12-28T07:42:33.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about adding a slow onto his E, because he really needs a way to stick to his enemies.

Rekindling the flame that was Morde's E is a good start, but it would need a lot more to make a difference - even in bot lane. This was once the staple of mordekaiser's success, and now it acts as more of a shield than his actual shield. Imagine that.\n\nDirect quote via _Statikk_: \"(a) Majority of his gameplay is unavoidable and inevitable (especially for melee opponents) - Morde can often feel like a brick wall of statistics where neither sides' actions or skill matter.\"\n\nHere's another: \"Unlike champions like Garen who are completely self-focused, Morde has tools like an ally-shield and extreme dependence on ally utility like CC to succeed\"\n\n^This is morde NOW, not morde THEN. When your team even admitted that they overstepped their bounds with the arbitrary juggernaut rework, shouldn't the correct approach be to undo the damage rather than put lipstick on a pig? It's frustrating to see that the only solution in mind is to mask the fact that they messed up by messing up even further, and making it look intelligent to some degree. News flash; Stupid is still stupid - even after the second pass.\n\nAs a long-time mordekaiser main, I was around for the days when Sunfire Cape stacked, and I can assure you, he was a lot less \"healthy\" back then than he has ever been. Old morde actually had a fair amount of counterplay - in that he could be easily taken down from a distance, yet was a formidable opponent for any who dared a close-quarter skirmish. His sustain and damage had the ability to be counterplayed, negated, and shut down at early levels (much like ANY other champ with a so-called \"end game fantasy\"). Morde was an excellent mid and top laner, and countered many of the old meta assassins - whilst still bearing the potential to be obliterated by other viable mages - like Lux, Zyra, Syndra, Etc. \n\nLately, I would say that his counterplay now is not so much dictated by his skill, kit, or lack thereof, but by his lane partner. He exists now as a self-sustaining, giant minion who acts as a shoulder cannon for his support whenever an enemy is dumb enough to slip into range of his Q. If anything, I can't think of another champion who is more dependant on his team. Is that not unhealthy? Even URGOT has the ability to pick his lane, yet Morde is the kind of 2nd tier carry (yes, even that is an overstatement at this point) who is given little choice in where he remains viable.\n\nI feel that the safest way to balance morde is to bring him relatively close to where he was pre-5.16 (and by the looks of the current W and E changes, that seems to be the right direction). Having tested countless builds on both NA and the PBE over the past months, I have concluded that Morde is not so much too weak or too strong, but rather boring. He lacks the intrigue to keep him fun, or even exciting. He lacks both the unique qualities and juggernaut feel that he used to - even after the so-called \"juggernaut\" rework that stripped this very quality from him. I've  voiced these concerns on the PBE until I'm blue in the face, yet to no avail. Many would agree when I say that there are definite ups and downs to his new Q and ult passive, yet what made Morde a champion at heart is somewhat dead. \n\nI get the impression that Rito secretly feels that their current duo lane rework is the \"greater of two evils\" (especially given the blatant balance issues highlighted by ban picks at Worlds), yet they still speak as if the old morde is somehow less healthy that he is in his current state. I'm not sure why they continue to cling to the bot lane delusion - especially after the AD itemization changes made him completely irrelevant there, and it's not like duo top is a meta that spans outside the realm of lv. 10 summoners. I see what they mean about not being happy, but I don't think they care about just how unhappy we really are. No matter how educated our opinions may be, and no matter how grounded in fact our arguments are, this is not our game, and Rito has made this very clear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2015-12-12T23:17:27.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whelp... as a Morde player I believe We should look at him thematically.\n\nThematically: he is a slow, lumbering tank who wants to smash your face.\n\nHow he is as now: nick enemies with E and only go in if your cetain of obliterating the enemy, else your gonna be kited to death running at or away from them.\n\n\n\nPlease...
