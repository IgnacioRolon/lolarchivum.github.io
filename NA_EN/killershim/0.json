No jungler would contest a 1 v 2 vs funnel and a laner would react late(even in pro scene) to scuttle respawn because he has to clear the already pushed wave.

I just think it is a dumb complaint since it not only ONLY affects tiamat users, but it also ONLY affects tiamat users that have the most gold on their team. \"Wah I lose 60 gold on the wave when I already have more gold than everyone else\". It's too bad that it is still worth covering lanes for basically free exp that would be lost to the tower and setting up the creeps for when your laner gets back. Out of the like top 15 junglers only Lee, Trundle, Shaco, and Rengar buy tiamat and Lee doesn't really NEED to buy it. An argument can be made for the other 3, but only Trundle is going to actually be touching enough lane creeps for it to matter. He is also the one that is actually going to finish his jungle item early. Rengar and Shaco are much better ganking than splitting since by not being visible on the map they apply so much pressure that sitting in a side lane is a waste of time ESPECIALLY since Shaco pushes slow as hell even with Tiamat.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KillerShim","date":"2018-07-24T19:09:26.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:427}} ?","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2018-07-24T19:36:12.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ivern SHOULD be finishing Cinderhulk earlier than he does.

I'm plat in flex and have been in soloq a couple of seasons, not much better, but I can offer some advice to help curb that ignorance you spew out. Don't need to thank me.\n\nNot all junglers finish their jungle item, not all junglers rush it. It is not them being bad, it is their champion lacking in some area that needs to be addressed before finishing the jungle item. If WW/Shaco/Ivern as examples between others rush their jungle item they lose a lot. Now they are either punished for rushing their jungle item or, in the case they do, punished for helping out their team by holding lanes. This is not a trade off, but a net loss.\nThink about it.
