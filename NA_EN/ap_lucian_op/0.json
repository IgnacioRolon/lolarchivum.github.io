I&#039;m a Diamond V Twisted Fate main. I&#039;ve been studying a lot of high ELO Twisted Fate players to really get a better understanding of the champion.\r\n\r\nMy main focus will be on improving games through game knowledge. I will most likely go over pretty much anything except for runes because there are plenty of resources available for finding the optimal rune setup for any champion.\r\n\r\nMain method of coaching will be through analysis of replays or live game analysis via screen-sharing. Send me a message if you are interested and would like to learn more!\r\n\r\nCurrently, I will offer the first lesson for free, but will charge a fee of $5 per lesson afterwards if you enjoy my style of coaching and would like to keep going.","replies":[{"poster":"Red Wreckage","date":"2018-01-12T06:59:41.536+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
