They really do some amazing champion trailers on time to time and they clearly have the budget for it.  I would really like to see the story of league of legends in a couple of movie series.\r\n\r\nThey have more than enought tools for it so why not ?:D \r\nWe've all seen some really good trailers from Riot ,  is the Varus trailer which is really amazing. Perfect graphics perfect story.","replies":[{"poster":"Nekorus","date":"2019-08-22T18:24:42.226+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"the 5 minute animations they make take 7 months to create so imagine a 1 hour movie and think about how long thats gonna take.","replies":[{"poster":"GayrensTari","date":"2019-08-22T18:29:09.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nekorus,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=wcaNUR6L,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-22T18:24:42.226+0000)\n>\n> the 5 minute animations they make take 7 months to create so imagine a 1 hour movie and think about how long thats gonna take.\n\nYea, plus, nobody even take it canon even if they made it, like the cinematic movie where garen and katarina competing with each other and killing each other.\n\n\"the might of demacia has to love the sinister blade! and has to hate the shield of valoran!\" priceless.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-08-24T09:51:42.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean the cinematic where their summoned clones fight it out?\nInfinity Edge not actually them themselves?\n\nEdit: I'm not even gonna fix that auto correct.

I've read all the materials you can possibly find to come to the conclusion katarina and garen are competitiors, sometimes bros, but mostly competitors, and Taric and garen are soulmates, who had to seperate due to many complicated factors. \n\nYou are welcome to  further disccuss about it with me if you want.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sent Nudess","date":"2019-08-22T19:18:05.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"i think they can do faster than that , still would wanna watch an 1 hour demacia yordle and darkin movie","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-08-22T19:38:10.418+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok then, what would be the story?
