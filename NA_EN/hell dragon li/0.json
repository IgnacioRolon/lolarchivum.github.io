Trying to move his account from the EUNE server back to NA server after finishing our deployment overseas, but it will not allow him or I to purchase Riot Points to make the transfer. Is there any other options we can take to transfer his account?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-23T19:24:57.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your friend on the updated client?  He may need to return to the legacy to process RP Purchase or a transfer:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nOtherwise, are there any errors he's getting?","replies":[{"poster":"Hell Dragon Li","date":"2017-01-22T22:01:39.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your help, we have been able to log in and attempt to purchase RP, however it seems that our cards are now being denied as we are no longer overseas. Is there anyway for us to purchase RP for that specific region online? If not, what are our other options?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-24T16:28:20.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha!  RP Cards are specific to their own region, so it's not possible for example to use EU RP Cards on NA.  Maybe we can work something out; though, I really can't make any guarantees.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our billing team will look into this individually with you.  We'll reply back asap!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
