I received a key fragment, but no chest.\r\n\r\nAccording to my profile, I have three chests available.  Nasus has not received a chest this season (this is my very first game with him).  I have before received a chest on my very first game as Sona when a teammate ranked at S, so I believe I should have received one.\r\n\r\nIt may have to do with the fact that as Nasus, I have received no \"season highest grade.\"\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a photo showing that 1) I have 3 chests available, 2) I played as Nasus today, 6/8/2017, and 3) I did not receive a chest or \"season highest grade\" for the game.\r\n\r\nI sadly see no way for me to look up the ranks of my fellow teammates, only my meager rank \"B\".  If anyone knows of a way to look up the rankings of all the players in a game, please let me know.  I did not think to take a photo before I left the endgame results page.\r\n\r\nThank you.  I know this may not be seen, or easy to resolve, so I understand if you skip this.  I just thought I'd try.\r\n\r\nSee you out on the rift. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"KJGrenadier","date":"2017-06-08T18:15:55.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may have figured out, after reading through the riot webpage again.\n\nIt says \"When you or someone in your premade party earns any S rank, you’ll acquire a chest.\"  Should I assume that means that the only teammates who can help me gain chests are teammates I invited before I entered into the game queue?\n\nBasically, if I go in like this photo, only I can help me earn a chest.
