We've learned that this is a known issue with 2007 or older macs. This is likely the cause of your issue. It seems that the new launcher is taking up too much ram on those older machines. We are working on a patch and hopefully it will come out soon so you can get back in game!\n\nLudusBonus\nRiot Games Player Support\n\nI have a 2006 Mac Pro running el captain with 2 3.0 quad core processors and 21 Gb of ram.","replies":[]},{"poster":"emarythomp2","date":"2017-06-01T20:07:16.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same issue on my mac too.
