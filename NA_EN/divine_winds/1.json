Sometimes, when someone is telling you to do something, they&#039;re trying to be the shotcaller. It is infuriating, and as you argue, you realise they&#039;re right. You lost an argument. I&#039;ve seen so many people flame, or simply not do things like &#039;farm under turret&#039; in order to spite their teammates. And that&#039;s sad. If you know someone is trying to win, and they tell you to play safe, or not to baron, don&#039;t take it badly. Because most of the time, they&#039;re trying to help.\r\n\r\nThis applies to real life too. There&#039;s no point in arguing a fact that you don&#039;t know much about. And it&#039;s always frustrating to be on the losing side. Sometimes you need to accept that you lost and move on, not stoop so low as to insult your own teammate.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2017-01-09T07:21:48.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's true most people don't listen to advice. But it's generally because the guy giving 'advice' is also flaming you and doing obnoxious things like ping spamming you when you get ganked instead of helping you. Not always the case, but that is generally why people ignore them. \n\nI've rarely seen people give legitimate advice, and even when they do, they can't seem to resist also adding in some insults to their 'advice'. If people could learn to give advice without insulting the other person (very easy to do) this wouldn't happen so much.  Add that to the fact people usually already know the advice the person is giving, it's just that they're getting outplayed by better opponents, so the advice is kind of a mockery in those situations because it's assuming the person is losing because they are very bad.\n\nAn example of good non flaming advice: \"vayne play safe under tower until you get a few levels you can gain advantage back after some good csing\"\n\nWhat I usually see instead: \"stop feeding noob f****!!!!!!!\" (ping '?' all over your corpse after you die) how are you losing as vayne kys!\"\n\nAn example of good advice with unnecessary flame thrown in: \"vayne play safe stop feeding fu**\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-09T04:38:33.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reality is known to the state of denial to cause cancer.","replies":[]}]}
