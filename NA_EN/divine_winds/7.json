Stealing cs on purpose when they are IN lane or farming more than is needed to last hit, reset, or set up a freeze for your teammate is bad. I can't count on all my fingers and toes how many times I've fallen a full level behind due to having to respect the enemy jungler just sitting in bush toplane after my jungler ruined a freeze I'd set up before basing and gave my opponent one. That can easily lead to a full level lead for your opponent and ruin item timings leading to a free lane for a champ that should be getting bullied.  If the laners are about equal in skill and the jungler camps for the guy with a level lead, that can be the entire difference in the game.\n\nThat's why you have to THINK about what you are doing. Sometimes clearing out a wave is good (even if your laner is too low elo to realize  it) and sometimes it's best left untouched or minorly trimmed.
