There r items to be looted (Tri force weapons,  botrk, AOe weapon, the wands, rings) \r\nPlayers get to form squads, choices of a lot of heroes, and to fly at a location of the large map at the beginning. There r also monsters and dragons that drop from the sky (like PUBG air drops), legendary items (like Tri force, hydra, or death cap) can be found upon killing them. \r\nMechanics r about the same.\r\nThere are circles as well\r\nLast player survive wins.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-09T08:15:53.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you played LoL lately?
