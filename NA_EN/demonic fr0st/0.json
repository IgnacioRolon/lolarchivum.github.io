Then my ping shot to 10k. I was able to reconnect for 30 seconds at a time after being dced for 2 minutes each time. Restarting the game didn't work.\r\n( On the first restart it said I was blocked by a fire wall which I know I am not and then proceeded to be let me connect on my next try. The second restart just stated \"failed to connect\" and then let me connect on my second try again.) \r\n\r\nRestarting my computer also didn't work. \r\n\r\nI went upstairs to see if being too far from the router was the case only to find that all the tvs were also lagging out. My mom stated that the show she was watching was skipping. The tv screen pixeled then would catch up after stopping for a couple of seconds. I managed to play and help my team a little bit with the best of my ability. The final part was when I dced, then the league game crashed and it ended with it saying we were defeated. Go figured since our fio was afk for the whole game and I was dced for most of it. \r\n\r\nOnce the game ended EVERYTHING in my house went to normal. The phone was fine, the cable was fine and my connection to everything else on the internet was restored. I was playing ash on urf and it was my most recent game. It could be a problem on my side but having my network suddenly restored after the game ending made me suspicious. Is there anything to explain this event? Any who, I wish every one a good day ^~^.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-07T22:50:53.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're suffering from some packet loss.  This can happen with an unstable connection, and a wireless connection can certainly do that.  The quality of service (download speed) provided by your ISP subscription could be a factor too.
