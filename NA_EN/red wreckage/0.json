Got S- on Udyr.  I've never gotten and S/S-/S+ on Udyr before too.  But at match end, I didn't get any chest!!  There was another player(Sivir) who got an S, but they got their chest?  \nI did get 4 chest last month.  From my knowledge, you can only get 4 chests per month.  But today it should've reset?  or not?  Anyone with more info. plz shed some light in here.  :D  \nAlso, will I get a chest if I get S or above with Udyr in future?  or is it marked or something for this season?  :S\n\nWhat happen rito???\n\nEdit: i just checked my profile and in champions, the chest icon on Udyr is lit.  like 4 other champions for whom I've earned a chest.  I think this one is lost somehow!!!  \nCan this be looked into?  :)\nty for ya time","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-04-01T21:20:35.538+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Checked out your account and looks like you already earned a chest on Udyr last week which can happen when someone else from your group earns an S.\n  \nWhat this means for you is that since you already received a chest on Udyr this season, you wouldn't get chests anymore from playing Udyr until next season. \n\nIf you're still curious how it all works,  check out the [Hextech Crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide on our support site, which has a lot of the general FAQ type information :D","replies":[{"poster":"Off Shade","date":"2016-04-02T04:30:03.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love how you have time to comment on these posts while tens of posts on mac client FPS dropping is completely ignored.

I know it's RNG but old players like me probably feel very bad about champion loot.\n\nI don't intend to rant but try to see it from our perspective, 6+ years with riot here and my support for you guys won't dabble one bit because of this, but just consider changing it somehow? even ward skins are a better option for us :S","replies":[{"poster":"Nazzadan","date":"2016-04-01T22:46:59.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hold on to the champion shards, they said they are going to implement something to use them on for the people that own everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-04-01T23:34:13.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I never read that, good to know then!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Grey Wolf","date":"2016-04-01T22:52:21.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RiotBok,\n\nI hate to tell you but that page doesn't go any near into enough depth.  There is serious lack of clarity when it comes to Hextech.  I had a nice discussion with support about it but when I asked them to pass it along to the folks working on Hextech they said they can't do that.  WTF?!?!
