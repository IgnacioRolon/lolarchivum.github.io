No damage in the world will save you from face checking a brush with 5 people in it and losing the game off it. Hell take a look at the LEC, Garen Bot winning, Soraka top with smite winning, Tristana mid winning, and you're here so afraid to upset the meta that you can't buy an item that isn't in your recommended tab.\n\nYou can't copy pro builds cause pros are just that, professional players, playing a highly coordinated game with other professional players, with professional supports and still if they feel they need more defense they'll buy it, can't remember the team but they had a Varus with {{item:3047}} , how many of you would buy tabi on an AA heavy champ like Varus even if you're up against 4 ADs, i'd say less than 1%.\n\nCan't speak for all classes so i'll stick to what i know, ADCs. You have an item that literally gives you a shield equal to 30% hp, {{item:3046}} yet you'll trade it for the extra {{item:3087}} . You'll buy 5 damage items and then instead of getting a {{item:3139}} or {{item:3072}}  to literally heal for 200 a hit, while having either bonus mr and a cleanse or 300 extra HP shield,you choose to buy another pure damage item instead.\n\nLiterally just build this {{item:3006}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3072}}  ,bam, 20% lifesteal, 900hp shield (PD+BT) 45 armor and a damn revive if you get deleted or caught. And you won't even feel the difference in the damage, hell your Brand support will out damage you anyway by pressing R.\n\nMages, throw in an extra {{item:3102}} in there, hell build {{item:3040}} instead of {{item:3285}} , get a {{item:3151}} instead of a {{item:3135}} if the enemy isn't building any MR. \n\nPick a real damn support, not just {{champion:99}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:555}} \nPick a tanky jungler {{champion:113}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:33}} \nPick a tanky top laner instead of {{champion:157}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:126}} \n\nPick up a damn {{summoner:21}} instead of an {{summoner:14}} , pick some defensive runes, buy more defensive items, god knows you never do.\n\nDamage being high is a product of Riot power creeping the game as much as it is the product of the players mentality, where more damage = better. If a pro team can win the game with smite Soraka top, then don't tell me that you need to pick a mage support or an assassin jungler to win and that without 6 damage items,full damage runes and ignite you're surely going to lose cause you're \"literally\" dealing 0 damage.","replies":[{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-08-20T04:16:14.543+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":5,"body":"Tank items do not work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2019-08-20T04:13:51.106+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, thats because nobody really plays tanks...

This mean that you have to jump high and higher, not to overtake the defence system entirely like you could with the previous set up, but just so that you wouldn't be ridden with holes as the danger height went from &lt;50 cm above ground, to &lt;60, to &lt;70 and so on.\n> \n> You are FORCED to jump higher, and even when you do the threat is still equal; you still just barely avoid the shot even when you've already jumped a lot higher.\n> \n> That's the lethality.\n> \n> ......\n> ......\n> \n> And I haven't touched on the fact since it's still a flat pen, it means it still kills the non-armour stacking unit harder thanks to its passive growth.\n> \n> ......\n> \n> So in the grand scheme of things, lethality behaves like a % pen to armour stacking units, and behaves as an ever-growing flat pen to kill squishy harder as time goes on.\n> \n> It's effectively, the best of both flat and % pen. \n> \n> Lethality as a concept is simply, a mistake.\n> \n> ......\n> \n> And it's also worse because Riot made flat pen now calculated AFTER % pen.\n> \n> The current penetration in the game is just a flat out mistake that needs to be fixed.\n\nyour analogy falls flat because it's not really accurately portraying lethality vs flat armor pen.\nLet's use your corridor with guns to stay consistent. With the old flat pen system, you had guns that shot anything below 50cm. So if you could jump 50cm, you would never get shot.\nWith lethality, you have guns that start off shooting anything below 10 cm, then 20, then eventually after you've gone through the corridor 18 times, they reach 50cm. \n\nIf you can jump 50cm from the get go, the 10,20,30cm guns are completely useless and you have excess height. It's not until the 18th pass through that you barely clear them and need to be able to jump higher.\n\nIn the old system though, you had a maximum of 50cm worth of guns, whereas now by the 18th pass, you have something like 75cm available.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2019-08-20T09:17:16.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Full AP teams get completely shit on by tanky champs, Void Staff or no.","replies":[{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2019-08-20T09:40:21.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RavenMagus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xyenN0lR,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2019-08-20T09:17:16.767+0000)\n>\n> Full AP teams get completely shit on by tanky champs, Void Staff or no.\n\nAP dps champs or anti-tank (Brand) don't care much about MR.
