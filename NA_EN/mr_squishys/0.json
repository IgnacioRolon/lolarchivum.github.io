Everytime I try to log in I get a message saying that I failed to connect to PvP.net. I've used Riots repair thing and allowed it to take control of my firewall to allow aces, repatched ect. but I still can't get on.

In this case it sounds like your network is having problems connecting to the login servers.  I'm investigating reports of this in another thread, and I'd like your help as well.  If you are still having this issue, go through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to see if tuning up your network might help.
