To start off this post I would like to say my internet is 100% fine during any other game/browsing/surfing/streaming on the internet. However, every now and again, sporadically, while in a game of League my internet just breaks. I'm not talking a simple disconnect from the League servers, I'm talking more like my router completely stops working for anything and everything. I am on a wired connection and it almost seems like League is causing my internet to restart itself. During this process I have tried to open webpages and stuff to see what is working and I usually load up the page saying that I cannot find the DNS (server?) of anything and then redirects to the no internet connection page on chrome. Again my internet works 100% fine at any other time, except when I'm playing League. I have also looked into the connectivity issues page and went through changing my DNS or what have you and nothing has worked for me thus far. Anybody else having this same problem in the more recent patches? \r\n\r\n-Kind Regards\r\n   Zephyr \r\n\r\nP.S. I've been playing League for quite some time now and my issues are kind of reminding me of some of the old P2P connection issues with Pando that we had back in the day.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T03:35:30.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm yea it definitely sounds like something weird is going on with your connection, and it may actually be happening after it leaves your network and is on its way to our servers. If that connection gets damaged or loses bits of data along the way, you can experience some packet loss and start seeing champions sliding around or ignoring your commands. \n\nLet's run a quick test for packet loss to cover that base really quickly using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Grab your network logs from one of those games that froze up, let that reader scan them and grab a screenshot using something like Gyazo or Imgur to post here for me to look over.","replies":[{"poster":"CLG Zephyr","date":"2017-07-29T03:57:16.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/bxhvJMH\n\nHere is the imgur link of what your reader outputed. I re checked the recording and I dc'd around 11 mins into the game if that helps at all.

It could be mainly on the ISP side of things, but go ahead and reach out to our tech guys in a ticket with those logs to see if there's anything that we can adjust on your end.","replies":[{"poster":"CLG Zephyr","date":"2017-07-29T04:59:53.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do, thanks Broporo!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CLG Zephyr","date":"2017-07-29T01:12:17.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More info for those interested:\n\nI have talked with my ISP and they said that my internet should be working fine from their side. I have ran data line tests and such through them with no problems identified. \n\nThis problem seems to happen completely randomly, i go from a stable 35~ ping to disconnect anywhere from 2 mins into a game to 40 mins in a game. \n\nI have flushed my old DNS and updated to the one that Riot recommends on their connectivity issues page.\n\nMy system is currently running Windows 10 but this wasn't a problem until recently and I do not believe I have updated anything on the Windows side but I am open to all possible fixes.\n\n-Zephyr","replies":[]}]}
