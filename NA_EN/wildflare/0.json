After watching a skin preview on the skin spotlights youtube channel, I came to the conclusion that when in game the animation for the recall is buggy. Playing with the skin, as soon as I begin the recall animation it appears fine with the frog spawning and Rek&#039;Sai circling it. However, as soon as the animation moves for Rek&#039;Sai to jump and eat the frog, this specific animation never actually occurs. Instead, he just gets spawned into the middle where the frog was. I am sure this is a bug that I am not only experiencing.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-10T18:50:27.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nHave you rested it with the new patch?
