My ping is a constant 45 but jumps randomly but frequently throughout my game to up to 170 ping. Not sure what's going on with this, but I have a hard time believing it's my net with all the troubleshooting I've done.\r\n\r\nA lot of my friends have been saying they're experiencing ping spikes too, but I just want to see if it's a server problem for anyone else.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to get this fixed soon so I can make a late season surge to grind ranked because as of late I've been tanking games and my ping spikes have NOT been very helpful. \r\n\r\n[Speed Test Result](http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5694949478)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T20:46:57.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, what did your ISP tell you?
