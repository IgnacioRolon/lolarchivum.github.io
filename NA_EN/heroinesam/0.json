Sorry if I post this in the boards or something but I just didn't think it was horribly important enough to put somewhere else, so I hope it is in the right place.\r\n\r\nSo, I got a visa gift card to spend where I want and I wanted to buy skins and stuff buuuuuuuuut I see that your payment options don't include visa gift cards. Which is strange since you accept Subway gift cards. So I just wanted to know why you guys don't have Visa gift cards as a payment option since they are fairly common and not having it as an option forces some people to take their money elsewhere? Or am I just looking in the wrong place or doing something wrong? Please let me know! Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-20T02:31:39.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We do accept visa gift cards! You'll need to input that card info just like a normal credit or debit card though. It can be a little confusing since the options don't specifically say visa gift cards. Also keep in mind that you _may_ need to activate the gift card online before you'll be able to use it! \n\nYou can always check up on the different payment options [**here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/203701590-What-payment-methods-are-available-to-me-) as well.","replies":[{"poster":"HeroineSam","date":"2017-03-20T15:30:35.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
