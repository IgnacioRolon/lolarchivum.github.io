But now, for some reason, when I get in game, I have a frame rate of 2 frames per second and am getting a resulting kea of 0/8/0. I don't know why this is happening but it's quite annoying on top of everything that's been going on and I'm wondering if this is a common problem due to the preseason patch and - if so - when is this going to be fixed by? I appreciate any advice. Thank you!\n\nEdit: Also, my computer is just fine for I can open apps with ease, and go around the league home base with ease, only in-game do I have difficulty.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T02:43:13.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huge drops in FPS can generally be caused by a number of different factors, though the most common are display driver or hardware issues.

We'll need to dive into some system logs to pinpoint the exact cause of this issue.

Since that specific specialist will have access to your system logs, it will be far easier to troubleshoot this in that capacity. \n\nThere is a bit of a delay in response times, as the Beta Client has obviously been a hot topic for support lately, so you may need to remain patient for a bit longer.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"HeroineSam","date":"2016-11-25T17:04:33.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But through what medium will they get in touch with me?
