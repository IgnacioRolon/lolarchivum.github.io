They give us a new way to look at a champ, and allow for alternate interpretations of the character. So what are your five favorite skins? It&#039;d be awesome to hear what they are, and what your reasons are for liking them. You don&#039;t have to limit it to one skin per champ, just so you know. You also don&#039;t have to own the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are mine:\r\n\r\n5: Traditional Trundle\r\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/21/Trundle_Traditional_Screenshots.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/613?cb=20150508234801\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;m a trundle fan. Don&#039;t actually have him yet, but I like his gameplay. I also hate his theme. They traded a cool, unique character for a typical &quot;but he was smarter than the rest&quot; backstabbing minion character. I also hate that I didn&#039;t like him back when we likely last saw traditional trundle go on sale. It&#039;s an awesome skin that plays with the theme of rot and disease, a character type sorely lacking in leauge. Sure, we got Nasus, but he&#039;s more curses than rot. Unfortunately, Traditional Trundle still has some particles from his base skin, which clash with the rest of him, so he places lower on the list.\r\n\r\n4: Spirit guard Udyr\r\n\r\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ-GIYyuNygcJjpe-cmwxdf0ZaO-GAMDIl9fNe1IqfL3Eql7G04\r\n\r\nAnother skin I unfortunately lack, Spirit guard udyr does great justice to this awesome champ. With his evolving models and animal spirits, Udyr never looked better.\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Heartseeker Quinn\r\n\r\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Htn91IFOf5w/WGxJhMHZWyI/AAAAAAAAbOo/Y7yiLj1an8Ed3ktvYMfkRZuTeqY89E5wwCLcB/s1600/quinnfront.jpg\r\n\r\nQuinn is just a fun champ. I love split-pushing with her, I love leaping around with her, I love blinding with her, I love when you hit that w and tell your team that shaco is coming and they beat that little #### into hte ground. You know what makes her better? Being able to do this with a big-ass dove carrying her around the rift. This skin is fun and has a very different take on Quinn, and it&#039;s all for the better. While she doesn&#039;t look as good as early in the PBE, she still looks awesome in this skin, and has effects and sounds to match, earning her my #3 spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Elementalist Lux\r\n\r\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRH78_AKD4KHcnWiRS3Pon_AuRFMyst4A7_YJ5ZqhMpQxVorey\r\n\r\nThis is an awesome skin, and it was worth every penny. The forms have distinct feels, and each brings a new effect to the table, making games look flashier the longer they go on. I especially love the water and storm forms. It&#039;s a shame that water doesn&#039;t link into storm, but it&#039;s ok. I still got Mystic for when I want to mess around.\r\n\r\n\r\n1: Star Guardian Jinx\r\n\r\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQSG7-dZPw7xEgzhYchgNaDmAZQ2Kk3IEfn--8uhP196MN7AHdB\r\n\r\nIf you know me personally, you know I love Jinx. Not in that way. I still have some pride. But she&#039;s seriously an awesome champ. Awesome design, awesome gameplay, fun personality, etc. Now take all that and slap it into the magical girl genre, and you get the best skin in league of legends. She has awesome new particles, an amazing voice-over, the best non-canon shiptease, and snazzy animations. They manage to perfectly capture the awesomeness of Jinx but with a new feel and the most realistic work ethic ever. &quot;We&#039;re on a mission! Just don&#039;t remember what.&quot; We all are, Jinx. We all are.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose were my favorite skins, but I&#039;m far more interested in hearing what yours are!","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-03-11T19:44:26.396+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Captain Fortune - showed players the REAL Sarah Fortune\nPulsefire Ezreal - opened the floodgates for sci-fi skins\nSurprise Party Fiddlesticks - community idea that felt like a celebration for players and Riot and the only skin to ever get custom Ability Icons\nDJ Sona - totally unique experience\nGentleman Cho'gath - this skin makes you tilt proof, it's just too fun.

When he became the most gorgeous man to walk the earth, this skin got dramatically better. I love the edgy, sexy vampire look he's got going on, and I especially love the stone embedded in his chest. For now, on my beloved, it will be my favorite until something cute comes along. *COUGH*STARGUARDIAN*COUGH*\n\n2) Final Boss Veigar\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WVL6KpxHoH0/U-uvafYi8VI/AAAAAAAAVm4/-yUG7tC-1Y8/s1600/turnaround.jpg\nI love the nerdy, video game voice over so much, as well as the awesome pixel VFX. I especially love the voice lines \"ALL THE CAKE IS GONE!\" and \"HEY! LISTEN!\"\n\n3) Secret Agent Miss Fortune\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Z08wMxTqRs/VZ4tOmyf7II/AAAAAAAAEu4/-Hcdaw8wA1I/s640/mf3turn.jpg\nOf all of her skins, with the exception of Arcade, I think this one gives the most unique fantasy to Miss Fortune. I love the purple dress and the fact that you get to see her hair. The guns are nice too, in gold.\n\n4) Star Guardian Janna\nhttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W6W06yNjurc/V-GlJdB_H4I/AAAAAAAAUxc/Kww7wrzaTEMc7eydmJCy26ES8eaTQBW9wCLcB/s640/jannaturn.jpg\nI love Janna, and I love magical anime girls. This look for Janna is fantastic, and I love the update look to her hair and the adorable particles. Plus, Zephyr is cute too. Brownie points for the start game and the recall music.\n\nand\n\n5) Ghost Bride Morgana\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3NLOiaIVxOU/VS9ZLQKwCrI/AAAAAAAACaU/icvrMH6kiGk/s1600/morgturn.jpg\nThis skin is just awesome. I love the whole La Llorona myth this is based on from Latin American culture, and I think the ghost bride is a pretty great look for Morgana. Plus, I love brides and zombies, so this is a great mix.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\nRisen Fiddlesticks\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EfI7E_Z1h-A/VSXMrrYWkdI/AAAAAAAAn8s/dH2474TkKBk/s1600/fiddleturn.jpg\nI also like mummified zombies, so this is a fun skin too. I love the scarabs in place of crows, and the Egypt theme is just fun.\n\nProgram Camille\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vEcmsYeE_Ps/WDQvzV0oE4I/AAAAAAAAY3Y/yTm65x34KNc4rYd-kJ1n2digPUR9cifYwCLcB/s640/cam1turn.jpg\nI love this, more so than the PROJECT line - I love the play on her being an aggressive AI that's bent on deleting malfunctioning software or obsolete machines.","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackfootedfox","date":"2017-03-11T23:38:34.864+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"5: {{champion:41}} Dreadnova Gangplank\nI don't play Gangplank, but this skin has a theme that I LOVE. I watch anime from time to time, and it has a very anime feel (Super Galaxy does too but not in a dark, gritty way). It just opens some amazing possibilities for new skin ideas that can swirl around my head very easily.\n\n4: {{champion:10}} Iron Inquisitor Kayle\nThe splash art for this skin really drew me in as beforehand there wasn't anything else like it in my eyes. In game the skin matches so well with her particles you could mistake it for begin an awesome version of the base skin. The dark somber tones just match with the righteous fire.\n\n3: {{champion:29}} Medieval Twitch\nI wanted this skin ever since I learned of its existence (I started playing after Refer-A-Friend was shut down), and now that it's had its splash updated I'm salivating even more over it! Maybe one day they'll allow me to get it...\n\n2: {{champion:57}} Meowkai\nProbably my favorite joke skin in the game (although that Pug'Maw skin is interesting) and now that it has Chromas I'm for sure getting it next time I can. It's just so silly that it's great. I love it.\n\n1: {{champion:29}}  Pickpocket Twitch\nFirst skin I ever bought, it's what made me main my main, and I bought it purely for the Sly Cooper reference.

It has helped influence my life far more than a video game ever should.\n\n2)  Super Galaxy Rumble\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/kderuRbEyv0/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nI loved this skin before watching Gurren Lagann and I love it even more after.  It is smooth, streamlined, and has some of the most amazing quotes.\n\"Nothing can stop me.  Not even a wall of tigers with smaller tigers for teeth!\"\n\n3) Arcade Hecarim\nhttp://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/August_2013/gamescom_skins/Arcade_Hecarim_Splash.jpg\nIt is a mecha rainbow Unicorn that plays music.  What isn't to love?  This skin is starting to show it's age a bit but I still love it despite having had a falling out with Hecarim when they made Q changes a season or so ago.\n\n4) Popstar/Arcade Ahri\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/pahri-articlebanner_1.jpg?itok=RHP00eOA https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eBtmQ9bCkQQ/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nWell I couldn't choose just one or the other so I went with both for very different reasons.  Popstar Ahri is a hilarious skin that amuses people to see.  I love it for that reason alone.  Arcade is much more of a work of art and I can really appreciate the effort and extra animations that went into it.\n\n5) Classic Nautilus\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Nautilus_0.jpg\nNot what you were expecting?  Well Nautilus is my second most played champion, and only a few thousand mastery points behind Taric, the champion I am literally named after.  Despite owning every Taric skin, having sunk hundreds of dollars into LoL, having bought DJ Sona 3 different times for me and my friends, and owning every Ahri skin even though she is only my 5th highest mastery champion I don't own a Nautilus skin.  Now I love the champ, but honestly his base skin has always struck me harder than any of his skins.  It is well done, feels like Nautilus, and just doesn't need anything added to it.\n\nHonorable mentions include:\nDraven Draven, Order of the Banana Soraka, Vandal Vlad, Giant Enemy Crabgot, Neon Strike/Demon Vi, All Taric skins except maybe bloodstone, Bloodmoon Kalista, Explorer Ezreal, Lunar Revel Azir (go!), and Dj Sona.\n\nBasically I like a lot of skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2017-03-10T20:14:46.380+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"5.

I also love the pinks and reds and pastel hair. It's all very pleasantly aesthetic. Also, as an Art History major, I love Sweetheart Sona's splash art with the Renaissance-esque art in the background. I personally think it's one of the best backgrounds in a splash art in terms of nodding towards classicism.\nThe Ashe and Annie splash arts also remind me of Alice in Wonderland, so that's a plus. Now, normally whenever I play Ashe, Quinn, or Sona (I do not own Varus, but I do appreciate that hot damn skin), I am playing their Heartseeker/Sweetheart skin.\nSince I love this skin line so much, I would love to see more supports receive a Sweetheart skin (Sweetheart Braum, anyone? Sweetheart Janna?)\n**\nStar Guardian Skins**\n\nOf course I love Star Guardian {{champion:99}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:40}}. At the moment, I only own Star Guardian Lux, but I am very eager to throw money at Riot when Janna and Jinx go on sale. I just love these skins for the throwback to my magical-girl-filled childhood, though they remind me more of Madoka Magica (even though they are a direct nod to Sailor Moon). I have to admit that Janna is my favorite, simply because 1) she's JANNA and I'm biased, 2) she's PURPLE and I'm biased, and 3) Zephyr is so cute <3\nI do admit, though, I was disappointed with Poppy and Lulu. Lulu more than Poppyl; I think Lulu could have been a lot better.\n\n**Bewitching Skins**\n\nBewitching {{champion:25}} and {{champion:18}} are two of my favorite skins. While I don't play Tristana a lot, for some reason I've gotten the majority of her skins through the mystery chests--yet even then Bewitching has become my absolute favorite of all her skins (previously it was Buccaneer). I like the skin so much, I'm tempted to play Tristana more often. I love her recall the most, with the cute little kitty <3\nBewitching Morgana, I've been spamming that every time I play Morg that I forget I have her other nice skins. I think, aesthetically, this is Morgana at her best. I imagine that this is what Morgana looked like in her prime before she was a fallen angel, and she's ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. I also love the details to her dress--I think it gives her more volume as a figure and more personality. Overall, 10/10 skin, so glad I bought it.\n**\nArcade Skins**\n\nSpecifically {{champion:21}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:81}} and {{champion:103}}, in which the only ones I do not own are Ahri and Ezreal.\nI think Arcade MF was one of the first skins I bought, and it's the skin that got me playing MF. Then I was on a wild hunt trying to get Arcade Sona (I kept missing it on sale, but I finally got it for 70% off in my Snowdown Shop), and I got Arcade Riven for free from a contest.\nI naturally play Arcade MF and Sona a lot more than Riven because I am a horrid Riven player, but every time I play these skins I'm always having a lot more fun. The little pixel animations are perfect.\n\n**Pharaoh Skins**\n\nMy passion in life is Ancient Egypt, so naturally I love the designs for Pharaoh {{champion:32}} {{champion:75}} and {{champion:76}}.\nI don't own any of these skins--the only champion I own of the three is Amumu, and the Pharaoh skin is legacy), but I am biased and I love their designs. And while there are other loosely related skins to this theme (such as Risen {{champion:9}}, Desert {{champion:86}}, the Sandstorm skins, and the Guardian of the Sands skins), I would greatly appreciate it if Riot would keep making more Egyptian skins.\nSlightly related, I love the classical Greek Muse {{champion:37}} and Mythic {{champion:69}}, and would also like to see more skins along that line (you know, other than {{champion:80}}).\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\nIndividual skins that I love (and own, and play roughly 90% of the time when I'm playing the champion):\n\nPopstar {{champion:103}} (because, as I have mentioned, I am basic)\nSnow Day {{champion:90}} (because I am biased and this is the only skin for Malz I own, though generally I am not impressed with his other skins on an aesthetic level)\nThe Dragon Trainer Skins for {{champion:117}} and {{champion:18}} (though I don't own Tristana's skin, I still love this theme. STILL WAITING FOR DRAGON TRAINER {{champion:133}} , RITO. BECAUSE QUINN SHOULD TOTALLY RIDE A DRAGON AS HER ULT. WHY IS THIS NOT A THING YET. /rant)\nZombie {{champion:63}} (I don't even care if I am the worst Brand you have ever seen, everything about this skin is GLORIOUS, and the quotes are just so damn funny, especially when he's \"singing\", like \"Not easy being green...and dead\", and \"Every day I'm shambling...\" XD)\nFrosted {{champion:81}} (because I'M BASIC and he reminds me of Jack Frost, and I'm BASIC AF)\n\nOkay, I'll stop now. :)","replies":[{"poster":"SpyKayle","date":"2017-03-10T21:41:32.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find Pharaoh Nasus to be an ugly skin.

I have a rule where I don't buy a skin unless A: buying it tells Riot that I want more skins _like_ it, or B: it looks better than the classic skin and I plan on replacing that classic skin with the better looking premium skin. Vi's basic aesthetic is amazing, and I personally love it more than anything else the game has, despite me not maining the pink-haired punk anymore.\n\n2) Debonair Vi\nDid I say it needed to be better than the classic? This is a close second. It's Vi, just as punk and pink-hair as ever, but in a suit. Yeah, a fucking suit, sharp as a knife. Need I say more?\n\n3) Popstar Ahri\nI never play this skin anymore, but it's Girls' Generation Genie skin, and that's enough.\n\n4) Dragon Trainer Tristana\nHER GUN IS A BABY DRAGON\n\n5) Aether Wing Kayle\nAnother champ I never play, but her dance is Night of Fire which is one of my favorite things on this planet. Plus, it's just cool.\n\nHonorable mentions:\nCaptain Fortune; PROJECT series; Program series (both because cyberpunk is my favorite genre ever); Orianna (classic and sewn chaos); Blackfrost Anivia; Sejuani's rework \"classic\" skin (I bought Sej to show Riot that I supported the direction of less sexualized female models); and Slayer Jinx.\n\nHonestly, it's hard to decide. This is really just things I value on a scale of 1) Vi 2) anything else. Riot has done such an incredible job creating the skins in League. I don't play League much anymore (though I'll definitely make an extended return with the release of Xayah and Rakan), but I always have a hard time validating the purchase of skins in other games 'cause I'm always thinking \"League does it better.\" From updates icons, textures, particle and sound effects, voice lines, champ-specific interactions, and animations, League skins are the complete cosmetic package. You get what you pay for, and I'm never disappointed.

I didn't own him before the update and I always thought his update, although beautiful, was unnecessary. I liked Trundle's old voice a lot better than his new one and his old laugh is contagious to me. Luckily, when Riot released the hextech crafting system I got this skin in my first chest.

Even though I didn't want most of the champions in the bundle, I patiently grinded out every last influence point to get every champion in the starter pack bundle so I could purchase just the skin.

Renektoy\nhttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f8Mw-pRRNM0/WL-WUqwiPvI/AAAAAAAAfjc/j4cujHwTOkweQcMboNdz9siga7uMgpZcQCEw/s640/reneturn.jpg\nNot too long ago I was contemplating buying a Renekton skin since I've always had an interest in the champion (I break out renekton support all the time in norms) and I was considering maining him in top lane. Only problem I had was, all of renekton's skins are too macho for me. I wanted something that made renekton look cute or silly. The next day, Renektoy showed up on Surrender at 20. The fact that he still menacingly says \"who's next on the chopping block\" while being a children's toy is hilarious to me. I love the particle effect on Dominus and his death animation is perfect. He looks like a toy story or Small Soldiers character.\n\n\n\n\nHonourable mentions:\n\nSpectral Fiddlesticks\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HyNMRON7OCE/V3Dqtr5xHpI/AAAAAAAAQro/53sR1Xtt2HIjBYaxfuvQCqNyqvipvIwwACKgB/s1600/fiddleturn.jpg\nThis is yet another blessing from Riot. I got this skin that one time they gave us mystery skins for good behaviour. I like it because the strength of the glow effect is hilariously high. It's a simple skin, but I use it over my other Fiddlestick skin because it was a gift from Rito Game.\n\nOrder of the Lotus Karma\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/--StR4WayNCw/VC2hBUX0DuI/AAAAAAAAaQY/1hIZPYuf1vg/s1600/karma2.jpg\nwaited so long for it to be purchasable in the client and it was worth when it finally showed in the shop.\n\nForecast Janna\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V6p9jSprD5Y/Ugmg4huxe6I/AAAAAAAAGMM/fvtwuCx0NoQ/s1600/hahafh.png\nThe voiceover \n\nWarring Kingdoms Garen\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ea3lYnA1mGM/WEcuBIxuDXI/AAAAAAAAZpc/v9B6Z7kwG1MDOQLsrUbnBhP1KvKCuyKVQCLcB/s640/garenturn.jpg\nThe green visuals of his passive go best with the colours of this skin imo. The particles look amazing and I prefer the smoother movements of this skin to the movements of Steel Legion who was always too meaty and rigid for my taste.","replies":[]}]}
