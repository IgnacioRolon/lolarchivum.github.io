Maybe Nami or Wukong, but they could be different races too.\n\nThe point was just to see which champs might get retconned into being Vastayan instead of whatever their lore was before.\n\nFor instance, I don't think we've seen any new lore on Volibear as a part of any of the events over the last ~3 years that \"overrode\" the previous lore, so it's entirely possible that the Ursine are just a specific, bearish tribe of Vestayan.\n\nSame goes for Fizz and Nami; their original lore put them each as members of distinct races, but there's no reason that those races are variant Vastayans.\n\nPrevious to this story, Ahri's lore was that she was a fox who always longed to be human and stole a dying sorcerer's magic in order to do so; now we know she's actually Vastayan. That kind of retcon means that basically any animalistic humanoid could actually be Vastayan.\n\nI agree that some of those listed are a bit more animal than human, but I seriously doubt Riot would introduce a whole new race just to give Ahri a new backstory. I expect we'll see more of these near-humanoid animal-people champions turn out to also be Vestayan rather than each being a unique wonder child (Ahri, Wukong) or member of races with no other story development (Nami/Fizz/Volibear).\n\nNunu was just included because, who knows, maybe Wilump (and yetis in general) are actually Vestayan.
