I am in love with the visuals and will definitely be picking this skin up either way, I was just curious as to where the inspirations for it comes from.  Leblanc is a perfect candidate for a Puck skin, being the mischievous and deceptive person she is, so I also wanted to thank you for making this wonderful work of art!","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-02-25T21:38:52.178+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were inspired by a fan concept by [Mist XG](https://www.artstation.com/artist/z361474408) to explore a druidic/fairy space for LeBlanc. We ended up moving away from the Druidic aspect as it doesn't fit her character as well as the Faerie Trickster archetype. Some references I was inspired by were Titania from A Midsummer Night's Dream, Oona from MtG, Pan's Labyrinth, Penny Arcade's Thornwatch (Hecarim was influenced by this one too), young Maleficent in Maleficent (again Hecarim too) and the Sylvari from Guild Wars. LeBlanc was designed about the same time as Hecarim, after we fell in love with the Bard skin we wanted to expand the Elderwood (and you can probably find some of my player-probing in old threads), and they were designed with a greater story setting in mind;\n\nIn the core LoL lore LeBlanc is a schemer manipulating things from behind the scenes - so too in the Elderwood. I see Bard and his Meeplets as her emissary, reporting to her on the movement of intruders to their magical realm. While Hecarim is an ancient and powerful enforcer, protecting the forest from all who dare trespass. It was important for us to establish the Elderwood as a place were humans dare not go, for the magical forest is filled with powerful magical protectors. For this reason I tried to design LeBlanc as a fusion of both fae, animal and plant elements to emphasise that she is a creature of pure magic that simply _looks_ like the forest she is the embodiment of. Bard has coloured cloth and Hecarim has hewn stone that hint at Elven crafts from a forgotten time, but LeBlanc is pure forest magic!\n\nTo that point I think that it's also important that we push the breadth of design in our skin lines so that each champion brings something new to the setting. I've seen some beautiful fan concepts for possible Elderwood skins but they reuse too many elements from previous designs - in my mind these worlds are large and aside from specific cases such as Warden/Marauder I think each one is an opportunity to see something that combines some familiar motifs with something fresh.\n\nThanks so much for playing League of Legends and it really warms my heart to hear that players are enjoying this one. Working on this skin was something really special for me >:)","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-02-25T22:40:27.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will we reach a point where we will have truly official Lore for skin lines?\n\nThere are often threads like this one where the skin team talk about the story behind a skin line (I remember a really cool one about the Rogue Slaughter Fleet with Garen, Quinn, etc.), but it's very little compared to the core Lore.\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't want these side lores to detract from and slow down the core Lore.

Thank you so much for responding to my feedback. I really enjoy noticing things and inspirations for things like that!  There are so many pieces to an enchanted forest: the insects, the flora, magical mushrooms, forests in the fall, hidden caves and dark and scary underbrush and what lurks below the canopy that blocks out the mundane world! Elderwood is definitely a skin line I could see with a lot of varying, yet still cohesive skins.  There is so much room to play and I can't wait to see what your talented artists come up with.  I really enjoy that Mist XG person's art and hope you pull from more of the various fan artists.  I have no talent for visual art, but I do enjoy writing.  Again thanks for your time, and keep up the amazing work in creating this wonderful game. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Pale Woman","date":"2016-02-26T01:30:41.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=PvJTBWKz,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-25T21:38:52.178+0000)\n>\n> We were inspired by a fan concept by [Mist XG](https://www.artstation.com/artist/z361474408) to explore a druidic/fairy space for LeBlanc.

The animation team put a bunch of work into a flutter on her W that you can barely see for half a second! It would be an awesome addition and would more than likely just be a recycled animation <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2016-02-25T21:43:46.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool to hear! :) Elderwood is a cool theme; i don't play Hecarim but that's a boss skin.
