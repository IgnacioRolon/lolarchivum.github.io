If it's a practice fight, they do that since this form of fighting was for survival. The reason people still do it, of course, is to stay true to the old art.\r\n\r\n{{champion:114}}  doing this makes no sense. She SHOULD have her off hand out, ready. Yes, I know it's a minor misplacement of the hand, but it really bothers me seeing her handicap herself like this in a fight.\r\n\r\nI REALLY hate {{champion:114}} , but even I don't think she deserves this disrespect. Not to mention, only an arrogant piece of garbage would do this off the bat, Fiora clearly has honor.","replies":[{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-04-12T06:04:21.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate when people pose reality complaints in any video game\n\n....but cmon. League of Legends?? It's not exactly striving for authenticity....\n\nThere's already a massive disconnect between how goofy the game is  (and is meant to be) and the lore which takes itself a bit too seriously at times. In game champions meme at 100 mph but then we get stories depicting the brutality of war and lovers locked in hellish purgatory.\n\nTHAT is more jarring than an indescrepency in a fighting pose which never existed to be realistic but to call to mind a stereotype that the masses can ALL RELATE TOO AND ASSOCIATE WITH FENCING. Riot artists probably even knew that to begin with, but they still include it because it serves its' purpose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cåracal","date":"2019-04-11T22:43:11.341+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fiora is a pretty arrogant character...","replies":[{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2019-04-12T00:51:10.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually she’s not. They changed that, she used to be, before the rework. Now In her new lore they make sure that it’s obvious she’s only perceived as arrogant, but rather is confident.
