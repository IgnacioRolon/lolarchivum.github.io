Only for fear, only briefly.**\n\n\n**For this is only the end of a chapter, one riddled with holes and tears. The next will be forged in fire, the words writ in stone. A world not so easily marred.**\n\n\n>#Lore\n\n***\n\n\n>Those of you who have seen my previous concepts, you know my lore is usually significantly longer. However, the more I worked on it, the harder it was for me to fit it with the League universe (also the piece wasn’t exactly in my comfort zone, so it was slow going even without the writer’s block).  It wasn’t good enough for the audience that’d actually read it, so I ended up scrapping it.\n\n>Don’t worry though, future lores will be longer (the next concept will have a lot, don’t worry), and I might end up writing a longer version of the lore if this blows up (assuming there is a demand). Until then, here’s the Riot style lore snipit.\n\nNolan was an ancient geomancer and scholar to a kingdom embroiled in a war that was quickly turning for the worse. When a plan involving black magic was to be put into effect on the willing soldiers, he was sentenced to death for opposing it.\n\nThe method of execution was a hellish pit of flames, of which he had predicted would be his untimely demise. He survived, but only after thousands and thousands of years had passed, and with most of his grip on reality lost as the fiery spirits embedded themselves inside of him.\n\nHallucinating vividly, he sees a growing corruption spreading across Valoran, along with images of his past colliding with the present. In a fit of righteous insanity, he vows to destroy whatever the corruption had touched; in order to put his mind at ease and to set straight what he had ‘allowed’ to happen years before.\n\n\n>Base Stats\n\n|**Stat**|---|**Base Value**|---|**Per Level**|---\n|-\n|Health||504||+63|\n|Health Regeneration||6||+0.65|\n|Armor||23||+3.1|\n|Magic Resist||30| |+0|\n|Range| |540| |(Ranged)|\n|Attack| |52||+3|\n|Attack Speed| |0.648||+1.3% |\n|Movement Speed| |330| |+0|\n\n>Friends, Enemies, and Role \n\n**Friends:** {{champion:63}}  {{champion:54}}\n\n**Enemies:** {{champion:34}} {{champion:268}}  {{champion:10}}  {{champion:266}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:56}}\n\n**Role:** Mage\n\n>#Kit\n\n\n#Passive: Omnia Ardet\n\nNolan conjures fireballs while standing still, procuring a **Fireball** for every 4/3.5/3 (levels 1/7/15) seconds he stands still. This process will reset completely if Nolan moves during this time.\n\nNolan can have up to **four** Fireballs at once.\n\n>Nolan’s abilities consume a Fireball when available, causing them to apply **Desolation** to all the ground that they touch. Desolation lasts 5 seconds.\n\n>If an ability fueled by a Fireball hits Desolation, it sets the ground on fire for 3 seconds, dealing 80 / 140 / 200 / 300 (+.3 AP) (Levels 1/6/11/16) **magic damage** to avnyone that passes over the fire over 4 seconds. \n\n>Enemies that are **ablaze** that walk over Desolation set that patch of Desolation on fire similarly to Fireball fueled abilities. Abilities that apply desolation will refresh the duration of the fire on the ground.\n\n#Q: Molten Hail\n\nNolan rips meteors from the earth and sends them skyward, channeling them down near the cursor over **5 seconds**. Nolan hails 10/15/20/25/30 meteors, each meteor dealing 5/10/15/20/25 (+.033 AP) **magic damage** (max: 50 (+ .33 AP) **/** 150 (+ .495 AP) **/** 300 (+ .66) **/** 500 (+ .825 AP) **/** 750  (+ .99 AP) **magic damage**). If Nolan has available Fireballs, each Fireball empowers 5 meteors, consuming 1 Fireball at a time.\n\nMeteors fall with increasing accuracy towards the cursor, deviating up to 400 units randomly from the center of the cursor at the start of the channel,  then scaling down to 150 units from the center of the cursor. “Center of the cursor” moves at 400 MS (as a reference, think how Vel’Koz can’t move his laser as fast as he wants).\n\n>**Range:** 1200 units\n\n>**Radius of Meteor:** 75 units\n\n>**Cooldown:** 23 seconds\n\n>**Cast Time:** .5 seconds\n\n>**Cost:** 120 Mana\n\n#W: Infernal Tide\n\nNolan summons a wave of lava 700 units wide directly behind himself and sends it slowly in a line. It deals 20/40/60/80/100 (+.2 AP) **magic damage** every .3 seconds an enemy stands in it and slows for 15/20/25/30/35%.\n\nThe wave lasts for 10 seconds, and travels at 250/255/260/264/270 MS.\n\n>**Wave thickness:** 80 units\n\n>**Cooldown:** 17 seconds\n\n>**Cast Time:** .75 seconds\n\n>**Cost:** 100 Mana\n\n\n#E: Terra Nova\n\nNolan places a sphere of molten lava at a target location, of which will detonate after 3.5 seconds have passed, dealing 60/100/140/180/220 (+.5 AP) **magic damage** in a 650 radius. If Nolan has available Fireballs, he can recast Terra Nova to imbue the sphere with the Fireball, increasing its damage by 26%/27%/28%/29%/30% (from base damage and scaling) and maximum health by 1 hit.\n\nThe sphere starts with 2 health and can only be destroyed by auto attacks. If Lucifer’s Hammer hits Terra Nova, the sphere detonates instantly. If Lucifer’s Hammer is empowered by a fireball, it increases the damage of Terra Nova by one level.\n>**Range:** 1400 units\n\n>**Cooldown:** 18/17/16/15/14 seconds\n\n>**Cast Time:** .3 seconds\n\n>**Cost:** 80/90/100/110/120 mana\n\n#Ultimate: Lucifer’s Hammer\n\nNolan strikes a target location with a colossal meteor after a 1 second channel, dealing 200/300/400 (+.6 AP) **magic damage** and knocking up enemies for 1 second within a 300 radius. \n\nAdditionally, a shockwave is released .5 seconds after, dealing 100/150/200 (+.2 AP) **magic damage** in a 650 radius. Desolation is applied on the shockwave only. \n\n>**Range:** 1400 units\n\n>**Radius of ‘Hammer’:** 300 units\n\n>**Cooldown:** 240/220/200 seconds\n\n>**Channel Time:** 1 second\n\n>**Cost:** 100/150/200 mana\n\n***\n\n>#Quotes\n\n#Selection\n\n“This world is but a pyre, long since escaped its due.”\n\n#Spawning\n\n“This world has forgotten me, how unfortunate.” \n\n“I wait no longer.”\n\n“This is only the beginning.”\n\n“The final hour approaches.”\n\n#Movement\n\n“The time for half-measures has passed.”\n\n“I see no beauty in this wretched world.”\n\n“What the flame burns; fire consumes.”\n\n“This too shall end.”\n\n“My power only grows.”\n\n“Now I see the truth.”\n\n“Fire runs through my veins; my blood boiled and purged.”\n\n“Lies will not save them.”\n\n“Ashes to ashes; dust to dust.”\n\n“I will unravel these vile roots, however far they travel.”\n\n“I suffer no more.”\n\n“A thousand, thousand years, and nothing has changed.”\n\n“They are beyond pardon.”\n\n“Nihil is the only true peace, one that I intend to restore.”\n\n“I have no ears for false remorse.” \n\n“The stain of demons is cleansed only through fire.”\n\n“This world cannot be forgiven, but perhaps the next one can.”\n\n“My eye sees naught, my hand makes it so.” \n\n#Attacking\n\n“Corruption will have one answer.”\n\n“Merely an ember of what’s to come.”\n\n“The wind shall be their tomb.”\n\n“Baptism by fire.”\n\n“I leave only dust.”\n\n“Cinders will be my legacy.”\n\n“Death takes you swiftly.”\n\n“Burn, and be released.”\n\n“Return to purity.”\n\n“A pilot to the blaze.”\n\n“The inferno rises.”\n\n“Death is a blessing, a kindness you do not deserve.”\n\n“There will be no warning.”\n\n#Interactions\n\n{{champion:63}}  “Our interests align, spirit.”\n\n{{champion:1}}  “I have no use for children, however talented they might be.”\n\n{{champion:161}} “You wish to learn?

His eyes are a now a piercing blue, and his particles change from a fiery red to a more chilling color. His ultimate involves a giant flaming comet instead of a metoer. 975 RP \n\n**Hazmat Nolan:** Nolan joins Heimerdinger in the apocalypse, sporting a neon yellow hazmat suit and gas mask. His particles are sickly green to match the radiation, the desolation now oozes with green muck. His ultimate is a nuclear bomb. 975 RP\n\n**Dark Lord Nolan:** Nolan dabbled in the darker arts when seeking more powerful countermeasures to said arts, only to find himself caught in the allure of absolute power. His robes are now black and lined with silver, a menacing ebon cape flowing behind him. 750 RP\n\n**Hellfire Nolan:** A mage is sent from the depths of a fiery pit, his vengeance hot and tempered. Nolan now sports crimson red robes, bone shoulder guards, and his particle effects are toned a deeper red.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-26T01:24:58.599+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I commend you on the professionalism and level of detail included in this presentation.  You clearly enjoy the lore and mythos of Runeterra and its inhabitants, and it was fun to read the interactions and expanded narratives these characters could share.\n\nThat said, I wish I liked this concept more than I do.  I think the passive is very unusual and I can't imagine that standing still for 3 seconds at a time (or 12 seconds total to get the maximum amount of fireballs) could be fun.  The rest of Nolan's kit seems like somewhat generic mage-y abilities, which is totally fine, but I wish his abilities synergized better with his need to stand still.  Since that's such a core component of his kit, I was expecting to see his other abilities support and reward Nolan players for standing still \"well.\"\n\nI took a stab at creating a \"stand still and cool stuff happens\" champion in a concept named Agatha, but she is designed to be a support and every single one of her other abilities is tuned around the fact that she is meant to be immobile.  In fact, I frequently referred to her as a \"turret\" who had to position herself strategically during team fights so that she could get the most out of her immobile and vulnerable gameplay patterns.  Nolan has the passive but I don't feel like the rest of his kit supports that passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Flintfall","date":"2015-03-26T01:52:33.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should have made a bit of a note, but fireballs charge during cast times/channels. Here is where that applies:\n\nQ: 5 second channel\n\nW: . 75 second cast time\n\nE: .3 second cast time\n\nUltimate: 1 second channel\n***\n\nDepending on playtests, I might reduce the time needed to generate a fireball, but I think there are other opportunities for charging. Such as:\n\n* Beginning of the game\n\n* Respawning/buying\n\n* Waiting behind minions in lane\n\n* Waiting for enemies to appear on minimap\n\nMost of these aren't incredibly boring, and you can work it in fairly well with a playstyle change. \n***\n\nAs for passive interaction, here all the interactions I thought of:\n\n* Spraying an area with Fireball charged meteors will generally stack Desolation to Burning relatively easily\n\n* Terra Nova (**E**) and Lucifer's Hammer (**Ulitimate**) can be combined for instant Burning everywhere\n\n* Using Infernal Tide (**W**) to apply desolation can be useful when you follow it up with Molten Hail (**Q**)\n\n* Same as above, but with Terra Nova (**E**)\n\nThe standing still part is mainly to help centralize the kit around positioning well and not moving. For many of the abilities you can set them up and reposition and still have ample Fireballs for use on the others.\n***\n***\n\nClearly, the design is a bit ambitious in terms of a newer playstyle (not moving as opposed to a mobile game). He isn't supposed to appeal to a large crowd, and it's completely understandable that the gameplay doesn't seem interesting to you. I myself probably would not play him often, but I wanted to see if I could create a completely teamfight-centric mage, of which I feel the kit accomplishes.\n\nThanks for the feedback!\n***\nEDIT: one more interaction and notes,\n\n* using W and E to clear a wave (least fireball usage)\n\nEach ability is meant to function differently on its own, but also to provide backup/aoe for other abilities to proc off of. \n\nThey're also not spammable, meaning you can charge fireballs while they're on cooldown.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kindofspookygub","date":"2015-08-08T01:43:47.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone else think that Flints champions are all fairly difficult to play, as in it takes a lot of mechanical skill and knowledge","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-07-14T02:38:48.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The amount of work and dedication here is just beyond me, I don't think I could every do something like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Flintfall","date":"2015-07-18T01:13:32.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just takes a lot of time is all.

I want him to fill a niche instead of being a generalist, and have a playstyle that isn't currently in league.\n\nHe requires patience and planning, which isn't a broadly likeable trait in a video game. luckily, League already has a lot of fast-paced champions, so I can create a concept like Nolan aimed at a small playerbase (those who prefer acting slowly, or those with crippling lag :P).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nobleman DB","date":"2015-03-26T02:29:46.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a reason as to why the cooldowns on his skills are really, really long?

He has a different playstyle that many people don't find fun, and is intended to fill a niche (teamfight only mage).\n\nAs for gameplay, Nolan does not play like most champions in LoL. The common mage playstyle is to use spells consistently to clear waves and poke the enemy, then eventually to lay down aoe in a teamfight. \n\nNolan is centered around the teamfight portion, being able to excel at that far more than the rest of that roster. His rotation annihilates the enemy team easily, so to contrast that he needs weaknesses.\n\nHis laning phase is supposed to be weak in order to contrast his late game power spike, and in order to preserve his teamfight only playstyle, I needed to make sure he can't poke the enemy.\n\nI accomplished this by having large cooldowns on his abilities while also making them unreliable in poking situations.\n***\nBy gating the laning phase, I can make each ability much more impactful. the cooldowns might be a bit long, but I'd rather him be weak first then buff him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GiraffeFactory","date":"2015-03-26T00:59:48.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This actually seems like a pretty cool champion concept!","replies":[{"poster":"Flintfall","date":"2015-03-26T01:09:05.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
