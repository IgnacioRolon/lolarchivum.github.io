There is a problem with Korean server.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice to meet you :)****\n\nI am a Korean user playing games on Korean servers. Why did you come here and ask a question?\n\nI have a big problem with my Korean server now.\n\nIn the Korean server, it is said that from 2016 season reward it is 3vs3 Twisted Treeline team rank, and although the reward of season is received, the loading screen frame is shown also in Summoner's Rift or Summoner's Rift ai. (Attached photo of evidence.)\n\nEven if you ask the Korean operator, it is clear that the loading screen border is displayed in the 5 vs 5 Summoner's Rift or 5vs5 Summoner's Rift ai even if you get the season reward with a 3 to 3 Twisted Treeline team rank. (Attached photo of evidence.)\n\nBut when the reward came in, I found that the border was not visible in the 5vs5 Summoner's Rift game. So, if you have a suggestion on the homepage of the Korean operator about how this happened, there is no answer for one week already, and the other user who received the 3vs3 Twisted Treeline compensation also suggested, but does not give any compensation.\n\nI did not run the solorank after I found that the 3vs3 Twisted Treeline reward now shows the border in the 5vs5 Summoner 's Rift game.\n\nIt is really sad.\n\nIt was nothing that I suffered during this season. It is a reward that I got from trying hard, but suddenly the words have changed and I did not pay the right compensation.\n\nplease.\n\nHelp 3vs3 rewarded users\n\nThey did not receive the appropriate compensation at any one moment for no apparent reason.\n\nPlease help ... I have also put in one-to-one inquiries, but this is a North American server. If the rewards have changed, do not you have to tell them before the rewards come in? I hope you get the right rewards soon.\n\nEvidence\n1. https://riotgames.zendesk.com/attachments/token/bB2JJ5JexNz8yy53YGV5qXaiM/?name=question.png\n2. https://riotgames.zendesk.com/attachments/token/y0a5c5usx08HJdZVPbUb3Gq9S/?name=answer.jpg\n3. https://riotgames.zendesk.com/attachments/token/1KGvDD5c7T8rIS4XRCKnBmH8c/?name=2016+season+reward+details.jpg\n4. https://riotgames.zendesk.com/attachments/token/6AiRdA62l7KztDIFoCDiXuclK/?name=2016+season+reward+details+original.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T23:57:31.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're experiencing this issue on the Korean region, you'll need to work with the support team for that region.
