You don't seem to enforce or care about your own rules and guidelines AT ALL. You just throw it under an auto detection report system and never investigate the entire issue of the match. If you did you might have realized that my Bot and Mid lane were duo queue and actively working against trying to win the game. My patience was worn after a 6 game losing streak and being filled Jungle. \r\n\r\nBut hey, it's fine, I'll play it out. Giving warning pings to my team that they are actively ignoring and blaming me for dying. And while I am receiving the same level of verbal abuse, I get suspended and they get off free because they have the three **Report Majority**. What happened to the tip I always read in the loading screens that says \"**Competitive BSing is fine**\" Why can't I call out complete idiots for trolling my games? Am I supposed to be having fun? Isn't that what a game is supposed to give me? Enjoyment? Not constant harassment that I have to argue back with these people to get anything accomplished. Despite all of this I mange to crawl my way to a victory by splitting and working against my OWN team who will not engage in any of the fights when I group.\r\n\r\nI am not upset about the chat restriction. I might as well never communicate at all if this is the response I am met with. I am upset that I get the restriction when they were equally to blame for the altercation and the fact that the 2nd game I was reported for was COMPLETELY Irrelevant and happened 4 games ago. I'll gladly serve 10 games of not talking and from hear on out will make no effort to do so until I see justice and improvement in your reporting system.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-21T05:53:14.235+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, it has come to this: someone displayed misbehavior in a LoL match in flagrant disregard for the game's rules, ToS, EULA, and Summoner's Code. That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nIn a perfect and just world, everyone who deserved a punishment would get one. In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other players’ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game. There is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words which is what we are trying to address with these bans.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Everyday36,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bucnlyRF,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-10-21T05:36:08.823+0000)\n>\n> I get suspended and they get off free because they have the three **Report Majority**.\n\nIt is not possible to gang up on someone with multiple reports. From [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player):\n\n> It only takes one report for our systems to review a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-10-21T07:19:45.789+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I get suspended and they get off free because they have the three Report Majority.\n\n Okay so first and foremost, multiple reports do not matter. It only takes one report to trigger a game for automatic, unbiased review. Premades do not have any power over you, one report is worth the same as 9. If you don't believe me, [**Riot themselves have confirmed this. **](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/9VrUtrJo-being-solo-and-having-a-team-report?comment=000000000002) It also doesn't logically make sense for multiple reports to be treated differently since that would encourage mass-reporting and abuse by premades.\n\n Secondly, you don't know that they didn't get restricted or suspended. The IFS message (report feedback) is inconsistent at best. You could report 9 different people who all receive permanent bans and you _still_ might not get it. \n\nFor common flame (general insults, pretty much anything that isn't blatant homophobia/racism/etc.) you can receive anywhere from a 10-game chat restriction to a permanent suspension depending on what step of the punishment ladder you're on. So checking someone's match history **will not** show you if they've been punished. \n\n_**There is no way to verify if someone else has received punishment.**_\n\n Finally, none of the things you said here would be considered \"competitive BS'ing.\" That term applies to things like \"GGEZ\", \"?\", \"get rekt\", etcetera. \n\n**\"Did you listen? Good you fucking r%%%%%\"** is not competitive banter. \n\n> Why can't I call out complete idiots for trolling my games? Am I supposed to be having fun? Isn't that what a game is supposed to give me? Enjoyment?\n\n If you're someone who derives pleasure or enjoyment from insulting others (even in the rare cases where they may be trolling) you are not someone Riot wants to play their game. The rules are clear. Don't flame anyone, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n Doesn't matter if they started it first, doesn't matter if they were geniunely trolling, it does not matter. You don't get to stoop to the same level as someone else and skirt by without punishment because you weren't the instigator. That's not how rules work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DBS Ronovon","date":"2019-10-21T05:55:11.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"You are wasting your time.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-10-21T11:02:01.652+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So are you.
