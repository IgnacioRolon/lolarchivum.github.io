People there don't have to fear a ban which would cost them everything they had on their account, thus they flame as much as they want. If they get banned they just make another account and can instantly continue. Only play on the PBE if you really have to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-21T15:25:39.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that's normally how the PBE is.\n\nWait till you see it when URF is being tested.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkLordArbitur","date":"2017-10-21T15:15:58.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you reported him, then itll get better. riot doesnt take kindly to people like that on the pbe server. its designed to be an anti-tilt place specifically because youre not playing for fun, youre playing to find bugs, and youre liable to be paired against someone who is nowhere near your skill level.","replies":[]}]}
