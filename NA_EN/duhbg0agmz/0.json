This error can happen if your game files become corrupt, in addition to security settings blocking them from installing properly.  I recommend going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to restore access.  Then grab the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a Force Repatch to fix up the files.

I believe it has something to do with old files still being on your computer that don't get erased from a simple uninstall.\n\nMake sure you delete everything from your computer to do with League. This isn't just an uninstall. Move the RiotGames folder into the recycle bin and empty that out as I believe even with an uninstall that folder remains.\nAfter everything is gone try installing again from the site.\n\nSo, step by step it's.\n1. Uninstall League\n2. Delete the Riotgames folder and make sure it's not just hiding in your recycle bin by emptying that out.\n3. Check to see if there are other League related folders that need to go as well (probably not because they should all be in the Riotgames folder)\n4. Install League once more","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ãºnknown SaTaN","date":"2017-06-29T13:12:00.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"should have punished him for this toxicity","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Certified Genius","date":"2017-06-29T01:01:12.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Watch yo' profanity","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeSinCombo","date":"2017-07-09T21:29:31.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FIX UR FUCKING CLIENT RIOT SO WE CAN PLAY IM SICK OF THIS STUPID ERRORS POPPING UP LEFT RIGHT CENTER NOW FUCKING FIX IT","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImrQns","date":"2017-06-29T08:38:32.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man!
