You can definitely go through and manually delete them, but a much easier and quicker way would be to grab the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with **Reinstall and Clean Uninstall** checked. That'll make sure everything gets deleted and the game reinstalls all in one neat little step ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
