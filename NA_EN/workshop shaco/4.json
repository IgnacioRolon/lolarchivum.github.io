You get more of a damage output by staying alive than you do by going full glass cannon. She feels simliar to Irelia tbh. \n\nEdit: \n\n> [{quoted}](name=AIaya,realm=NA,application-id=mNBeEEkI,discussion-id=LITg0BYe,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-08-09T02:45:23.157+0000)\n>\n> I've been going {{item:1001}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3072}} .\n\nAnother decent build^\n\nPretty much go offtank or be useless. \n\nEdit 2: \n\n> [{quoted}](name=3ternalkarma,realm=NA,application-id=mNBeEEkI,discussion-id=LITg0BYe,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-08-09T05:40:51.396+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3153}} {{item:1330}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3143}} ? idk i honestly feel building her bruiser is best now ortherwise she never survives fights\n\nLike I said any offtank build will work really, people have their preferences. But she is a DPS bruiser now. I think she is actually pretty strong, even though others may disagree. ","replies":[]}
