Some might say this is overkill, and in reality it is. However, from a mathematical point of view this extra armor past the 300ish mark (I think its less) which people believe you shouldn&#039;t go over, acts as a BUFFER to lethality and percent armor shred. After Black Cleaver and maybe a last whisper Malphite would have about 400ish armor but he would still have about a 20% dmg reduction from physical dmg. To me, that is HUGE. So even if increasing armor doesn&#039;t give you more increased resistance to damage, it allows you to take roughly the same amount of damage from armor pen builds.\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#039;t take away from the fact that there are well balanced teams out there with mixed damage, making item diversity important in a well rounded build. This would only work when the other team is made of monkeys and they all go one damage type. or if their mage is feeding/focus mage down in team fights first idk.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts non-toxic LoL players &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2017-12-14T20:25:44.748+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I thought you were actually going to be a gameplay poster that understood armor, I was only half disappointed.

You only get 1 fucking percent. But if someone penetrated that with a bunch of lethality and brought it back down to 800 I would still be reducing incoming damage by 89%. That's the benefit. They can shred half of that 900 and I would still be reducing over half of their incoming physical damage.\n\nif I had 50 armor and added 100, incoming physical dmg reduction would jump from 44% to 60%.

They can penetrate it but they will still deal roughly the same amount. \n\nAnd do you notice how when you added 400 armor instead of 200, to your 3k hp the percent reduction only raised by 8%? instead of the 25% you got earlier from only building 200?\n\nI still feel as if I'm misunderstanding something here though","replies":[{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2017-12-15T13:19:50.831+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"...That formula doesn't mean what you think it means. The % dmg reduction is a ratio of actual HP:total EHP, total EHP is the important one as it is how much raw damage someone has to do to kill you. So yes 800 armor is 89.9% damage reduction, but using our 3000 hp example from before you can see that it is just 3000 HP:27,000 EHP (3000/27000 = 89.9%). The %dmg reduction is just explaining your ratio of health to your actual survivability to a specific damage type.\n\nSo if someone was hitting you for let's say 500 damage an auto, Assuming 0 armor and 3000 hp they would kill you in 6 autos. With 100 armor it would take them 12 autos to kill you (50% damage reduction). With 200 armor it would take them 18 autos to kill you (66.66% damage reduction. With 800 armor it would take 54 autos to kill you (89.99% reduced damage). So with a 23% higher reduced damage number you actually gained 36 additional autos needed to be killed. Do you see how even with smaller differences in the %damage reduction you still gain 6 autos worth of survivability per 100 armor? \n\nThere is no diminishing returns, your actual HP is just becoming a smaller fraction of your EHP.","replies":[{"poster":"PhalseLogic","date":"2017-12-18T20:32:57.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see the err of my ways, I was right about no diminishing returns but, not for the right reason lmfao\nthanks for teaching my silver ass","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-12-14T20:56:12.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"There are diminishing returns.\n\nThe more armor you have, the more you lose to {{item:3071}} {{item:3035}}\n\nYou also did not factor in magic or true damage.","replies":[{"poster":"EkyonKun","date":"2017-12-14T22:30:39.289+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xwLHkp0L,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-12-14T20:56:12.285+0000)\n>\n> There are diminishing returns.\n> \n> The more armor you have, the more you lose to {{item:3071}} {{item:3035}}\n> \n> You also did not factor in magic or true damage.\n\nWhen it comes to armor shred, you just have to increase your health to armor ratio.

So much for the whole point of this thread.\n\nDiminishing returns is where you gain less by building more of something. Mostly, it's whatever stacks in a multiplicative way instead of additive. An example would be the Ultimate Hat not giving you 60% Ult CDR when you get 15% Ult CDR and 45% regular CDR. Another example is how Void Staff used to interact with Season 6 Piercing Thoughts. Instead of 35% + 7% magic penetration, it gave 39.55% magic penetration. THESE are diminishing returns.\n\nShredding a portion of armor is NOT an example of diminishing returns. It's simply making armor less efficient to purchase.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-12-14T20:40:08.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But there is. In a mathematical sense, no there technically isn't. 1 armor gives 1% more effective HP indefinitely. However, ***in practice*** it has diminishing returns in sense that to achieve maximum efficiency you need a proper balance between HP ***and*** resistances. 500 armor with 1500 HP gives you 7500 effective HP. 300 armor with 3000 HP gives you 9000 effective HP. \n\nGeneral rule of thumb is you want 10 HP per 1 armor. If you have 300 armor, you want 3000 HP to maximize efficiency. If you're stacking Tabi + Frozen Heart + Iceborn + thornmail, you are ***comparatively*** getting diminishing returns. Slot space is an issue so if your build impairs your ability to build enough HP, you are in fact diminishing your effective HP\n\nDon't forget % armor pen also makes armor less efficient as a stat as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2017-12-15T03:08:20.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"50 Armor 1225 health is 1838 effective health against physical damage\n\n100 Armor 1225 health is 2450 effective health\n\n150 Armor 1225 health is 3063\n\n200 1225 is 3675\n\nBut 150 Armor and 1600 health is 4000 effective health against physical\n\nBy adding just 375 health, you get more effective damage soaking than adding an additional 50 armor.\n\nIn other words, buying 1000 gold worth of health here gives you **325 effective extra health** than buying the same gold worth of armor.\n\n\nYeah, armor DOES have diminishing returns, relative to the  gold value of other stats. The same is true with health; stacking one without the other is extremely gold inefficient.\n\nThe gold value for the amount of health you want to have for a given resistance value is 750 +7.5(r), where r is the value of your resistances. \n\nAnother way to think of it is that, after 750 health, for every 50 resistance you want 375 extra health. If either value is below where it should be at a given point, you're better off buying the other,  (depending on the damage comp of the enemy team).\n\nGood benchmarks are: 2250 health, 200 resistances; 3000 health, 300 resistances; 3750 health, 400 resistances.\n\nThis is obviously a general view. If you're against a sufficient threat of true damage, you'll want a bit more health, and if you're against %health damage you'll want a little more of that damage's resistance type.\n\nAnd if you're against {{champion:11}} or {{champion:67}}  you're fucked","replies":[]},{"poster":"NotSpecialDude","date":"2017-12-15T00:12:16.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it does, but not in the literal sense. \n\nConsidering the limited item space and 5 other important stats to build (HP, MANA, AP, AD, MR)\nSpending all that gold on solely armor is indeed a waste. 200 armor or 800 armor, you'd still get bursted by any ap mage worth their rank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2017-12-14T20:17:14.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehh, close enough.\n\nYou could use the Effective HP Argument written on the wiki: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Armor","replies":[]}]}
