She's definitely unfair to people who don't understand the answers, but one of the easiest to answer when they do.\n\nThat being said, against banshees, you can often engage with 3 stacks. Flash W R, or R W; you'll still stun the crowd near instantaneously. QSS isn't usually a problem either; the champions that need to buy it usually can't survive the damage from the spell that initially stunned them, and by the time they react to hit QSS, they probably still end up dying.
