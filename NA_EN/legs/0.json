Also, i noticed that when i was in a normal game of summoners rift or aram. I would randomly get a \"attempting to reconnect\" message every few games. To fix it i would have to leave the game and re-join right? Well when I left the game, my client would freeze and would not  let me reconnect until i restart my client. It's annoying because I would be gone for ether 5 minutes to 10 minutes during a game.  On Saturday when I joined a game of U.R.F and I noticed my ping was unstable. Meaning when every second would go by, my ms would go from 100-500 when it usually sits at 60 or 70 ms, which is good for me. This has been going on since SATURDAY. I tried a lot of methods to lower my ping back to how it was but nothing worked. \r\n\r\n- I tried Dns flushing\r\n\r\n- I tried the simple disconnect and reconnect the WiFi method (which usually works)\r\n\r\n- I tried looking to see if my firewall had something to do with it. (found nothing)\r\n\r\n- I tried repairing my client twice. (that did not work)\r\n\r\n- i tried restarting my router (that did not work)\r\n\r\nI don't know if it has something to do with my internet having issues connecting with the NA server. However, i did notice after disconnecting and reconnecting the WiFi my ms would go back down to 60 but would still be unstable. Few seconds later it would go back up to 100-500 ms. I'm with Shaw so I don't know if it has something to do with that. I've talked to quite a few people who are having the same issues. \r\n\r\nI honestly never had this problem before in the past patches.\r\n\r\nIf there is a way to fix these issues please let me know. :)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \r\n\r\n\r\nOn a side note: After repairing my client, the \"unknown error\" messages are still happening.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-24T21:39:39.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the types of error messages you are getting and where they are appearing (plus your in-game issues), this all seems to point to some sort of strange connection issue between your computer and our servers.
