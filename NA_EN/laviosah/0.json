I made sure not to actually use it for anything but I did feel concerned so I wrote a ticket to support and they said to make a thread here. I have the items that were left in it when purchased written down and can post the exact process if asked to by a Rioter but I would like to avoid giving an exploit out to the public so if there&#039;s a better way please let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Laviosah","date":"2015-10-05T18:50:25.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright just wanted to make sure.
