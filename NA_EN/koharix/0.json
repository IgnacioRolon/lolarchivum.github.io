This leads to me opting to support as my secondary (even before the new lobby system). Before the new system I would get my call of jg over 66% of the time, support about 25% and rarely would I get stuck as any other roll (top, mid, adc). \n\nI was ok with this, I am a good jungler and not a bad support. So since the new system I set my preferences as Jungle primary, Support Secondary. This leads me to being the support roll over 90% of the time. For example the past 8 consecutive games I have been playing as support. Now I figure the majority of players prefer carry rolls such as mid and top, causing few to choose support as either preference. \n\nThis is a problem for me. I am opting to start placing mid as my secondary just so that I can jungle despite my subpar mid play. I know this is a bit of a rage post but I truly feel their is a problem with this system when well over 50% of the time you do not get your primary.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-01-18T00:53:35.769+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"This makes me mad because I'm support primary and mid secondary, and I NEVER get support.

If primary is taken, they prioritize your secondary over other people who have that role as their primary in order to ensure you find a game.  That would then force that person onto their secondary, and so on.

Based off of wait times for Team Builder the most popular roles were Top and Mid tied for the role of  most popular, then jungle then ADC and lastly Support. Because of Top and Mid being both solo lanes, and quite a bit of overlap in terms of game play and style these roles will often have the most players seeking these positions as primary or secondary. That said if you choose your role to be Top/mid you are more likely to get TOP more often. However if you choose a role such as Top/Support you are much more likely to get the role of support. So that being said, You are more likely to get the role of less popularity between your primary and secondary selections.
