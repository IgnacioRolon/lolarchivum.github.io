You spent a good majority of that match being negative, toxic, and all-around awful. You flamed more than anything else, and your behavior isn't just below standard, it's unwelcome.\n\nI really don't know what to tell you, besides that you can either just, not use chat from here on out, seeing as how ready you are to flame and harass, or you can leave League altogether - you clearly hate the game, and your behavior isn't welcome in it, so while I'm generally disinclined to suggest leaving, this case I believe is an exception.\n\nThough, if you continue behaving like you did to receive this Chat Restriction, it eventually will come to a point where you'll be forced to leave. Know that your behavior is far below the standard Riot expects from you, and they will not hesitate to ban you if you keep it up.","replies":[{"poster":"minaTwíce","date":"2019-11-12T06:06:57.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":14,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Umbral Regent,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=f088MIeO,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-11-12T05:49:55.343+0000)\n>\n> You're right, there is further misbehavior beyond simply calling someone a dog.
