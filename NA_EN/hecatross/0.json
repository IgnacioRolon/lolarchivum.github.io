No need to mess with your updates this way!\n\n2) Open Start Menu > Type \"Control Panel\" and Open it > Programs and Features > View Installed Updates (Top Left) > Search for KB4015583 > Right Click, Uninstall.\n\nI know the issue is almost a month old now and not technically directly related to league, but I figured I may as well post what I found as I haven't been able to find anyone else with a solution to the issue. So maybe this will help out one or two people that had this problem.\n\nIf you'd like a detailed run-down of the update, you can view it here: \nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4015583/windows-10-update-kb4015583\n\nIt's a few very minor updates to general windows services, nothing that would break anything if uninstalled, and if it does you can always re-download the update with the instructions on the above page.\n\n3) Wait for Microsoft/RITO/Mouse manufacturer to fix this up\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Amazing fed","date":"2017-05-18T11:19:44.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The keybind helped, thanks.\nFor the update part however is incorrect I believe: \nI think update KB4015583 was only rolled for the who accessed the creators update early builds (before april 11), the later builds have the update incorporated so users can't uninstall it separatedly","replies":[]},{"poster":"3xpress","date":"2017-05-10T17:15:49.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I am having the same problem, however in my Installed Updates section it only shows 3 update files - KB2565063, KB2565063 (another one in a separate line) as well as KB4016250.
