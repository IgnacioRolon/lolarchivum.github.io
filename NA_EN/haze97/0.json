It feels even outdated and unpolished but I'd rather play that instead since they have better servers for the entire fucking continent with active moderation.\r\n\r\nIf you guys thought EUW had trolls you'll should play on the third party Garena Singapore server. I will be back if League ever starts to give a shit about Asia but until then trying to get a low ping lol experience had been depressing to say the least.","replies":[]}
