Whats the difference saying something back in the game?\n\nNo its not the same at all. LoL is a VIRTUAL online video game. It has nothing to do with self defense or honor or education or pride or justice system. When you play LoL, your physical integrity is not in danger. Heck, your personal honor is not even in danger either. Nobody forces you to defend yourself in a VIRTUAL game. You may say \"I was educated to defend myself and my honor\", which is great in some real life circumstances, useless in a virtual game with anonymous people.\n\nIts hard to not want to retaliate, if it were easy, this Boards wouldnt exist neither this historical debate as old as LoL. Its hard to take the high road but thats the intelligent thing to do. Do you want to be the mature one or just another toxic player? Retaliation is useless, doesnt matter who started it in a virtual game.\n\nAll that being said, you have settings and tools to prevent you from flaming if you cant resist the urge. We can also assume you had chat restrictions before the 14d ban. We can also assume its not your first account, being so toxic on lvl35 Bronze account is rare. If you cannot respect the rules by controlling yourself + settings, then LoL is not meant for you and you shouldnt have a unhealthy interaction with a game. \n\nLastly, after 14d ban, theres no leniency anymore. You are not required to be less toxic, you are required to be flawless. Meaning the smallest sign of negativity could trigger a permaban.

LoL is a VIRTUAL online video game. It has nothing to do with self defense or honor or education or pride or justice system. (and rest of post)\n\nMostly yes, but got to say that defense of the ego (reasonably done) is very relevant and should be done in most situations. Mind you, sometimes that entrails ignoring the offender, but that is only one way out of many, and for many people ignoring the threat to ego is not a good idea.\n\nLeague does not care about this (it works against them making $ because a player defending themselves is not focused on the game) and good number of you who just wanna play the Goddamn game without whiners defending themselves don't wanna hear it. I know. That doesn't make it fair or good for those who would be better off defending themselves.\n\nOf course, most people simply \"go out of control\" or some shit in defense, but there are reasonable ways to do so, and even rules-legal ways. How is not important to this thread. I do want an enjoyable game, and I believe to achieve that a greater respect for player's psyche is the key to unlocking a more competitive, player friendly base.\n\nRight now the rules dictate \"shut up about the toxic behavior, play the game, report them, and shut up about the toxic behavior.\"\n\nDon't think that's for our benefit as players. It certainly suits many of you, dear apple-throwers, but Most people aren't like that, as apparent in the toxicity present in most games. The report system isn't being used rationally to identify foul rule-breaking. The rules are bending to the will of the masses to punish the most disliked.\n\nEdit: OP is not exhibiting a good way to defend themselves, but the point of my response is to say that defending oneself is not against the rules and, done justly, is a good thing in the big picture, for the greater good of League rather than the isolated game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-02-27T23:32:18.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the commentary really is not necessary. You get chat logs out of context (only your words) for a reason. Theres nothing anyone could say or do to you that would suddenly make you exempt from the rules.\n\nYou went wrong by implying your team is useless with all the \"guess i gotta 1v5\" shit. Started with singling out mid lane as the one \"not paying attention\" and then moved on to other players. Pretty condescending chat log. Not too bad, but you probably use chat like this often, and the system punishes based on severity and consistency. I would guess this is a case of consistent negative chat.

Just avoid mentioning mental problems because people are touchy about it and I think that's really what got you in trouble. Pretty okay chat logs otherwise. Although its not okay to say this but if it was a legitimate question to someone telling you to go kys, then maybe it can be waived? Worth a [shot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) anyway, right? They can see the sequence of events so go ahead and try if it was the case. \n\nAlso, once someone is being toxic then just mute right away.
