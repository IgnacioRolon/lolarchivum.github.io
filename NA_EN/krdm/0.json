Sorry haha.\r\nI recently began university and since moving here, League has been almost unplayable for me. Whenever I play, my ping ranges anywhere from 40, to 150, to 800, even going as high as 5000 (I'd say about 60% of the time it's well above 300). This mostly happens in public matches too, I seem to do alright in custom games by myself. I would just deal with it and assume my university's internet can't handle online games very well, but League is literally the only game that's having this problem. I've been playing games like Starcraft 2, Diablo 3, Call of Duty, and all of them are fine. My upload and download speeds are fine, it's just something about League. My best friend has been getting into the game and I would love to play with him and coach him, but that's pretty damn hard to do with 1000 ping haha.\r\nAny suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-16T21:47:48.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on wifi?

I feel like it shouldn't be a problem on my end though because in general, my internet is fine. Fast download speeds, fast video streaming, I can play any other multiplayer game without any issues, it's only league that gives me problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-16T22:23:52.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though your net might seem okay elsewhere, you can still have problems using specific services.
