I am so sick and tired of being punished for the game itself crashing, it's just league, I have no connection issues with anything else and I have already ruled out all of the factors aside from it just being the new client. I don't even really care about the LP that much anymore I'm just heated beyond belief that I have such a long penalty for the game itself freezing and not me dodging. I don't dodge, I never have, the handful of times I got a penalty ALL are from the game locking up or freezing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-18T19:02:08.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing so you can run into problems, and it's perfectly fine to stick to the legacy client for now if you want to play ranked matches.
