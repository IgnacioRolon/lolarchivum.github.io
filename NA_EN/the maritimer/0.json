I've played a *lot* of multiplayer games: some with more toxic communities, some with less toxic communities. So I can indeed put up with a lot. The question is whether or not that makes treating other players that way *okay*, which is, I feel, a different question then whether or not I can take it. I can: I don't actually report many players in *League*, and I *personally* would likely not have bothered to report this. That does not, however, make it okay behavior *given that you have been warned about your behavior before*. If you did not have a history of problematic behavior, this would be a tiny blip on your record, which seems about appropriate. When you show a pattern of problematic behavior, however, you get less leeway for those little blips.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-01-08T15:14:35.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is not a “new” system.

It is a claim backed by common sense and personal observation. The appeal to ignorance fallacy is the notion that \"You can't prove it so it is not relevant\". You could use the same argument against the statement \"The majority of people don't like to be stolen from\" which also could not be proven without taking a sample of the world's population but it is common sense.\n\nI would also refute the notion that the board's population is not large enough of a sample size to get a measure of an opinion of the player base. I would further argue that board attracts just as many toxic players as it does non toxic players. While it is possible for Riot to ask players if they prefer toxicity or not, no study has likely occurred as it lacks any merit. There is a reason game companies spend time creating a punishment system for toxic players and it's because people find it ruins their enjoyment.\n\nIf you're looking for definitive statistics to back up a common sense claim, you won't find them here. I neither have access to the tools required to conduct such a study nor do I have the time required to do so.
