It all started on the 9th of December where i came onto League as usual  and simply started a game. This game got me into the Que fine and champ select no problem, once champ select was over and the game was due to start it normally comes up with the logo and transfers me to the loading screen. This time however it did not and it simply opened the second window of League and said it wasn't responding and left me unable to access it . Naturally i thought it had bugged so i reloaded the game and then tried to reconnect and it would not do so and simply told me game still in progress and then returned to reconnect. I have tried on different days and have tried multiple ways of running the program and still nothing. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the game twice and used the hex tech repair tool and still nothing . The day before this happened it was running fine and i did not install or uninstall anything.\r\n\r\nIn hope that is enough context for people to kinda understand whats going on. Hope this makes sense and i am open to all suggestions i guess as i simply wanna get back into playing this game.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T18:27:34.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, this doesn't seem like an issue with game files but a network problem.  More specifically, it sounds like your client is going into a dormant state and failing to load the game because your connection is failing to transition from champion select to the game server.  My recommendation in this case would be to stick to customs for now while going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
