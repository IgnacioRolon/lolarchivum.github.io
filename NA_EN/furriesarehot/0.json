I'm fully willing to have a weak early game if it means I can be a legitimate threat in fights, and it created an interesting dynamic where the team actually tries to help Darius get that first dunk in order to unlock his power so he can singlehandedly win the teamfight for them, whereas before his ult was little more than a KS'ing tool.\n\nQuinn is one of my favorite ADC's, I loved her old ultimate to death but it just didn't fit on an ADC, at least not in it's current state.

His itemization was mostly offensive with only the defensive items you absolutely needed as the game went on\n\nReworked Darius has sustain based off of his health pool, and tons of free AD in his passive, making defensive itemization far more efficient (and desirable). his gutted attack speed, removal of the attack speed slow damaged his potential as a duelist by a lot, while the Q cast time preventing him from using basic attacks during the windup and lowered W ratio made his tower pushing power far weaker (by also making triforce go from his core item to being really bad on him)\n\nthey took a champion with a kit that has horrible teamfighting and forced it to work by implementing a gimmicky ball of stats passive","replies":[{"poster":"hopeful4","date":"2016-01-22T23:52:38.465+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Boy you have no clue what you are talking about.
