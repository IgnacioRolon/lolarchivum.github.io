It's more likely that when they first created league they didn't expect or plan for how big it would get. To maintain such a large project they would have needed a very good design. What most likely happened is that the design was lacking, inconsistent programming standards, which caused certain things to break when a change was pushed. As an analogy, many people using the kitchen but only one at a time, one person goes to buy apples, places them in the apples basket in the cabinet. Another person, bought some apples and places them in a drawer. Time passes and they realize that the apples are probably bad and should be thrown out, so they go and remove it from the designated apples basket from the appropriate cabinet. Meanwhile they have apples rotting in a drawer. Now imagine a HUGE kitchen pantry that has had years and years of things being put in incorrect places, imagine cleaning that up. It would be pretty difficult and time consuming. It would be easier to just start over, wouldn't it? The upside, because the new client has a better design and presumably there are better programming standards (lesson: put all the apples in the apple basket guys) it should make updates less painful. :)","replies":[{"poster":"RiverWind0407","date":"2016-10-21T05:22:32.092+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is... actually a really amazing analogy.

Now if you would have  watch any Pro LoL game you would be aware that most pro players and very high elo players stick to their specific role and 3 champ pool. With a few excepts ( faker senpai). The best place to learn how to play a champ is playing a game of AI. Once you feel comfortable and are able to pulll of their combo try normal. Once you feel you have mastered that champ in normals then bring that champ into rank. Also you will need more than 2 rune pages and please for the love of Rito get 3rd tier runes and build the pages accordingly. There are many website out there that can help you.\n\nAlso I am confused but what you mean by game style falling apart.
