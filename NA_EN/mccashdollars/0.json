While I haven't had that issue with that happening since then, it did make me think to secure my account.\n\nBack when I created the account (it has been years), I used a throwaway email. So during the process of talking with player support I was told they can't change things and give me access to the account because I couldn't name the first 4800ip champion i bought like 4 years ago.\n\nI was confused by this because it was never an issue with me having access to my account. I have always had access to my account. I wanted to change the email and make sure I secured the account. I am very frustrated because there is credit card information attached to the account (WHICH IS MY INFORMATION). I don't see how that is less useful than the IP champion question for verifying my account. I also don't know why the account was banned randomly simply because I want to secure it. If I said nothing it would of been fine. I will be very upfront about my frustrations.\n\n\nI have scrims today and need this issue handled ASAP. Thank you for the timely help/response.\n\n\n\nEDIT: If it would be possible to discuss the situation verbally over discord or something that would be good as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-14T01:57:25.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though you can't remember that specific detail about the 4800 IP champion, do your best to look over those questions again and answer as many as you can.

Once they're in the account, they can also access your purchase history as well. Do your best to answer those questions again as best you can, even if they're guesses.

Don&#x27;t worry about trying too many times either.\n\nThe question I have for this though is am I going to receive another lvl 30 account with the amount of IP (Time) and RP (Money) I've invested in this? I can't talk to this guy. I told him very specific things, including the mystery skin I was gifted by Riot for good behavior in-game that they did a couple years ago. I told them the very first champion I ever played.\n\n\nThe issue I have especially is because of this, I am being stolen from and there is no phone number of someone I can talk to and with how unbearably slow these responses to support are, I'm missing six hours worth of scrims tonight because somebody decided to screw me over because they didn't like my answers. And they refuse to tell me what is the magic that they want from me... Just a bunch of vague information? That is the opposite of helpful.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Basically, how do I get this resolved now. Because I can't have the situation where I put in a response and miss multiple days of practice because someone decided to lock my account and then leave for the night. That's what is frustrating me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-14T02:39:55.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any extra info you provide, like what skins Riot gifted you, may not hold much weight.

It isn't that I own the skin, it's that the skin was specifically sent from Riot Games as part of a mystery gift event. Also, if it is possible I'd like to ask if you could expedite the ticket process.

The Riot-Gifted skin *isn't* a purchase, so how is that in my purchase history? And if gifts are on the list of answers that don't matter, why the hell are they even asking me for that? Like I don't know how I'm supposed to remember information from over 4 years ago. There is only so much I am going to know. Especially because I play on two accounts.\n\n\nI know there's no way in hell you guys are gonna refund my money, but the guy on the support ticket is going to happily tell me no to a request I didn't make, and then ban me for it. There's no way for me to talk to a physical human with people words. That's the issue I have. I don't think anybody there could say to me \"Well there was no indication or reason for us to suspect this account of being compromised, but since you, the person who tried to update the security info on here couldn't remember a weird question, we're actually taking away your account, that has human currency invested in it, away\" \n\nThe issue I have especially with this is why is my account being stolen to force me to focus super hard on what those answers coulda been? I understood that they'd want more info to update/change the email etc. and I planned on sitting and looking through my stuff/champs to remember which things did on this account when I got the opportunity, but now I can't do that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
