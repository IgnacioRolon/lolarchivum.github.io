The issue is she could E to a wall, and easily get counter stunned / binded / whatever by the other supports or even ADs like cait and vayne. Its a predictable pattern she does as the moment she goes to a wall you already know what to do. If she can't all in correctly and consistently, then the only other quality she would need inorder to be useful to her AD is heals (nope) tankiness (nope, not early or mid game) and protection (a clutch suicidal E to save an AD maybe, but nothing special.)\n\nThe only excuse to play camille support is \"its fun.\" \n\nRiven wouldn't be too far off from a comparison, but riven atleast does have both damage, a couple methods of chain CC, and a reliable consistent shield she gets without having to actually fight for it, making her less bullied. \n\nHer ultimate could make flashy plays, i could see support camille but a niche counter pick to leblanc since the moment she dives camille can ult her.

Its not all in all the time.

That alistar isn't gonna surprise me when I see him coming not blitz nor naut. With every support you have tradeoffs that you decide if they're acceptable. Some only offer kill potential and a body to block shots others have healing and buffs/debuffs to help keep the lane stable or turn a fight. Camille has things to help her support like: a strong slow, a stun+gap closer(that doubles as an escape that other supports lack), good damage and tankiness for fighting, and low mana cost allowing her to stay active. You can argue that others could do some of that too but not like she does. It's like when people argued why play Sona when there is nami or blitz when there is thresh or talon when there is zed. They're different and have something that the other doesn't. Also her ult with mf is a fun wombo.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Syllann","date":"2016-12-14T06:18:30.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"she has a hard engage level 2? and can immediately follow it up with a slow.

She has to be picked into lanes that are a bit lower on cc. Obviously vayne lux will stomp her if you go for wall stun everytime, but against sona or soraka for example she can easily maneuver and lock an ADC. Also she trades like a beast, courage plus her passive makes her very hard to successfully whittle, and she stays combat ready with around 100 mana. \n\nShe has cons but comparing her to riven and jayce is honestly incorrect. Camille has a stupid quick gap close, her shield will be bigger than riven, even if some of it can only block ADC/supp damage. She has built in sustain that has a moving cast, allowing her to evade a large variety of skill shots while trading and escaping, while riven is stationary while she q3s. Also she can do some insanely clutch saves. Mainly coming from the fact you can queue tac sweep while hooking, allowing you to bounce and move back, slowing them a .5 seconds before the stun ends. And she can do this though thick walls if she has vision of the aggressors. \n\nBack to her cons:\nWeaker to cc than most champs (her kit involves second casting a lot)\nCan be predictable, and requires creative play to succeed\nCan be counter picked easily, don't take her every game unless you know how to win the matchup. Blitz in particular dumps on you\nIsn't exceptionally tanky until mid-late game, making her rely on her courage shield more than Ali or naut.\nSlow can be hard to land in some matchups, Lucian and ez, but her ADC can follow up if you position right.\nI'm not saying it is the best thing ever, but it is much more than a meritless troll pick.\nI truly want to see it be played in plat+, so I can point to a good player, rather than myself.
