His heal is pitiful and is only good late game if you have Ardent Censer on him.  Why wasn't there a discussion thread for Alistar before this update went live?  If there was, I sure didn't see any thread like I saw the threads for Skarner and pals (although we all remember how 'positively' the Skarner thread and feedback was received, right?).  Even a simple change like letting Alistar use his heal while moving would have been awesome.  It would have fit his theme of a rampaging minotaur, trampling along his path and letting out a war cry of sorts without stopping to do so.\r\n\r\nI've used Alistar A LOT since I started playing League of Legends and he has been one of my most anticipated updates, and for the lack of discussion between Riot and the people who like him (or could start to like him) I just feel really disappointed.  Tristana gets all new everything while Alistar gets a texture update (which they all do in these updates), a new run cycle (I think) and a few trample animations.\r\n\r\nIsn't it agreed by basically everyone that uses Alistar that his passive is garbage?  It's mildly cute in laning phase but that's about where any use out of it ends.  I'm well aware this his heal and his passive are meant to make him an aggressive lane pusher, but a lot of AP supports can shove lanes without their passive doing it for them (looking at you Lulu and Morgana).  In late game though his passive and heal dwindle in to complete obscurity unless he has Ardent Censer.  And if you try and build Alistar as an AP Tank he can do 'okay' but he's better off being build as a full tank since his damage output is mediocre.   When I go full AP Alistar, it's not his passive that scores much damage on anything.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm in that group of people who think that a champion's abilities should have uses throughout all stages of the game, not just the beginning.  And Alistar's AP ratios shouldn't be outrageously high for his Q and W or his E, but I was hoping they would have given his E some kind of unique effect, or give his trample a unique effect.  Maybe restore some of his mana on (any) kill with his passive?  Just throwing SOME sort of idea out there.  Also, how come Singed and Alistar didn't get a new recall animation?  Aren't recall animations supposed to be standard on champions now?  Was hoping they would use that 'dance' that matadors use to add to Alistar's existing dance too.... ah well.\r\n\r\nSorry for this rant everyone, but after waiting for years for an Alistar update, and to see the \"FANCY SHMANCY TRISTANA UPDATE YAAAY!\" with the Alistar texture update and walk/trample animations--I feel more than a little let down.  I feel even more let down than when I saw Singed's update.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-01-14T04:05:25.678+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"Alistar's a champ we'd like to do some light gameplay work on at some point.

Yes, that is true for any other lane, but it seems particularly important when playing support to be able to avoid creep-block. \n\nAside from that, it also helps Alister push the lane when you need to (which some ADCs are really not very good at alonem, particularly single-target champs like {{champion:67}} {{champion:96}} ). It also adds a little extra damage to an engage (which can help ADC secure the kill). You could also argue how Lulu's passive helps her support, when all it is is some extra harass from her, unless she uses E on her ADC, which I consider an extra effect to E, not her passive. I would actually argue Alistar's passive if more useful than Lulu's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheFrozenIsles","date":"2015-01-15T00:55:23.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E93HeFPx,comment-id=000c00010000,timestamp=2015-01-14T05:25:32.241+0000)\n>\n> Fair question and no offense taken at all.\n> \n> I'm quite confident we'll do some work on Alistar at some point.

His proportions were just so weird, his animations so clunky, I couldn't imagine that salvaging anything from his old self would work out very well. And, to be completely honest... it didn't really. Now don't get me wrong, the PBE Alistar is certainly an improvement over the one on live - but a lot of his old clunkiness still shines through. His silhouette still looks like a giant mime pretending to sit in an imaginary box. His passive animation is still him throwing his arms up in the air 3 times in rapid succession. Things like that.\nAnyway, the point where this becomes somewhat startling for me is the direct comparison with Tristana. I always thought of both champions as relatively equal when it comes to being outdated, with both being on the older side and in need of work, although in the end, I would have guessed Alistar to be a higher priority due to the reasons above.\nI know there are good arguments why Tristana has gotten so much visual love (seriously, she looks awesome), and the timing was propably a pretty good opportunity as well because she was up for some gameplay changes, and I would have completely understood if Alistar would have been kept on the backburner for some time to come. However, the decision to launch Tristana as a full-scale rework, while Alistar was kept comparatively low-scale seems pretty... random.\nIt feels a bit like Tristana got scheduled for this big rework and, because of that, Alistar was shoved into a smaller one, even though he would have profited just as much from a complete overhaul. Basically, if 2 or 3 Rioters on the rework team would have been Alistar fans instead of Tristana, we might have ended up with a super-fancy Bull Man running around the PBE while Tristana would have gotten a new face with the flappy ears and some texture work, but still mostly use her old model and animations.\n\nThis particular case doesn't even concern me *that* much since I'm not really an Alistar player. It's just that, when these reworks eventually arrive at the champions that I like and that I'm passionate about, I know that I would be pretty up-in-arms if a champion that was released at a similar time and looks arguably *less* outdated gets the full Tristana treatment, while my champion received something that, ultimately, doesn't come anywhere close in quality.\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to say that those lower scale reworks shouldn't happen. They worked really well for some champions where it was clear that a complete rework wasn't due, like Anivia or Rammus. It's just that, recently, I feel the scales have been tipped a bit too much in their favor, while partly being targeted at champions that might have benefitted more from a larger-scale work, causing some of them to feel a bit lacking in terms of what could have been accomplished. Of course I can't speak for everyone, but personally, I would gladly sacrifice 2 or 3 Alistars for 1 Tristana, even if it slows things down a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"58304318_DEL","date":"2015-01-14T09:32:32.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're part of the visual team, can you please give us an option to saturate SR a little bit more?\nPlease?

Oh the ways of the Riot boards...\n\nAnyway, I think adding a 4% Bonus HP ratio to the heal (2% to allies) and changing the mana cost to 50/55/60/65/70 from 40/50/60/70/80 would fix it entirely. It rewards alistar for tanking up, reduces the spam ability of it early when it might be too strong in lane, and allows for better spammability late when it is supposed to be spammed.\n\nHis passive should deal 6 (+1/2/3xlvl) damage and 50% bonus to minions. This wouldn't be enough to make laning OP, but late game it at least would compare to a sun fire cape at 42 DPS to champs instead of 24 DPS to champs","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2015-01-14T03:54:42.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
