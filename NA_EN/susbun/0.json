(useless rant.)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"Have you ever loved someone GD and don&#039;t know how to deal with them? Am I in the wrong? \ni feel like amumu rn {{champion:32}}\n\nSo I got jealous, no I am the incarnate of jealousy down to the burning pits and what follows jealousy? Rage\nI got angry and snapped at my boyfriend, the same boy who made the &quot;How Do You Deal With Depression GD?&quot; thread. I&#039;m not usually jealous.\nI snapped at him for being to clingy, I snap at him for the messages he sends. Being rude and quiet when I try to invite him to friend things. I snapped at him for all times I sat in a skype call and got ignored, because he wasn&#039;t paying attention or I got &quot;Well you&#039;re talking to all these guys.&quot; When I casually message someone on my client. For the times I wasn&#039;t allow friends or to go anywhere without a guilt trip or a call. I tried asking nicely like an adult I need some time for other things, it&#039; ignored, With the shouting &quot;WELL TELL ME WHAT I DID.&quot; I&#039;m bitter, doesn&#039;t matter who it&#039;s my personality.  I insult, I jab I don&#039;t know how to deal with other&#039;s insecurity. So when I realized he couldn&#039;t come to me for something so trivial I snapped; let alone talked about it with other females, opened up to others? For the first time I guess I cracked and saw his point of view. \nLike how he doesn&#039;t like me talking to others....yet when it was my feelings it was irrelevant. _Ignored._ &quot;Well you&#039;re treating me like a friend&quot; I never was, it&#039;s in his head, he won&#039;t listen.\nYou&#039;d be distant too, if your lover left you from someone else as a kid (*cough* him). Or you knew your lover lied about trivial things. Like going to sleep or not being logged on. Why even lie are those things eh?. I still put him with it though,like he does me, because I care. Now I&#039;m being ignored, maybe it&#039;s over maybe not. Maybe it&#039;s a taste of my own medicine that&#039;s a huge gulp to swallow. \n\n","replies":[]}
