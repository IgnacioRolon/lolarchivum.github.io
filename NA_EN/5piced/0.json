This occurs at the start of any game featuring full teams and typically freezes at about 2 seconds on the clock when the champions appear to take their places on the map. I have had no history of this happening until a few days ago following the installation of a windows 10 update. I am able to rejoin the match once in progress (if a remake has not been called) but obviously after a full reboot it is difficult to enjoy the game 5 minutes in with no items or experience.\r\n\r\nIs there anyone else out there who has faced the same issue and has found a solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T18:51:42.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been seeing this behavior for specific setups on Windows 10 after the Anniversary updates went out.
