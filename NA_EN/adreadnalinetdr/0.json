Is it because the NA servers were actually down, or is it that I changed the internet modem I used, therefore effecting my server IP pathing? Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T22:00:00.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not seeing any widespread NA server issues around the time you posted this, so I'm wondering if that was in fact related to the new modem settings or something. Check out the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and give your router/modem a good reset and let me know if you're still having problems!","replies":[]}]}
