One hour it's available, and the other it's not. Nothing about this in any kind of status update either. What's happening? Anyone else having this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Dirrty","date":"2017-06-20T15:47:49.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"( Taken from Riot's Post) you'll see \"DRAFT PICK\" available in your client from Midday until Midnight (12:00 to 23:59). These are the peak times that we feel the queue can operate well in. We will TURN THE QUEUE OFF at night, from 00:00 to 11:59. This means you won't see the queue in your client until the next day. That is only for Eune because of high Queue waiting times. I hope i helped clear things out  {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-20T15:22:49.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I'm not seeing any issues with queues being disabled.
