He said, \"No way! Rammus sucks so bad! Do buy him!\" So we argued for a while and I eventually bought ramus. Some of the game highlights with rammus were 16/3, 14/4, and so on. I laughed in my friends face and told him I was legendary and rammus is god. So I wanted your guys' ideas and thoughts. Is rammus underrated? Is rammus bad?

That ADC taking your jungle farm because he \"needs it more than you\"? Good luck getting the farm needed to do your job before the enemy jungler comes to take all your camps as well. They also need to know that you can get to dragon from the fountain or from across the entire map before they get there from bot lane, and that they can all in on a gank because the enemy won't be able to attack them. \n\nIf your team is semi competent then rammus is incredible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-17T00:35:13.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rammus is really good in solo queue and the new Cinderhulk changes are going to make him infinitely better.  He's a situational pick and should be used as a hard counter to heavy AD comps like Xin jungle, Zed mid, etc.\n\nHe does great in low-mid ELO games where players ward the river and not the actual jungle camps, because his power ball lets him close the gap before enemies have the chance to retreat to their tower.\n\nHe has a pretty weak early game which can be exploited by counter jungling and not getting enough farm early on.  Late game he becomes a monster, though.","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRA RAMOOSE","date":"2015-03-19T11:05:58.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too true, but....
