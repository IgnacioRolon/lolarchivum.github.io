But like everything else in life, it's a skill gained slowly.\n\nSomething that a high level jungler would be able to do consistently is predict what buff a jungler will start at, and which lane they will gank after both buffs, or maybe if they will power farm and B for level 4. Being able to predict both of these means you can shut down a jungler hard by removing his double buffs with a well timed countergank/invade, but is not necessarily the best way to \"git gud\" as others say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-05-11T22:23:53.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Life?\n\nIs that a new game coming out?\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KZ Engel","date":"2018-05-11T21:58:54.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you care so little about the game, why do you care about learning it? just play for fun. rank and skill don't matter if you don't care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2018-05-11T21:56:04.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're going to make that many assumptions coming right out of the gate, I think you're already beyond help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2018-05-11T21:42:11.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a life you don't need to care too much about the game then, stick to bots or something.\n\nBesides, if you really want to learn and improve you'd seek out resources like League of Legends Wiki or YouTube guides.\n\nThose two will do better in every way in terms of teaching you how to play than walls of text.","replies":[{"poster":"Bobloser3555","date":"2018-05-11T21:48:38.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont understand why people enjoy playing against bots so much to me its boring.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-05-11T21:46:52.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"uninstall\" is a good advice tbh","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicFatPleb","date":"2018-05-11T21:48:12.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ive reinstalled the game 4 times. each time i regret it. i just wanna play with my friends, but i dont wanna be a burden","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Schenix","date":"2018-05-11T21:45:57.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Practice Tool for pathings, clears, ganks against bots.
