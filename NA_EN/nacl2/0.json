Another thing the reports have in common is Riot support refuses to elaborate on the ban and basically just say &quot;system said ur scripting ur not getting unbanned skriptlord420&quot; I understand that you cannot describe how the system detected it or whatever along those lines, What I don&#039;t understand is when someone has a legitimate dispute against that ban and has ways to prove there was no cheating involved, they&#039;re given a cold shoulder by riot support. one in particular was a very recent post by a challenger player on LAN who was banned for 3rd party programs and when he contacted riot they bluntly said the system detected him as scripting and they said nothing further.\r\n\r\nThis bothers me the most because I&#039;m currently using Overwolf in game which I have shamelessly advertised with the link. The specific feature I use is their instant replay system which allows you to watch a replay of the last 20 seconds in game so you can possibly see what you did wrong or just so you can watch a sick play again. I&#039;ve seen numerous reports by people permabanned for supposedly scripting when in reality they&#039;re just using a replay or recording system. \r\n\r\nOverwolf and other replay systems in no way interfere with the game or give you an unfair advantage. Yes they are 3rd party programs but if rewatching the game so you can improve and not make the same mistakes again is against the rules then you can go ahead and ban 70% of the community that record their games or have replay systems.\r\n\r\nPersonally I feel Riot needs to just remove all automated systems that can result in such harsh punishment, These systems seem to misjudge a lot of people and flag them as cheating when in reality they are doing nothing at all wrong, then when it flags them and they are banned Riot support and most Rioters in general give them a cold shoulder without actually investigating and admitting that the ban was wrong.\r\nI&#039;ve been saying a huge trend lately of Riot never wanted to reverse something that needs to be reversed, maybe it&#039;s  from an inflated ego and thinking everything they do is perfect. I&#039;m not quite sure why it&#039;s happening but I&#039;ve seen too many examples of not fixing something that wasn&#039;t right.\r\n\r\nEither directly say &quot;Riot as a company feels that a replay system can somehow give you an unfair advantage against the competing team so it will result in a permanent ban&quot; or stop punishing people for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2016-02-24T23:10:51.307+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's common when a large number of bans take place for folks to look at places to lay blame, and legit applications like Curse Voice, Championify, Overwolf, and more are common targets.

I can think of several just off the top of my head:\n1) In order to protect their copyright to the code, they can't (in a legal document) give people permission to modify it\n2) If they say something like \"Custom skin programs are always okay\" in the TOS, someone will find a way to exploit it by making skins where hitboxes are clearly visible or something\n3) \"offer no advantages to the player\" is subjective and mutable, and won't hold up in court.

Else how can you be sure? I doubt even Riot knows those numbers with 95-100% accuracy because their \"justice\" system is automated. That's confidential company information. It is not disclosed to the public for obvious reasons.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cloak an Dagger","date":"2016-02-26T07:36:10.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NaCl2,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=svUlkN2L,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-24T02:34:40.370+0000)\n>\n> I&#039;ve seen a few posts now that are starting to scare me because they all have one thing in common, they apparently get flagged for &quot;scripting&quot; but the only 3rd party program they mention is some type of recording or replay software that in no way interferes with the game. Another thing the reports have in common is Riot support refuses to elaborate on the ban and basically just say &quot;system said ur scripting ur not getting unbanned skriptlord420&quot; I understand that you cannot describe how the system detected it or whatever along those lines, What I don&#039;t understand is when someone has a legitimate dispute against that ban and has ways to prove there was no cheating involved, they&#039;re given a cold shoulder by riot support. one in particular was a very recent post by a challenger player on LAN who was banned for 3rd party programs and when he contacted riot they bluntly said the system detected him as scripting and they said nothing further.\n> \n> This bothers me the most because I&#039;m currently using Overwolf in game which I have shamelessly advertised with the link. The specific feature I use is their instant replay system which allows you to watch a replay of the last 20 seconds in game so you can possibly see what you did wrong or just so you can watch a sick play again. I&#039;ve seen numerous reports by people permabanned for supposedly scripting when in reality they&#039;re just using a replay or recording system. \n> \n> Overwolf and other replay systems in no way interfere with the game or give you an unfair advantage. Yes they are 3rd party programs but if rewatching the game so you can improve and not make the same mistakes again is against the rules then you can go ahead and ban 70% of the community that record their games or have replay systems.\n> \n> Personally I feel Riot needs to just remove all automated systems that can result in such harsh punishment, These systems seem to misjudge a lot of people and flag them as cheating when in reality they are doing nothing at all wrong, then when it flags them and they are banned Riot support and most Rioters in general give them a cold shoulder without actually investigating and admitting that the ban was wrong.\n> I&#039;ve been saying a huge trend lately of Riot never wanted to reverse something that needs to be reversed, maybe it&#039;s  from an inflated ego and thinking everything they do is perfect. I&#039;m not quite sure why it&#039;s happening but I&#039;ve seen too many examples of not fixing something that wasn&#039;t right.\n> \n> Either directly say &quot;Riot as a company feels that a replay system can somehow give you an unfair advantage against the competing team so it will result in a permanent ban&quot; or stop punishing people for it.\n\nWell the more players wrongly banned the more money Riot loses. Grey area is a wonderful thing but it won't last forever. So don't feel scared. If banned just go to the next up and coming game.\n\nYou can compare the life of any company to that of a star in the galaxy. It starts out small. Grows and grows until it gets too big and collapses on itself. Sucking all your money that it can and nothing escapes the pull. Not even Lyte.\n\nIt's the fundamental basics of business.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1ezrealvs5scabs","date":"2016-02-26T04:32:55.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another shit thread.
