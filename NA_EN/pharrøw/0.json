Is it a balance issue, map exclusivity, or something else?\n\nI'd love to see it on champs like Diana and Amumu.\n\nEDIT : Loving the discussion here, people. I've asked another question pertaining to nerfing it slightly like increasing the cost to something deserving of its stats or removing its tenacity, was wondering what you guys though about that? I see a lot of discussion about balance (obviously, it's a GREAT item), but not much about what would happen to champions or how it would affect the itemization of AP bruisers and others who found use for the item.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-07-16T08:05:21.879+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two things on the itemization:\n\n1. Tenacity is largely a bruiser stat. It can be good on mages who also buy Zhonya's, but that's basically it. Squishies who get hit by CC tend to die to them anyway, even if it's .5 seconds shorter. Tanks don't really care about being stunned. So it's only for \"I want high damage uptime and I have a fair bit of health.\"\n2. Armor+MR is not generally a good set of stats to have on an item. We have a stat for \"makes you more durable against all incoming damage\" and that stat in Health. Very rarely do Armor and MR exist on the same item. I can't speak to the reasons for why they do.\n\nOverall, you do properly identify that Amumu/Diana want the item. Singed does too. It's something I can ask about, more durability+AP for the melee mage/bruiser types.","replies":[{"poster":"Pharrøw","date":"2014-07-16T11:39:01.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, I'd like to thank you and all the reds for the attention. I'm glad you guys were so willing to discuss something that's I've been interested in fior such a long time.\n\nI'm a fan of AP bruisers because some reason the way they do damage fascinates me (I remember calling them lovetaps for the longest), and I realize how drastically the game could change putting Moonflair on the Rift. Bans of AP bruisers like Singed and Amumu and Diana (my worst fear, Diana being a permaban) would spike.\n\nBuuuuut I can also see super-annoying champs like Kassadin building this and buffing their durability a whole bunch. An even tankier multiflashing assassin that's almost uncatchable scares me more than what would become of actual bruisers.\n\nThe possibilities I see with this item are amazing. Kinda wanna see them on the PBE, even if it requires minor nerfs for a little more balance (cost increase, ect.)

Rumble would see a resurgence if this item was available considering his semi-melee spell range and his melee autos. I could see it as a potential pickup on Vladimir or Mordekaiser as well, both of whom tend to build slightly more tanky because of their short range spells or lack of CC and their need for more sustained battles. Even Kassadin or Gragas could probably make solid use of it.\n\nI'd be a bit worried about a few outlying cases though. I could see the potential for abuse on supports with this item; almost every single support could massively abuse this item unless its cost was so high that it really prohibited their purchasing it until very late in the game.

Sorcerer's boots are the fastest built and one of the few sources of flat magic penetration in the game which makes it a priority item for most mages, be they melee or ranged.\n\nfor Melee mages however tenacity can be just as sought after depending on your enemy's composition. While physical/Attack damage champions have their own source of tenacity with zephyr and merc treads, since they deal their damage with auto attacks for the most part which happen multiple times over the course of a few seconds unlike most mage abilities, they have the luxury of picking up these items without a major impact to their builds. Mages don't have that luxury, it is either a choice between tenacity from merc treads at the sacrifice of precious magic penetration or the other way around. Not all mages benefit greatly from zhonyas and its stasis which leaves them at a disadvantage compared to their physical damage counterparts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-07-15T03:24:59.827+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I wonder if there are AP bruiser champions who effectively operate as such (c'mon, Diana's played most effectively as an assassin right now).

Does it create more player expression or does it make the big fat bullies even bigger, fatter bullies?

Moonflair doesn't give the other stat Merc Treads provides:  magic resistance.\nTo me, MR is far more important, since for most team fight situations, if you get hit by one CC, you're going to die, whether you have tenacity or not.  Tenacity is more of a tank stat - since you can actually survive the burst of 2-3 players.\nThe only time I'm tempted to build tenacity as a mage is when there's a silence on the enemy team,  since getting silenced is less deadly than getting stunned, but still important to get out of early.\n\nAlso, when playing assassins, I note that I rarely care about the duration of CC, because assassins are generally very binary.  You go in and either use all your abilities, or get hit by a CC.  If you get CC'd, you're dead unless the target is alone, in which case you have a chance.  And .25 seconds less CC isn't going to change the 1v1, nor save you in the dive in (unlike Zhonya's, which lasts long enough for your abilities to come off c/d).","replies":[{"poster":"Pharrøw","date":"2014-07-15T05:56:49.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Moonflair does give MR, though.

It is just too many types of stats in one place while being cost and slot efficient.  There is no reason to not buy it.  \nBut more importantly, I hate the ar and mr on the same item part.  With the exception of GA and warmogs, buying defensive items is a choice between ar and mr, followed by a choice of what do you want to go with your resist.  I think this choice is healthy for the game and I am opposed to giving out both on one item.  I have mixed feelings on GA, but I consider it ok because it is clearly bad as an item when the extra life is on cd, aka it has a clearly defined weakness (but possibly needs a slight nerf anyway).   There is no such weakness on Spellblade.  It is an amazing item all the time.  Quite frankly, I could see this item being must rush and making champs that are not effective with it not viable in mid and top.","replies":[{"poster":"Pharrøw","date":"2014-07-16T03:36:31.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought that if it DID appear on SR the cost would be about 3000.\n\nThat way, the champs that rushed it were more akin to those that rushed a Bloodthirster or Rabadon's in lane, sacrificing a stat for what could make them viable later in the game.\n\nIf you rush a super expensive item, you're sacrificing either defense or offense, and the opponent can capitalize on that. Counterplay is allowed with cost increases, because you're given time to predict to and react to what your enemy is building. Someone who builds a Seeker's Armguard in lane can be taken advantage of regardless of what they were building. The wait time getting then gold necessary to complete the item makes it a little more balanced.\n\nOr so I think. I could be entirely wrong, but a 3000G Moonflair Spellblade is something I want to see on the PBE, just for results.","replies":[]}]}]}
