I main support and I usually roll with Morgana{{champion:25}} , but she's not ideal for all comps.  When this used to arise, I would play Taric{{champion:44}}  because he was still worthwhile.  Now I would say that as a support, Taric is outclassed by pretty much all other viable supports.\r\n\r\nThe pros and cons as I see them are-\r\nPro:\r\nAOE-Knockup CC x2\r\nAOE heal that also does damage\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nSquishy\r\nVery avoidable knockup\r\nHard to play aggressive early\r\n\r\nI see Janna{{champion:40}} as a similar champ to Nami and I have trouble playing Janna.  However, I have never tried Nami to see if she's very different.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?  Would I like her or should I save my money?","replies":[{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-08-07T08:10:56.908+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's an incredibly effective and useful support, and nowhere near as difficult to play as people make her out to be. If you play support a lot, then yeah, she's definitely a worthwhile pickup.\n\nShe's also the best support for Yasuo, so that's fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglyBunnies","date":"2014-08-07T20:45:29.482+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you all for your comments, based on that I have bought Nami and am surprised at how good her engage is and how aggressive I can be, she's still really soft but items/runes can help.","replies":[{"poster":"themaddscientist","date":"2014-08-08T23:37:53.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole reason why I started playing {{champion:267}}  was because, unlike {{champion:40}} , she can be played really aggressively. The other reason is just because Aqua Prison, if you can land it, gives you a decent amount of control that a lot of squishy supports don't have until later on ({{champion:37}}, I'm looking at you).  She is squishy, but so are most caster supports (you don't realize how high {{champion:25}} 's base armor is until you play her), but that usually isn't a problem with the build I use, specifically due to {{item:3190}} , {{item:3047}} , and  {{item:3028}} as well as a decent amount of armor/magic resistance on my runes. I don't know if {{champion:267}}  is necessarily the most viable support, but she competes with {{champion:412}}  for title of the most adaptable support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-08T20:48:46.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah! You can totally be aggressive with her ~ her W has a pretty significant range. \n\nI used to be a Sona main, and at the time, she was getting picked pretty frequently in my games, and I wanted to pick up another champion with a heal.

She is fun, effective, and has a lot of utility. She isn't as hard as people make her out to be, but it'll take a while to get the hang of her Aqua Prison. I highly recommend playing her. She is pretty compared to other champions base speed as well, so that helps with the problem of her being squishy. I like to play her super aggressive early and it usually works out, so I wouldn't worry about that. \n---\n{{champion:21}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"innervation","date":"2014-08-08T21:03:01.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elite nami's hit q's.
