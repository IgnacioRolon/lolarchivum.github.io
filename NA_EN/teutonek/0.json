He messaged me asking if I would like to mystery gift trade him (790rp). As before, we'd been friends for some time on League so I said sure why not. Well upon sending his gift he deleted me. Anything I can do here? I would post his name but dont think its critical to a forum since the mods can preview old chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-08-12T04:21:59.072+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Completely sucks to lose a friend and get a knife in the back at the same time. Been through similar situations myself so I know how you feel.\n\nSadly, I can't enforce personal agreements, like gift trading, between two players. They're not binding contracts, and we don't have a scalable way for Riot to be a divorce court for ex-friends. :(\n\nIn the future, be cautious and skeptical about deals like this. As you've seen, there is a high likelihood you can end up with the short end of the stick. \nAnother option is to only send gifts when you don't expect anything in return, that way you'll never be let down!","replies":[{"poster":"Shadwborn","date":"2015-08-16T12:10:15.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please help.

I apologize, but I also cannot reverse your gift. I understand that this may be frustrating, but we have built several warnings into the gifting process to remind you what you're gifting and who will be receiving the gift before you hit the \"Unlock\" button.\n\n>The gifting feature was added to provide our players a way to gift their friends with Riot Points or content such as Champions or skins. Using the gifting feature as a way to trade content between players is not the intended function of gifting. As we cannot control or verify the actions and intents of our players, we advise against using the gifting system for trading.\n\n>I'm sorry that I cannot help you further. Please let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xuxa","date":"2015-08-12T02:57:36.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the long con :(","replies":[]}]}
