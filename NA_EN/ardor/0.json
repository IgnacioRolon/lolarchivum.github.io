Sometime into the game I walked over to Cloud Drake and started to kill it. I killed the dragon with my E and even though it was dead, I was able to reactivate my E. I also tried it on blue buff and I was still able to reactive my E after killing blue buff with it. I then tried the same thing on champions. I entered a new custom game as Kled against Tristana. I got her to low hp and made sure to kill her with my E. After killing her with my E I still able to dash back through her by reactivating my E even though she was dead. I&#039;m not sure if this was intended but I do not think being able reactivate Kled E on a deceased target is it&#039;s intended use. If anyone could recreate this for me and record it, it would be greatly appreciated as I don&#039;t have the ability to record myself. Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a great day!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-09-05T04:04:56.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally intended.
