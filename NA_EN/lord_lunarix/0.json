The effect sounds, such as abilities, changing form, basic attacks, etc. worked, except the passive music.  I checked all the sound settings on my client and the settings in game, but alas, nothing.  So I was wondering if it was just a patch issue or...what?  \r\nMany Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"E0L","date":"2015-02-25T23:46:02.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you gone to options to see what your music is set to, i turn it off so i didnt hear it at first either","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-26T00:26:31.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the first thing I would check. \n\nYour friends will need to opt into the experience by holding tab and clicking on the music note icon.

Earlier today one of my friends who owns dj sona played as sona with the skin on, I go into game i press tab and click the button but no music. I've also had the 99% problem, though i've always thought there's no need to fix it since i can just exit the patcher, rerun it, and it patches like normal. I think this  is probably a rare occurance since there's only like 3 people on this forum that state they have the problem but i think it would be very worth looking into, considering you're getting 25 dollars for each person you help XP","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luticman","date":"2015-02-26T01:56:49.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue here.
