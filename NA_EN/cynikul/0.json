I find that super disheartening- even if he is that &quot;play level&quot;, no one should get unranked players in ~plat and/or around that level, or in there promotional matches. That&#039;s not fair and should never have to happen to a player, your matchmaking guesswork shouldn&#039;t be done in higher stake matches and its absolutely absurd that someone like this would pass through. No, i&#039;m not even bitching about the player, not even saying it&#039;s his or her fault, but this should literally never happen.\n\nEdit: I could care less that its likely a smurf; don't do guesswork, place these people around silver and THEN see how they fair in their matches before moving it anywhere close to gold.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-20T19:18:35.524+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Said player also carried most of their previous games with total stompfests.\n\nSeems to do better than you, at a glance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-05-20T19:16:13.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was Diamond last season.

I'm a pretty firm believer that even if you were XXX rank last season, your MMR should be reset to a ~silver level, and if you're smashing players, move up to gold level in the provisionals. But IDK, maybe its an over reaction. I just dont feel like the person was the player that originally owned the account.","replies":[]}]}]}
