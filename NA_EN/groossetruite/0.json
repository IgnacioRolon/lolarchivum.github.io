It's possible that you might be logging onto the wrong account, though.  Hit us up through an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and our account team can help recover it with you.  See you there!","replies":[{"poster":"GroosseTruite","date":"2017-06-24T20:42:46.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for the quick reply. I was also wandering how it's possible to remove my database from LoL EUW server. Maybe I log to the wrong account indeed. So by submitting a ticket there will be a way to find my \"real\" account ? Anyway I submit the ticket","replies":[]}]}]}
