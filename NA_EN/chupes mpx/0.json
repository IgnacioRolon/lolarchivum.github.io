I tried it out on my machine and got the same error. Removing them fixed it although the installer is going to default to the same directory (because the registry is storing the old filepath and not updating it for whatever reason) so you're going to have to manually redirect it to the updated file path. \n\nSteps:\n1. Remove brackets! [Game] --> Game\n2. Launch Installer and observe that it still thinks the filepath with [Game] exists. Edit it by selecting your updated filepath clicking on the folder icon to the right on the text box and select your updated filepath\n3. Run installer!\n\nThat should fix it but let me know if it doesn't. Happy Testing ^___^~","replies":[{"poster":"Chupes MPx","date":"2016-06-09T23:16:49.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot, it's working now.
