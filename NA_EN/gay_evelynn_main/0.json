But what do you mean by riot won't be addressing it at this time? Does this mean they have something visual in the works for her right now, and don't want to fix something that won't  be a thing soon anyway? Is riot too busy with other bugs, such as the zz'rot one right now?  Or is this bug just something you are going to leave?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-22T21:34:22.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I understand something like this might be trivial...

I'm on the Skins team myself, so I don't have a lot of insight into what's coming down the road besides what's listed on the Champion Update page. \n\n> Is riot too busy with other bugs, such as the zz'rot one right now?\n\nEach team has their own bugs, so skins wouldn't be fixing Zz'Rot, but we do have other emergent bugs, such as bugs for upcoming content, as well as other issues like Snow Day Malzahar's recall poro being all blue. \n\n> Or is this bug just something you are going to leave?\n\nFor now, we are going to be leaving it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DexterousGecko","date":"2016-02-20T01:37:15.737+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"how was the comment vague?
