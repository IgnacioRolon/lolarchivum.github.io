When the game loaded the screen was still black but i could hear the sound.  I flashed and heard the flash, I tried using an ability and heard it go off.  I also think I could type in the chat, but the screen remained black.\r\n\r\nI've noticed other mac users running into problems similar to these ever since this new patch, and some other problems, but was just wondering if anyone on this board was experiencing these problems and new how to fix it, or if this is something on riots end.  This wasn't happening before the patch and I could play everything fine, so i don't know whats going on.","replies":[{"poster":"I ADCarry","date":"2017-01-12T02:40:18.404+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"THANK YOU, at least im not the only one, its honestly making the game unplayable for me, and its just this patch thats been doing this...

However, the majority of the mac users playing league has the setting on 'More Space'. When this happens, from what I think, the resolution between your mac and the game client is different so like you said, if I was to get into the game, everything works fine, but I have to alt tab then come back into the game, my screen would be frozen if I don't click my mouse for like 0.2 seconds.\n\nSo for me when I play, the 'temporary' fix that I have (Because I have to do it everytime I alt-tab) is this.\n\n1. Just get into the game then when you look at the game/video setting.\n\n2. I have my game resolution set to 1680 x 1050 and the 'More Space' for the Mac display resolution is also 1680 x 1050.  So when my client goes into the game and changes the mac book display resolution to default (1280 x 800), the different resolutions may have caused the problem. So set the game client resolution to 1680 x 1050.\n\n3. Then when your game gets dodgy, try going into system preference for MAC, then Display, and change the resolution to 'More Space' (Because it should've been automatically changed to 'Default'). Once you've changed to 'More Space', just alt-tab back into the game and you should have no problem (Make sure the client resolution is also 1680 x 1050.)\n\nThis worked for me but tbh, it is still very annoying having to click on the display settings and changing after every alt tab when needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daeguian","date":"2017-01-17T03:24:59.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have exactly same problem as you, and I just realized that when I stop moving my mouse, the screen freezes and when I keep moving my mouse, it get back to normal.
