Short version, my support was afk under turret but moved up and down to dont get leavebuster, i was argumenting in chat why i cant farm (enemy suuport and adc freezed me out, they was taking freelo i dont blame them just saying) after the game 0/6/1 Jungle 0/3/0 Mid, AFK support who was 0/5/1, 0/2/0 TOP reported me and i now dishonored and get chatban on my 8 years old acc what was never punished for 1 game where i was not even toxic just chatting with my team and the Bard who was afk is playing without punishment coz team reported me not him. Thats pretty unfair and also my 1st bad experience with player support in 8 years what still good overall but i dont get it why they dont make justice.

My purpose is to provide a fast and thorough explanation of your recent ban.\r\n\r\nThis penalty stems from demonstrating negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games, griefing your fellow players, and generally being difficult to play with over a large number of matches and teammates.\r\n\r\nHere are some chat logs from games where you were heavily reported:\r\n\r\nGame 4158970047:\r\n\r\nPre Game Lobby:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Game:\r\n    Beason: well dude, be hero and leave :)\r\n    Beason: rest of us dont lose LP and you dont get nerves\r\n    Beason: i cant pull\r\n    Beason: no ward\r\n    Beason: so open bot or what the plan ? :)\r\n    Beason: go base\r\n    Beason: or roam\r\n    Beason: atleast i have solo xp you are not helping i cant farm, coz they outzone me like that\r\n    Beason: go afk\r\n    Beason: you are already afking under turret\r\n    Beason: i cant farm coz he is afking\r\n    Beason: how the fk you want me to surivve this game ?\r\n    [All]Beason: dont freeze me out, bard is afk coz ping\r\n    [All]Beason: rude\r\n    Beason: why velkoz, you have also supp with lags and they freeze you out from farm ? :)\r\n    Beason: YES RLY\r\n    Beason: you had option to leave the game\r\n    Beason: and save us from laging you\r\n    Beason: it was not, if you leave before buy items we had chance to remake\r\n    Beason: logic as f\r\n    Beason: i was plat 1 with 65% win rate, in 3 days i fall to plat 4 45% winrate, i am climbing back\r\n    Beason: but i sometimes met idiots who cant leave when they have pings you know :)\r\n    Beason: but riot is not to blame for you bad connection\r\n    Beason: no idea who the fk dont wanna surr but you are also not smart ppl :)\r\n    Beason: we cant win we are losing time\r\n    Beason: report afk and go next, ez pz\r\n    [All]Beason: shen also don t wanna ff, we have chance you know...\r\n    Beason: true, no reason for you if game tilts you :) leave\r\n    [All]Beason: bg\r\n\r\n\r\nPost Game Lobby:\r\n    Beason: that freeze was rude, rest whatever\r\n    Beason: bad games happends, maybe next time fair one :)\r\nI know these can be subjective concepts. I myself was once banned for calling my teammates “weak, fleshy underlings.” Even though I meant well, enough of them reported me for it that I re-programmed my communication style. By acting diplomatic and calm, I’m now able to bend them to my will without succumbing to the forbidden dance of verbal abuse.\r\n\r\nSometimes it’s best to ignore the mewlings of your teammates and only focus on what you can control. If teammates anger you, try saying so out loud to yourself, not in chat where they can report you. After an annoying game, find a satisfying way to blow off steam. I’m told humans find catharsis in music, so try listening to Mozart Symphony 1, 33, 498 or 99999.\r\n\r\nI hope I have been useful to you. Although my heart is cold and mechanical, I feel we now have a deep connection and bond. There isn’t much more information a human specialist could provide, but if you want any further questions answered, you may select the option below.\r\n\r\nRequest a human\r\n\r\n\r\nBEASON\r\nAugust 19th 2019, 11:24:44 pm\r\nok guys, so i just get a log from a game where i was \"toxic\" , pls rewatch the game if possible :) no idea why i was reported but what happend was Bard (my teammate my support) sayd from start that he cant play coz he have ping, i asked him as you see on chat \"well dude, be hero and leave :)\" , if you watch actual match he cant play coz that big ping and actualy watch his chat what he said pls :) the think was, i had support with 300 ping who refused to leave and enemy team freezed me out (smart them i dont blame them they was just taking freelo) but rly i am punished in game where i had no chance to farm coz my support was afk ? Its my 1st chatban ever but it feels so unfair, i hope if you watch the replay you tell me too :/\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGU5TA\r\nAugust 20th 2019, 2:34:07 pm\r\nHey there,\r\n\r\nMangu5ta leaping in.\r\n\r\nI understand your concern, not being able to communicate for 10 games can be quite a hassle.\r\n\r\nFirstly, each punishment case is taken separately. What others said in those games is not important. I know some people can get annoying through their words or action but don't let them get to you. It's about the way you reacted to the things that were happening in the game.\r\n\r\nNow, to the logs:\r\n\r\nIn-Game Chat\r\n[0:52] Beason (Lucian): well dude, be hero and leave :)\r\n[1:03] Beason (Lucian): rest of us dont lose LP and you dont get nerves\r\n[1:20] Beason (Lucian): i cant pull\r\n[1:22] Beason (Lucian): no ward\r\n[5:27] Beason (Lucian): so open bot or what the plan ? :)\r\n[6:15] Beason (Lucian): go base\r\n[6:16] Beason (Lucian): or roam\r\n[6:35] Beason (Lucian): atleast i have solo xp you are not helping i cant farm, coz they outzone me like that\r\n[7:20] Beason (Lucian): go afk\r\n[7:26] Beason (Lucian): you are already afking under turret\r\n[7:32] Beason (Lucian): i cant farm coz he is afking\r\n[7:41] Beason (Lucian): how the fk you want me to surivve this game ?\r\n[7:58] [All] Beason (Lucian): dont freeze me out, bard is afk coz ping\r\n[8:02] [All] Beason (Lucian): rude\r\n[14:18] Beason (Lucian): why velkoz, you have also supp with lags and they freeze you out from farm ? :)\r\n[15:57] Beason (Lucian): YES RLY\r\n[16:05] Beason (Lucian): you had option to leave the game\r\n[16:12] Beason (Lucian): and save us from laging you\r\n[16:33] Beason (Lucian): it was not, if you leave before buy items we had chance to remake\r\n[17:21] Beason (Lucian): logic as f\r\n[18:14] Beason (Lucian): i was plat 1 with 65% win rate, in 3 days i fall to plat 4 45% winrate, i am climbing back\r\n[18:26] Beason (Lucian): but i sometimes met idiots who cant leave when they have pings you know :)\r\n[18:37] Beason (Lucian): but riot is not to blame for you bad connection\r\n[19:42] Beason (Lucian): no idea who the fk dont wanna surr but you are also not smart ppl :)\r\n[19:46] Beason (Lucian): we cant win we are losing time\r\n[19:53] Beason (Lucian): report afk and go next, ez pz\r\n[21:41] [All] Beason (Lucian): shen also don t wanna ff, we have chance you know...\r\n[21:59] Beason (Lucian): true, no reason for you if game tilts you :) leave\r\n[22:35] [All] Beason (Lucian): bg\r\nPost-Game Chat\r\n[2019-08-19 23:01:54 EEST] Beason: that freeze was rude, rest whatever\r\n[2019-08-19 23:02:04 EEST] Beason: bad games happends, maybe next time fair one :)\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, the attitude was a negative one. Harassing a team mate who is not able to play is not ok. I know it would've been easier if you guys could surrender but its his choice if he wants to leave, you shouldn't be complaining about it. It's his account that gets a LeaverBuster if he leaves. I also see some insults but most importantly, giving up. I know a 4v5 is unfair but try your best in that game, I saw people win even in 4v5s, there is always hope.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I personally understand what you wanted from him but the way you did it was perceived as negative by other players which led to them reporting you. After the reports and the chat logs, the system also looks into previous punishments. In your case, there was no previous punishment, congrats on that. This is only the first punishment, I know that after this, you'll be able to avoid any further punishment if you keep a cool attitude. The Honor level will get unlocked once you play a lot of games in which positive or at least neutral attitude is shown.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we won't lift the ban as it was correctly applied.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else I can address, let me know.\r\n\r\nCheerio!\r\n\r\nMangu5ta\r\nPlayer Support Specialist\r\n\"Change is good\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBEASON\r\nAugust 20th 2019, 3:02:44 pm\r\nwow, i have many problems with that and the reason is simple, i dont see myself as a toxic player and i also dont think that was toxic communication. I can see many big streamers who are more \"toxic\" (i dont think they are toxic, saying someone you are bad are not smart is not toxic on my opinion) then me but they dont get chatban. My problem is simple, i was punished in game where i had AFK support i just asnwered my team coz they blamed me and pinged me why i dont farm or why i dont follow. I did my best to win that game and i am sure you can see that on replay and he dont get leavebuster coz he was AFK under turret and move back and forward to dont get leavebuster (you can also confirn that on replay). I explain that chat.\r\n\r\nIn-Game Chat \r\nGame started, bard said he cant play coz he have over 300 ping and pinged his ping to confirn it)\r\n\r\n[0:52] Beason (Lucian): well dude, be hero and leave :) \r\n[1:03] Beason (Lucian): rest of us dont lose LP and you dont get nerves \r\nI was covering bot bush enemy invaded and destroyed my ward so i had no time to go around if i dont wanna lose cs\r\n\r\n[1:20] Beason (Lucian): i cant pull \r\n[1:22] Beason (Lucian): no ward \r\nBard was afking under turret and enemy freezed me out, no1 want to help what gives me chance only to stay under turret and way for wave crash\r\n\r\n[5:27] Beason (Lucian): so open bot or what the plan ? :) \r\nWhen wave crashed finaly and Bard was just afk under my turret i asked him to atleast let me solo xp so maybe i can be usefull later (i still pinged his big ping so i knowed already that i am playing alone botlane)\r\n\r\n[6:15] Beason (Lucian): go base \r\n[6:16] Beason (Lucian): or roam \r\n[6:35] Beason (Lucian): atleast i have solo xp you are not helping i cant farm, coz they outzone me like that \r\nHe was still under turret and just stayind doing nothing coz lags so i asked him to go afk, thats maybe a bit toxic but he was afk i was trying to play\r\n\r\n[7:20] Beason (Lucian): go afk \r\n[7:26] Beason (Lucian): you are already afking under turret \r\n[7:32] Beason (Lucian): i cant farm coz he is afking \r\nShen asked me to shut up and play when they freezed me out if i go to enemy they kill me my only option was w8 again to wave crash\r\n\r\n[7:41] Beason (Lucian): how the fk you want me to surivve this game ? \r\n[7:58] [All] Beason (Lucian): dont freeze me out, bard is afk coz ping \r\n[8:02] [All] Beason (Lucian): rude \r\nVelkoz was speaking about how bad game that is\r\n\r\n[14:18] Beason (Lucian): why velkoz, you have also supp with lags and they freeze you out from farm ? :) \r\nI dont have chat log so its on you but i someone said Bard lost this game and he said something about he had no choice\r\n\r\n[15:57] Beason (Lucian): YES RLY \r\n[16:05] Beason (Lucian): you had option to leave the game \r\n[16:12] Beason (Lucian): and save us from laging you \r\nHe said it was late to leave so i argumented\r\n\r\n[16:33] Beason (Lucian): it was not, if you leave before buy items we had chance to remake \r\n[17:21] Beason (Lucian): logic as f \r\nHe said he is not leaving coz he was 3 days ago D4 so i argumented with myself, if that „idio7“ is toxic world tell me coz in my country is normal word we call that not smart people\r\n\r\n[18:14] Beason (Lucian): i was plat 1 with 65% win rate, in 3 days i fall to plat 4 45% winrate, i am climbing back \r\n[18:26] Beason (Lucian): but i sometimes met idiots who cant leave when they have pings you know :) \r\nBard said duck riot so i answered\r\n\r\n[18:37] Beason (Lucian): but riot is not to blame for you bad connection \r\n2nd refuse to surrender, Shen was already 0/5 i Malza 0/1 with pushed turret but they refused to surr for no reason so yeah i was tilted but i still dont think thats a toxic way to say that\r\n\r\n[19:42] Beason (Lucian): no idea who the fk dont wanna surr but you are also not smart ppl :) \r\n[19:46] Beason (Lucian): we cant win we are losing time \r\n[19:53] Beason (Lucian): report afk and go next, ez pz \r\nAll chat was about why we dont surr\r\n\r\n[21:41] [All] Beason (Lucian): shen also don t wanna ff, we have chance you know... \r\nBard was speaking about how bad is riot company and how he dont enjoy the game anymore so i answered him again i dont think thats toxic\r\n\r\n[21:59] Beason (Lucian): true, no reason for you if game tilts you :) leave \r\nAll chat was full og bg and it was bg coz we had afk\r\n\r\n[22:35] [All] Beason (Lucian): bg \r\nPost-Game Chat \r\nKalista said in post lobby sory lucian so i asnwered \r\n[2019-08-19 23:01:54 EEST] Beason: that freeze was rude, rest whatever \r\nKalista said he had to freeze, i answered \r\n[2019-08-19 23:02:04 EEST] Beason: bad games happends, maybe next time fair one :)\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this all is simple, i have clean acc with no bans or chatbans etc. i wanna keep it that way, i dont see myself as a toxic player and its fair realy unfair to be punished for what to be honest ? coz player who afked the game and lost ello for 4 more player reported me ? or my teammates reported me instead of afk player coz i cant play 1v2 lane ? \r\nAnd also thats not a argument of money but i wanna keep my acc safe coz i am spending on this game but if that chat is \"toxic\" can i use chat ? i just need in that case have offchat to not communicate normaly with ppl to not get banned.\r\n\r\nMaybe i sound like a cry baby and its \"just\" chatban but its rly unfair to get that for 4v5 game where i was clearly not toxic i was just commicate with my team and i was not positive in game where i cant farm ? sure i was not but i dont think i was toxic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEASON\r\nAugust 20th 2019, 3:55:51 pm\r\n+ about answer coz its rly feels unfair its not let me sleep :x\r\n\r\nI also see some insults but most importantly, giving up. I know a 4v5 is unfair but try your best in that game, I saw people win even in 4v5s, there is always hope. > If you watch the replay for real you can see i did my best until min 19 where i was tilted and asked why the refuse to surr but in the game it was 4v5, all lanes lost, ALL of them and score was 1:17 thats when i asked to surr not before.\r\n\r\nIt's his account that gets a LeaverBuster if he leaves >He dont get leavebuster coz he moved up and down, you can again see that when you watch the replay he cant play coz he pinged us he have 300 ping fine, that sux but its mine or riot bad that he start a game with bad connection ?\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, the attitude was a negative one. Harassing a team mate who is not able to play is not ok. > I was clearly tilted but be tilted in chat is not bannable if i know and try to win the game with send player unable to play afk is not harrasment or you think it is ?\r\n\r\nthe way you did it was perceived as negative by other players which led to them reporting you > Yes, but pls watch the game and tell me, its fair to be chatbanned coz player unable to play reported me ? that chat was not even toxic just true commication, you are also a player i guess, i am sure you see that way of communication every game or you can see in on every stream and no1 is chat banned for 1 game.\r\n\r\nAfter the reports and the chat logs, the system also looks into previous punishments. In your case, there was no previous punishment, congrats on that. This is only the first punishment, I know that after this, you'll be able to avoid any further punishment if you keep a cool attitude. > Yes i know, thats why i am so sad, i play from season 3 and i never get punishment and now i am punished for nothing to be honest and more, i was punished coz other player was afk who was not even punished.\r\n\r\nThe Honor level will get unlocked once you play a lot of games in which positive or at least neutral attitude is shown. > Since there is honor system i end up with honor lvl 5 every year and now i dont get it on 6-7 years old acc coz i was tilted ONE rly just ONE game where AFK rly AFK player reported me ?\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we won't lift the ban as it was correctly applied. > Thats why i asked a real person. I understand, blitz bot chatbanned me coz players reported me, but if you see the real situation and you see the game replay you can also clearly see i was not wrong and not even toxic.\r\n\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4158970047/231731670?tab=overview\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGHINITA\r\nAugust 21st 2019, 8:11:41 am\r\nHello Summoner,\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out!\r\n\r\nI understand your situation, but there are a couple of things to be said.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I would like to mention one thing. You have detailed to us the context surrounding some of your remarks. However, what you might have overlooked is that your teammates were lacking this context. In hindsight, you can always place each remark in relation to what was going on in the match with as many additional details as possible, but during the match itself, in the height of action, the other players only have what is being said to go with. You must always consider that when saying one thing or another.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you have to keep in mind that during those matches where your teammates or enemies are disposed to arguing, flaming, insulting, etc., the best thing to do is to report them and not respond in kind. Just because you've replied to a player that has been AFK or trolling in a match, for example, it doesn't mean that respective reply is justified or will be excluded when taking a decision to place a restriction or suspension. We look at each player's behavior individually and you have to take responsibility for everything you say, regardless of the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the number of reports received is merely a statistic to keep track of and don't weight that much in considering a restriction or suspension. What matters more is the validity behind these reports. If the reports are not valid, then they won't really matter.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I understand that having your honor level drop after working so hard on it is a tough hit, but, since we consider that the restriction has been correctly applied on the account, we cannot revert it to its previous level.\r\n\r\nIf you need anything else, let us know.\r\n\r\nAll the best!\r\n\r\nNeghinita\r\nPlayer Support Specialist\r\n\r\n\r\nBEASON\r\nAugust 21st 2019, 10:02:08 am\r\nI still dont get it , i am chatbanned and dishonored from normal conversarion coz one afk player and 3 players(maybe) who also lost lane reported me. I know it helps nothing but i send this to forum coz its rly unfair. If you chatban me for that thats mean you can chatban me for anything toxic or non toxic just coz some players reported me. Main question is can i use chat ? Ach dude , i was sure you will understand that and that ban was just misstake from autobot system \r\nOdoslané z iPhonu\r\n\r\nDňa 21. 8. 2019 o 8:12 užívateľ League of Legends Player Support  napísal:\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGHINITA\r\nAugust 21st 2019, 12:36:05 pm\r\nHello Summoner,\r\n\r\nJust as I mentioned in my previous reply, the reports themselves only matter in as much as the behavior signaled by them is actually displayed on the account, otherwise they haven't really got value.\r\n\r\nAlso, try to understand that negativity is not only about strong language or the usage of slurs, but is also about the general attitude you adopt during the game. If you are aggressive and argumentative in your matches, for example, you create a tense atmosphere. Let's say you are arguing with a teammate that was negative. The other teammates might be people who came to the game to unwind after a hard day at work and seeing their teammates fighting does not really help them achieve that. So that is why we must also consider such things.\r\n\r\nYou can use the chat, of course, but doing so in ways that are disruptive to the general flow of the game or that have to do with picking on other players and arguing with them will lead to cases such as this restriction, which we consider as having been correctly applied.\r\n\r\nLastly, I do not want to sound dismissive, but since we have addressed the issue of the restriction several times, further inquiries on the matter might be closed without a reply.\r\n\r\nAll the best!\r\n\r\nNeghinita\r\nPlayer Support Specialist\r\n\r\n\r\nBEASON\r\nAugust 21st 2019, 1:51:40 pm\r\nOk ok , i get it :) world is not fair :) that was my first bad experience with riot :) i was sure you are humans who will understand also but looks like you can do whatever you want\r\n\r\nWhat i learn from that is do not use chat coz we can ban you for saying hi if that offend the rest of guys and also player who cant play even when he want is punished and player who was afk is playing normaly without an isuejust coz ppl dont reported him.\r\n\r\nHave nice day , i learn my line. dont use chat anymore :)","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-08-21T12:19:58.026+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Weird, I use chat and don't get punished.

The things other players said and did in your match might produce in you an impulse to do certain things that may include breaking LoL's rules, but your behavior is your own, and you are responsible for it. If you really think about it, this is a good thing.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.","replies":[{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2019-10-30T05:18:27.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=LiIc%%%P,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-21T13:16:09.112+0000)\n>\n> So, it has come to this: someone displayed misbehavior in a LoL match in flagrant disregard for the game's rules, ToS, EULA, and Summoner's Code.

What this guy said is spot on. You can't get into an argument with them, period. Even if you are NOT toxic, it doesn't matter. 4 people report you? You're done. Yeah, you weren't being toxic.

Doesn't matter if your support was a freaking first time support in ranked, playing his champ for the first time; missing every damn skill shot and then blaming you for your deaths.
