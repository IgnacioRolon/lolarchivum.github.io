People were complaining about not getting their role in the old draft because according to whose picking first, they get to choose the role they get.\r\n2. Dynamic queue took like 5-30 min to find 1 match.\r\n3. Now with autofill, people complain about not getting their role.\r\n\r\nNow look folks, with the new draft, you ask for a role. Unlike back then you have people that would say mid or feed and all of that. Would you rather let rng decide your fate with the old draft or let autofill remain in which you have an higher chance of getting your actual role because autofill turns on and off","replies":[{"poster":"Support BÎ¿t","date":"2017-01-29T20:22:17.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play supports.
