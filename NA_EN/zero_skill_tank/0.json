It&#039;s not that the artist did bad job, it&#039;s just that those skins don&#039;t really have much going on in them. They are both pretty, but at the same time they don&#039;t really feel like you have your champion skinned.\r\n\r\nPoppy got an uber-cool skin soon after her rework, can Yorick player hope for _anything_ finally too?
