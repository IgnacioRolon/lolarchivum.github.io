See, armor is much more abundand than MR (due to oversaturation in armor penetration), so that more Magic penetration items can&#039;t really be added - indeed, when MR aura was removed, even 3 items we have now were too much and led to giving more free MR to all ranged champions. Adding more impactful magic pen item would make mages unstopable, and that&#039;s not the goal.\r\n\r\nSame applies to mana - most AP champions get a single mana item, some of them can get two. The system already inludes all mana items we could ever want - indeed, with a little good will even ROA and Archangels could (and should) be merged into single item, they are vrtually identical (scaling over time + mana + AP + hp/shield).\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR here is that item system __in it&#039;s very core__ doesn&#039;t offer enough for AP champions - not only AP items are in a state that is far from satisfactory, it&#039;s hard to even imagine an item that would change that - we don&#039;t need 13th AP/CDR item, CDR is capped and AP stacking doesn&#039;t scale that well.\r\n\r\nSo, my proposals focus on introducing new options for AP champions\r\n\r\n* AP upgrade for Kircheis Shard\r\n   - there are many AP champions who would enjoy AP/AS item, but their kit doesn&#039;t support DPS playstyle enough to invest in pure DPS item like Tooth. Energized attack would give them a middle ground between burst and dps style. Potential users: {{champion:268}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:4}} \r\n\r\n* Empowered recall item\r\n  - mages are the only class that needs to recall lategame, that&#039;s a fact (a bit streched, but still). While this is OK as a weakness, allowing them to build to partially mittigate it would be a cool option. Potential users: every mana reliant mage.\r\n\r\n* tower-damage as a statistic\r\n  - right now 50% AP is converted into tower damage. Making that number item dependant (i.e. it would start at 40%, but could go up to 70% if build for) would be interesting and would introduce new element that AP item system lacks.\r\n\r\n* new iteration of mejai&#039;s\r\n  - Mejai&#039;s is cool in that it&#039;s snowball passive is something that AP system has but AD system doesn&#039;t (anymore). It has, however, absurd abuse cases on super-safe champions like Janna, Soraka and Lux - what leads to it being nerfed until it&#039;s only viable on those, and barely at that. I think that it could be made into cool, viable item if those cases were gated I.e. stacks could be only granted if you were close to dying enemy (partial gating from super-safe champions) and stacks increase your damage (as oposed to AP, completely gating from Janna and Soraka).","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-09-06T21:43:51.027+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":3,"body":"I wonder if there's room to remove \"the\" mana item from a mages build. \n\nLike, what if instead of having to start {{item:3165}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3070}} ({{item:3174}} in years past) to get a large pool of mana/mana regen, then moving on to your core stuff, most of the AP items gave a little bit of mana but not a ton. \n\nRight now the prevailing strategy is \"buy your way out of your mana problems, then never think about them again.\" Shouldn't choosing to sacrifice a mana item give you *some* advantage over the person who went a mana item first?

The problem is Riot didn't introduce or actually work on AP itemization and, if I remember from the tank update, they raised MR and health on tank items.

They have hardly anything in their arsenal to deal with tank champions now and the amount of damage and survivability ADC have now. I mean really look at ADC and Tank itemization and see how different their itemization is. Tanks and ADC all have items with tons more useful actives, mechanics that save them from death so they can stay alive long enough to kill enemies, and decisions to pick the right item for specific uses. AP champions have a belt that lunges they forward and shoots out missiles. AP champions have a freeze gun that shoots out ice spikes. GREAT JOB THERE.\n\nWhat Riot needs to do is:\n\n1) GIve magic pen more options like ADC have. I mean if AP champions had more decision making in their items it would make them more interesting to play and feel great.\n2) More unique actives that aren't a belt shooting out rockets and a freeze gun shooting out icicles. I also think Liandrys Torment should get an actual active that does more damage to health stacking champions.\n3) Lower the cost of Rabbadons, increase the amount of AP on it, or add some new mechanic to it. Seriously. Rabbadons costs too much for the price of not really providing anything.\n4) More MR/Armor items that have AP attached to it. Look at ADC who have more than 3 items with armor/MR attached to it with attack damage. I mean they even get a dumb cleanse item that protects them from CC. What do mages get? A belt that lunges them forward and shoots missiles out. An ice gun that shoots icicles out. Enough said.\n5) Bruiser AP champions need more options and a ton of work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2017-09-07T04:48:12.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dont stop Niisan,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A1NoBdtZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-09-06T20:37:19.236+0000)\n>\n> \n> * Empowered recall item\n>   - mages are the only class that needs to recall lategame, that&amp;#039;s a fact (a bit streched, but still).

AP ratios are how Riot is able to specifically tune each mage's damage from items based on how much base damage they are able to deal.
