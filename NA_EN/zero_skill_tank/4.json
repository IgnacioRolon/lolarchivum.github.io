So these are my personal opinions, hopefully I can shed a little insight into my logic when giving feedback though. \n\nSo I'll talk through the logic, or at least the logic that I gave from a Playtest perspective. \n\nWhen you hit Zed's Q by any number, but lets use the 10%, you effectively hit multiple areas of the champion. Zed uses his Q for farming, wave clearing, harassing, and all ins. All of this would be reduced by 10%. Since this ability is so core to the champion, any change will affect him very heavily. \n\nNow you may say that Zed deserves to be hit heavily and can use some time in the gutter, but I think a lot of people would prefer to see the champion still be viable if he isn't so frustrating to play against. Especially when you consider that his winrate isn't even that high, it's simply his bantrate that is the problem. This is very subjective though so I can see why people feel he deserves to be weak for a while. \n\nSo this is where the change to multiple qs comes in. We are giving Zed players that can execute well some room to still succeed on the champion during all ins, while keeping nerfs on his early wave clear and poke. \n\nIt can be easy to dismiss a nerf when the number may seem small to you, but when it affects so much in a kit I would expect it to have a pretty decent impact. Also, I personally don't see -10% as a small number.\n\n~~I'd be happy to stay around and chat if there is anything people would like to discuss.~~ Think I'm gonna head out and be done for the day.

I'd be perfectly happy for Zed to remain viable, but I would like for him to spend some time as not a top-tier champion. He's been top-tier for a very long time with only short interludes where he's only average or slightly above-average. That's annoying. It definitely feels like there is an effort to keep Zed above the average level of champion power, there is a reluctance to implement changes that might make him average, and he gets very quick attention in the rare instance where he does end up viable but below-average.\n\nMost importantly, this is NOT true for most other champions. There is a high willingness to leave other champions that get hard hard in the dirt for a long, long time even if they don't have design problems, but Zed doesn't have to deal with that. It is favoritism. There may be good justifications for that favoritism (he is popular and it has been suggested in the past that he is the healthiest assassin, which I tend to agree with), but that doesn't make it any less aggravating.\n\nI'm not suggesting that you should want to make Zed bad, or that any other balance changes should be done right now, but I do want to make it clear that a significant portion of the annoyance with Zed isn't his interactions with other champions, but instead is his favorable spot with the developers.

Ekko has some utility and Zed has historically been a split push threat, but other than that most assassins don't really have much to do if they can't kill.

They do it more often than most classes, but most have some other options than having to all-in a lane opponent. Zed, Katarina, Diana and Ekko all have some form of ranged farming and waveclear that they can use to farm with some safety, or push and leave so they can go make ganks happen instead of fighting a stronger lane opponent. While they can all-in their opponents, playing safely is not out of the question for them. Zed is a slight outlier in the degree of safety he has, but the presence of safety is not abnormal.\n\n>what else is an assassin going to do but either 100-0 someone or fail to do so?\n\nIn lane, they will push and leave the lane to gank somebody else. They don't need to take someone in a straight 1v1 fight if they use their high mobility to make things happen on the map. They still can farm, and they get to try to influence the map and catch up with kills on other champions. That is a fallback pattern. It isn't as robust as the fallback patterns of other classes, but that's just inherent to assassins. Zed is no diffferent, and his safe farming fallback is mitigated by a lack of late-game scaling to farm into and a lack of strong gank mechanics like high reliability or a strong initiation CC. When you take those into account, his fallback pattern isn't really out of line with the assassin class.\n\n>assassins don't have a great fall back pattern as far as I can see\n\nIt's better than having no fallback pattern, and having to rely on not losing to your lane opponent or becoming unable to farm. That's a problem that Akali (and to a lesser degree Talon) fall into, and it's a key factor in Akali being one of the worst designed assassins in the game. She has to be given extremely high reliability abilities to make up for her having no means to come back when she gets behind. Having some kind of fallback, weak as it is, helps to prevent more assassins from being like her and Talon.\n\nZed annoys me because of his insane popularity, but those two annoy me because their design necessitates that when they get ahead, you have very few options for dealing with them, which is incredibly frustrating to play against. Zed isn't as bad to play against as them. Anything that prevents the rest of the class from being like them is beneficial in my eyes, and that's why I like Riot's policy of allowing assassins some form of safety so they don't have to be incredibly binary.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2016-05-23T02:54:08.009+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Has the balance team ever considered reverting him to his more fair and less safe state he was in when he was first released? \n\nHis R had a shorter untargetability frame, and brought his shadow behind his target instead of behind himself, and he appears in front of them instead of behind them.

You could change the functionality of how his Q falls off but it will make it rather confusing and unclean for players. Hopefully this made some sense.\n\nThat honestly seems OK, though. Since his ult doesn't put a shadow directly behind his target anymore, landing a triple Q isn't that common of an occurrence, and giving him silly damage on it would probably be alright.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arthimetes","date":"2016-05-23T01:03:33.757+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem isn't truly about his winrate, more-so the fact that on 90% of champions it's completely unfun and borderline infuriating to lane against him, I think you need to hit his E like you did his Q, less damage on the ability and more damage on multi-hit and tbh the Q change is a buff to zed almost 100% of the time past silver ELO.\n\nI'd say hit the E as well the same way you did the Q, have his ult's damage go higher based on how many multi-hits he got while it was active but lower the base amount, and hit the q a liiiiitle harder then he wont be toxic and unfun to play against for most the champion pool, while still rewarding the skilled zeds.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2016-05-23T01:20:15.861+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would agree that there is frustration in his laning phase. A lot of this nerf and previous nerfs have been around hitting his laning while still allowing him to do Zed things(kill people when he presses R).

As a support, it is my job to keep my teammates alive (and in several cases, engage as well). When I'm playing against a Zed (and other assassins like Talon, but that's another champion so let's keep this on point), I struggle to peel these assassins. They either have so many mobility tools that my peel seems effectively useless, or they blow up the ADC before I get a chance to react.\n\nI agree that his laning phase is strong - it's too strong, and it always has been. I appreciate the changes to his Q. If he wants to hit you for meaningful damage now, he'll have to hit you with multiple Qs, which means he'll be in range more often to receive return harass, which puts him in more danger.\n\nHowever, that's not why Zed has recieved near permaban status - it's because Zed has always been balanced around QSS and Zhonya's existing and nullifying his ult (which is somewhat of a false premise anyways, because Zed would buy enough CDR to be able to ult twice in the timing of one of either). Now, with the QSS changes, Zed feels much more unfair to play against. I can rarely do anything about Zed deleting my ADCs aside from using all my shield granting actives and pray that's enough, and they can't do anything about it either. I get that positioning is supposed to be key, but when champions like Zed have a gap closer that is longer than the basic attack range of most of the ADCs, that's not possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2016-05-23T01:42:00.939+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Totally feel ya here. These changes are also supposed to make him weaker if he max range Ws and then ults because it will be near impossible to get a 2 shuriken hit. It may not be enough but hopefully it allows a little more room for adcs.\n\n**Opinion Zone!!!**\nI'd also just like to mention something that I struggle with a lot. Assassins are frustrating, they are mobile, they kill my important teammates and they can make me feel very helpless. I think this is a part of the game, and if it was removed it would make the game worse. Finally catching the god damn Fizz after he has been hoping all over the map is incredibly rewarding and feels great.
