Really great to hear your feedback! For whatever reason your comment wasn't showing up for the normal page view and I didn't see it until now when I checked updates. (I was just furiously refreshing the page every few minutes to see if there were any new posts.) Sorry about not responding sooner!\nBasically, my point was to make a somewhat funny post about how we do have more than just one AP/armor item and that the original poster was forgetting a few. Zeke's Harbinger is a AP/Armor full item on Summoner's Rift, and at first I was going to mention just that but add a qualifier: it doesn't work for most middle lane, top lane, or jungle mages except in the most extreme of circumstances (like where the mage down on his/her luck, the Marksman is doing amazing, and the support has other priorities than Zeke's Harbinger.) Then, I realized that I could make a joke about how Twisted Treeline was a better environment for mages by stating its two now map-exclusive AP/armor items. Now I know that BigBadBadger was talking about Summoner's Rift and he wouldn't have mentioned those items, especially because one even functioned much like a Hourglass! But I said, \"eh,\" and told myself that I had to make the joke and educate people at the same time that there are technically more AP/armor items, even though they're irrelevant in a situation where Zhonya's Hourglass was mentioned. Finally, BigBadBadger obviously knows about Seeker's Armguard. I was still feeling in a happy mood (thinking about the subtle Twisted Treeline master race joke I'd make), and thought, \"why not, I already listed all the other AP/armor items,\" and so I put it down.\nSo basically, one semi-serious thing, and three jokes made on the false premise that BigBadBadger was talking about all of the AP/armor items instead of only the ones for middle lane, top lane, and jungle mages.\nI thought that the word \"Technically\" in italics established the semi-joking tone I had, but it apparently failed quite badly. I feel like it might have even gone better without the word, since it might have seemed confrontational.\n\nMoonflair Spellblade is such a good item, and I'd love to be able to use it more. However, it's not the most balanced item, and certain mages would work really nicely with it, like Lissandra and Galio, and would offset the balance of the game a decent bit as Riot tried to nerf the mages who were too strong with it and maybe give some buffs to those who didn't work with it or buff more AD assassins to account for just how much harder it will be to assassinate a mage with Moonflair Spellblade and Zhonya's Hourglass. (That's one reason why assassins aren't so prevalent on Twisted Treeline, even though the ability to assassinate one target is even more important there.) It would also reintroduce tenacity back into Summoner's Rift, and Riot wants that out as much as possible.\nI think it's kept in Twisted Treeline because the slot left open by the fusion of Rabadon's Deathcap and Zhonya's Hourglass leaves a big hole in many mages' builds, and Moonflair Spellblade is a convienient item that everyone can use.\n\nI really need to get to bed, but I'd love it if we can keep this discussion going. I know I didn't respond to your point about more items from Seeker's Armguard, and I want to address that.\nThank you for your comment! Much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2016-02-11T22:30:52.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did look up Moonflair Spellblade, and all of the stats seem pretty good, but the tenacity part might be too much if on CC mages, I'll agree there, but some fine tuning can certainly make it balanced.\n\nMoonflair just seems like a _very_ defensive item, which we need more of if we fall behind in lane, or need something in case the other team has an equal share of AD and AP, somewhat of a 4th or 3rd item, depending on how the game goes. Zz'Rot and Guardian Angel offer the same amount of armor and magic resist, but I wouldn't dare buy Zz'Rot on Annie, I'd lose out on offensive capabilities, not to mention Zz'Rot is a niche item for high health tanks if they want to split push but also be with the team (the voidlings deal more damage based on your health).\n\nYeah, I'm not too sure about the tenacity vendetta either, when the champion pool (and most of the champions played nowadays) all have slows or something that would be nice to build tenacity against. Probably because it made balancing of certain characters harder if they had to put into account that there might be some tenacity thrown into their build with some items (Zephyr and Mercury Treads).\n\nImagine having Moonflair, Zephyr, and Mercury Treads on Irelia. She would get an exponential amount of tenacity (items and passive), and practically ignore any CC applied to her. Now, that would make her really dominant because she can never be slowed, stunned, or rooted, and those are the three main CC abilities that make ganks and kills the most reliable.\n\nAnd if there was an ungankable champion being dominant thanks to items making other champions' lives easier in other lanes, then everyone would be unhappy that one champion has to ruin the fun for everyone else.\n\nLissandra with tenacity? Imagine her with a Rylais. Good luck getting away from her.\n\nI think the main problem is that there are items that give AP and health, but there are _very_ minuscule amounts of items that give AP and defenses like armor and magic resist, which we need more of.\n\nAbyssal gives AP and MR, Zeke's gives small amount of AP and armor, Zhonya's gives AP and armor, Athenes gives AP and magic resist, Banner of Command gives AP and magic resist... and thats about it. Half of those are niche items. There aren't many defensive items that give resistances without sacrificing offensive stats.\n\nA lot of times, especially with how snowbally the game has become, I feel the need to be grabbing more and more defensive items early in order to survive and wait it out until me and the rest of my team can do something.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-02-12T21:47:58.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot about Irelia; Moonflair Spellblade would work so well on her because it would give her higher defenses, more damage on her Equilibrium Strike and Transcendent Blades, and of course tenacity. I think the reason why Riot doesn't want tenacity is because it makes abilities feel wrong. It feels better to gank someone with a Quicksilver Sash than it feels to gank someone with tenacity, because A. you forget about the tenacity when you gank and the Irelia escapes before you pull off your full combo on her and B. it felt like Irelia had to do nothing, because tenacity is passive. If Quicksilver Sash goes off, at least you knew that you made the person feel threatened enough to blow Quicksilver. It also introduces a skill aspect; with Quicksilver Sash/Mercurial Scimitar, you are in control of your life, rather than your stats being in control. \nBasically, cleanses are more rewarding for the would-be victim and are more tangible to the attacker than tenacity.\n\nI agree, Moonflair Spellblade definitely could be balanced, but it would take some ironing out, and I'm not sure if we need another variable thrown into the already somewhat unstable balance that we have. It's not the case that _all_ of our AD (and AP) assassins are doing so well and that all of our mages are doing so poorly that we need to give them Moonflair Spellblade. If we did, I think the phrase \"League of Assassins\" may change to \"League of Mages\". Assassins are definitely having a hell of a time on the Rift right now, but considering a good deal of them are middle laners, adding a strong hybrid defensive/offensive item for mages would hurt them all pretty badly, more than I think is necessary. (I think they do need some slight tuning down though.) It'd also make certain top lane mages absolutely horrendous. I've read complaints on the boards about how Lulu/Swain/Lissandra top are \"literally cancer\" to lane against as a melee, and adding this would only exacerbate the problem. As the game progresses, most melees often get strong gap closers, damage, and/or tankiness that allow them to kill the mages when they manage to get to them (often by locking them down with crowd control), but if the mage has built Rod of Ages/Rylai's Crystal Scepter/Liandry's Torment (which are typical on the short-ranged bruiser mages sent top lane) and a Moonflair Spellblade, the mage is going to be quite tanky, slippery, and hell to get to if he or she has a Scepter.\n\nThis brings me to your point of having too many AP items with health. I think it's okay for AP items to have health on them; if they didn't, our short-ranged mages would be in a really poor place. I do think that we need more items with resistances too. I think the problem is that we need to make more of those items without encouraging the short-ranged mages to partake in those items along with their health items, and becoming too tanky while dealing decent damage and providing good utility.\n\nI'm confused about your point on \"There aren't many defensive items that give resistances without sacrificing offensive stats.\" Shouldn't that be the case, that adding defensive stats sacrifices offensive stats on an item?\n\nThe game is pretty snowbally right now, and it's definitely right of you to build defensively if you feel threatened by your lane opponent/enemy jungler, but I wouldn't build defensively if I felt confident in my matchup.\nI realize that assassins are often the champions that cause most players to feel threatened (in middle lane), but I think that's their nature. Most are lane bullies, just like Darius and Riven are top lane. They don't have as quite a big teamfight presence later game as most other mages do if unfed, and building defensively is the right way to go in most situations. I'd do that in any meta if I felt threatened though, not just a snowball one.\n\nAlso, your previous point about more items from Seeker's Armguard. It would definitely be really cool and I think that Riot could make some nice variety in the AP item tree for mages going up against AD champions, but as long as there were options with clear tradeoffs and mages weren't encouraged to take all the AP/armor items. If the mage is taking multiple AP/armor items to increase survivability, the mage should be making a clear tradeoff in other stats and playstyle. (Like players wanting a quick path to 40% CDR by taking Morellonomicon and Athene's Unholy Grail.) The mage should also be harder to kill, but not unkillable. That's one of my problems with making an AP version of Quicksilver Sash - mages with that and Zhonya's Hourglass would be _insane_. People are already complaining about champions like Fizz being unkillable with just Zhonya's Hourglass and cooldown reduction.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatWood5Guy","date":"2016-02-12T22:33:25.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeszarck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tN6b7nuJ,comment-id=00050003000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-12T21:47:58.625+0000)\n>\n> That's one of my problems with making an AP version of Quicksilver Sash - mages with that and Zhonya's Hourglass would be _insane_.

Why should ad be the only ones to benefit? Currently, zed can stack DoD, Maw and ghostblade and arpen runes and zip through my zhonyas paltry 50(maybe 65 if you had the time to farm) armor. It would do me much better to be able to QSS after zed blinks away, thinking he has a kill when I can remove duskblade AND death mark with one active.

I think it's a nice buy for mages if the situation requires it; you can just sell it later in the game when full build requires you to. I think it'd be like old Haunting Guise in that regard, except that this is an item against specific teamcomps to be built in the mid game instead of an early game rush item. If the enemy has no AP, I wouldn't advise it though; probably best to go Zhonya's Hourglass and Randuin's Omen (later on) as defensive items.\nI agree that many AD champions get a lot of penetration in their regular builds and that defenses aren't that good against them. I think that while they may have a bit too much flat penetration in their builds right now, they definitely need to have items that give flat penetration. They do need to be good at killing squishy champions, and flat penetration is good for that. Riot could probably tweak the numbers on armor penetration or make some of the penetration items unsavory to buy together unless the champion wanted to achieve a very specific end.\nAlso, if the Zed realizes that you've built a Quicksilver Sash, then he'd remain to kill you and blink out afterwards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2016-02-13T02:35:22.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I meant with the defensive items with resistances while sacrificing offensive stats was that getting a Zhonyas or Rylais gives you resistances, but also gives you power, so you're getting the best of both.\n\nIf you want resistances, or both armor and magic resist, then you have to grab the heavy tank items which only gives health and armor/magic resist, and no AP or anything for mages.\n\nIf you buy a Banshee's Veil, or QSS, then you're getting resistances for a CC AP lane opponent, but what about the AD opponents? In order to get any resistances for them, you need to grab RoA to become beefier against their burst, but without armor, it doesn't do anything against a Talon or Zed because in order to truly mitigate the damage. You need armor.\n\nWhile AD champions can buy a Maw of Malmortius or Mercurial Scimitar for magic resist, and still get a good amount of AD.\n\nI mean, you could pick up a Frozen Heart to give yourself armor and mana, but again, you're sacrificing gold and an item slot for a defensive item that could've given you a bit of AP in the process.\n\nThe tenacity point you made, very true. Stat checks have been something that Riot said they want to move away from, because stat checks aren't something that can be gauged by skill, but just by being confident in the fact you have enough stats from items to fight your opponent. \n\nTenacity is no exception, because that is something that you don't realize until you look at their items. Then it becomes apparent why they only stayed stun for like 1 second when your stun value is actually 3 seconds.\n\nI do agree, they need an AP QSS item, because AD champs have way too much in item defense in terms of magic resistance, I don't think they have a ton of armor items, but the AD magic resist items might be a bit too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-02-13T04:14:35.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I understand your point now. Mages only have Zhonya's Hourglass for armor if they want to keep their ability power at acceptable levels for the early and middle game, whereas AD champions get both Maw of Malmortius and Mercurial Scimitar if they feel threatened by their AP lane opponent, and can also get enough armor penetration in their normal builds to basically negate the bonus armor from Zhonya's Hourglass, while mages' penetration items are situational with the exception of Sorcerer's Shoes, which doesn't give much penetration, and Void Staff, which is built to counter magic resist and slows down most builds.\n\nI'm not sure if mages need more penetration, but I think that some penetration could be removed out of AD users' builds. I'm not sure how much, but I think that if an AD user is trying to get a lot of penetration, then the AD user should pierce through a singular armor item (Zhonya's Hourglass), but if the AD user is not focusing on penetration, then armor should mitigate some of the AD user's damage.   Because penetration comes free with assassin builds, they don't need to focus on penetration because they're automatically getting it in their builds. I think this is what Riot is trying to fix with assassin itemization. Once they get some items that don't give assassins free penetration but still synergize very well with assassins, assassins will need to make meaningful choices on whether they want penetration or the assassin items.\n\nAlso, giving mages more armor options to deal with AD will hurt AD casters and might force them out of the middle lane meta, which I don't think is a good thing - I think they help make middle lane interesting. (Talking about champions like Varus, Jayce, Quinn, and Ezreal.) Because they often suffer the same problems that mages do against assassins but don't get any armor in their early core builds, they'll struggle even more against an AD assassin that is winning. They can get a Quicksilver Sash and not have to sell it because they can upgrade it, but I'm not sure if that's a balanced tradeoff.\n\nIf Riot made an AP Quicksilver Sash upgrade, it would need to be made an unsavory combination with Zhonya's Hourglass because of the power of both actives in combination. Quicksilver Sash and Zhonya's Hourglass is fine in my opinion because Quicksilver Sash has extremely clear tradeoffs (barely any combat stats compared to every other finished item), but I can't think of any way to make it a poor tradeoff with Zhonya's Hourglass since both would be strong AP items that give different resistances and amazing actives. Like, marksmen can build Zhonya's Hourglass in some situations and profit because they really need the active and Mercurial Scimitar isn't the right item for the job. However, a marksman would rarely opt for both because there are a ton of other really inviting item choices to make. If, however, Zhonya's Hourglass was given an AD equivalent, marksmen would have much more reason to buy the item, and more reason to chain it together with Mercurial Scimitar to become ridiculously slippery. I think that if we made a AP Quicksilver Sash upgrade, then the item would need to be made **extremely carefully** so to not make coupling it with Zhonya's Hourglass an attractive build path. Either that, or make other mage items feel really impactful and unique so that mages will want to build those too.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hex the FenFen","date":"2016-02-10T15:31:48.913+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Especially since the new assassin item is cheaper than Zhonyas, how can mages be expected to rush it while being heavily oppressed in lane?

That's why the class always had a set of powerful dual items like {{item:3027}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3174}}, old {{item:3170}} , so that fed opponent didn't turn them useless immediately.\n\n\nBut changes to itemization practically removed every armor option, leaving mages with really bad iteration of Zhonya in days when physical damage is as popular as it never was. If you look at mid winrates, you will see how it is dominated by AD champions, or mages with powerful defensive abilities, be it targetable stun or very strong shield or for of invulnerability - simply because armor itemization is nonexistant.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohob","date":"2016-02-10T18:19:13.746+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"you'd think AP/armor items would be going up an up over the years, consiering how AD mid has grown. there was once a time when AD mids weren't a thing, when zed and yasuo didn't exist and playing urgot mid just got you reported by 9 people, so your **only** option for an AD mid was {{champion:91}}, and nobody played him because _an AD mid? that sounds **awful**!_\n\nand yet, since those days, AP/armor has gone nowhere but down. maybe they were just trying to prevent {{champion:8}} from becoming truly unkillable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BroLane","date":"2016-02-13T04:21:46.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tohob,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tN6b7nuJ,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-02-10T15:58:06.295+0000)\n>\n> if you want armor as an AD champ, you get.. {{item:3025}} .. {{item:3742}} ? they're good but neither of them actually give damage. there's no such thing as an item that gives both AD and armor.\n\nNeither give DIRECT AD.
