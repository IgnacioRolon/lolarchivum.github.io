Recently I read about how ranked team names are locked after a couple games and even went to support to ask and got it confirmed. I think teams that have been inactive should become available, much like how inactive summoner names become available after a period of time. I'm bringing this up because there is really no use to inactive ranked teams, and maybe they have awesome names that active summoner wants to use. I know this may not be a big idea but I really think it should be taken into consideration.\n\nId appreciate some help for this to get changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T21:03:33.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you may be onto something here, and I think that's a pretty good idea.
