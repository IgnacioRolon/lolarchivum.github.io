It is these champions that make the game extremely unfun to play compared to the average champion. With riot releasing and reworking more and more of these overloaded champions (though the bulk of them are CT creations, lol) that force extremely unfun playstyles, compared to the average champion, the need to ban them out increases, since riot refuses to balance some of them.  \n\nOP isn't in the wrong to state his opinion of wanting more bans because the amount of \"fizz/leblanc/yasuo- type champions\" have increased.\n\nRiot tries to nerf hammer these champions into the ground (Hi, kalista, azir, Zoe) but sometimes they show blatant favouritism and keep unhealthy champions in a strong state, and as time goes on the number of unhealthy champions in a strong state is being increased. It's only fair to want more bans to not have to play against them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-12-07T05:05:55.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Correction: the most hated champions are not CT champions.

I'm not saying morde is the sole reason Irelia is able to be killed. I used Morde as an example, an analogy so to speak. However, even in a 1v1, it is extremely possible for morde to win a 1v1. It is true, irelia has 335 movement speed, while morde has 325, but mordekaiser usually gets rylais to compensate for his lack of mobility, as well as gunblade for the burst/slow/heal. Irelia has a larger attack range than most melees, yes, but as morde has a shield for using skills (as that is how all fights are usually determined), irelia has to burst him down before he juggles his shields, as if he does, he wins the duel.... meaning she has to go in with her e-q-q...meaning she has 0 forms of disengage if she chooses to fight. Morde suffers in a passive matchup, yes, but in a raw 1v1 duel, morde has the upper hand.\n\nI digress however. \"she has more movement speed than morde... and well anyone below her MS...\"\n...Dude. That's common knowledge. Thats like saying kench is an undefeatable duelist because he has 200 AA range and has 335 movement speed, like irelia, thus allowing him to kite with his harsh slows and autos. However, he has 0 way to disengage, but has sustainability in exchange for it. Similarly, Irelia is in the same pot. She has mobility, but she doesn't have much sustain, in which she makes up for by burst. However, if she fails to burst/trade ( which happens, believe it or not), she gets punished severely for it, as she makes the walk of shame back while taking agro from the enemy.\n\nBut fine, lets say its an unfavorable matchup, and you tend to lose a 1v1 against irelia, like irelia vs zed. Zed is in a good spot, and isn't out of meta, yet in a 1v1, zed will usually lose. But according to your logic, zed should win, as he has alot more movement speed (10 to be precise). \n\nOk, but thats just one champion right? Well how about urgot? He has 5 less movement speed than irelia, but many of us know in a 1v1, irelia would lose drastically. Why? Because Irelia is a bursty bruiser, while urgot is a bursty dps frontliner ( not necessarily bruiser), who excels in disruption.\n\nWell, lets say by some miracle, the champs have equil movement speed and dueling potential.

Irelia wins 10/10 times because she has a better kit.

That&#x27;s common knowledge. Thats like saying kench is an undefeatable duelist because he has 200 AA range and has 335 movement speed, like irelia, thus allowing him to kite with his harsh slows and autos. However, he has 0 way to disengage,\n\nSo you've literally never seen a tham kite with his consume/toung lash? And then disengage after a toung lash slow or even stun. He has good disengage unless the enemy is you know irelia, a ranged melee champion. \n\n> But fine, lets say its an unfavorable matchup, and you tend to lose a 1v1 against irelia, like irelia vs zed. Zed is in a good spot, and isn&#x27;t out of meta, yet in a 1v1, zed will usually lose. But according to your logic, zed should win, as he has alot more movement speed (10 to be precise). \n\nIts all about those burst per seconds.

Only recently was this whole burst morde a thing. I know this because I've mained him since season 1. Initially he built much like a bruiser 3-4 tank items... \n\nIrelia literally has to be a retard to lose to morde, because she can kite and nuke him.","replies":[{"poster":"dontspinbutwin","date":"2018-12-08T07:26:35.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"....so we doin this. hoo boy.\n\nYou chopped up my argument, and took the pieces that fit with your argument completely to counter my argument. You have to view it in its entirety.\n\nA. For one, like i mentioned, morde gets completely crapped in laning phase (\"He loses passively, but wins duels\"). Its extremely similar to Darius vs nasus. Darius harshly wins that lane, but give nasus a few stacks and armor, and nasus can take on Darius. This usually occurs 35 mins into the game, after laning phase. Morde loses lane to irelia, bc Irelia has harsher zone. However, give them both items, and Morde holds his own against irelia, and can even push her back. Most Morde mains complain against irelia matchups because laning phase sucks, and seeing how most games are short, thats the majority of the game for them. It isn't fun, so they complain.... just like how laners who fight pantheon complain.\n\nB. I've played kench top, pre nerfs, pre buffs, post buffs, post nerfs, so on. I know his strengths, and I know his weaknesses. He has passive sustain, but not dueling sustain, so his best strat is to poke them down then go in with a burst combo. I wouldn't really count his q as a solid disengage: while his q does give a hefty slow, it stops at the first target hit, and roots him. since duels in lane usually occur around minions, he can't freely waddle out, so he has to take a few hits, and if they chase him, then he can q, and get a bit of distance, then passive heal off his e and dorans shield (if he has it). Even if he slows, there are matchups where he still dies, like Darius, who has 2 slows (e and w) and a pull (e), or garen (insane tenacity if procced correct, and his spin still damages if he's eaten), jax (q and e, usually used seperatly in lane when fighting tahm), so on so forth.\n\nC. In a sheer 1v1, I do agree that zed loses against morde. It's why zed never does try for that 1v1, he instead pokes down morde from a distance to ensure morde cant get shield procs with his skills, then goes in for the kill. Urgot has scaling damage/burst, so in all stages of the game, urgot can win against morde.  I'll assume you mean zed's range is short by his auto range, but zed never autos someone to death. He combos them, or ult combos them, then uses his passive proc to chunk em hard. Zed=/=yi.\n\nD.You are correct, I think ornn's movement speed is at a fine spot. However, like i stated, he isn't mobile. His dash is long, yes, but like I stated, there is a delay if he hits nothing, causing him to just sit there for a short delay, which is all it takes for the enemy to catch up. Granted, Ornn usually follows this up with his Q slow, so that's how he escapes, but just because a champion escapes doesn't mean they have mobility. I've seen many elise players escape a near death experience. Do they have mobility? Heck no. They just stun, spider form, then crawl away. It should also be noted I brang up Ornn as an example to how Irelia can't kite due to cc in champion kits, yet you're here trying to discuss how I'm incorrect, which is ad hominem, or even attacking the person fallacy/ies. So thus, I will correct, and move on.\n\nE. The nasus thing. You dismissed the entire nasus argument because I used the word tank, rather than bruiser. I believe that's straw man fallacy. Even if you disagree with the nasus being a tank thing, that takes 0 away from the argument.\n\nF. You are correct, irelia wins in a 1v1 against zed. _that was the point of my argument_. I wanted to say that movement speed means very little in a 1v1 where theres high mobility. My argument was pointed out and justified yourself, so thus I need not say more here.\n\nG. Actually, many don't like irelia because, like i've said, they don't like thinking more or differently when fighting her. It should also be noted that 70+% of players are gold and below, and it's usually those players who complain. Skill level and learning curves do exist, and with that, frustration. It's why champs like Yi can faceroll in lower elos (causing said players to complain), yet be considered a trollpick in higher elo.\n\nH. I do like this argument, its a solid one. Irelia has alot, which is why she's frustrating. However, a few things.\nHer heal comes from her Q, so thus, in a 1v1 ( which is what many players complain about), she doesn't have much sustain.\nShe has mobility, yet I once again repeat, with minions in presence. Treat her like yasuo, and her mobility disappears. \nirelia has a nice bit of a stun and a slow, I agree. However, I have yet to see irelia use the ult as a disengage, but rather to catch enemies out. Her e is a nice stun, yes, but if she chooses to use it, she has no forms of disengage. If she wants to burst the enemy down, she sacrifices mobility and cc, making it a fair trade. She gets much, loses a lot as well.\nI repeat, once again, she usually uses damage reduct when shes caught out. She never uses it to engage. If she uses it, that means she ran out of dashes or tricks, so then while she has damage reduct, she also lets the enemy know where she is and that she is in a bad spot, allowing for harsh retaliation.\n\nI. You make a fair point with morde. However, like mentioned earlier, she has to sacrifice mobility and cc/disengage if she wants to burst him down. If she's successful, she gets rewarded. If she fails, morde can lock her down and severely punish her.\n\nLast but not least...\n\nJ. _This isn't an irelia hate thread._ This is a thread discussing the frustration of fighting certain champs, and irelia just happened to pop out because she's frustrating. The entire argument that was made, and my retaliations, contribute literally nothing. I simply wanted to tell peeps to learn how to fight other champs, but you took it and molded it into an irelia hate club.

Most Morde mains complain against irelia matchups because laning phase sucks, and seeing how most games are short, thats the majority of the game for them. It isn&#x27;t fun, so they complain.... just like how laners who fight pantheon complain.\n\nHold on there... Morde's highest winrate is before the 25 minute mark. Do you even know how the champ works? He wins lane phase really hard against most champions, and has a relatively weak late game unless his team secures dragons... I can tell you as a fact I won 100% of lane phases until season 8 when they fucked him hard with runes and masteries. \n\nThe reason why Morde mains complain about playing against irelia is because he wins at no points in the game against her unless she is bad. Again, he is designed to win lane phase, and close out the game pre 30 minutes. \n\n> B. I wouldn&#x27;t really count his ...\n\nMatchup dependency doesn't mean that he doesn't have any disengage. You know who actually has less disengage? Morde. He needs a fucking teammate to disengage. Having to burst through Thams big ass Shield also makes for a pretty convincing argument if you do waddle just far enough away. \n \n> C. In a sheer 1v1, I do agree that zed loses against morde. It&#x27;s why zed never does try for that 1v1, he instead pokes down morde from a distance to ensure morde cant get shield procs with his skills, then goes in for the kill.

Zed=/=yi. \n\nLol if you lose to urgod as morde you are doing it wrong. Urgot with his self slow may as well be a melee champion. Morde does outshield urgots damage unless fed. <- fed is not an argument for balance sooo I'll leave it at that. \n\nAs for zed, dodge his Q... and then he is a short range champ... even when he tries to combo you you get to respond. If you pop your W as you see him press R, you can pop it for damage and heal as soon as he lands 99% of the time. Then you get your R, E if you can aim, and 1 Q if you press on him. Even if you are half health since he does damage to your shield and not you his R hits for little damage most games. He is for all intensive purposes short range. \n \n> D.You are correct, I think ornn&#x27;s movement speed is at a fine spot. However, like i stated, he isn&#x27;t mobile. \n\nThe thing about that is sure he might not be highly mobile, but some is still well some. \n\n> E. The nasus thing. You dismissed the entire nasus argument because I used the word tank, rather than bruiser. I believe that&#x27;s straw man fallacy. Even if you disagree with the nasus being a tank thing, that takes 0 away from the argument.\n\nYou can't use an infinite scaling damage champion as an example of a balanced champion. IF he is left alone to stack Q ofc he is going to win trades. If you keep beating the shit out of him all game he isn't going to get anywhere. He shouldn't be used for balance discussions unless the discussion is specifically about him. The same should be said for veigar. The other day I hit 2k ap on viegar and could Q R their tank to dead. Should we be talking about the balance there? No! The enemy team let me stack too many Q's and got punished for it. I could have built off tank and still one shot any of their squishies. \n\nAlso, when you use the term bruiser it means that they have damage, often very high damage. Mostly because riot refuses to balance tank to damage so they have mostly just transitioned everything into burst damage. \n\n> G. Actually, many don&#x27;t like irelia because, like i&#x27;ve said, they don&#x27;t like thinking more or differently when fighting her. It should also be noted that 70+% of players are gold and below, and it&#x27;s usually those players who complain. Skill level and learning curves do exist, and with that, frustration. It&#x27;s why champs like Yi can faceroll in lower elos (causing said players to complain), yet be considered a trollpick in higher elo.\n\nI'd like to put out there that I'm complaining about Ireila from diamond. I am a part of that 1% of the playerbase. \n\nIt isn't about thinking against her. I used to have that argument against Yi. Morde historically loses to yi. Two seasons ago I figured out that if morde purchased Zhonyas and Stereks gauge (sure sounds like a shit build) and the morde would press Zhonyas on Yis alpha-strike which in turn wasted part of Yi's ulti because not only did he lose Q time to get to you, then he would reset to his starting dash location and be forced to walk to you. Then stereks gauge would eat a majority of upfront burst damage that yi could do while his ulti was still going. His ulti and most time's E, because a majority of yi's press E when their Q is cast would wear off, and you could just straight up fight him to death. You could do that because you negated most of his true damage and ate the burst his ulti gave. \n\nYou know how much thought that took to actually pull off? You know how good I got at doing it I was actually wining 9/10 times on morde vs yi, a matchup that morde normally lost because yi kills and lifesteals too fast and hard. \n\nSeason 8 rolled around, and now damage is to the point where I was trying that and wining 0/10 times. \n\nFighting irelia feels that way. She Q dashes to you, gets to stun you. Deals you another Q worth of damage, and then just autos you to death while getting to ignore a big burst of damage. To top that off if she hits her R and you could have left now you just stand there while not being able to fight her unless your champion is better than hers (or she is bad) and can just stand there to 1v1 her. If her movement speed was 325 I really wouldn't have any reason to complain about her. IF she failed her burst she couldn't just walk away like she does now. I'd make a very similar argument for Camille, yasuo, lee sin, akali. \n\n> I. You make a fair point with morde. However, like mentioned earlier, she has to sacrifice mobility and cc/disengage if she wants to burst him down. If she&#x27;s successful, she gets rewarded. If she fails, morde can lock her down and severely punish her.\n\nHow does morde lock her down when she can just walk away with her higher movement speed? IF she builds black cleaver/trinity force or any movement speed damage item even through rylis she can just walk away. \n\n> Last but not least...\n> \n> J. _This isn&#x27;t an irelia hate thread._ This is a thread discussing the frustration of fighting certain champs, and irelia just happened to pop out because she&#x27;s frustrating.

I just went ahead and listed why shes hated. The only reason a lot of these champions get complained about is because they are actually unfair to play against. Alot of the highest complained about champions are ones that have high damage attached to mobility. There is no way to \"Simply learn\" how to play against getting burst 100-0 by someone thats faster and has more damage than you.","replies":[{"poster":"dontspinbutwin","date":"2018-12-08T22:40:12.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my last comment, before I give up trying to properly communicate.\n\nI used morde as an analogy, and i mentioned that twice. You took it to an extreme and used morde as a basis for 1v1s, which wasn't the argument of the fallacy of the fallacy at all. You sidetracked an argument with a fallacy, ignored the correction I gave, then took that fallacy as the \"main point\" to continue your side of the argument.\n\nYou stated zed was an easy matchup because his q was a small skillshot. Irelia's e is a thinner stun than zed's, but unlike zed, theres a delay, and 2 casttimes, while having a shorter castrange. Once again, your own argument contradicts yourself. \n\nThe disengage argument. He is tanky yes. However, most champions don't just auto and then let him go. They use cc to lock them down, or pull them back. Like if Tahm is top, urgot toplane might e tahm, then slow him with q, and since that locks on, w grants urgot the ability to walk over minions, leaving that fight to urgot's advantage, not to mention the jungler that may gank. sheer tankiness isn't disengage. That's like saying illaoi has great disengage due to the fact she can 2v1. That isn't disengage, that's turnaround ability, Don't mix up the 2.\n\nThe nasus argument was created to demonstrate that even an infinitely scaling champion has weaknesses.  To trade the idea of infinite scaling, nasus loses many lanes, gets heavy zoned, heavy kited, so on so forth. He loses alot to have alot. Same with irelia. I won't repeat myself as on why she loses alot to have alot, go back to my former post to see what I said.\n\n\"Fighting irelia feels that way. She Q dashes to you, gets to stun you. Deals you another Q worth of damage, and then just autos you to death while getting to ignore a big burst of damage.\"\n....That...That isn't how irelia works at all. The hell? Her dash's cooldown doesn't get reset when she lands e. her e sets up a charge that allows irelia to dash to that champion and consume the mark rather than have her q on cooldown. Her damage reduction roots her, does minimal damage in compensation, and like i mention for I think the 4th time now, she only uses it if she's caught out. It isn't an alistar ulti, it's a last ditch effort.\n\nMorde locks down irelia after she fails her combo because she has 0 forms of disengage. With a protobelt/gunblade with rylais, morde can stick onto irelia as she either tries to keep autoing or awkwardly walk away. I'm sure I made this clear multiple times, but I'll say it again. Irelia trades burst for mobility and disengage, many players complain about irelia because they die, and don't get to see how irelia survives in a teamfight after she bursts them down, similarly to how rengar does.\n\nLastly, the last point I want to make.\n\nI mentioned Irelia because the person making this post in the first place use irelia as an example. I mentioned irelia because I figured that if i could tell everyone how to counterplay irelia, then they would realise that they could counterplay other frustrating champs, such as Darius, kaisa, yasuo, so on so forth. Taking that and expanding this to an irelia hate thread was not my intention at all, whatsoever. Furthermore, it appears, like many things in my argument, you completely ignored my very last statement saying to actually contribute to the argument, rather than babble on for the sake of being right. To make all my arguments here, I used internet statistics, actual gameplay experience, and have fought/played as irelia. I came here knowing why people are frustrated, and spoke in hopes we as a community adapt to different playstyles. What's worse is, if you truly are diamond, you should already know about this. This is the equivalent of faker complaining how late game nasus is so strong because he can 1 shot you with his Q. This is the equivilent of the time where LCS players were shown footage of kled gameplay, and the LCS players announced kled as a broken busted champion.\n\nStop bandwagoning for the sake to be right.
