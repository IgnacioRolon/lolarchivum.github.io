Common culprits can be malfunctioning graphics drivers or problems inside your operating system. I recommend working through our [Bugslat & Crash guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes), as it goes over the most common fixes for these issues.\n\nLet me know if the guide was able to resolve the problem or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Jasaiyan","date":"2016-08-11T03:03:28.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well It was working perfectly fine yesterday, then I went afk and my laptop went to sleep.
