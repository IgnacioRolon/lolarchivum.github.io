I relentlessly pushed him out of lane, killing him multiple times (although I screwed up and died once) and getting quite fed.\n\nUrgot&#039;s kit allows him essentially a point-and-click slow with massive range. Once he catches up to you, the slow can be reapplied, and with his normal build of {{item:3071}} and {{item:3025}} he both shreds your armor and hits like a truck. A simple {{item:3155}} solidifies him as a durable tank, and that&#039;s not even counting his last 2 item slots.\n\nHe burns your resists, perma-slows you, and shreds your health bar through Q spam. In lane, if you don&#039;t dodge the (decently telegraphed) vial of acid, you&#039;re in for a bad time since you just get zoned off of your own minions from the sheer damage from such a high range that Urgot puts out.\n\nAnd to top it off, his ult makes engaging onto him very hard and allows him to be a strong duelist as well as peel for his backline.\n\nHe&#039;s still pretty fun though, and while he&#039;s unbearably toxic if ahead, he still has his own niche, being the ranged juggernaut.\n\nIf course, he can&#039;t be kited like normal juggernauts, but that&#039;s a whole different story. \n\nWhat would you guys change in Urgot&#039;s kit? How would you make him more interactive? Would you raise his skill ceiling? Maybe change his Q? \n\nOne thing&#039;s for sure, I&#039;m ready to see what Riot can do with him once they give him that beautiful, beautiful new texture update.\n\nEDIT: furgot how huge the Fervor changes were. That's a good chunk of damage onto Qs that you can't just ignore. It's likely better than Thunderlord's now.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-10T01:11:34.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot is like old Yorick in the sense that just like old Yorick's only real counter was Heimer, Urgot's only real counter is Yasuo.
