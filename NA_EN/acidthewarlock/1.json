The other team had a Rengar. He instagibbed everyone, since he started to get fed pretty fast since I can only assume he powerfarmed.\r\n\r\nWe lost a teamfight but I ulted to the other side of the fight where I ended up throwing spells into Karma&#039;s shield and eventually she ran away. I saw Rengar and their Jhin at low health, so I moved to the other side to kill them. I could have finished off Karma and gotten the triple.\r\n\r\nBut I was twitching and shaking really bad. For no reason. Other than the fact that I could in fact win a teamfight.\r\n\r\nAnd I blew it all. That&#039;s pretty much why I suck at League, Smite, Overwatch, you name it I&#039;m bad at it. I can&#039;t survive ganks, can&#039;t teamfight, can&#039;t enable ganks, nothing.\r\n\r\nBecause of this stupid adrenaline rush that just leaves me sitting there like &quot;wtf just happened&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd the funny thing is I play soccer and I deal with it without even thinking. It&#039;s all natural. Only in League does this become a problem.\r\n\r\nCan I get some help????","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-04T02:30:16.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens to me as well, in tense games. just relax, find something to eat beforehand, keep some (preferably cold) water on hand, and do not follow the gamer tradition of getting high as fuck on sugar and caffeine before playing pvp games.\n\nKeep in mind it is just a game, no matter how annoying yasuo is.\n\nAlso try to pay attention to stupid plays people make, for comic relief.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-09-04T02:13:27.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eat before hand.  If you are running on sugar or something adrenaline rushes can get really bad.  Eat something solid before playing.  Nothing that is gonna leave you feeling super energetic or could leave you with an upset stomach.  Pasta is a personal favourite of mine.","replies":[{"poster":"AcidTheWarlock","date":"2016-09-04T02:15:28.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the idea, I normally play in the morning or later at night, so I normally just drink a glass of water before I get into a game.\n\nSounds solid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2016-09-04T02:10:28.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have a shot of whiskey.
