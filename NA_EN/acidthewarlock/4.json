Less punishing health costs means that it&#039;s easier to play from behind and your trades feel better, and while you don&#039;t heal as much you still heal a ton and hit for a lot of damage.\r\n\r\nHowever, the best change is to the Blood Well. No longer can you jump into a fight with your passive full and revive ready. You need to prepare it and know when it will activate, and stay in combat to keep it up. It&#039;s similar to Vlad, only without the better Q. And if you do it right, it lasts a while. The last time I had passive up in my most recent game I kept it up for about 10-12 seconds.\r\n\r\nActually, it&#039;s kind of satisfying.\r\n\r\nI could see some more work on Aatrox during the Diver update, but I think right now he has definite outplay potential as well as appropriate counterplay besides CC/kiting.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-04-14T03:02:05.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like he has more potential, but is harder to play now tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Abandon","date":"2017-04-14T05:57:25.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-15T00:25:03.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It shit and here is why:\n\nIf you ARE behind in lane, that means you are probably being zoned, which means its hard to stack to HellBent which means you are easier to tower dive.

Most champions enjoy passive benefits being passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Slave Knight","date":"2017-04-15T01:15:56.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the old passive for it's flat steroid but I can honestly see what Riot has gone this route. If Hellbent could be enabled whenever the player chose to go in without any prep, Aatrox would honestly have no hard lane match ups. \n\nAs it stands, he has clear advantages over most lane opponents and clear weaknesses in which to abuse him.\nTeemo for example, has just gotten harder but match ups that were before quite steep of a mission to win (renekton, olaf, other hard bruisers) were brought down to a more reasonable level of difficulty.\n\nCurrently, I feel Aatrox may be in the best spot he's ever been though that's not to say his entire kit is fully fleshed out and cannot benefit from being looked over for minor improvements. I still feel the decay is too long but at least for my games, it's manageable.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Grift98","date":"2017-04-15T01:15:46.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Olaf yes you get the benefit when you lose health however it isn't as big a benefit as a revive/ad steroid/as steroid all wrapped into one. Jax yeah you get it base but it doesn't make as big an impact as when aatrox has a full blood well. lee you have to actively work for his passive. Morde you have to work for his passive. Kayle you have to work to reap the benefits but aatrox has a pretty powerful passive in a teamfight/duel so the amount of work needed to attain it is substantially higher.","replies":[]}]}
