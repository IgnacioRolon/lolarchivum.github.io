It has a minimal impact in teamfights especially since Shyvana, as a tank, is supposed to use it as an initiation. In addition, its slow and telegraphed, can also be very easily stopped with any CC mid-flight.\n\nThe fact that Shyvana has no CC anywhere else in her kit, and she&#039;s a tank, means that her ult has to feel pretty impactful. I believe giving her ultimate more powerful and impactful CC would be the right buff for her, since she&#039;s struggling a bit. It also is very thematically fitting.\n\nJust add a QoL buff where enemies are knocked back all the way to the landing location instead of just by an inch, and then _probably_ add a mini stun like 0.75s afterwards.

I know people will argue Udyr is balanced but Katarina mains also argue she is balanced.\n\nUdyr's fall-offs are that if he doesn't build tank he's useless past 20-30 minutes, and he gets kited super hard by anything with a slow or escapes. Like, stupid hard. He has a movement speed buff and that's it, slows destroy him.\n\nLike. How does anyone in their right mind think Udyr is ACTUALLY overpowered? He's not picked all that often, and the only reason he is picked now-aday **also massively benefits Shyvana (cinderhulk)**\n\nShyvana has MORE mobility, MORE damage (%HP damage like crazy, a double-strike autoattack reset, and a speedbuff that for whatever reason does damage), and MORE tankiness than Udyr (seriously, have you ever looked at Shyvana's passive? No?). The only thing she doesn't have, that he does, is lifesteal.\n\nSo, lets not call Udyr OP just because autoattack based champions win in lower elos because apparently people have trouble a super-speed skillshot like Shyvana's E that is super difficult to miss if you point in the right direction. A'it?\n\nMaybe if people would learn to counterpick **_LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO IN THE GAMEMODES THIS GAME IS BALANCED FOR_** you wouldn't complain about things like _Udyr._ Its like none of the newer players know how to do this. The game is built around it, its a MOBA!\n\nSorry to be abrasive like that, but people who say things like that probably shouldn't be talking about balance.

She's an amazing duelist with pretty good damage.\n\nShe does lack CC, but tacking any on will likely make her too strong. What she could do with is making sure her ultimate always works. I know I've jumped through people and not damaged or knocked them back before.\n\nI do admit that her ultimate's initial launch can feel a bit underwhelming, but it is important to remember that it gives her improved defensive steroids and increases the strength of all her other abilities, while also having a pretty low cooldown and a good duration.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"B3ER","date":"2015-04-11T13:11:10.728+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The issue I have with Shyv is that she doesn't do her theme any justice.
