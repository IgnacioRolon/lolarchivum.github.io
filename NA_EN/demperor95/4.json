I say to myself: how often would you find a player who can endure the learning process of this game, which takes an extremely long time, patience, and playing with so many smurfs? This is especially true for people who don't really have friends who can teach them everything quickly.\n\nFrom a personal experience, what I find to be the roughest and most complex aspect to learn for new players is item builds. Sometimes, people reach level 30 without a clue of proper item builds, and that's why reaching level 30 is deceptively just the very first step for these new players who might think otherwise. This is why an extensive and thorough item tutorial for building each class and subclass of champions should be integrated with the game tutorial.\n\nI am pretty confident that an item tutorial would be the most effective implementation to accelerate new player's learning process, and will greatly smoothen the learning curve of this game. In my opinion, it is neccessary, especially given the lack of tutorials in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"EMOFRATPARTY","date":"2014-11-19T19:57:44.041+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love that too, that way my first couple of games in *League* wouldn't look like this:","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2014-11-20T10:00:49.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'd love that too, that way my first couple of games in *League* wouldn't look like this:\n\nBam.

There was no advice that Marksmen don't need Frozen Heart/Warmog's. I learned this game on my own. I had no friends or anyone to teach me it. My Brother-In-Law got me into the game and only taught me a little bit of it. He was higher level than me at first, but he doesn't play it much. He's still level 18, too, even though he knew more than me when I started. He actually knew how to build, I kind of just built whatever.\n\nAlso, I tried getting one of my friends into this. Apparently too complex for him. He didn't even know how to buy or open shop or anything.

Sure, I could mouse over them for more information, but it was a lot to read and absorb in the middle of a match.\n\nEven with a lot of LoL experience to analogize with, I was pretty much just clicking buttons.\n\nNow, it's true, you can then go and read the wiki or whatnot, but that's still quite a lot of information to soak up, and most of it doesn't really make sense until you have some gameplay experience for context. (\"Oh, she's killing tanks really well because she has Last Whisper. That's for penetrating % armor. That's better versus high-armor targets, whereas the flat ArPen is better for low-armor targets.\")\n\nIt's all second nature to us now, but it's important to remember that we're talking about the experience of the very newest players.\n\nWhen I started LoL, I didn't realize that \"weapons\" stacked. \"Wait, why would I buy a sword? She's already got a bow. How do you switch weapons?\"\n\nI've had friends quit LoL in part because they found it really confusing and stressful being asked to make all these item decisions in the middle of a match, while they were already trying to understand the rest of the game.

I mean I saw a Shyvana jungle that had Tears o_o ... And went for mana items. I was like \"WHUT\". When I was playing on my lv 5 smurfie xD.. I think it should be included in tutorial. Or make a possible tutorial for EVERY champion. So people get familiar with skills / items / functions of each champion.

There are just some new items in the shop, and 3 are removed, the nav list is just changed a bit ( Spell Vamp missing WHY RITO! WHY! :P ).{{summoner:11}}  is still smite there is just some extra stuff, at least now u can see how much smite damages and how much HP the golem has without clicking and hovering things.\n\nAnyway, every single item in the shop is new item for newbies. The new jungle items wont be of any use (since they don't have {{summoner:11}} to lvl 9 i think?) and they will figure those are not helping much in lane very soon. \nAlso they are asked to choose 1 of 3 lanes (arrows glowing and everything) so they wont worry for the jungle for a while. \n\nAnd believe me the best tutorial is when the game ends and u stare(as a newbie) in the opsite {{champion:22}} build and try to figure out how did he killed ur {{champion:22}}  1v1 5 times in a row so fast. And that is half the fun in Lol; \"OK im buying this first my next game! My {{champion:86}}  is gonna be indestructible !\" and when ur new build works that's when u feel the success in this game.","replies":[]}]}
