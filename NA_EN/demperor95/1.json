So she can basically melt the class designed for long-ranged kiting by herself. You can't kite someone when they have your range or more.\n\n3) She isn't an instant lane loss, but where's the counter-play in getting melted by an instant aoe stun-combo with tons of damage built into it?

Support annie especially won't be able to ever burst you 100-0. The reason she is picked up in the support role is for her amazing engage. The fact is that support annie does more damage then other supports but significantly less then the carries. Annie doesn't get a lot of free stats and support annie doesn't get much gold.

We all saw the permasnare at level 9 in patch 5.11. Now its not as bad, but without flash you arent running away.\n\nAshe went from 'utility ADC' to 'utility adc with hypercarry damage'.

She's just going to lose her stun stacks if she doesn't use it, then stack it up back quickly with a QWE rotation, since she only needs 4 stacks.

Ryze and Ashe werent weak before, but were given stacking mechanicsms to track - it makes it harder to play, more easily identifiable to play against, and gives periods of exploitable weakness.

He has 10 seconds to charge up 5 stacks, which he can do with his 2.6 second Q. Combine that with his passive that refreshes his Q whenever he uses it, and he can use his Q purely to stack his passive and not worry about not having it later for damage. \n\nIf you do something similar to Annie, she needs to use her 2 non targeted abilities - her W on a 8 second cooldown, E on a 10. She has no refresh in her kit. Meaning that in order to get a tibbers stun, you have to already be deep into a fight - youre stuck either using 2 of her abilities to no effect to get a stun, or youre stuck not having a stun for the majority of the fight on a 625 range mage. She shouldnt have to worry about not doing damage to get in her 'window'.

Her engage with Flash Tibbers is all she's used for. You can't really nerf that without completely gutting her Identity. (of coarse it's her identity that everyone hates.) Also the Stun on her passive is her only CC in her entire kit. Nerfing that would be as problematic for a mage's kit. If this wasn't the case, Veigar would not be in as a terrible position as he is now. Yet in Annie's case, it's more balanceable cause it's her ultimate ability. \n\nIn all honesty, I don't actually think her Flash engage is that big of a problem. Cause if it was, We would have just as much problem with {{champion:37}} Flash Crescendo, {{champion:32}} Flash Curse of the sad mummy, {{champion:3}} flash Idol of Duran, or any number of champs that have High, lock down ultimates. Yet we only attack annie, and not just anyone with high lock down, so lock down isn't the defining metric. So how does Annie differ? Gallio and Amumu, arguably have a harder time cause theirs are more close burst and their melee, But the fact that they usually build tanky makes this some what moot. And the different between Annie and Sona is that Sona is basically confined to the support role. \n\nSo I would deduced that the only reason why her Stun is problematic is that it's paired with high Damage and High scaling. Is that really a good reason to butcher the only thing going for her in her kit. I'd think it would be more appropriate to just nerf the damage of the ultimate, if the ultimate is too powerful by itself.

Probably not, so it would not really be appropriate to nerf her stun stacking. also Considering the fact that once you have stacked your stun, you are pacified until your ready to cast your ult. Cause if you have to cast your Q or W in defense. You lose it, and would have to stack it up again. \n\nLastly, Annie is still a staple pick in the LCS as a support.

She has damage, And I don't think taking away her stun reliability in favor of the damage, is a good idea since it would gut her viability as a support. (something riot won't do as long as she's a staple pick in the LCS.) And I still don't think it's a bad thing to nerf the damage. The CC itself isn't even completely uncounterable, Even if it successfully lands, you can cleanse/Mikales/QSS out of it, all of which counter support annie. Yet with a High burst AP Build, The damage is already done.  And nerfing the ult in particular would reduce her full rotation, without impacting her laning phase too much. \n\nMaking her Stun just fall of isn't a good way to balance her CC. (though perhaps putting her CC on her passive was a bad idea.) She's not a spell slinger. If Her CC was to just fall off, it would have to have a decent window before doing so. (like say, 12 seconds?) And that would still be long enough to be a pain, and just long enough to speed boost, Flash, engage, or Zone you out for 12 seconds which is long enough to secure an objective. I say this mostly because Riot wouldn't want to nerf her level 1 potential. Or even if they do they would increase the frequency to compensate. (like say, after 3 spells) and that could be just as annoying.\n\nOver all, I don't see a reasonable fix without at least a small rework.

But you shouldn't compare her to Ryze or Ashe. Their windows of power have a much more dramatic impact, and are centric to their damage output. My suggestion for Annie is just to encourage her to use the stun more often. If she loses it, she can stack it back up really quickly with one spell rotation, while giving her opponent a bot of a breathing room.\n\nAlso, Annie's cooldowns are not long. In lane, her Q has a 4 second cooldown, which drops to 2 seconds if she last-hits with it. Her other spells do a have a longer cooldown, but keep in mind she only needs 4 stacks to get her stun anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-07-18T03:03:27.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If. If I shouldn't compare her to Ryze and Ashe then why did you bring them up as examples for your idea?\n\nBut the idea doesn't work, and comparing her to them explains why it works on them but not Annie.\n\nBut in fairness without her stun, what exactly keeps other mid laners from jumping her? Nothing.\n\nHer entire identity and kit is setup around her passive stun, and this somewhat long window of opportunity is a colossal weakness for it, especially charging it, if it can only be up for a limited time this requires her to constantly use her abilities and waste mana, if she wants it up for a fight she needs something to hit in order to proc it up quickly enough, and because of this change being limited she is even more vulnerable with her stun for a bit because she has to wait for her cooldowns before she can even use her combo + stun.\n\nDo you see where this is failing?\n\nA reasonable nerf to Annie assuming she actually needed one, would be making her need 1 more charge to stun, or lowering it's duration. But people want to see her gutted then actually balancing her properly.
