So I'm posting to just ask your opinions, do you think this kind of in-game talk should warrant a permanent ban or not?\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I have been punished in the past aswell, however never for something that you might see in-game where people wish the C word to your family, or ask you to k*s etc. \r\n\r\nThe problem in my opinion is the automatic system of punishments. Once you have been punished before, the next punishment seems to automatically be harsher than the last one, in a strick defined line. So If you get chat restricted for a minor offence, the next minor offence will be a longer restriction, then ban, then permanent ban. But from the fact that I have still lately seen people showing what I would call \"extreme\" toxicity, wishing all kind of things to you and your family, being extremely racist etc, I have a feeling they are not getting banned faster, than someone like me. If I am right, being extremely racist is considered the same as saying \"ok u are dumb\" in Riots eyes. \r\n\r\nAnyway here's the chatlog that got me permbanned\r\n\r\nIn-Game\r\nKamakas: not so early\r\nKamakas: we can poke tho\r\nKamakas: ye\r\nKamakas: okay lol\r\nKamakas: this rengar\r\nKamakas: is just solocarrying\r\nKamakas: lol\r\nKamakas: u just saw how he is sitting bot lmfao\r\nKamakas: how can u still flame\r\nKamakas: ok u are muted kha so dumb lol\r\nKamakas: 2 kills and 20cs ahead playing 3vs2 and jungler blames lmfao\r\nKamakas: u dont listen\r\nKamakas: just ff\r\nKamakas: kha is farming its fine\r\nKamakas: lol\r\nKamakas: what a joke\r\nKamakas: 1 kill participation vs 7 XD\r\nKamakas: 2 kill participation jungler\r\nKamakas: vs 9\r\nKamakas: XD\r\nKamakas: just go next lol we cant win with this difference\r\nKamakas: U HAD FLASH XDDDD\r\nKamakas: oh my god let me out\r\nKamakas: press yes lol\r\nKamakas: inting\r\nKamakas: report\r\nKamakas: so bad lol\r\nKamakas: not with these plays","replies":[{"poster":"HotarÂµ","date":"2019-12-01T20:00:33.239+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Something everyone is glossing over is that while OP's punishments may not have been for anything severe, they were still punishments all the same. \n\n When you receive any punishment, you're warned that further offenses will lead to more severe punishments down the line, up to and including a permanent suspension. On the 14-day suspension reform card, it explicitly states that \"_Any_ continued negativity will result in a permanent ban.\"\n\n Imagine you're in a store with 2 other people, the shopkeeper and another customer. The other customer pushes a rack over ruining a bunch of merchandise and making a mess of the place, they're immediately kicked out. You disrupt a customer, the shopkeeper asks you not to do that again. You do it again, the shopkeeper asks you _again,_ a little more sternly, to not do that. You do it one more time and the shopkeeper shouts, telling you that the next time you bother a customer, you **will** be kicked out. \n\n _Any_ disruption **no matter how big or small** will get you kicked out, or in this case, permanently banned, because you have been warned multiple times and you're on your last straw. \n\nYour account was pretty much hanging off a cliff, you exhausted all your chances and Riot specifically said \"Hey, if you do this again, you're out.\" It's unfortunate that you got suspended, but even these short logs have problematic elements in them like asking for reports, giving up early/begging your team to FF, and insulting or disrespecting other players (namely \"what a joke\", calling out the score differences.)\n\n>The problem in my opinion is the automatic system of punishments. Once you have been punished before, the next punishment seems to automatically be harsher than the last one, in a strick defined line. **(cont.)**\n\n>If I am right, being extremely racist is considered the same as saying \"ok u are dumb\" in Riots eyes.\n\n That is not correct and not how the system functions. There are two separate ladders for punishments, we're going to focus on the chat related one. \n\n The standard ladder is as follows:\n\n[](https://.)\n\n##10 game chat restriction > 25 game chat restriction > 14 day suspension > Permanent suspension\n\n[](https://.)\n\n When you violate the rules with \"standard\" toxicity (swearing at other users, calling for reports, etc.) you gradually move up the ladder until you reach a permanent suspension. When you use **zero-tolerance** language (term used for any racist, homophobic, sexist, or other discriminatory slurs + death threats) you immediately receive a 14-day suspension, one step away from a permanent ban. \n\nThe end result is the same, yes, as both players are permanently banned, but being extremely racist is treated with much more severe, immediate punishments. \n\n\"Ok you are dumb\" is not on the same level.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamakas","date":"2019-12-01T21:12:28.335+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you, that actually answers my question about the punishment severity between \"standard\" and \"extreme\" toxicity, I didn't know that. At least there is _some_ difference.\nAlthough, I feel if many people find in this particular case, that the punishment is not warranted, there is a gap between what players know is punishable and what Riot is punishing for.\n\nSo if this kind of behaviour, calling someone dumb/showing negative attitude in-game, is punishable, then looking at the standard ladder of punishment you showed, 4 games like this can get you permanently banned from this game. Looking back to my games and the players I know, I honestly think most of the community is not aware of this. I mean of all the cases I have seen from reddit or elsewhere about players being toxic and getting banned, I can't remember anyone getting banned for calling someone dumb in-game.\n\nSo the system of punishment for chat related offences is currently like this: for the worst toxicity/racism/death threats you get 1 warning  - 2 week ban before a permanent ban. For calling someone dumb/showing negative attitude, you get 3 warnings before a permanent ban. This kind of punishment system honestly seems dumb do me and should be improved.\n\nAnyways, as I wrote in my first post, I'm not here to try to get the ban overturned or justifice my own actions, just ask the people if they think it's warranted and to see if they are aware this kind of behaviour is bannable. Yes, I did get the \"Any continued negativity will result in a permanent ban.\" statement, but because I wasn't aware how easily you can get punished, it didn't prevent me from getting banned.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-01T21:26:19.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":24,"body":"How do you suggest it can be improved? More warnings? Riot tried that - they found that people who do not reform before a permanent ban tend to not reform (much over 95% of them continued being toxic and just got permabanned eventually anyway). Give a \"second chance\"? Again, it's been tried (twice now) and failed.\n\nI think most people here are more than open to hearing ideas on how it can be improved - but it will not be \"improved\" if your ideas of improving serve only to help yourself at the cost of releasing more toxicity from others in the game. Riot cannot make special rules for you - nor can they have an employee sit with you and watch every single game to \"monitor\" you. They must apply the rules and standards to everyone equally - meaning giving you another chance also gives 19 other players (if we assume 95% to 5% ratio) the chance to ruin more games before they are punished again.\n\nYou were referred to the Summoner's Code - which makes quite clear what behaviors are punishable. You also seem to understand that your behavior in this game was not acceptable. You're now saying you weren't aware how 'easily' you can get punished - but you understood yourself that your behavior like this was not okay. I'm not sure how much clearer a warning they can give that **any** further misbehavior would be a permanent ban - but again, open to hearing your suggestions.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamakas","date":"2019-12-01T22:07:17.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you are open for suggestions but unless you work for Riot I don't see how it can help.\nFrom the top of my head though:\nPut more emphasis on the chat punishments, for chat-related offences. Maybe first warning chat restriction, second warning a temporal chat mute, third warning permanent chat mute and fourth offence of any kind permanent ban of account. This would make much more sense, while not being less tough at all. And as someone who has been chat restricted I can say (and im sure riots statistics would confirm) that they actually do work - certain amount of games without the ability to type much _does_ make you focus more on the game and less on the chat. \n\nAnd if you mention that I was referred to the Summoner's Code and should know the rules - the fact is, as I have stated before, very many people of this community _are not_ aware that you can be punished for a chat log like I have posted.","replies":[{"poster":"LanceTheMighty","date":"2019-12-01T22:39:24.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree with this, if someone is misbehaving in CHAT they should be punished in CHAT.

I don't know why people think this is a good idea as it's not.\n\nRanked may be considered more competitive than the other modes but not everyone plays ranked, and if someone is being toxic then they shouldn't be allowed to just switch to another mode and continue to be toxic while acting like nothing ever happened to them. That's not fair to the people playing non-ranked modes (they now have a problem child to deal with) and it's not fair to the person displaying the problematic behavior (they don't learn that the rules apply to all game modes equally).\n\nIf Jack is consistently causing trouble for everyone and refuses to stop then they should not be allowed to play period as a consequence of their behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"LanceTheMighty","date":"2019-12-02T16:02:45.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not toxic behavior, trolling and griefing behavior ( inting ) should be met with a ranked ban.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-12-02T16:18:32.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both of these **are** considered toxic behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"LanceTheMighty","date":"2019-12-02T16:23:02.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Both are \"toxic\" but one is gameplay toxic and one is chat toxic.

When I got my first 10 game chat restriction on my now-permabanned main account, it took maybe 15-30 seconds to figure out how the system worked. The information is readily available and even if it wasn't, you already received three prior punishments for this same behavior. \n\n> So if this kind of behaviour, calling someone dumb/showing negative attitude in-game, is punishable, then looking at the standard ladder of punishment you showed, 4 games like this can get you permanently banned from this game.

That being said you also did this 3 times in total, playing through a full 35 games with your chat restricted, waited out a full 2 week suspension, and received reform cards every step of the way. \n\nEven if someone doesn't necessarily agree with the rules, that's ample time to understand what behavior is punishable and change it accordingly. \n\n> So the system of punishment for chat related offences is currently like this: for the worst toxicity/racism/death threats you get 1 warning  - 2 week ban before a permanent ban.

My point was that if someone is trying to say the warning(s) aren't enough, that's not really fair or correct to say as that excuse can only take someone so far.\n\n Receiving a 10 or 25 game chat restriction is understandable, mistakes happen, but most people will never go further than a 14-day suspension because at that point the system isn't to blame, they're the ones violating the rules that have been made clear to them on multiple occasions. \n\n Even if you look at some of the actual surveys/posts conducted, most players have no issues understanding the rules.\n\n[**Twitter post by Nasteey with about 300+ entrants.**](https://twitter.com/Nasteeylol/status/1191784038740049920)\n\n[**Reddit post by user Aszelee with almost 5,000 votes.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bt1kgr/poll_have_you_ever_been_banned_from_league_of/)\n\n[**Strawpoll results from the above post**](https://www.strawpoll.me/18054580/r)\n\n If you didn't understand that and/or the punishment system as a whole, that's fine and no disrespect to you.

If someone gets punished for saying get c****r, they will have a clear idea that this is not tolerable, next time they might get punished for calling someone ape (this was my last ban, ape in gameplay context tho) and find out this is considered punishable aswell. Then next time they say dumb they could be permanently banned, while not being aware _at all_ they are breaking the rules.\n\nSame goes for negative attitude. Is saying ff punishable? Can typing out someones score or calling out (without toxic words) get you banned? Saying _you have to do it often_ makes no sense to me. It should either be punishable or not, so people could actually follow the rules and play accordingly, not have this vague idea of \"I wonder how many games out of 100 am I allowed to get tilted and show negative attitude in\".\n\nThe strawpoll you linked only illustrates my concern further. According to that, 37% of the people have been **banned** at least once. I would expect the reddit playerbase to be much more toxic than the average, but these numbers are insane, 10% permabanned at least once? 8% on more than one account?  Sure, most of these people are probably toxic and have refused to change their ways, but this honestly seems to illustrate the fact that there might be a very considerable number of people who either get softer punishments or also permanently banned because of Riots vague ruleset.\n\nNow obviously Riot couldn't just publish the \"101 of getting banned\" of words and phrases that are not tolerated, since it could help people avoid punishment, but there certainly are ways to make the lines clearer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BawssDude","date":"2019-12-02T03:00:09.914+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"no i dont think anyone should be banned unless its death threats or something like that. people are just snowflakes nowadays","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-12-02T04:09:39.438+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BawssDude,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EjJJA2Ee,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-12-02T03:00:09.914+0000)\n>\n> people are just snowflakes nowadays\n\nthis line always cracks me up, like the people **raging at complete strangers they will most likely never see again in a video game** are somehow stronger or mentally fortified LOL","replies":[{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-12-03T06:20:43.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Assuming that the one saying it are raging at all. {{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-12-03T12:57:53.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, they are","replies":[{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-12-03T14:48:30.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like you are just mad.","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-12-03T16:52:12.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"says the guy spamming rageposts all over the forum","replies":[{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-12-03T16:54:04.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You just call whatever you disagree with spam.

People already complain about trolls and inters not being banned as much as verbal abuse cases, so why implement a system that protects those players simply because they pay money?\n\nFirst off spending money is optional with only cosmetics being purchasable for real money. Second of all why should someone be given a refund if they've consistently caused a negative environment for many other customers? If you go to a restaurant and pay for your meal but then start causing a disruption to the point where you're forced to leave you don't magically get a refund, nor do you deserve it. Yes you spent money but that doesn't matter as there are many other customers who spent money and aren't causing disruptions. If you go to an arcade, spend money on tokens or whatever and then start harassing and shouting up a storm every time things don't go your way, the workers there will have you leave without a refund.\n\nThe same thing applies here. Riot is a business &amp; thus like any business they're under no obligation to give someone infinite chances or immunity to punishments, especially if the person in question has shown time &amp; time again that they don't care about the rules. At that point it's better for everyone else to just remove the disrupter from the place &amp; not give them a refund. Refunds are often only given to the customer for product or service errors out of their control, not when the customer in question is causing a negative environment for others if that makes sense.\n\nTo quote [Kei143](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mmh6PidR-the-dreaded-downvoteers-in-this-discussion-board?comment=0001000100000000000100000004): \n\n>When Riot permabans someone, their philosophy is \"the chances of this guy reforming isn't a whole lot, we'd rather not have him in the game\". Thus in their eyes, they have already written off the toxic player as a paying client.\n\n>From a business standpoint, do they want to remove the toxic guy who has spent $500 but is causing a negative environment for 4-9 other players in every game? Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.\n\nI get that people want to protect their investment, but at the same time the investee is and should be under no obligation to keep protecting and coddling the investor every time they act up and vice versa if that makes sense.\n\nIf people truly valued their money spent on the game then ideally they wouldn't misbehave to the point where Riot is forced to permaban them and ask them to leave.

Second of all why should someone be given a refund if they've consistently caused a negative environment for many other customers? If you go to a restaurant and pay for your meal but then start causing a disruption to the point where you're forced to leave you don't magically get a refund, nor do you deserve it. Yes you spent money but that doesn't matter as there are many other customers who spent money and aren't causing disruptions. If you go to an arcade, spend money on tokens or whatever and then start harassing and shouting up a storm every >time things don't go your way, the workers there will have you leave without a refund.\n\nBecause this is the gaming world, not the real world with buildings, real estate, people physically interacting. This is online where no one can slip and fall, or hurt anyone with force. \nThe disruptions you talk about are limited to playing the game. Just as paying money is voluntary, so is playing the game, or playing with people you don't like whom are disruptive. \nThese are options for the people complaining, they don't need to group with the troll, or they can mute them, eat the loss and move on. When you take someone's money, they worked for it, and it should be protected because it has value. \nPlaying with someone and disrupting them has no inherent value, and can be avoided by the choice of the player offended by the misconduct. \nIn a store you walk out of the store, but you also may be stopped by someone, beaten or killed on the spot, here online that is impossible, so your comparison while note worthy is not enough. \n \n> The same thing applies here. Riot is a business &amp; thus like any business they're under no obligation to give someone infinite chances or immunity to punishments, especially if the person in question has shown time &amp; time again that they >don't care about the rules.\n\nYeah they have no obligation if they issue  a full refund on purchases. Maybe even with a time limit on them. This is another topic for discussion. \n\n >At that point it's better for everyone else to just remove the disrupter from the place &amp; not give them a refund. Refunds are often only given to the customer for product or service errors out of their control, not when the customer in question is causing a >negative environment for others if that makes sense.\n\nIt is a two way street, )(Remove both people involved no matter what then.) as with a night club, the bouncers will toss out everyone involved. Doesn't work? Well, Riot is not the standard for moral conduct, and is not equipped to be an arbitrator. They are a business, not an ethics committee. This should not be a thing at all. \n \n> To quote [Kei143](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mmh6PidR-the-dreaded-downvoteers-in-this-discussion-board?comment=0001000100000000000100000004): \n> \n> I get that people want to protect their investment, but at the same time the investee is and should be under no obligation to keep protecting and coddling the investor every time they act up and vice versa if that makes sense.\n> \n> If people truly valued their money spent on the game then ideally they wouldn't misbehave to the point where Riot is forced to permaban them and ask them to leave.

Riot doesn't make that call, nor should they ever. \nMoney has value and that value is respected by the entire world, Riot somehow thinks it doesn't need to respect the value of money now?","replies":[{"poster":"THISGAMEISTRASHK","date":"2019-12-07T21:05:11.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My guy I like the way you grrr ave your rebuttal","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-12-03T06:18:45.577+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Na, banning someone from a game should only be reserved for people cheating by using outside means.

Besides, just like in real life toxic/disruptive people drive away business, which in turn means less overall players/customers and money, so it's in the best interest of pretty much everyone as a whole to discourage toxic behavior as much as possible. Times are changing, and if people don't like being punished or held accountable for their behavior then maybe they should stop thinking that anonymity is a shield for them to act however they want consequence free.","replies":[{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-12-03T18:51:39.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes \"people\" have decided that, sure.

People are still allowed to voice their frustrations and criticisms but aren't allowed to start throwing things like insults, name-calling, hate speech and death wishes around. That kind of stuff is unacceptable and is just a very poor way of getting ones point across in general. I fail to see how expecting people to exercise some basic levels of maturity, respect and decency and holding them accountable if they refuse to do so is wrong.
