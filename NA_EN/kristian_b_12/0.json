Well, during normal games I almost always carry as a mid laner. I'm also a good in any other position. I have also played against a gold player in mid lane and I beat him pretty thoroughly. \r\n\r\nI would just like to start searching for teams, I'm a good player and could make a good addition to any team, especially one needing a mid laner. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading and for consideration.\r\nI'd like to leave you with this, I think I can compete with anyone. I focus when I play and play to win and try my best. I also work to improve the best I can and learn from every single game.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-12-05T04:01:20.474+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What everyone will tell you is \"I thought I would be ready for Ranked when I hit level 30, boy was I wrong\".

But yes I agree more complex rune pages will be needed. I understand the importance of more than simple AD and AP, the importance of countering. But I'd like to get into more competitive play. I don't really care if I land in bronze, I will feel like I'm being productive while climbing whereas in normal games I feel like it's a grind simply towards more IP and Exp. I appreciate your comment, and I probably will regret it. :3","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-12-05T07:31:32.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kristian B 12,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=tzPk9UV7,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-12-05T04:18:58.394+0000)\n>\n> I don't really care if I land in bronze, I will feel like I'm being productive while climbing whereas in normal games I feel like it's a grind simply towards more IP and Exp.\n\nHow productive will you feel if you *don't* climb out of Bronze the entire season?

If you were wondering, I landed in Silver two going 5-5, with 3 of my wins being carries. I am currently silver 4, and that's about where I belong and where I am at currently. I've been hovering in silver four from about 20 LP to 90 at times, although I haven't been able to steak enough games together to get back into silver 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kristian B 12","date":"2015-12-05T15:52:33.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrCyanide,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=tzPk9UV7,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-12-05T07:31:32.603+0000)\n>\n> How productive will you feel if you *don't* climb out of Bronze the entire season?

Also, the level of competition from many opponents is very low. I decided I am going to main Middle and ADC, and when I'm in those two lanes I almost always win my lane, whether I can roam and beat the people my team probably already fed is another thing. But I want to at least do my preliminary matches and get a feel for what it is like.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YumScrumptious96","date":"2015-12-05T19:19:14.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm currently looking for Top, ADC, JG players who know one or two roles besides mid.
