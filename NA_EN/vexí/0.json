However I'm facing some serious issues in my matches. I'll be fine for a couple of minutes and then I'll start getting hit by....lag spikes of some sort. I've never seen this issue before and I'm totally dumbfounded by it. My ping will be fine, hovering around 20-30 and I've capped at 60 to see if the problem may be tied to my frame rate. Unfortunately the problem persists and I'm at a complete loss as to what I should do. \n\n The problem itself is that characters and minions will be fine one moment, then everything almost \"stops\". What I mean by this is that characters and minions will randomly just stop having animations. However, damage will STILL be shown. I won't see what is actually happening, only that I'm either taking damage from something or someone. Sometimes everything stops completely, Minions will go about their usual pathing until they reach the enemy minions and then they'll just crash into each other and form a mosh-pit. I really wish I could clarify further but I really don't know what to say about it other than that. As an example say I'm playing Yasuo, I'll dash and once I do so, his animation will go off and be...almost like it's stuck on. If I stop moving he goes back into his idle stance, but once I start moving he'll do the Sweeping blade animation while moving around. I just want to play again..and I have no idea what else to do about this issue. \n\nhttp://n2.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/summary/id=36a470be-2139-6ca8ffed-b5bb-45a6-ba5a#DNSLookup\n\n I ran this and unless I looked at the wrong part I'm pretty sure it says that I had no packet loss. Any help would be extremely appreciated. :(\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I don't have anything remotely similar to this happen to me in any other game. Lagging in general isn't an issue for me in any other games. This is only happening on league.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T04:41:50.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This definitely sounds like packet loss. Bear in mind that Netalyzr mentioned you had no packet loss to *their* server, which is very far aware from League's servers, which are in Chicago for NA. I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to first ensure your local settings are fine before we take a look at your network routing if you're still having issues afterwards.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Vexí","date":"2016-10-31T05:05:23.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay well I took a look and also ran the repair tool. Nothing. I would assume the tool tests my ping to your servers and I had roughly 50ms with 0 packet loss.

You can complete this by grabbing [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/), plugging in **104.160.131.1** and starting the trace. After it's run for about 5 minutes, export the results as text and copy/paste them here. Be sure to run this during a time you experience the latency and packet loss symptoms so we capture an accurate route.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Vexí","date":"2016-10-31T23:16:02.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 | 1790 | 1790 |    1 |    6 |  227 |    2 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 | 1791 | 1791 |    9 |   22 |  289 |   83 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 | 1791 | 1791 |   10 |   25 | 1057 |   97 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 | 1791 | 1791 |   10 |   28 | 1069 |   99 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 | 1791 | 1791 |   20 |   35 | 1069 |  105 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 | 1791 | 1791 |   20 |   35 | 1054 |  230 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider  \n\nI hope this was done right, I put in what you told me to and this is what I got.

I don't see any packet loss, but your results are rather skewed due to something local to your modem causing it to mask the details about the hops you took. I usually see this when someone is running a Hitron Hub. Reach out to your ISP and request they push a modem firmware update out to you before you run another traceroute during a time where you experience your connection symptoms.","replies":[{"poster":"Vexí","date":"2016-11-01T21:33:27.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I experienced the issue throughout the entire match and the program was running during this time. This is why I'm so confused about the problem. I have now ran your repair tool, the program you specifically told me to, AND the netalyzr tool. However none of them claim that I have any packet loss. Quick question, do you think it could be an issue with my game? Would reinstalling it or possibly just repairing it yield any results? I will be contacting my ISP, but unfortunately they can sometimes be....difficult.
