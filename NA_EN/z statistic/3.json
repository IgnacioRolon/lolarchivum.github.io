I would totally win, lets say, 50-100 games with a champ to get the splash for the summoner Icon. However, would we have the option of getting certain skin splashes as well as the original?

Also another idea: maybe the champion the summoner has played the most all time is available. When that summoner spams another champion and that other champion becomes their new most played, the old main disappears from their icon menu and the new most played enters. Just an idea to really make it special for each summoner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Annie I","date":"2014-09-29T01:19:06.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great Idea.
