The model however was changed to something I wasn&#039;t familiar with. It kind of looked like a red version of Grim Reaper but with significantly more flair. I would have taken a screenshot, but I forgot sincei t was so unexpected. I simply thought the name was a bug in translation consistency across clients.\r\n\r\nBut the model is clearly unique. Just thought I&#039;d give you guys heads up since Karthus is fairly common in coop.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-03-06T21:36:08.634+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That skin has a chroma for it and bots will use them.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-07T23:14:13.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!
