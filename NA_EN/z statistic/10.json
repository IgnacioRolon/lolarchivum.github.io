Actions in League (or really any game) fall into two broad categories: social and gameplay. Social is interacting with other players. Gameplay is strictly interacting with the game. They aren&#039;t perfect definitions, but I think they work, especially for MMOs. I know a lot of you played WoW and Runescape back in the day. Hurling offensive and rude speech incessantly would be a social thing whereas exploiting a glitch or griefing players (except for very specific circumstances) would be a gameplay thing. It&#039;s pretty cut and dry there.\r\n\r\nIn League, it&#039;s slightly more complicated. Sure, there are glitches like the 0 cooldown flash hack or the glitch that allowed one to leave a game and avoid loss of mmr and LP. That&#039;s pretty obvious. It&#039;s cheating. But what about griefing? Well, except in specific situations like 0/30/0, it&#039;s hard to tell if someone is just bad or intentionally feeding. There are actions in MMOs where the analogous thing in League is very murky. I firmly believe in innocent until proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt, so this restricts the gameplay abuses to things that are basically just cheating.\r\n\r\nThink about it. Any time you confront a toxic person, what are they doing? 9:1 says _verbally_ abusing you. Even if you want to punish them for that, it&#039;s clearly different from gameplay abuses. Now the crux of this point: in my humble opinion, gameplay abuses should be met with and only with gameplay restrictions, and social abuses should be met with and only with social restrictions.\r\n\r\nWhat that amounts to is that I believe that a 14 day game ban for hurling gratuitous amounts of verbal filth at people is inappropriate. Instead, a mute is in order. This is different from chat restrictions. There, you CAN talk but only for a limited amount per game. A mute means you can&#039;t speak at all. And if they continue to abuse social systems after the mute is lifted? Scale it to a permanent mute. Don&#039;t ban them. If no one can hear their shit, does it make a sound? What does it matter if the person _would_ call their teammates every slur under the sun for missing 3 cs if they can&#039;t _actually_ say it to them?\r\n\r\nPermanent bans imo be should saved only for cheaters and blatant griefers.\r\n\r\nRiot, you have a mute system in place. If someone is muted  several standard deviations greater than the mean, why not just start them muted for their 4 allies and 5 opponents? Chat restrictions are like the mother saying, &#039;ok, if you&#039;re good today, we&#039;ll go to Chucky Cheese&#039;s&#039;. If the child has proven they are little brats, then the mother shouldn&#039;t even entertain the idea. Likewise, if someone has shown they don&#039;t care about chat restrictions, just mute them.\r\n\r\nThis could also expand into other social systems. For example, if they are auto-muted, they cannot add people first, only accept requests. They cannot initiate a conversation via pm, only respond one. These things need not automatically apply, but if someone adds people just to berate them, it&#039;s a great thing to have.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is born from a trend I&#039;ve seen over the seasons: players are encouraged to report, not necessarily mute people. That&#039;s bonkers. In fact, a mute should be in the same category (not necessarily same strength though) as a report. Actually, I&#039;ll go a step further: _the option to report a player for verbal abuse should be **removed** and instead, Riot should hammer in muting into players heads and **treat mutes similar to verbal abuse reports**_.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t count on my hands the number of times people have posted on the forums over the years that they don&#039;t mute because then they don&#039;t have evidence to punish the person. That&#039;s ridiculous. It&#039;s also stupid. You want to report this person for your abuse but don&#039;t take steps to block him? That doesn&#039;t justify his behavior, but why would you willingly subject yourself to abuse for no good reason? Players need to take more responsibility for dealing with situations of verbal abuse instead of putting on Riot to vindicate them _when Riot has already given us all the tools we need to deal with these cases as they happen_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\n1. In my opinion, verbal abuse should lead only to chat restrictions, time/#game based mutes, and permanent mutes, not bans of any kind. Cheating and griefing should lead to bans and not CR/mutes.\r\n2. Riot should have more systems in place to facilitate social restrictions for the outliers.\r\n3. Muting players should be the go-to answer for dealing with toxic players, not reporting them.\r\n4. Mutes should be treated as report, but not necessarily as powerful as reports (sometimes you just don&#039;t want to see their messages, whether they are toxic or not.)","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2016-02-16T21:45:24.918+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Except social issues become gameplay issues. The person being super negative in chat only brings down the whole team, which can directly translate to a loss. Or maybe the person is too busy typing into chat to actually be playing the game. \n\nPeople shouldn't need to mute people. The feature exists as a way to help people deal with negative players, not as an excuse for those players to continue their behavior.\n\nBut my bigger issue with an idea like this is that the players who want to make your experience awful are going to find ways to do it. So you let the player who rages at his teammates for every little mistake they make, give warnings, temp chat restrictions, and eventually a chat ban. Do you really think that just because the player can't chat, they'll magically stop causing problems?\n\nI don't believe that to be the case. That rager, once they've had their chat privileges permanently revoked, will find other means of taking their anger out on allies. And the only avenue left for that is through gameplay itself. Be it intentional feeding, going afk, abandoning the team, sabotaging farm from jungler or other laners, they're going to express their anger somehow.\n\nSo now with a system like that, the problem players are suddenly able to stay around the game far longer than they otherwise would have. They have to walk all the way through to the permanent chat ban. Then they'll have to work up through to a permaban for their gameplay behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-02-16T21:55:03.134+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"A game I like to play is to remove all the 'should' and 'have to' from a sentence and see what you're left with.

I'm generally capable of ignoring all the but worst offenders in my games. Sometimes I actually find myself laughing at these people. \n\nBut here's the basis behind my assumptions:\n\n- Historically, most players will reform their behavior after their first or second warnings (with the current system, the two sets of restrictions they ear)\n- Historically, if a player makes it past two runs through the system, reform rates plummet significantly. Basically, these players have no desire to correct their behavior or not\n- Given that people reaching 2-week or permaban level punishments in the current system generally have no intention to correct their behaviors, it means they realize what they're doing is wrong but consciously continue to do so\n\nBy that point, these people are intentionally causing problems. Just because you take away one means of doing so doesn't mean they won't find some other way to continue. And given how so many of the people act when they come on here complaining about their permabans, I do strongly believe a decent number of them would go on to find other ways to cause problems. Some even threaten to do just that on their next account in order to \"beat the system\".\n\nWould permanent chat bans work for some people? I'm sure they would.

Riot used to do that as well. Permabans were only for the worst offenders, not the most frequent. People were able to regain their accounts if they had proven to have reformed, etc. etc.\nThey even tried their best with quasi-permanent chat restrictions, that would kinda fit your suggestion.\n\nBut ultimately, it all was impractical.\nMost people that would still frequently misbehave after the first 2-week ban didn't ever change. So Riot started issuing permabans for repeated and frequent bad behaviour as well.\nMost people that tried to prove they were reformed after being permabanned, just ended up permabanned on their other account as well.\nMost people that were on those permanent chat restrictions starting drifting towards other ways of annoying/attacking their team.\n\nAll of these things catered to the minority (repeat offenders) of what was already a minority (toxic players) to begin with... all at the expense of those who never did anything wrong to begin with; or at least those who don't do enough wrong to get punished.\n\nShort version: \"This is why we can't have nice things\"\n\nThat's not to say I disagree with your points... and Riot doesn't either, as shown by the introduction of chat restrictions.

Not that I am proud but I learned a lesson from it. With that experience of being just chat restricted came to two distinct and immediate changes to game play and its effect upon it. One, I immediately noticed that having limited messages I was unable to communicate anything with my teammates to benefit our teamwork (ideas of engagements, tactics and objective priority). There just wasn't enough messages allotted to me so that I may collaborate. Two, I was unable to encourage my team.  This one bugged me the most.  When told I did good or my support said good job and I couldn't send a message. The times when your adc gets a kill with you and they get discouraged because they can praise you but you cant to them only 3 minutes later. I have even had teammates get frustrated with me because I wasn't responding to inquaries.\nSo you know that, by simply putting a message limit on someone already has a diverse effect on the team and their ability to do what they are there to do in the first place, work as a team. By muting players and allowing them to enter ranked matches would create a disadvantage to your team from the start. Sure you can muster some words in at the champion select. But, as far as game-play goes, you cannot Mute or Permanently Mute a player in the game. This has to be one or two of the reasons why some, not all, of your ideas here may cause you to believe that its unpopular. Because it is demeaning to the League of Legends community.\n\nI would like to see somewhat the opposite to what you are saying here.  That repeated verbal abuse, harassment, hate speech, griefing and the like to be an account bannable offence. The idea coming from the same thought that society has on criminals. If you steal (verbally assault) someone, you are punished lightly at first but, will gradually become a jailable (bannable) offence. This type of system works in society and would work in this community. The fear of jail(being banned) simply stresses enough, in itself, to wean out the bad apples. length of ban would be the only issue here with this method. Everyone also knows that half the community has multiple accounts and even banning one account will only be encouragement for them to A)Fix their problem B)play the other account and get it banned to0 C)play that new account learning from the experience and never want to start a new account or mess up their main account ever again.\n\nMy 2 copper pieces.","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-02-17T00:45:30.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That depends.

Even the most toxic person can have good ideas even if said sarcastically, so even if what they are saying is annoying, I leave it alone on the off chance they come up with an idea.

Let's imagine a world with a semi-false dichotomy you can either have mutes or reports but both will count as tallies towards punishments. The superior choice depends on the abuse in question. If the person is verbally abusing people, then muting him is the clear option as this prevents you from being distracted by his toxicity in chat and otherwise performs the same job as a report. If the person is hacking or intentionally feeding, muting is less effective than reporting because reports can have extra details mutes don't (muting someone is generally self-explanatory though).\n\nThis is the main reason why I would push for muting to take the place of verbal abuse reports. Like reports, singular mutes are meaningless. However, relative frequencies are very useful in determining one's toxicity. The main difference is that mutes actively deal with the problem as it occurs as opposed to after the fact like reports.\n\nIt also encourages players not to engage toxic players; toxicity really only perpetuates if someone is there to throw fuel on the fire. Ragers are less likely to keep ranting if they aren't getting a response. This point is particularly important as according to Lyte, 75% of toxicity comes from Positive players. These are the kinds of players who just have a moment of weakness and may only continue the raging if they feel vindicated by retaliation. Removing that retaliation would most likely allow them to calm down so that if they play another game, they are less likely to rage and spread the toxicity like Lyte describes.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-02-17T03:24:50.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah I think there is a misunderstanding here.  \n\nI was saying Muting as in the Mute button, not Riot muting them as punishment.

Now because the reason for THAT is uncertain (being toxic or just mildly irritating?), there needs to be a huge leeway for raw mute rates when looking at evidence.\n\nI'm also fairly confident that if the person is being mildly annoying to the point that 90% of his teammate don't want to put up with his spam, he should probably tone it down even if he's not being toxic.

It's because when they do this they 1. detract from the gameplay as statistically evident in RIOT's research and has been a tool tip for ages 2. are acting against the wishes of an OVERWHELMING majority of players as statistically evident in RIOT's research and 3.  specifically will draw additional negativity from additional people and reduce the likelihood that those people and people they encounter will want  queue additional games (which is specifically counterproductive to RIOT's business model).\n\nThink outside your own little world. Value the time other people want to play a game with you and regardless of how you feel about their gameplay or how your team did realize they teach sport teams at age 3 to shake hands with the other team and say good game.  It's not just about the people getting banned. Are there ways to think about how to deal with them? Sure. Muting them instead of banning is a band aid on a bullet wound. It isn't employed by RIOT because it hasn't been shown to correct toxic behavior. They've tried it. They've specifically looked at ways to correct behavior and muting their speech entirely 1. isn't productive to the game and isn't fair to team mates forced to play with them (which is why restrictions allow you to convey meaningful strats if you choose) and 2. results mainly in these players finding more destructive and harder to track outlets for their toxicity.\n\nDo I have to be any clearer or do you get it now?","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-02-23T14:28:30.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's your right to comment on anything you want or jump into a conversation whenever, but I'd ask you to read the thing you're replying to before posting.

You are asking me to take your word at face value simply because you're slapping Riot's name on it. Forgive me if I remain skeptical.\n\nYou seem to be changing a lot of your arguments to fit your need. In your TLDR you state:\n1. In my opinion, verbal abuse should lead only to chat restrictions, time/#game based mutes, and permanent mutes, not bans of any kind. Cheating and griefing should lead to bans and not CR/mutes.\n- I don't think this is true, should be implemented and opens the door to a lot of trouble for many reasons and I've listed a few.\n2. Riot should have more systems in place to facilitate social restrictions for the outliers.\n- I again don't see why RIOT should have to cater to 5% of their community at the expense of the 95% because they refuse to \"not be a jerk\".\n3. Muting players should be the go-to answer for dealing with toxic players, not reporting them.\n- It's not enough. It never has been. When muting, they find other more toxic ways to harass in many, many situations. There's plenty of evidence to suggest this is true.\n4. Mutes should be treated as report, but not necessarily as powerful as reports (sometimes you just don't want to see their messages, whether they are toxic or not.)\n- We have a reporting system. You want an entirely new system just for 5% of the community. And you want it to circumvent the system RIOT has spent years fine tuning? I find this ludicrous.\n\nTo respond to your comments:\n1. My comment was responding to your comment and was in the context of your original post.\n - Your flawed argument is that there is a difference between \"social\" and \"gaming\" offenses.\n - I argue this is entirely untrue and that RIOT's business is to ensure a positive play experience for everyone and that creating a loophole for \"social\" offenses (which I don't see as less game ruining than software hacks, exploiting, or various other \"gaming\" offenses) isn't conducive to adding a benefit to the game and promoting a positive play environment.\n2. No one has EVER been punished in ANY way because another player muted them.  \n - It's simply not been done. In this tribunal or in the current system or any iteration ever.\n - Adding this in would lead to millions of erroneous reports.  Something RIOT has specifically had to combat and has a system that does a decent job about it.\n - The body of your idea is to suggest there is a difference between \"social and gaming offenses\".  In that and subsequent comments, you mention some arguments that amount to misdirection at worst and ignorance at best. This is one of them. I don't infer that \"Player A is harassing Player B simply by virtue of muting them\". It IS ludicrous to suggest that. And I don't agree that your idea would benefit anyone. But my point goes to what's ACTUALLY taking place in game. Muting doesn't do anything but mute the player. Reporting them does. And that report isn't willy nilly about the actions it triggers. It specifically targets harassment and other specific, undesirable events (from a community and business perspective) and attempts to help the player correct their behavior and if they don't then it shows them the door.\n3. Read the tool tips. Talk with Mods, DO YOUR RESEARCH. I'm not here to do it for you. I've done mine. I don't care if you're skeptical. You want to \"prove me wrong\"? Great. Go find evidence.\n - RIOT has released a lot of information about their player behavior program and from the little bit they do you can assume that a LOT more is being done just so they have statistically relevant data. And yeah, it can be manipulated when released but that doesn't mean they don't have the real numbers and know what does and doesn't work.\n - Ask a mod. Ask them why are chat restrictions in existence? Why not use chat bans? They have specifically told me they tried that in beta and regional testing and have found it to be counterproductive to their Player Behavior goals.  I really don't think they were lying to me.\n - RIOT's Lyte is famous for bragging and explaining (in posts, in press releases and at trade shows) how this system is specifically designed with community in mind and stemmed from capturing the wishes of the community and many many other things that back up what I'm saying.\n - There's more, but I'm again, not going to do your homework for you just because your ego thinks you're right and I'm wrong.\n\nSeriously, come at me bro. Your kung fu is weak. You have a poor argument, an idea that defies logic and is full of loopholes and your position on my counterargument is deflective at best and egotistical and assumptive at worst.\n\nDid I miss anything?","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-02-23T21:05:19.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, a TL;DR.
