To illustrate the problem, here is a more extreme example:\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s say Leblanc get an update for her passive. You can now control it like a second unit; you can move it and make it cast spells in addition to autos. The tradeoff is that it still doesn&#039;t deal damage and it&#039;s E doesn&#039;t root.\r\n\r\nSituation:\r\nAn enemy Leblanc W&#039;s over the wall. You have no idea if she&#039;s real or not.

There is now no way to tell which is real and which is fake other than trying to look at patterns of movement over a period of time (the real one will most likely be more guarded).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the same kind of problem with Thresh&#039;s Q cast. At the very least, it gives you no information other than it&#039;s being cast.

There's a slight burden of knowledge involved, but one you should learn pretty quickly after receiving it once or twice.\n\nMost champions have some form of this dance they can do between telegraphing intentions and then tricking an opponent. Usually they just move in one direction and try to throw you off with their instantaneously cast leading skillshot from an odd angle or get close enough to you that it forces you to play your hand to avoid them without them actually needing to throw the skillshot. Thresh's ability to misdirect while casting is a strength given to an ability which has a weaknesses built into it. It already let's you prepare more decisively when you need to use escape options available to you. \n\nIf you're simply arguing for the clarity of being able to play around what an ability does while in the process of seeing it for the first time, it's really no worse than understanding things like a Vel'Koz Q or a Bard Q which completely change the relationship you need to have with your minions and such.

I often play Morgana against Thresh and Blitz hooks for her E. If I see a window of opportunity for them to hook my adc or myself, I have my E ready. Thresh is a tad easier for me than blitz because of the windup. It's not like I need to look where he's pointed. I saw a windup animation and there's a clear avenue of attack for him. He could be looking the opposite direction and I'd know where he wants to place that hook. It's not hard to predict what he wants. \n\nWhat you're saying is that it's unfair for him not to telegraph twice. Once is the windup, which should make his intention clear, and once again to know where it is going, which you should ALREADY know because it's a Thresh hook. Here's a tip, it probably wants the ADC or the squishy support. If he has clear line of sight on BOTH then you both fucked up for leaving yourselves that open with an easy to avoid telegraphed skillshot that is ruined by morgana, Lucian, graves, sivir, sona E, Nami passive, ezreal, and somewhat Braum's shield. Thresh's big core power isn't from his hook itself like Blitz: It's the lantern. \n\nWhat, Thresh missed the hook and hit a minion next to you? Don't relax. He can toss that lantern to the adc, jump to that hooked minion next to you, ult, flay you into it for the slow and now the adc is there and both of them have a shield on. He may have missed his intended target, but the result is the same. He was able to CC you and get his ADC the engage in favorable conditions. He's a shock and awe champ. Even on a poor hook he can get in and get shit going. \n\n\"But Mister Mack, that sounds so OP. Why would we let a broken champ like that exist?\" So why is he not bitched about more? Because he has a very high skill ceiling. Thresh's potential is rarely fully actualized. Sometimes, people play thresh because they saw Madlife or Remilia and think that's just how Thresh is and that by picking him you've unlocked god/win mode. It isn't. That's how Thresh is when you know how to play him at a supremely high level against people who just aren't prepared for that level of performance on him. I rarely and afraid of Thresh because of that skill ceiling on him, however having said that I am probably likely to get completely fucked by a God-Thresh in the future because I expect so little from the majority of Thresh's I see.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-03-24T11:46:53.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"FYI He is most likely throwing the hook in your direction.\n\nThat being said the easy way to dodge is to walk in an angle towards thresh\nSo not walking back and to the side, not walking sideways, no, walking towards Thresh and sideways.
