Then just build like normal and sell Brut for 6th item.\r\n\r\nWhat this gives me:\r\nan additional 15 AD and 20 more CDR at the cost of 180 health over pre5.8 BC + belt for the gold differential of roughly 300 gold\r\n\r\nCDR on Panth is actually really useful. It means more stuns and thus more shields which means more survivability vs AA based comps. It also means more ults so now it&#039;s even better for teleporting and not just for initiating. And not to mention more E&#039;s which means easier times tank busting than before. Now, let me back up and say this is all just theory and that while useful, you wouldn&#039;t spam CDR on Panth more than pre5.8 BC because he needs damages and sticking power more.\r\n\r\nThat said, 35 CDR on Panth mid game is freaking amazing.\r\n\r\nAnd I was also grumbling about Phage giving so much less offensive capability than I&#039;m used to, but then I saw it had two uses:\r\n1. I can rush it in a difficult lane without giving up too much offensive power\r\n2. I can pair it with Brut if I am really stomping for BOTH hp and more offense.\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;m starting to think this change isn&#039;t nearly as bad as I thought it would be.\r\n\r\nThe main downside I see is that it delays Randuin&#039;s or Glory, which is key on Pantheon if his team lacks catching or sticking power and makes him squishier longer (and I will be spamming Pantheon top/mid/jungle despite my team&#039;s comp in Ranked unless he is banned). Once he builds that Randuin&#039;s or Glory though, he&#039;s back at a net gain because then he would either be building something like Locket/BV or starting on LW with a pickaxe/LS. However, in the majority of ranked games I played in S4, games would end before I could finish my third item (some before finishing Randuin&#039;s, which is an issue). However, as the meta is now favoring bodyguarding and longer games, the early Brut+BC rush should help blow up squishies and being roughly as tanky as before while simultaneously having even better peeling and tankbusting capabilities.\r\n\r\nNow that it&#039;s close to summertime, I can&#039;t wait to test this out in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-30T18:10:01.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brutalizer need another item apart of GhostBlade, because Ghostblade is not a item that every AD caster need.","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-04-30T23:01:47.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or any AD caster, really.
