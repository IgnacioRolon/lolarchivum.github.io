I could get on board with a hyped up passive that blocks 50% damage and then deals 150% of the blocked damage over 3-5 seconds, but as it stands, DD is basically an item that gives sustain that is useful on AD casters and a moderate amount of burst resistance.\n\nIf I want sustain, I'll get Hydra.\nIf I want CDR, I'll get BC or Maw.\nIf I want general tankiness, I'll get BC\nIf I want burst resistance, I'll get Maw.\nI want CDR, lots of AD, sustain, and general tankiness...wtf am I, high? There shouldn't be an item that does that all together to a decent degree. I'll just get some overlap with BC, Maw, Hydra, Randuin's, and SV.\n\nMy beef with the item is that it doesn't really have a good niche because the intended niche is so weak. It could be a really good high-risk, high-reward item, but it isn't. I have died more times to DFT than to the passive on DD even when controlling for the frequency of encountering them. There is no dancing with death like the pitch was.

It doesn't only benefit you, it benefits every physical damage your team deals.

Isn't the other passive, the one that makes damage dealt to you become a bleed over 3 seconds that fufills the 'fantasy'? It's somewhat of an effective damage reduction if you can lifesteal what was dealt to you. Probably worth more than 5% lifesteal you could get with a {{item:3072}}, depending on the champion.\n\nAlso, it gives a good amount of AD and a fair portion of cdr. 15% lifesteal is not insane at all. Lifesteal per se is shit though. You need a lot more damage to make it work.\n\nOverall {{item:3812}} is a good niche item for AD casters that also use autos.\n\nThink {{champion:420}}, {{champion:240}}, {{champion:114}}, {{champion:58}}, {{champion:121}}, {{champion:104}} . Hell, even {{champion:119}} can get away with building it.\n\nIt certainly has some hidden power there but the thing is: There are champions that build {{item:3812}}.

It is literally his last items because there is nothing else moderately decent. The passive is more or less negligible. The DR is nice, but the DoT might as well not be there. That was the selling point of the item. If you didn't put enough pressure, you'd die from the DoT. And in exchange, it would give you a boatload of offensive stats. Well, that ain't the case. It's not any higher than the top tier AD items and the DoT's damage is non-existent. In order for the DoT itself to register on your radar as something meaningful, the enemy has to deal somewhere in the avenue of 90% of your health instantly. That's stupid.\n\nHonestly, it would just be better if you had a debuff that constantly dealt a % of the damage blocked while in combat as long as you were in combat or until you killed a unit over 5 seconds continuously, stacking. DD blocks 100 damage? You now take 100 true damage over 5 seconds. Wait, you got hit again and blocked another 100 damage? Now you're taking 200 damage over 5 seconds. The debuff just ramps up until you get out of combat or kill a unit. This is the item you DON'T want in a prolonged fight and instead want in picks and stuff. THAT'S a niche. Right now, it's a stat stick.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best princess EU","date":"2016-12-19T21:49:37.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"but it isn't purchaseable in laning phase","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-12-19T21:50:40.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither was New WotA.
