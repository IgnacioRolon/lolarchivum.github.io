Fricken hate playing as Tahm.... Happens so often that I've stopped playing One for All. There's nothing fun about being a 4k health Tahm, half lifing a full MR Garen and perma-stun locking the entire team. It gets boring really quick.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-22T03:03:14.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 notes, one for and against:\n\n1) There's actually a lot of champs that counter tahm hardcore, and plenty with at least a 50/50 chance of winning. Garen just doesn't have the shred you need against a bunch of champs with a ton of tank/regen/shield/escape. But that's no reason to auto-rage-quit against Tahm.\n2) Now as far as DODGING goes, I mean, I wouldn't dodge if I saw Tahm on the other team, but I would probably dodge if I saw Tahm on MY team. As stated in another thread, there are 6 champs that statistically make up 50% of voter winouts and about 5 more that make up another quarter, and another 5... well, basically about 90 champs are almost impossible to get. I'm sick and tired of getting one of the same 15 champs every freakin' game. That's not why I play OfA. And this is the only game mode that has actually made me dodge. I never dodge in ranked, regardless of people's picks. I never dodge in ARAM, and actually roll my eyes at the people who do. ARAM dodgers always make me think, \"why are you queueing for random when you apparently hate random?\" But OfA's appeal and purpose is not directly linked to how champ select works at all. In fact, how champ select works is irrelevant to why I and most other people play it, unlike ARAM. Unfortunately, that's a problem, because the current way champ select works is an anathema to why OfA is interesting. What's the point of wanting to try something if you can't, because half the people queueing don't really want to try anything? They just want to keep axing people with Darius for an endless number of games? Those people can keep playing what they want, repeatedly, to their hearts content, but champ select and player-matching shouldn't be built to force a few other people to play the same thing as well almost every game. That's why I keep mentioning Teambuilder in the forums.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-22T03:28:03.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, I meant dodging when there's one on MY team, not their team.

(ergo, why my thread on it is labeled \"with tweaks\".) Probably the best way forward is if you didn't queue for A SPECIFIC champ but a COLLECTION of champs. Categories wouldn't work, because OfA's all about specific champ synergies, but maybe there's 10 champs you're itching to try. You can queue with all 10 as preferences at once, and be matched with 4 other players with overlapping preferences. Would definitely help queue times if teambuilder were a thing. There's a few other ideas I brought forth in my thread, but I'm not gonna rehash.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-10-22T01:43:04.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah get friends then nobody will dodge?\n\nbut then again you want to play taric in one for all...","replies":[]}]}
