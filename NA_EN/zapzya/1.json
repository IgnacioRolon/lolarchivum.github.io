I took some screenshots to remember her by once the rework hits live.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lLN7ILk.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2QUOHcV.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/06AQR1t.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Tk9n6nr.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1NtBisk.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JLsWIMd.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gA0Ue1C.png\n\nJust a few pictures of Unmasked Kayle (it's basically the same)\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5kepxzl.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xOmk6QZ.png\n\nLet's not forget the old model had some issues, such as the tabard clipping into her foot and her tiny size to compensate for her large wings\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OZDi1bq.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/e9cPdps.png\n\nHere's all of the images in an album (maybe you want to compare to post rework)\nhttps://imgur.com/a/WN5bldW\n\nDespite these issues, old Kayle will always be, in my eyes, superior to the rework. Her colour palate of red-white-gold is easily recognizable and looks amazing. Her tabard looks majestic most of the time, despite the clipping, and her plume has a lot of attitude. Her wings contrast nicely against her armour. The places that lack armour are not emphasized or shown off. Her armour itself looks like it was constructed with being at least somewhat functional but not too restrictive.\n\nI played Kayle back in season 3 and loved the theme but wished for a better kit. When I came back in season 7 and saw her VU, I loved it but still wished for a better kit. Now that a better kit has arrived, I must say goodbye to the visual style that I loved about her. Goodbye old friend, your time has come.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-03-05T11:20:41.616+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"F","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedPannda","date":"2019-03-05T16:32:29.664+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Frostblade, now Kayle, please just let it all end.

After I stopped playing her I only really played her for a couple games over the years, or in ARAM. She was fun, just not a lot of depth.\n\nI intend to try out the new kit for sure though. Looks quite fun, but I have changed over the years so I probably won’t main her. It looks better than the old kit though, not having to turn on your ranged attack late game seems like such an improvement.\n\nThe only thing I hate is her base skins visuals, which actually have a massive impact on my enjoyment. It’s why I started playing and stil is one of the reasons i play A Sol, because I love how he and his abilities look. Luckily new unmasked Kayle looks good. It’s no old Kayle, but its a big step up from her base skin IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Kairoptra","date":"2019-03-05T20:55:40.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the response!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Clone Is Friend","date":"2019-03-05T11:26:32.011+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":12,"body":"F.\n\ni hate to see rito reworking champions and seing mains mourn.\n\ndid it my self too. #revertleague","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2019-03-05T15:47:36.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":".......Well Kayle basically has no players in her current state so overall it will probably help. \n\n0,7% pickrate for plati+ and sinking last i checked.\n\n\nIt very unlikely to get worse at least.

I don't even maintain a big champion pool at a given time so there are probably some people who have gotten shafted harder than I have. It genuinely sucks to have one of your main champion stripped from the game. Now you have to play the game without him/her in an environment where everyone else has dumped 1000s of hours into their main. and the 1000s of hours you invested in the champ is gone.  And don't argue \"toxic gameplay champion, good riddance\" because that's not what I'm arguing. Having a champion you invested 1000s of hours into deleted from the roster while subsequently being told to stay competitive SUCKS regardless. I've easily lost over 4000+ hours to reworks. 1000+ coming from Veigar alone.\n\nConsider that even with a playrate of 0.2%, you are talking about several hundred thousands of players.  \n\nBy this point I've already come understand this is a more or less needed process, but it still hurts, especially, ESPECIALLY if you don't like the update (Shoutouts to old Galio mains).","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2019-03-06T07:39:28.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was never a dedicated main, but i played Ashe,Swain, seju, Syndra,Malzahar, akali, Irelia and Xin Zhao a lot, even before their reworks, all of them got significant changes or were reworked that changed their gameplay.\n\nAshe and Irelia in particular are my second and third most played, and i dropped both Swain&amp;Irelia on their reworks,........So sure i get where you are coming from, however, if the players truly like those champs then they´ll still play them afterwards as long as its not too terrible from their perspective. \n\nI relearned to play Ashe,Sejuani, Malzahar (Once he got nerfed down and dropped out of the perma banned spot) and i made sure to properly test Irelia, Akali and Xin zhao as well. \n\n\nThen more than just reworks, there are times when a champ just gets nerfed out of the game or is incompatible with the meta, i´ve been through that quite a few times as well with a number of my picks, so i truly know how much it sucks to lose one´s favored picks. \n\n\n\nBut i do think that the reworks are needed still, because what is the point of a champ that only declines more and more as they grow more and more unable to deal with the changing game?  A rework does at least offer the chance of giving them a future of being playable.....and if it fails?  It hasnt happened but a chance to try and redo abilities do at least exist.\n\nAkali is for one finally getting buffs back after losing Q heal and W tower invisibility, if this works out we might just see her come back and then there are hope for others as well to get in depth changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clone Is Friend","date":"2019-03-06T06:31:07.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"these noobs with prob like 100h in the game downvoting this. wtf","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2019-03-05T18:28:03.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You call that \"old\"?\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/56/Kayle_Render_old.png/revision/latest?cb=20180803230501\nhttps://www.mmogamer.es/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Kayle-Old.jpg\nhttps://static.bonusstage.com.mx/uploads/2018/02/571e7f98-8658-4faa-b789-fa7aaedca14b.jpg\nhttps://static.bonusstage.com.mx/uploads/2018/02/70cc2116-292a-48c1-bf62-a14c4c6de588.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2019-03-05T15:26:08.942+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kayle was actually the first champion I got a PvP pentakill on.
