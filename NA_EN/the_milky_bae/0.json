Like... seriously? \"Why would I buy an item for 600 gold that gives me 700 gold?\" That's really a question you have to ask like you can't figure it out? Yes, it takes longer to turn a Poacher's Dirk into a Serrated Dirk than it takes to just buy a Serrated Dirk, but it's faster to turn a Poacher's Dirk into a Youmuu's/Duskblade/Edge of Night than it is to turn a normal Serrated Dirk into one. It's a risk-reward item. You're getting your Serrated Dirk slower so that you can _finish_ it faster by being able to put that 700 gold you saved into the other components.\n\n> Now not only do you have to risk going into the enemy&amp;#039;s jungle every 50 seconds, you have to pray that every time, you not only find a camp that isn&amp;#039;t already killed, you have to hope that the whole enemy team doesn&amp;#039;t collapse on you and kill you instantly. Plus all the time you are gone, the enemy jungler could be stealing your blue!!\n\nAll this tells me is that you don't understand how to counter jungle properly. That 'the enemy jungler could be stealing your blue' in particular is the worst damn excuse for anything. Yeah, he could be. He could also be taking blue while you're ganking, or he could be taking dragon or rift herald while you're taking your own blue. The enemy jungler isn't going to just sit on his ass twiddling his thumbs while you do things. In fact, as a jungler, part of your job for the team is to try and keep track of whether the other jungler is at any given point in time, either by tracking his jungle route or through wards. And hey, when you're dropping wards to scout for him, maybe you see a camp he hasn't taken yet. Assuming you're not bad, you should be taking that anyways just to deny him it, and if you have a poacher's dirk then that's an extra reward for doing it. Enemy team is starting to collapse on you? Good thing you were watching the minimap and those wards you just dropped so you know to quit what you're doing and get the hell out of there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2017-05-23T00:28:29.665+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is really needed is other items similar to poachers dirk that offer other buildpaths.
