I love them because of the stealthy mind-game filled playstyle since outplaying my opponent makes me feel rewarded the most. I play almost everyday and I grind at least 4 matches each day. I just get antsy waiting for all the PBE changes to come to live and I really don't like watching Brofresco play the new stuff before I can.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T02:44:49.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The criteria we use to select PBE testers changes all the time, especially if we're looking at testing specific content. One set that remains consistent is that we are always on the lookout for players that are really active, a positive influence on the community and would give great feedback.\n\nWhile I cannot grant you PBE access, I wish you luck with your application and encourage you to continue to actively play League while you wait for an invite.\n\nBe sure to check out our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) for complete details on how the system works.
