By the time you have dragon buff or particularly baron buff where all your big minions outrange the turrets it all becomes irrelevant.","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceArchie","date":"2014-12-05T05:30:11.831+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's my problem with all turrets in general, and as the casters of the recent Preseason OGN eloquently put it \"Dragon is now more exciting because it's relevant throughout the entire game. Turrets are your teams gold banks\". Thats a pretty accurate statement and im 99% sure theres little reason anyone could deny that and even remotely make turrets seem dangerous, unless they don't like being denied a dive whenever they please. Games are easier to snowball now because of the dragon buffs, they are easier to snowball now because every champion is essentially stronger than they were before because levels scale much better now and make you much stronger. \n\nThis combination makes games very tense, and moreso about a complete team stomping rather than individual chances to shine or clean up. To be fair I don't think I've won a game at all this preseason by being the most dominant player on the map, but moreso my team being able to outplay the other team individually as a collective until or just being able to follow up on my engages at the right time. To win a game in season 5 you need to execute as a team consistently even if you have a lead. Thats good but what I don't like is that, teamfights literately trump almost every other aspect of the game right now, especially turrets. \n\nIf you win a team fight, even if a single member remains up, you can bet that that member will be able to take out two turrets solo. If it's a split pusher it's even worse because if you lost a 4v5 and the had one splitpushing that one guy can back door your inhibitor and will quite frankly be the strongest player on the map by the end of it. The turrets feel so underwhelming because they just literately are. They are nothing more than gold banks with the only respectable turrets being the first and the nexus turrets. The first because they chunk you out so much at an early level, and the nexus ones because in rare occasions if the other team is too bloodthirsty the turrets will take out a few over-aggressors out.\n\nWhen I watched the OGN preseason, the turrets didn't play a role they used to as they did in the past. You would quite frankly see often the turret getting opponents pretty low or even killing a few at any tier. The turret was a tool for anti-siege and players who payed attention to the aggro could potentially secure a 1 for 1. Even if the better team survived with some members, sometimes it wasnt a good idea to go for the turret because they were actual threats and juggling aggro may be fatal. But now a single teamfight in even the early mid game can result in an astonishing clearing of 1st, 2nd and maybe 3rd tier turrets. Thats not fair in my opinion because a seige team shouldn't be given the luxury of feeling \"safe\" under a tower because it's underwhelming. They should have to make a choice, take the turret or take the chance of focusing the enemy team fully. These new turrets just don't provide that anymore for a defending team and the snowballing of these games is so fast.\n\nThe laser turrets in regards to a splitpusher work in theory but not really at the same time. They don't do a substantial amount of damage over a relevant course of time, they kill minions slowly if not at the same speed as the old turrets. Furthermore to mitigate the monster backdoor splitpushers who have been at the strategy all game, they don't even focus them so the tower is just there.... as a gold obstruction..... To be frank Season 5 is all on the players who just outplay the other team as a team consistently. It's theirs to win or throw and objectives pose no threat by themselves as deterrents, but are merely buffs and huge gold banks to collect from. \n\n**TL :DR-** *Part of Turrets being a deterrent is their ability to kill and their tankiness. If they aren't tanky and just aren't deadly then they do not pose as deterrents. The turrets are underwhelming and just help snowballing because they are merely gold resources for the team tasked in destroying them, nothing more.*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Long Dong Wukong","date":"2014-12-04T17:12:37.283+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"They don't hurt for about 3 seconds and then they remove your health bar","replies":[{"poster":"Crownsy","date":"2014-12-05T00:19:54.098+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> They don't hurt for about 3 seconds and then they remove your health bar\n\nRight, but if you are tanky AT ALL that's far to long. how long does a dive really take, 1 or 2 seconds?\n\nI main Leona, and I can tank them for 5-6 seconds easily at like 20 minutes. they provide the person we are diving zero protection.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarthPancake","date":"2014-12-04T21:19:50.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah,I am tired of getting turret dived at level 3 because it does nothing but poke them.
