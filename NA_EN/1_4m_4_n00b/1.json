If someone does this to you, we need to talk play styles here, Riven has a combo universal one , Q>AA>Q>AA>Q>AA this makes it so she utilizes each stack of her passive. This combo is done quick which immediately puts the cool down at5+ seconds early game and even late game as well. Riven CANNOT  so this infinite knock up stun combo you speak of and I'll tell you why: Each time riven Q she has a timer until she can use her next Q. This timer never changes. If the timer runs out and she does not Q I'm second or third time it will be put on a LONGER cool down. There is a way however to use all 3 Q's and once finished have it on a 2 second cool down or something near 2. Either way it's short. You Q WAIT more than 1 second until your q timer is almost done then you q again wait once more for a bit until it's ALMOST done then q a third time and the Broken Wings will be put on a short cool down. Here's the thing if you let a riven do this to you, your afk 99%. The amount of time this takes leaves you with more than 5-7 seconds to cc her run do anything to avoid this. Riven has to WAIT more than a second to activate her second and third q cast and try to hit an auto so this means you have two chances to do something to stop this \"infinite combo\" of her stunning and knocking up. You know what that is? Run back. If you run out her AA range she will be forced to waste her q to catch up then when it's on a longer cool down and she has nothing left but W to stun she has no other attacking abilities so chances are she runs away. She can't lock you out for 3 seconds also cause rivens W has a animation time by the time she finishes casting it without her e you'll be out of it only taking one auto. Riven e then w to use the stun faster by canceling it with her dash if you know this then you now know riven has room for counter play.

For riven to have the \"infinite q combo\" i heard someone say, she needs to time the qs for a bit. So q wait q wait q, and even then the cooldown is 2 seconds which is enough for counterplay since knock up isnt long, any hard cc shuts riven down her shield is not a big problem tbh it doesnt last very long if anything i guess you could reduce the shiled duration but riven has recived nerfs on nerfs on nerfs i feel as if shes fine the way she is now her kit is very nice but it can easily be counter by tankier champs and any hard cc, people mostly choose other burst champs to try to \"outburst\" her when this is not the way to go.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-03-15T22:42:56.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides the fact that she can knock you up, then stun you when you land, then dash and shield herself, doesn't really sound fun when she starts roaming to pick up kills.\nWhat I'm saying with the shield scaling off AP, is that it wouldn't allow her to be able to absorb tons of damage while still dealing tons of damage.\nThat's why.

Here is where you need to learn the champ. Rivens go for a q, aa , q ,aa combo between those two Q's you have ample time to cc her and interrupt her combo and put her q on a longer cooldown. also going back to the e>w combo, this basically cancels her w animation which means after a knockup, she either dashes OUT and stuns or to the behind you and stuns, her shield absorbs damage but doesnt stop cc, if you cc her and force a cooldown on the shield, she can easily be countered. i know these things from experience, for example {{champion:54}} baits out e, the cheese wheels her for his gap closes, then he can easily just hit her down from there. A lot of people try to counter riven with head on bursts, not gonna work a majority of the time. Her main shutdown is CC and there are plenty of top lane champs that have slow stuns or silences. Her other is just tanks, tanks tanks tanks, dont try to outburst her.

Xin zhao can cancel her 3rd q wwith his. Slows with malphites really hurt her as he does have the cc and is a tank. As you can see there is a pretty huge room for counter play.\n\nthe only way i see her getting out of hand as she is now, is if other top laners recieve nerfs. which is doubtful since even if 1 or 2 did there are plenty others to shut her down. But even so if they recieved nerfs we would have to see what to nerf on her from there depending on what the other champs lost. im not being toxic sorry im just surprised riven gets this much hate when i main her i can be shut down and when i play against her she is just as easily shut down.","replies":[{"poster":"OoohCreamy","date":"2015-03-15T23:10:03.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also having her scale of AP is just not a smart idea. from this you are saying we take a champ who is good and make her completely useless its like having an ADC with all AD scaling abilities build ALL AP.
