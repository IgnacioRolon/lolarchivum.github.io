You may want to take a break from queueing up and work on resolving whatever is causing these bugsplats.  Leaverbuster will treat everyone equally, not just you, because it still causing other players a bad experience for being down a player. \n\nThe nature of bugsplats are usually game files, drivers, or hardware.  You may want to run through the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide and test it in custom games so your leaverbuster doesn't escalate.

You can email us directly via support@riotgames.com instead of using the ticketing center.  If you want to go over an account suspension issue, feel free to make another post and I'll take a look.  Just a heads up, the PB team via ticket can consider any disputes regarding it though.","replies":[]}]}]}
