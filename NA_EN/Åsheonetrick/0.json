New accounts, trying things out, picking off meta, trolling sometimes, picking braindead champions, picking meta champions, going Jarvan Camille botlane and dominating, and there is one thing I've noticed. \n\nEvery single game has somebody who doesn't care, win or lose, they remember its just a game. Then there are 2 people who care, but not enough to afk over a bad support pick. Then there are 2 people who either troll, type way to much, or get passive toxic in game. \n\nAnd you know what, i want this to change, almost all players do. Nothing is going to change these things however. \n\nBut here is an idea.\n\nEvery time a player logs in, present them with their chat logs, ALL OF THEM, from the last time they logged in. Have these appear on screen, and don't allow the player to remove them or start a game until maybe 2-3 minutes go by. Many people are only toxic sometimes, or rarely, but some circumstances in game can bring it out. Maybe after seeing the things they've said, they can reform themselves before it gets too far. \n\nPlayers getting out of hand ruins the game, toxic or whatever many players don't care about. Showing somebody the sheer amount of messages they've typed over a few games can be an eye opener to many players.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2019-04-16T17:00:07.607+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"This tries to address a really deep philosophical question: Is it the role of a game (or in the past, governments, etc) to change the behavior of the individual?

Is it a Democracy,Dictatorship,Hierarchy? With more information one could give a more clear answer. With out knowing any of this we as individuals and a community have no direction which plummets us  in to chaos.. Right now it seems we have all the above.. But it truly feels one of the examples   are left out when it comes to when decisions are being made. This kind of breaks it down .. Not going to get to in-depth here so please bear with me.\n\nExample  of Hierarchy in League, As a community ( Enter Champs name here ) Feels pretty good in Bronze through Diamond right now. Challenger through Pro Play says ( Enter Champs name here ) is broken so nerf  that champ. (INC nerfs!)\n\nDictatorship in League. We are going to buff/nerf things just because we can.\n\nExample of Democracy in League. A majority of the community.. Hey riot these champs {{champion:92}} {{champion:67}} are busted, Conquer really needs to be addressed,burst damage is at a all time high, tanks are like turned over trash cans,mobility creep/power is insane. \n\nAt this point I am hoping that we can pin point which one of the examples are left out when decisions are being made . Riot tells us that they are listening to us when we speak and it matters to them...\n\nThe sad truth is, We as a community go to riot and say hey this champ is busted {{champion:92}} {{champion:67}}, Riot goes off and buffs {{champion:114}}, then we as a community feel like everything we have said has fallen on deaf ears.. Over time players/people become angry frustrated, They lash out. Then comes the inevitable..

Our ability to change who we are is limited. Only within a tiny margin are people capable of truly changing, and that margin even deteriorates as we Age. If you are older than 27 years old, your brain is generally fully mature, and you are going to lose flexibility from that point on. After 27, you generally only learn through retention, and to process new information. Your emotional build is done. You either are socially neurotypical and acceptable, or you aren't (within a margin).\n----------------------------------------------------\nBut how do you factor this into behavioral modification (punishment or otherwise), and have your cake too?\n\nWell..... The dual endeavors of trying to keep up with competitive player skill curves while trying to keep a clean environment conflict with each other.\n\nI understand very well why Riot keeps making champion kits more flexible, more available, and gold incomes up: Players have become so much better on the average that mechanically, they are taking the old kits, and making them incompatible with their pace of reaction. So, we're driving toward minimal reaction time play.\n\nBut, the more Riot adapts the game to learning curves and reducing reaction times, there are always more laggards (players who either have an inability to adapt, or players who adapt slower than the rate at which your baseline competitive player is.\n\nPlayers don't interpret the data on a macro level that comes from these laggard interactions. They just see \"inting,\" situations where they knew exactly what would happen, but their teammates did it anyways, and have seen enough games over time to generally predict a game's outcome by 8-9 minutes. While the inting may have actually just been a skill curve laggard being unable to react to a good player, all their team sees is inting. Or, when you know with a 100% Certainty, that a play will be successful if your teammate does anything more than \"breathe,\" and your teammate doesn't even do that, you generally see an ineptitude where in reality, they could have just been doing the risk math different, and only trusting themselves, and not you.\n\nBottom line: _**The more Riot focuses on the .5 second play window, and creating those dynamics, the worse the community will behave. The only way to combat an increase in bad behavior, ironically, is to bring the game back to a state where pro players are not the baseline, but rather get away with being \"Godlike\" while lower tier players are given more time to react. Bring the game back to 1-2 second reaction time capacity, and toxicity will go down, because people on average will perform better.**_","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-04-17T13:51:28.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my humble, but firm, opinion, yes it is.\n\nHumans as individuals are notably bad at a number of things, but one of our biggest strength is the ability to build systems around us that compensate those bad sides and incentivize us to behave better than when left to our own device.

Toxicity is lower (not non-existent, but lower) in normals because most people \"don't care\".  I want to win, but if things go south, you don't get too worked up because it doesn't \"mean\" anything.  Ranked is a cesspool because whether INTENTIONAL (trolls &amp; smurfs) or unintentional (just weak), players make each other frustrated because 4 TOTALLY RANDOM people determine whether you advance or not, and when one (or more) of them have an outsized impact on your results, it is incredibly annoying.  If they're doing it intentionally, they'll often TRY to goad you into toxicity with taunts and frustrating plays, and if they're doing it unintentionally, then you will often push THEM into toxicity when your frustration gets the best of you.\n\nAnd that's all it is, is pent-up, continually building FRUSTRATION.  When you work with customers, its not usually a problem that one person is an idiot, it's that you deal with a thousand customers and if 10% of them are idiots then you see 100 idiots and after you pass 50, you just don't want to deal with them anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2019-04-17T00:20:54.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"extremely rare for me to say more than gg. mabye a gg wp if i felt both teams were doing well.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archaic Mythos","date":"2019-04-16T21:47:42.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about playing back replays to people who use gameplay grief, passively int or flat out int?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2019-04-16T20:20:23.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just have the chat logs scroll on a loop while the player is queuing. Most players won't be bothered seeing their own chat for a second or two before they alt-tab out to their time waster.\nBut for the section of the community that get way too heated, that say things in chat that they would never say in a calm state of mind, being confronted with their own toxicity will cause them to feel embarrassment.\nThey will, of course, just alt-tab out and try to put it out of their minds. But they'll be reminded every time they queue up. Even if they get real good at alt-tabbing out right away, the very act of doing so will bring to mind that which they desperately want to ignore.\nThis will cause them to consciously work toward keeping their cool, to avoid their own disapproval.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2019-04-16T18:48:07.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Toxic people do know they are toxic and they won't really reform , how will that change anything?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Optifreak72","date":"2019-04-16T18:18:06.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure how effective this would be.
