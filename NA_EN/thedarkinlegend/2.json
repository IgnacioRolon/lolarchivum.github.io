His kit is boring. Yes, it might fit with his thematic, but Riot could have done a far better job.\n\nMultiple AS steroids is a necessity on current Aatrox but it is absolutely boring. I love the effect on his R, but seriously, for an ultimate called \"Massacre\" it feels underwhelming.\n\nAnd don't get me started on his E. Sure, it \"works\" in the sense that it makes the champion works : it gives him waveclear, some harass and a soft CC in the form a slow. But for an ability called BLADE OF TORMENT on a champion that is basically THE GOD OF WAR (ot at least some avatar of war) of LoL, having some \"pew pew magic\" when we know that he can grow the size of his sword is ....
