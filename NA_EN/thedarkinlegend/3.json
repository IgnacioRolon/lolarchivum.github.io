And honestly, don't play Ranked for a few reasons:\n\n1. DynQ/Premades - This has been said multiple times but these groups of people and this Queue make the game especially unfun and unbalanced than just lightly unbalanced.\n\n2. Borders - Get removed if you don't uphold your rank every season. Example : Gold Border Season 5, Season 6 you end up Silver, you get a silver border, Bronze, you get an icon, no border.\n\n3. Hextech Crafting - Riots implementation of free skins, is quite atrocious as the system needs some tuning. You get stockpiles of chests, but a droplet of key fragments. Needing 3 fragments per chest is really extreme considering you can earn 5 chests and open 2 of them unless you are really lucky, but then you gotta hope for something new, and not something you already own. But it's a hell of a lot better than trudging through Ranked for 1 Skin.\n\n4. Hextech Crafting 2 - A Victorious skin for those who trek on to Gold 5 or Higher.. Sadly this is the only way to earn this Skin, but you gotta ask yourself, is this even worth it considering I can just play Normals and try having fun and earn the rest of the skins FOR FREE(Yes, even ULTIMATE SKINS!) \n\n5. Riot Noticing - The less people that play Ranked DynQ, and switch to Normal DynQ/Blind Pick will show them that their system is completely flawed and they'll possibly bring back SoloQ or pay attention to their players more.\n\nAs is, Ranked doesn't have any benefits that I care about, nor should anyone care about.
