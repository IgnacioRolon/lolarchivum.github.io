THEY NEVER respond to critiques or grievances on here. They never admit they were wrong, or apologized for not listening to everyone when we said...uh hey, those crits on Yasou with the new masteries will be bullshit...or any number of stupid things they do.\r\n\r\nAnd as for Dynamic Queue....I just don't understand why premades arent only matched up with premades. If you are a pre-made of 2, you should be matched in a game against a pre-made of 2 and 3 loners.\r\n\r\nWhat, not enough players for that? Are your numbers BS Riot? I though you had like 67 Bazillion players.\r\n\r\nAmateurs, riding the gravy train of being int he right place at the right time, much like that facebook nerd who will never ever do anything else in life, because he is a one trick pony....hes not creative, or some visionary, he just capitalized on trends at the right time.\r\n\r\nYour bosses at Rito are probably the same---just barely above intelligent people who have let their success go to their head. Who cares what the community wants! WE WILL GIVE THEM WHAT WE THINK THEY NEED.\r\n\r\nYou see Riot...it really is OUR game because, when the customers go, you won't have a game that anyone plays. If you think this silly top down 2D made to look 3D game where everyone runs around crazy hating each other will survive against bigger and better games from companies that give a damn about their customers, you are so very sadly mistaken.\r\n\r\nGod, I hate Riot so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-05-23T23:59:42.121+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"cry harder \n\nenjoy your new overhyped meme game","replies":[{"poster":"TheDarkinLegend","date":"2016-05-24T00:00:45.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Okay, thank you.

Blizzard's games do good, but not as great as LoL. Also, you are just a biased guy who makes up shit in his mind. Do you have proof that is not hypothetical that is what they do? Lemme tell you that more players like Dynamic Queue rather than hate it. If you hate Riot so much, hate them somewhere else. Not only that, what da fuk is the point of this disc but to flame. What do you want to discuss about? How everyone hates riot. It's sad how some people are so spoiled that if people don't listen to them, they just began ragin and yellin like a spoiled brat. Man, this is why LoL is considered to have a bad community. Grow up already. If you play the game, it doesn't mean they have to listen to you. You are angry that they are not listening to **YOU**, not the playerbase. You don't represent the playerbase, so quit acting like you know everything we like. Also, if they did listen to every fukin request people made, others would be like: No, I wanted that other thing and still complain. Besides, you are being rude to the other game. First of all, it ain't a moba, so it really isn't directly in competition. Not only that, you use it to attract people to you raging post. Like I said before, grow up. You ain't the center of the universe.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDarkinLegend","date":"2016-05-24T00:45:24.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So...Riot is blameless?

Back in the day, before they were overrun by Activision, Blizzard was a great company. After the take-over however, they're one of my most disliked. They don't listen to feedback and never apologize for failures. The devs don't even communicate with the players. WoW lost 50% of its player base because of Blizzard refusing to aknowledge their errors and fix them.\n\nRiot is ten times better, although they need to sharpen up unless they want to take the same customer-hostile approach as Blizzard did.\n\nOverwatch will surely be ran into the ground sooner or later. I personally don't buy any Blizzard products because they live on past fame and hasn't produced any top tier titles since WotlK.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDarkinLegend","date":"2016-05-24T00:48:23.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.

Honestly people like you are why gaming companies take community feedback with piles of salt.  \n\nLets start with overwatch.  The game is pretty fun and enjoyable but its a completely different genre.  Its way more likely to take players from tf2 (which has been uncontested in its genre for years and years) than it is from league.  \n\nOn to the complaint about riot not interacting with the community and their general fuck ups.  These complaints are always so fucking annoying to deal with because it blends item and champion balance fuck ups (like league of cleavers or release xin) with the rework fuck ups (like cassiopeia) and the communication fuck ups (like the solo que promise).  These three are all different teams and have all fucked up at different times.\n\nLets start with balance fuck ups.  Most of the time these have only happened during the preseason (which gives them a certain amount of leeway to fuck up) and the times when it hasn't been in the preseason they still get around to balancing it eventually.  I'll admit sometimes it takes a while but eventually they find the right spot. \n\nRework fuck ups are a bit weird because on the one hand we have a large number of great reworks and VU over the years (Darius, Shen, Poppy, Taric, Fiora, Sion, Trundle, and I would say karma but others might disagree on that one) and some bad ones.  Ryze has always been a problem and IMO his core mechanic of bursty spell caster will never be balanced for league (hence why he is on his third rework),  Cass has gone through two but I think she finally has a good place, Morderkaiser's whole idea (kinda like ryze) just doesn't work in the style of league either hence his many problems.\n\nCommunication fuck ups have happened but compared to a lot of companies they listen to their player base.  They have had multiple amas for skarner and cass,  lots of riot ask questions and generally communicate their decisions pretty well.  Their last mistake of solo que was simply a miscommunication.  If they hadn't promised it coming out then there would have been way less backlash.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDarkinLegend","date":"2016-05-24T00:51:48.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't see it.

But more realistically, they have bad leadership in their company that stifles good ideas, good analysis, in favor of pushing an agenda or change that a higher up insists on making.","replies":[]}]}]}
