TAKE THAT, AND THEN GIVE SUPER STRENGTH TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAMP, SO WHENEVER YOU WANT TO CLEAR ONE, YOU END UP REEVALUATING YOUR LIFE.\n\nthe incentive behind removing the Q % cap on monsters is the fact that the jungle got brawny. too brawny for pony. whenever hecarim tries to slash his scythe (assuming ur using his good skin) through a monster, the monster eats it for a snack and then hec gets sad because hec does no damage to monsters anymore. by the time he even tickles the monster, his hp is gone. rip.\n\nhis jungle ability restrictions need to be removed. they're no longer relevant, the jungle has been entirely redone since 2012 and don't apply well to the new one. (66% of damage dealt to minions, low cap for W on monsters)\n\nthe W buffs are self explanatory, buffing lane hec indirectly when ur trying to help jung hec defeats the purpose of buffing jung hec at all.\n\nwhile the heal buffs seem extensive, they're really not. spirit stone gave hec a chunk of hp every single time he q'd, and that was in the old jungle, where nothing even did damage.","replies":[{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2015-01-10T06:17:23.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":21,"body":"if you havnt figured it out yet, pen marks with one crit rune, LS quints 21/0/9 with emphasis on summoner CD in utility.","replies":[{"poster":"gLw0nB0Rds","date":"2015-01-10T06:17:58.637+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANKS NOW I CAN BE A HEC GOD TOO","replies":[{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2015-01-10T06:19:48.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":17,"body":"yw","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-01-10T07:08:13.182+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"just played a hec jungle game, can confirm his q does no significant damage to camps.
