She&rsquo;s a tricky arcane assassin who promises to misdirect and outmaneuver, but all too often throws her face at you with W-&gt;RW+Q+E from afar. The strength of that damage usually forces LeBlanc to give up cool tricks in favor of hitting stuff with her body; being hit with W as LeBlanc instantly snaps back leaves you unable to react. We want her trickery to have time to shine, and if she can keep a step ahead during that window, her brute force can be the coup de grace. \n\nThat&rsquo;s the plan -- double down on the deception, preserve the mobility, and make sure you have time to play too. These goals work together very nicely. To be deceived, you have to have enough time to understand what&rsquo;s happening and be wrong about it. To exist in harm&rsquo;s way for longer, LeBlanc needs a way to live, and what better way than deception? LeBlanc&rsquo;s signature double snapback serves as escape--any self-respecting mastermind keeps a little something up her sleeve--but using it means giving up her position and her kill. Even if she intends to snap back instantly, going in to poke with W/RW should give the opponent time to retaliate with an ability. A Zed-style tiny delay between W dash end and W snapback enabled is pretty likely to show up. \n\nIn doing that plan, we&rsquo;ve been mainly exploring active deception abilities for LeBlanc. If we do it right, her deception arsenal should be a versatile enough to help her team in addition to her role as an assassin. Like so many other assassins, LeBlanc is valued mainly as an unusually safe way to pick off squishy targets. We&rsquo;d like to add a dimension of strategic trickery to that. \n\nGameplay goals: \n\n* **Extend LeBlanc&rsquo;s burst window** enough that enemies can keep playing after she dashes in. She already has some of this in E, and the idea of Q implies a delay even if it&rsquo;s often popped instantly. Success here lets us preserve LeBlanc&rsquo;s powerful damage while giving her awesome in-combat deception tools--so long as opponents can react before their trip to the fountain. \n\n\n* **Give LeBlanc active deception tools.** LeBlanc&rsquo;s tricky nature has lots of opportunity for really cool plays, and while her passive is awesome it&rsquo;s also automatic and unreliable. We&rsquo;re trying things like concealing information about LeBlanc or giving false information about her to the enemy. It should also allow her to specifically make plays centered around it -- whether using it to cover herself as she assassinates a target or the threat of assassination as a bluff. \n\n\n* **Ensure LeBlanc brings unique strengths to her team.** LeBlanc should be able to use deception to keep her enemies guessing while she assassinates her target, which is something other assassins can&rsquo;t easily do--there&rsquo;s some of this on Zed and Shaco, but LeBlanc can go much further with it. A powerful and versatile deception tool would also have many uses outside teamfights, especially if the deception can occur without LeBlanc&rsquo;s presence...\n\nThat&rsquo;s where our thoughts have lead us for LeBlanc! Comments, questions and suggestions are all welcome. \n\nGood hunting,\n\n20thCenturyFaux","replies":[{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-08-10T20:44:19.273+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you planning on giving LB a makeover?

The common thread between the Talon, Rengar, and Leblanc reworks seems to be that they'll have some kind of mobility or outplay spell to compensate for the slower burst, but I'm just wondering why I would pick a Leblanc with slower burst when I can play Annie, flash obliterate someone so quickly that it's not reactable, and take objectives off of that instead.\n\nI also worry a bit that if you give their new utility/mobility/whatever too much power, you end up with champs more like Zed or Fizz who are probably perfectly balanced, but also cause a lot of frustration to people playing against them, particularly if they don't understand their intended weaknesses which may not necessarily be obvious.

At the moment it looks like LeBlanc will have a higher skill ceiling than before, and it used to be pretty damn high. This typically means the character is quite powerful at high elos, and LeBlanc was already very powerful there. That instability is one of the reasons we've got the tiny delay on W snapback. It mainly impacts high elo -- we can adjust the delay if we need to buff her at diamond+ or nerf her there or etc.  \n\nI think I understand what you mean about the clone being controllable etc, this might be a term definition thing?

Giving it, is a huge commitment, that likely will be tweaked but not removed. The thing is, wether was it when zed was really strong, or now that he is really weak, that delay always felt bad. We do understand of course that adding a delay makes things easier to balance, but when we think about WHY it makes things easier to balance (it simply removes possibilities, which in turn reduce the skill cap which in turn would makes things easier to balance, that was the main argument to add the 5 skills cap on ryze passive am I correct ?) we bounce on the idea that we do not want it.  \nLet's look at the ahri zed match up, without the delay, when ahri is ulted, she has a **lot** of possible decisions to make which she has to choose form, and zed is fully aware of that, and will try to deceive her.  \nFirst case, she ult back to tower, and count on the fact that zed will think she wants to charm under tower, to charm him at his original location  \nSecond case, she does the same, but charm behind her because she thinks zed will stay  \nThird case, she doesn't try to charm but focus on dodging shurikens with the first dash and set up the q (zed r back to dodge) into e at the original location and use second dash to reposition the return etc etc that's just few exemple but there is a tons of possible developpement for ahri there, and there is a beautifull mind game going on on \"I know that he knows I know\", and how the way you played before that influenced the way the ennemy think and so on.   \nNow look at current zed in the same match up, the only correct choice for ahri is to dash back and charm him with 100% hit chance when she is ulted. Knowing that zed just doesn't do it. that's it.   \nThere is also the fact that zed r is an ulti which isn't used often while while leblanc w is used much more often leading in much more situations that would be removed, and the fact that let's say we give 0,3 sec delay for the snapback, does that mean she can w r w instant as the delay occur during the second dash ? if yes it doesn't change the \"problem\" showcased in the exemple given. and if it's longer to account for the possible second dash, she is hyper fucked for any other use of w.  \n  \n  \nI wrote a lot more than I thought about the first part, I apologize for that not being native,  and as for your question, yes you got that right. \"We’re trying things like concealing information about LeBlanc or giving false information about her to the enemy.\" sounded to me like it would be done by the game and not the player.

Going from being able to totally negate the enemy's action to the enemy being able to cast one spell is a change you'll be able to feel, but it's absolutely necessary for the health of these characters. Awesome mindgames shouldn't come at the price of an unfair regular game.  \n\nAs you said, we can always adjust it -- if LeBlanc isn't good enough at high elo, we can reduce the delay easily. There's also the new deception tool -- whatever it will be, it's meant to help LeBlanc survive during this period and it needs to be able to do that job -- and LeBlanc's cast times will often cover up the delay anyway (contrasted to Zed's instant E) so it's unlikely to be felt as keenly as Zed's.  \n\nFor your last question, we're definitely going to give LeBlanc more ways to actively deceive her opponents ^^","replies":[{"poster":"86 Kg Rekksalot","date":"2016-08-11T00:41:42.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"> The ability to dash in for damage, then instantly snap out just isn't fair.\n\nThis is the direction, Riot is heading but I don't actually think it's true. Ofc it is really overpowered to just jump in, delete someone and jump back again, without getting damage, but for this to occur you need several conditions:\n\n1. Vision priority: You have to see your enemy and the place you are standing must be unseen.\n\n2. Items: You need to be quite fed to actually be able to oneshot someone and he needs to have no or rly few magic resistance\n\n3. Skill: You need to hit your Q+R (which is pretty easy ofc, but you usually need to do it from the edge of the range so you need a good feeling for that at least) BUT you need to hit that fucking E or you won't be able to do enough damage to oneshot someone (if you are not 10/0 but I think it's the same level of frustration to play against a 10/0 Vayne or even let's say Malph).\n\nConcluding I think it's ofc really frustrating to get oneshotted \"without no counterplay\" but for that to happen you need 1. misplay 2. have poor vision and LB has to play well.\n\nSomething else:\nWhile I like the idea that LB can maybe do something now when her spells are on cooldown for what feels like 10 seconds that she might be able to do something I think giving her Q a longer cast time would hurt not only her late and mid game teamfighting potential rly hard it would also make lasthitting in lane much harder (which it already rly is, she is already at place 46/48 champs that are played midlane in Plat+ http://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.minionsKilled&order=ascend&roleSort=Middle).\nHer identity evolves much about that fast paced playstyle of being able to punish mispositioning and misplays heavily and being able to be punished rly hard if she missteps herself. With the direction you told in this thread (W delay, Q cast time up) I fear that the focus will be too much about getting punished in even more scenarios than already now.\n\n\nWith that being sad I'm quite eager about the upcoming changes but hope you don't tweak her too much i a direction that got nothing to do with the old LB and only evolves about the new idea of \"deceiving\".

I don't have to be unseen to get free damage someone off. You can smack someone with a W and jump back before they can respond really easily. They have to throw something at me while I'm dashing, or they're getting nothing. Their window for a response is small at best. \n\nShe profits from a vision advantage as does every champion, but she is absolutely not reliant on one. This is not a realistic restriction on her ability to fight enemies without giving them adequate respond times.\n\n>Items: You need to be quite fed to actually be able to oneshot someone and he needs to have no or rly few magic resistance\n\nThe exact wording the Rioter used was \"dash in for damage\". No one said anything about one shotting. This is about trading. Leblanc can trade without getting giving enemies a realistic opportunity to trade back. If she's one shotting you, then all of this discussion about trading back doesn't matter anyway. It's a different topic.\n\n>BUT you need to hit that fucking E or you won't be able to do enough damage to oneshot someone\n\nAgain, you're focusing way too much on that \"oneshot\" idea. Leblanc doesn't have to do that. She can easily use Q and W to bully enemies and poke them down, then go for a kill.\n\nThe problem is about Leblanc's ability to negate the enemy's input in all trades, not just in oneshots. She doesn't give enemies enough time to get spells off on her. The speed of her combo is the issue.\n\n>Her identity evolves much about that fast paced playstyle of being able to punish mispositioning and misplays heavily\n\nIt still will. She'll just have to open herself up more, or use whatever new mechanic she gets to actually deceive the enemy instead of just being too fast to react to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HazyCloud7","date":"2016-08-11T04:22:33.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much of a delay are we talking?
