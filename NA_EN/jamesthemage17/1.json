So after you die (you will cuz you have bad base stats cuz sustain revive champion) you lose your dueling potential, and probably already used Q and E, so you are already dead. Q is also terrible as a spell. The knockup is almost impossible to hit, its extremely slow, the dash is small, and its so easy to interupt.  E is fine, though magic damage only helps early. \nW heal is fine. W damage is fine. R is also a major issue. Damage it does is a joke. Range is amazing. AS is great. Problem is, you dont wanna use it until after you apply passive, since after you die, u lose bloodwell and so become useless. \nWanna see a buff? Q is now 700 range (from 600) and is now way faster when target is close by (like soraka's Q) Knockup increases area depending on distance traveled. \nAfter dying, bloodwell will only empty after 3 seconds of being out of combat. Ulti is not lost if passive procs. W stacks remain after bloodwell is procced. \nThey can buff him. He's not in a state that any buff would make him best in class. If he was, we would have seen him once in the 3 years he was released and nerfed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Teslium","date":"2016-08-07T09:30:15.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest he needs quality of life changes more than anything. They need to make his passive not to reset his W stacks when taking fatal damage, his W wind up needs to be faster, and his W needs to function properly with guinsoo's","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Huudi","date":"2016-08-07T01:30:13.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hopping onto this for a pet peeve: how does riven fit into these considerations?

Let's babyrage. But anyways, I don't feel she needs nerfs at all, she is still Riven, useless when behind, carry and force to reckon with when ahead. You are saying she is oppressive when she gets a lead. Which is true. But you're fighting a Riven or staying in her lane 1v1. Group up, focus her down, cc her. The way she enters fights is awkward, she's all melee, but she builds full AD save 1-2 defensive items past her core. I would recommend, playing her. Just for a few games or so. Find her weaknesses and abuse them heavily.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-08-06T22:31:35.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"On that note, any insights on Nasus and Garen?
