However, when I do so, it only allows me to edit the top of my post. I can't scroll down in it. It's just a small box with the top of the post and nothing else.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T04:28:26.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah I see!\n\nThe editing textbox is not one that has the ability to scroll at all. To \"scroll down\" you can use the down arrow key to get to the bottom of this issue.

You _can _ scroll when you're on one, though.
