I really like it, and I want to know if it&#039;s gonna be gutted or changed or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-23T21:29:42.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure I remember them saying that q will be staying single target, and that they would give a small amount of lockout before being able to blink back with w (kinda like zed ult). I think the damage may be reduced in order to increase the amount of time she needs to deal assassinate, but no idea what everything will look like as of yet.","replies":[]}]}
