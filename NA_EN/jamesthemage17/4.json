She is sort of a {{champion:7}} but less of an assassin and has more utility.\r\nIn short, she is an all-around.\r\n\r\nBasic Info:\r\n\r\nPrimary and Secondary Roles: Support/Mage\r\nAttack Range: 550\r\nMovement Speed: 325\r\nHealth: 497-1406\r\nMana: 305-800\r\n\r\nChampion Matrix:\r\n\r\nDAMAGE: 1/3\r\nUTILITY: 3/3\r\nMOBILITY: 1/3\r\nDEFENSE: 1/3\r\nCROWD CONTROL: 3/3\r\n\r\n**Passive: Magicians Secret**\r\n\r\n1 second after casting a basic ability, Stella activates the area around where she casted the ability. Upon activation, enemies are debuted and have their armor and magic resistance lowered by 6(+1/level). This area lasts 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nFor clarification, the debuff ranks up to 24. At level 1, it is 7 (since it gets 1 per level) and at level 18 it is 24. I don&#039;t normally do this but I wanted this to be clear as possible.\r\n\r\n**Q: Hat Trick**\r\n\r\n**Cooldown: 14/13.5/13/12.5/12\r\n**Mana: 65/70/75/80/85**\r\n\r\nStella tosses her hat in the air. When it lands (1 second later) her and nearby allies become invisible for 2.5/2.75/3/3.25/3.5 seconds. Upon breaking invisibility with an attack, the attack will deal 20/35/50/65/80 (+30% AP) bonus magic damage.\r\n\r\n**W: Sleight of Hand**\r\n\r\n**Cooldown: 22/20/18/16/14**\r\n**Mana: 60/70/80/90/100\r\n\r\nStella causes confusion to enemies at a location. Confused enemies:\r\n-Have massively reduced sight range (reduced to 600/575/550/525/500)\r\n-Have a 45/50/55/60/65% chance to miss their attacks\r\n\r\nThe duration of the confusion is 1.8 seconds. Enemies confused take 55/80/105/130/155 (+40% AP) magic damage over the duration.\r\n\r\n**E: Magical Touch**\r\n\r\n**Cooldown: 13/12/11/10/9**\r\n**Mana: 0**\r\n\r\nPassive: Stella and her nearby allies gain 6/7/8/9/10 experience whenever they use an ability on an enemy champion. This cannot occur more than twice every 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nActive: Stella sends a bolt of magic at an enemy champion, taking 12/14/16/18/20% of their current mana. The bolt then bounces back to her, restoring the mana to her and her nearby allies.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy does not use mana, **Magicians Secret** is immediately cast in the area instead of having a 1 second delay.\r\n\r\n**R: Rabbit Sabotage**\r\n\r\n**Cooldown: 85/75/65**\r\n**Mana: 120/130/140**\r\n\r\nStella summons a fake rabbit to dash to an area, then immediately dissapear.\r\nWhen the rabbit dissapears, all enemy champions near it have their ability cooldowns increased by 2.5/3/3.5 seconds.\r\nEnemy ultimates take 1.5x effect from this skill.\r\n\r\nGive me your thoughts!","replies":[{"poster":"Evêñtfûl Hôrïzôñ","date":"2017-03-13T00:02:14.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great concept! I'd love to see a support who focuses on debuffs rather than buffs and crowd control in League. I think the invisibility would have to be toned down a bit though, since a team-wide stealth that lasts 2.5-3.5 seconds is a bit strong. Also, I think it would be interesting if the active ability from Stella's **E - Magical Touch** scaled with her mana or AP.\n\nYou should write lore for her. xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Dreamwalker","date":"2017-03-14T16:58:17.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like this champion.

I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to just give my quick two cents on it - They're just ideas, you dont have to read them if you dont want to :)\n\n**Passive:** It is unique in it's debuff, perhaps a little on the weaker side. Because reducing base armour and magic resist is a bit finnicky due to every enemy champion having different armour and magic resist, maybe make it a % factor instead. So say it was something like: **4% + 0.25% per level, up to a maximum of 8.5% reduction**. This would allow for more diversity in it. Or perhaps a flat amount *accompanied by* a percentage amount. For example: **Reducing enemy armour and magic resist by 5 (+0.25 per level) plus 7.5% of their maximum armour and magic resist.** Just for a thought!\n\n**First Ability:** I honestly love everything about this ability! I would put some thought into whether to make it *Invisibility* or *Camouflage*, but either way I think it'll be a great idea. Perhaps: If out-of-combat, becomes *camouflage* and increases the invisibility duration by double. If in combat, becomes *invisibility* and keeps the invisibility at a normal time frame. \n\n**Second Ability:** I must say I like where the concept for this ability was at, but it is a bit finnicky. Riot decided to try remove % Chance for most things that they could except for Critical Strikes, so adding a *% To Hit* ability might not go over well. Just something to consider there, otherwise I like it!\n\n**Third Ability:** Stealing a resource has always been a bit hit-or-miss in champion designs as everyone has a different resource. I do see you tried to compensate for it there, but what about the allies that don't use mana as well? Just another idea: **Stella applies a mark to an enemy champion for 5 seconds. If an allied champion uses an auto-attack against the marked target, they restore a % of their resource bar while destroying a % of the enemy's resource bar.** Then the mark would work with your Q's auto attack damage increase. Its a bit hard to work with resources, so points to you for giving it a shot!\n\n**Ultimate Ability:** I do like this ability a lot! It is a great debuff and completely unique - nice work!\n\nThese were just suggestions on my two cents, feel free to use it however you like! I'm glad you got feedback form the community on your creation; so many don't ever get feedback on their creations so I hope you are as successful in any further creations!

Happy creating, and good luck! (+1)\n\nI love reading the comments on my concepts.\n\nSo, I was actually considering putting that into her E. But I figured it would be too confusing and decided to add the instant passive instead.\nI also figured that nobody would like the % chance on her W. But I thought it was unique. After all, the whole point of me making this concept was for her to be unique.\nThanks for the comment!","replies":[{"poster":"lCantPauseltMom","date":"2017-03-14T05:31:50.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you didn't mind giving it a read, and your champion concept as is was  really good! Either way, your concept is yours and don't feel bad about standing your ground and defending your ideas if you feel it's right.

The area would appear where you first activated the Q a second later. It would not follow you. Also, how are you relating this to brand?\nQ: +80 damage on jhins fourth shot is nothing. Also, unless you build full ap with a bunch of {{item:3089}}, 40% ap is nothing since you're a support.\nW: not really. Quinn completely makes them blind. This just reduces their sight range by a number of units.\nE: in urf, nobody can lose mana, so there. This ability doesn't do any damage.\nR: how is it broken? It pushes cooldowns back by 2-3 seconds. That's a less-powerful version of silence. Plus, that's all this ability does. It doesn't do damage or have any other effects. So no it's not broken.","replies":[]}]}]}
