There&#039;s no outplay to it. The throwback range is much larger than flash, making flash useless against it, and since you&#039;re definitely gonna be slowed, heals movement burst isn&#039;t very useful either. \r\nI have an idea to put a stop to this BS. Instead of throwing an enemy far back, make them go directly behind him, so they actually have a shot at escaping.\r\nThis should definitely fix him.
