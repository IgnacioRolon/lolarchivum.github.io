However, there seems to be an additional... division I guess? I am in Warwicks Berserkers, while my friend is in Fizz's something. I was wondering what these all mean and how they compare with one another. I looked on google briefly for an answer but no one has seemed to talk about this. any answers would be appreciated. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T00:21:21.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those divisions are mostly arbitrary, but they're meant to help divide people up into smaller groups than everyone being lumped together in SIlver 4. With this system, it helps you view your own progress against others. As far as which division you get placed in, the system tries to place you into the same division as your friends but it's definitely not quite perfect.","replies":[{"poster":"Double Edge28","date":"2017-07-17T01:15:34.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are the divisions in an order?
