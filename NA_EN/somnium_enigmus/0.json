But yeah ~  My account meets the restriction levels of the roleplay section but can't post.\r\n\r\nI'll take a peek after I post this and see if that's changed.. If not -- guess I wait and see..?  Unless someone else has any other ideas.

Check it on the Roleplay sub-board and let me know if you still have issues.","replies":[]}]}
