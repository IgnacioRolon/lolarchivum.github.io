On my previously used build, my gameplay would average at about 120fps at max settings in a borderless window. But ever since the upgrade, my game would average at a lower FPS of less than 100 and go down to 40 FPS and become stagnant.\r\n\r\nI don't know what's wrong with these recent updates. It could be Windows 10 updates, possibly. But as far as I can tell, it can't be my hardware. Considering that my PC had once struggled to run Battlefield 1 but can now run it at a smooth 60 FPS, while LoL suffers from a reverse effect of this upgrade, it's truly an inconvenience when this happens. And for the love of god, DO NOT tell me it's the Xbox app's \"Game DVR\", because this has helped no one that is dealing with the same issues as I am. I have update all drivers of my hardware to the latest firmware they can be.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T23:30:55.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sounds like you've gone through a lot of steps, so it's a bummer your fps is still having issues.
