Then, purchased champion tokens to reroll into a Zyra. I told them the scenario and asked if they could refund my IP and get rid of the Zyra. Through experience, do you think they will refund it. Furthermore, how long does it usually take for them to respond after they responded to my ticket. Also, I am a bit confused about what it means when he tells me to sign out of my League Support account. How am I supposed to contact them? The following is my reply I got from Riot about being griefed after my account was linked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hey shawnpan510,\r\n\r\nI'm PapaBear. A.K.A Volibear's Bear Jitsu Trainer. A.K.A Ferocious, Fierce, Fluffy Support Agent.\r\n\r\nI will be more than happy to help you out! In order to continue, I just need you to sign out of our League Support site.\r\n\r\nAlso, Would you mind sending me an alternate email address that you have access to (that is not associated with a League account)? Once you send in your alternate email address, I will create a new ticket for ya and we can help you get back on track!\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing back from you!\r\n\r\nPapaBear\r\nPlayer Support\r\nUrsine Commander\r\n\r\n\"The thunder calls\"","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T00:37:20.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First things first, once we can verify that you were the account creator and can see the signs of your account being hacked we can absolutely fix all the damage they did like reversing that Zyra reroll!\n\nFirst, we'll need you to submit a new ticket while **NOT** signed into your account. It sounds a little counter-intuitive, but we need you to not be logged in so that we can properly verify you. If the hacker already has access to your account, they would have an easier time answering the questions while signed in. Go ahead and submit a new [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) by picking \"I need help recovering my account\" and make sure to sign out if you're still logged in on our support website.","replies":[{"poster":"shawnpan510","date":"2017-08-04T00:47:23.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you BROPORO! So, I followed the instructions and sent via my EMAIL an alternative EMAIL address to PAPABEAR. It has been a day and I have not gotten an email from the supporter. I have also logged out of my account from the support page. I have not gotten a response from him yet, so I am curious about whether he has already created a ticket with my alternative email address. Should I just follow your advice and just create a ticket by picking the \"I need help recovering my account\" or should I wait for the support.","replies":[]}]}]}
