I couldn't get back into the game without restarting my pc which is pretty common for busplats at least for me. However the game had already ended when I got back onto the client. My team had finished in 4 minutes after I left because we were so ahead. So I just closed the client and assumed that I obviously got the LP for that game and headed to bed. However, today when I open the client I get a message that I was placed into low prio queue for afking. Granted I had gotten placed into low prio queue a few days prior for completely legitimate reasons (I afked for 2 games), so my account was more prone to getting placed there. I check my profile and I see that I'm now at 0lp. I'm pretty sure that before I played the bugsplat game I was actually at 17lp so the game had actually counted as a loss even though it showed as a victory in my match history. \r\n\r\nAfter sitting through 20mins of low prio queue I get into a game which we end up losing. What was the most surprising and honestly absolutely bullshit was that I actually got demoted for this game. I had won 65% of my past 20 games which meant my mmr was probably higher than usual. I don't know if im right but as far as i've been told whether you get demoted or not for losing a game at 0lp depends on your mmr. If it's high enough you can easily lose 3 games at 0lp without getting demoted. So in addition to losing 17lp for a victory, I apparently lost a lot of mmr and ended up getting demoted the game after. \r\n\r\nI acknowledge that I'm quite a toxic player and maybe the second low prio queue was even justified but I just think losing LP for a game I had already won and getting demoted just because of it is absolute bullshit. All this because of thing that is not even my fault. I'd like to assume the client can tell I got bugsplatted and didn't actually leave the game myself. What is the fucking point of punishing someone for something that is clearly riots fault? I know this probably sounds like a tilted toxic player crying about how he got punished but whatever.\r\n\r\n**TLDR**\r\n\r\n**Bugsplatted in a game we won and lost LP for it which put me at 0. Played a game after it and got instantly demoted even though my mmr was higher than usual since I had won 65% of my past 20 games and just came off of a 6 game win streak. [My OP.GG](http://eune.op.gg/summoner/userName=Mitanoo) The bugsplat game is the one I went 8/1/2 in. ** Why do I get punished this hard for something that actually didn't even end up having any impact in the game and wasn't even my fault to begin with? {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T00:18:46.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks to have a bugsplat, but especially so during ranked games. Bugsplats aren't exactly something you did on purpose, but they still leave an effect on the game since your team had to 4v5 without you. If there weren't any punishments for leaving your team, it'd be a lot more rampant of a problem that's for sure. Since the bugsplatted game brought you down to 0 LP, that next loss made you demote because you were already at 0 which is normal.","replies":[]}]}
