When you mentioned that you get into games 5 min late, that tells me the other summoners are already in the game which means that the server isn't having issues. \n\nLet's be sure to cover all our bases with this [**guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).

This happens as my Wi-Fi does have MASSIVE ping spikes every now and then. However these recent times in 7.7/7.8 have been different. \n\nhttps://www.google.at/search?tbs=sbi:AMhZZiueQz6_10tHBgF0IwNx_1nlPBz8UOIlftlYpQCFNp7yb7QRT6qg46nDRh2ecGoOM_15Mn5Eb0RlcwPrwai5R9xPEkCgxAUIBXSvjfDbCIZT5AhXAJRDSeV6LlUdoU4ceM0cOh9H1OWYcMwT7oE6i0noDTLSv2IOZ2Gi0yaIwjEJC-EFGbVdaXZ0a7h7oq_18H9MX4j7Gd7Y-lQa_15qk7-RfehQRzr6x9WPkLkFhwwbwTI_13EgepDbWx9EdHrB3bZvZNw4X9ByYI-bAuujjKIm-k6HRvug3L2FdT3C2x-KDKPSWMgF-vNbwTdJbPNpc2PjUX2WeSXmFzpXFugLBrkt3-lTSKKzIuJhqkUj7u0KGR5HdtlzMZxspdiqB1fjOwJdO5qpesytHKRCzUYcSUEcP3E3uZuS8iMNjtDIkGmI4I2j9U0HbeJWpYgk_1mW0_1Y_1l-0CxF57V8IgjCappkpZg3dkZjeP2wx3TQ137w0tYvGuP-FyLXpXuNrR3md0Ijve8laHe5bGqbHbGfMqg1PuKp2nRhy3TGMGROWg2rSQB8z5RoYDWyeCAQIlLLRMtxkZw0biEohdTC_1ovLKvVXAi2JkSL6PQ415ggMhXTi-piGparEw-iFEoWS7NlCF0Z3Z2M4prPfIv1lHAreUkj0xW2aqOxampfClvHHl3uTsHQhHT34p1pSyaVGaC2H2rdLbYbqINC3a4leeL4iAYt1sYofBDVSgxydzmuJ68Sl2pq2rllf4xqR5T8xRLi4PbiOEcn-2g-N1EuJrN0xCtwbvnTLIQ9IAIFgeKJCMuvM70TTL7hcJmnPdn0Ep2AG4YPquwtau7KO-b_1_1fis6MoIxPefap0O_1TNORZj-jDpXiP6fp52kX92hL70CZcfL_14_1el74B_1BXVJffSpcyU2rbbRUbreZCTrr5muK5lyB7TfZofyBiz_1x85FQTcztGonKhrhkX7yO83cL7HRTrHbnqFsVt1Fvpp-9eY5nmNtZEC5umgO_1e-4dvhnUS55GUIJmbUMvWQLVTJtp7-qcb_1ruspXGQrAqFNxz684vxmlrQ7KXvLGFW6I3hnkFchJOKiGdMxDOCvVpfK2XzWY140KZTuSFrJ8AhtdQ-QKwgMtbzDGtPxS-hjhLFYsY7nJOgLBnQPm4i3SVm_1-iYnwOtCCU-hwhWSwzVjy2rrXY53j1YwEOwLZ6vpmPAZEx2HBRd3TEQ49sQGWItdnxERcpcx4FTILUE2nFLRQ1rhdW_1uXcoZofyUbE-sEC3U70Y8253bDR2NhNktafdlUAIAjJV4NVv6thvooICQ4r2OfOr1O3j2RG7ecPbjiIwB6vduau3yy3LFZ8PWKVDQSefxQEtgTOldGKB28DAHB-eoyT_1K5sBiy8etAQyKYrE42UgcDVY_1Z6_1SwhiL5mx0DK3E06BbV2P3Cd5JmOKBcsAvdiVpu-AZYr88xl7UmhgXe8SmKelcdkNlBLLgW2aZ_1j-5f9nWSbwJQDnuzlhMSZFW9pgtVVxv_1NhcOwRetuYd2ch_1zHUuNChX9JgOwR_1rojd_1WQOqPeIoqib4RqryDT09SPD5m06w37f0qFvc8pLWKKv3SnEu46NQL5jBxmdg3TS98iDJffqdBuTjL2apshnzS0cNyxJ7M0uVZf1LkYYyn3_1rS2xGgp_1IwiY1Lh_1t1trnHJkXwZGuzrHcvSQV4N4bWr_164IGoU9-ntCT9_1AyNrwn4ATasSfYqgbZ6TcGhF-TPP84UFoO75UxFB9eqg2wBNv03HzL5hm23qxPyBBaFNp1f0&hl=en-AT\n\nThis is a link (sorry its super long im terrible with computers xD) to how it looks like everytime I try to get in the game. \n\nIf you can't see the image this is a description. -> Everything has loaded perfectly for the \"you have left the game blah blah blah reconnect.\" I've loged on chat services and I can chat to my friends and clubs. However! The reconnect button is grey and I can't press on it, therefore I can't reconnect.\n\nThis is what has been happening and surprsingly when I play with my brother, (in the same house with same wifi and stuff), he doesn't recieve this and can reconnect perfectly. \n\nI was wondering if you could help me out.
