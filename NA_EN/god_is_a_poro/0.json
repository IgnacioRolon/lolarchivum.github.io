As a mid/top I will just farm and roam. If my team doesn&#039;t want to respond to it then tax and leave. If my team doesn&#039;t want to cooperate or group until it&#039;s too late, I guess I will just split the whole game.  \n\nI am pretty done coordinating with my teammates at this point but hey at least I didn&#039;t tell anyone that they are bad, what to do, or call them dumb. I don&#039;t care about the honor level or the rewards at the end. I will still be trying to win if they want to report me for not wanting to group IDEK. SOLO QUEUE. If they want to flame me in the chat that is their choice, but I won't see it or respond to it. \n\nAs for champ select, I will look up each player on my team to determine what I will pick. If they aren&#039;t playing their best, I guess it would be a good time to play something else for me too. Autofilled? NP I will get some practice on some weird champ that I saw on youtube. I am trying to win tho and will do my best! If my best isn&#039;t enough then oops. \n\nI must adapt to the situation instead of talking in chat. aka doing my own thing and they can do theirs. Not ruining my WR&#039;s on my main champs and picking something else that isn&#039;t a troll pick, but didn&#039;t fully master (I&#039;ll still be trying) is a good way for me to learn new champs and not get so annoyed in games. \n\n If someone wants to troll me or run it down I guess I&#039;ll just do the same exact thing as above and farm til we FF unless everyone wants to try. If I lose I lose if I win I win, but at least I am not flaming ppl on an online game.\n\nMaybe I should even get one of those copy pasted things for champ select to give people a chance to dodge if they don&#039;t like my play style or want to play with me. \n\nCan&#039;t wait to raise my 31% Ezreal WR. (I don&#039;t int btw, just unlucky/bad.) I've also seen faker play some interesting things that I've wanted to try out.\n\nSee you guys on the rift!\n\nUnless I am mistaken I am not breaking any rules. Correct me if I am wrong.\n\nEdit: My end goal is to play by Riots rules and not flame/troll my team, but since I cannot control or trust them I would need to do it in my own way.\nI'd also like to point out that I don't have a problem with being toxic or flaming and I don't exactly care if I hurt someone's feelings by saying that they are bad or stop ganking my lane you died to them 3x already and leeched xp. I feel like flaming is a normal part of an MMO and I always liked getting bitched out because then I knew what I could improve on. If I get mad and hold it in it just makes my depression worse after the match when I could have stood up for what was on my brain or flame someone intentionally trolling. I MOSTLY want to have fun and not get banned again.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-01T02:30:51.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"That will make you a liability to your team, impact your winrate, and if certain not-totally-reliable stories are to be believed, just get you banned again eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"God is a Poro","date":"2018-07-01T02:34:50.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Ta2WuvP4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-01T02:30:51.242+0000)\n>\n> That will make you a liability to your team, impact your winrate, and if certain not-totally-reliable stories are to be believed, just get you banned again eventually.\n\nI'm not breaking any rules tho? I don't have to do what my team wants and I muted all like riot suggests if I can't stop myself from flaming or spam pinging back. I don't really care about my overall winrate anymore, I just need to play my OTP and climb back when I feel like playing her again. If I don't I can just stomp on a smurf or something until I feel like playing her again.

I am not judging you, just saying that you might get banned for that.","replies":[{"poster":"God is a Poro","date":"2018-07-01T03:01:11.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Garen Main,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Ta2WuvP4,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-01T02:59:09.556+0000)\n>\n> Well, not playing according to your team&#x27;s plan can be seen as gamethrowing.

In my mind, since I can't trust or rely on them I need to split and force something else. If I die my team can get baron or something, if not then well I gave it my best shot!\n\nThank you for your input!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
