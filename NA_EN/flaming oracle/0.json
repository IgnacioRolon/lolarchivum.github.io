Until you own your elo, you won't improve. There is no elo hell - if there was, all the high level players that do bronze-to-diamond runs would be stuck in bronze for weeks. But they're not, they cruise through them. The only reason you're at your elo is YOU. Own it. Figure out what it is you're doing that could be done better, and work on it. If you belong in a higher elo, you WILL get there. Only thing holding you out of gold is attitude and time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QuickshotGGEZ","date":"2014-10-27T03:58:54.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Proper English on your list anywhere?","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Oracle","date":"2014-10-28T02:37:37.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for been born in Quebec.

This game I rushed the Morello and Mobility boots because I was facing a Janna and my ADC was pretty terrible so the mobility boots helped me land almost all my combos.  I didn't go pure damage because I was still trying to feed my team instead of taking kills, but most of the time I ended up getting it anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xDingwithsalad","date":"2014-10-27T06:19:48.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wow most damage as support zyra, i am so impressed. play better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"m3sm3r","date":"2014-10-27T17:00:30.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need 4 things to get out of silver - \n\na) a champ or two you are REALLY familiar\nb) win in lane with decent cs\nc) once you push down your tower, help other lanes push tower\nd) stick with adc and make sure you peel \n\nremember, once your lane is done then you shouldn't go and do wraiths or have a campout in the jungle.
