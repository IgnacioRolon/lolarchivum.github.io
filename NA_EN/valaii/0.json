I play alot of Mundo - mostly the Mundo Mundo skin and my last hitting is mostly on point. The other day i decided to switch to the Executioner Mundo skin and I happen to noticed what seemed like a slight delay in his auto attacking. When I would normally go in for a kill during laning - it seems like mundo, with that skin, would take a fraction of a second longer to &#039;connect&#039; with the minion - resulting in a misfire. \r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents. {{champion:36}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-06T00:31:35.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya Valaii,\n\nThanks for the report!
