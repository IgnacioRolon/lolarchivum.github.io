People don't realize that this game is free, and they still rage and say, \"this game sucks!\" Sometimes I find myself saying, \"man this champ really hurts.\" However, I would never bash this company for developing, designing, and producing a game that can bring people together and talk about something other than real world issues. Your company is an escape for most people. Me, in particular, I've served in the military, I'm currently back in college, I've got bills to pay, things that can really be a stress on some people. I just appreciate that this FREE game is able to take me into a place of serenity, competition, and ultimately... Fun. \r\n\r\nSo for that, cheers to you Riot. My utmost thanks.","replies":[]}
