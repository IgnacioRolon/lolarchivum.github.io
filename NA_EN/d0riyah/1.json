I just wanted to share my balancing ideas. Note: I am not good with the numbers part of things, so if I mention a numbers change take it with a box of salt.\r\n**Numbers Changes:**\r\nA main part of why Morde is broken is obviously because his numbers are too high. Ideas for basic number changes are:\r\nReduce passive damage some more \r\nReduce E magic pen\r\nIncrease cooldowns on Q or R or something\r\nDecrease the shield amount, and reduce the amount of charge you get when attacking/getting hurt.\r\nDecrease the amount of stats Morde steals during ult, or maybe make it scale on level so it's not 10% at level 1.\r\n**Ability Changes:**\r\nThis is dodgy to play around with on the first week of release but I had a few ideas.\r\nChange the passive from 3 hits to proc up to 4 hits to proc. As soon as you hit an E you basically have instant passive which means the enemy is in a really tight spot already, especially considering how much damage the E-Q-Auto combo does. Increasing the passive proc amount up to 4 or maybe 5 makes it less easy to obliterate opponents in seconds. \r\nChange the E hitbox to be smaller. This is my least favorite option but I considered it for a second. The E already has a long cooldown and the delay between cast and the pull is kind of generous. However the thing is just too long to really escape in most situations, so maybe making it shorter could balance him.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-17T07:09:17.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah and remove the isolation damage on his Q, double the cast time, remove his nashors passive, make his attack speed not be able to grow, make his move speed be 300 and remove hp by level scaling entirely, and lastly let the player walk out of death realm if they go to the edge of it then he will be balanced","replies":[]},{"poster":"EthreainAmbusher","date":"2019-06-17T04:14:40.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just dropping in to say hi","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-06-17T12:15:17.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, revert him.","replies":[]}]}
