Or maybe one ward every 10 minutes of the game. Even after pinging or asking for it they usually say that it isn&#039;t important. \r\n\r\nAs I normally main support I know this is a #1 to helping bot lane make sure we don&#039;t get constantly rammed by mid lane and JNG, it&#039;s also important for winning the game.\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t be writing this if it wasn&#039;t a problem. But it is.. I&#039;ve played ADC too many times to see how some supports play.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t meant to be a mean post but I&#039;m actually hoping that people read this and start to look more into it. \r\n\r\n{{champion:497}}","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-08-23T09:25:22.093+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should change the target audience from supports to anyone who plays.  Everyone can buy control wards.  Junglers can sacrifice smite upgrade for a mini sightstone.  Everyone gets free wards in their trinkets yet you often see people sitting on 2 wards.  It isn't just the support's job.  There should always be 5 control wards on the map, not just 1 or maybe 2 from the jungler getting one.","replies":[{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2017-08-23T09:27:42.384+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"True.

Everyone can buy a {{item:2055}} and everyone should be, that includes you. If you cant understand that and would rather force the misconception that the only wards from your team should be coming from the support then you have no place in high elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2017-08-23T10:54:48.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Annie Lolicon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3X6E06uE,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-08-23T10:17:11.302+0000)\n>\n> I hope you know why this is being downvoted.\n> \n> \n> \n> 2) you are trying to enforce a sight meta that punishes supports for their preformance based on warding.\n> \n> \n\nRiot was doing this way before this guy ever did","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2017-08-23T10:24:53.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are people in this comment section saying it is everyone's job to ward but when I post something that says supports aren't the team's ward dog and everyone has trinkets and can get control wards I'm getting downvoted to oblivion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-23T10:02:55.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I am playing support and you are my adc and we have both enemies half health with us full and I go to clear a control ward, please come with me instead of going back to turret -.-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2017-08-23T09:16:16.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who come in here and read this, usually have enough intelligence to already know it.

You as an adc are NEVER going to buy this. But I see TONS of supports who don't buy this item and say it's un-needed.\n\nPeople down-voting are either mad about the truth or they're mad for some reason.
