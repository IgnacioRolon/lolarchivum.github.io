That's honestly disgusting and shows where Riots priorities are, and I want help to either transfer the RP to another account, or have the ability to gift me friends so they don't have to wait....  The fact that I cant talk to my friends because I'm banned is r%%%%%ed in itself.  I'm already banned from playing, now restrict my friends as well.  And restrict gifting too?  It's a load of bull.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-10T03:57:56.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason as to why you [**can't send gifts from a banned or suspended account**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752964) is due to the fact that the ban that's been put in place needs to hold it's weight.
