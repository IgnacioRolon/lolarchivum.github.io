WHINING IN CHAT CAN GET YOU PERMA BANNED&quot;\r\n\r\nand if i am aware of that. then i will stop whining in chat.\r\n\r\n4) so riot. please speak with people in your banning department and try to get a clear absolute informative answer on what type of chat can lead to a player being perma banned. and im asking for ANY AND ALL situations\r\n\r\nif &quot;whining in chat&quot; cant get you perma banned on a first strike, but it CAN get you perma banned with 3 strikes of &quot;whining in chat&quot;, then that is VERY VERY IMPORTANT IMFORMATION and i need to know about it. because that essentially means that YES, whining in chat CAN AND WILL GET YOU PERMA BANNED if you keep doing it\r\n\r\n\r\n5) all i want is ANSWERS. i dont care about my 2-day ban, however i desperately want to know what CAN ACTUALLY get my account perma-banned, so i can know to NEVER-DO those actions\r\n\r\n6) so riot please please tell me what i did that caused me to deserve my 2day ban. explain to me what i did that is apparently &quot;bannable&quot;, so i can know what to stop doing to prevent future bans. \r\n\r\nbecause i am assuming, that ii something can get me a 2day ban, then it probably can get me a perma-ban too. and right now, i really am starting to believe that i received my 2day ban due to &quot;whining in chat&quot; (which to this day, i assumed you could never get perma-banned for simply whining in chat)\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\r\ni recently got a 25 game chat restriction for &quot;toxicity&quot;\r\n\r\ni looked at the chat logs given to me and i couldnt even find anything toxic in there.... i was just complaining saying  &quot;jeeze why do i get a int feeder on my team&quot; and things like that. and i was saying that when my jungler would LITERALLY run into my lane and int-feed my enemy toplaner\r\n\r\nam i not allowed to whine about my jungler int-feeding when that is LITERALLY what hes doing????????????\r\n\r\nfirst i have a question to riot.  is it really toxic and bannable for me to say that? \r\n\r\nbecause from all things i have learned so far from the banning system, i thought that no, it is not &quot;wrong and bannable&quot; to say those things. all im doing is complaining and whining about my team, and while it may be annoying, im not swearing to saying racist insults or anything.... all im doing is &quot;whining&quot;\r\n\r\nif riot literally comes out and SAYS that &quot;yes, whining is bannable&quot; then fine, i will accept that and i will stop whining in chat\r\n\r\nhowever, up until today, i literally have assumed that &quot;whining in chat&quot; is okay and acceptable, and while annoying it is not &quot;toxic and bannable&quot;. i thought only offensive comments, racist comments, etc, were bannable. So if riot actually comes out and says &quot;whining in chat is indeed bannable&quot; then OKAY GREAT, i will take this new knowledge and i will accept it, and i will stop &quot;whining in chat&quot; because i do not want my account to be banned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALSO RIOT THE ACCOUNT IM TALKING ABOUT IS NOT MSATIE\r\n\r\nthe account that was banned for 2days is  KAOKENTAKE\r\n\r\nriot. please look into KAOKENTAKE and inform me what that account did that caused it to deserve its 2day ban\r\n\r\nalso. i just finished 25 games of chat restriction. and i basically havnt typed much at all in those 25 games of chat restriction. ive basically been typing near-nothing in all my 25 games of chat restriction and the 3-4 games i had after the chat restriction. so honestly, i am perplexed riot, what did i do in those 29 games to deserve a 2day ban?\r\n\r\n or was i somehow banned for those whining-games that i already got a chat restriction for?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-10-21T18:26:27.039+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't do 2 day bans.

Riot Support still consists of human beings, so they are not instantaneous like an automated system. It can take hours to a few days before you receive a response, so please keep that in mind when waiting.\n\nYou won't get a genuine answer on the boards.
