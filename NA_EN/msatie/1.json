MAYBEEEEEEEEEEEE this build is really bad? but damn. it sure feels strong when i do it","replies":[{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2016-09-20T02:48:31.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are actually building Runaan's on Vayne with this build now. Why? Because each bolt procs the lifesteal effect, essentially tripling the lifesteal you buy.\n\nI'm a Twitch main, and I know how to play his lane phase, and I would never build this same build on him. Ghostblade, Runaan's, IE, then maybe lifesteal if I'm ahead and don't need damage, and I always run Fervor on him. Why? Because with any less, he doesn't do enough damage in fights. Vayne's W lets her deal damage without needing to build it too much, so she can get away with a lifesteal heavy build. Twitch really can't, his passive is a tiny amount of true damage and his E doesn't do very much in teamfights, it's mostly used to assassinate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViiLLAiN","date":"2016-09-20T02:37:42.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just lost a 7-3 game as varus because my mid top and jungle all fed...
