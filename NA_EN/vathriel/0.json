I'm on the mac client, and this wasn't an issue until today. I've only tried this on the NA server but I've seen a few other posts about it. I've tried many things to fix it as well. It should be noted my friend was in the match and said he couldn't remake because it counted me in the match the whole time, which is probably why I couldn't reconnect as well. \n\nUpdate: A friend was just trying to queue into a match but had previously been spectating. While attempting to queue it said they were still spectating another match and the queue dropped basically saying he had dodged. Not sure if it's related figured I'd bring it up.\n\nUpdate 2: Tried to queue into another game, got through queue, got the black screen of non-responsiveness again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T21:16:33.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you start into the champion loading screen, your network needs to keep a stable connection with the game server or it can sometimes cause these blank black screens.
