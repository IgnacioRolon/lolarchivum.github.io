I don't know how to check my level much less how to level up to 12 so I guess I will start a new post.\r\n\r\nI started playing League this season. Lot of fun, really got into it. I felt like I was constantly disadvantaged with my runes in the early days so, once I got to level 30 and had the IP to get a bunch of level 30 runes, I also bought two packages of rune pages using RP. I don't remember what that cost me but it was somewhere between $50 and $100 for both.\r\n\r\nI did this ONLY because it was a long-term investment. I enjoyed the game and wanted to keep playing and felt I was at a competitive disadvantage because my runes were never right. Now, the new system will allow me to edit these in the lobby. That's great, it is a big improvement conceptually from the current system. BUT, it also means my money on those rune pages is wasted.\r\n\r\nI've spent a lot of money with Riot on this game in a short period of time. If there is not a refund for this I am going to be really soured. That is bad business, to charge a super premium for these pages and then remove the need for them. I am happy to keep spending money with Riot in the future, but only if I know they are not going to screw me over like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Stargaz3r","date":"2017-07-21T23:55:46.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the rune pages are valueless in the design of the new system. They only are useful in the current system where you cannot set your runes in real-time in the lobby. Being able to set them in the lobby, I do not need these horribly expensive rune pages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-21T18:25:34.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our devs just made a [post ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/RlNQkO39-buying-runes-between-now-and-preseason)about this the other day!  Currently, any runes purchased since May 30th will be refunded.  Per the post, Rune Pages are also expected to carry over with the new system as well so it's still good to have them.  If you have any feedback, though, be sure to let the devs know in that post.
