For Trist its a fact that her kit is highly un'workable since immobile yet super blast marksmen like Jhin are menances to everyone(Plus Trist's W doesnt exactly safety window herself from a ability like an Ashe's ultimate even when Trist is already 'in flight and about to land on the ground yet still somehow get hit from her original spot, nor does her kit contain much in the form of CC or powerful damage and her damage is only gonna thrive thru corpse bombing targets or rapid fire them down like crazy).\n\nMy 'technical' last champ i bought was cassiopeia and then before that i got champions like Renekton, Zed and Fizz thru shards. All i can suggest it might be better to take your chances on getting champions at half to even 1/4th of its original price thru shards, even if you have to prepare more shards for essence to perm them, especially when those same shards can be bought for 1700 ip and doesnt need to just be thru the chests cause of that.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkwind","date":"2016-08-02T13:17:33.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it doesn't effect me anymore, but I did get this back before I had all champs and (almost) all runes.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Pdz0m","replies":[]},{"poster":"azza420","date":"2016-08-02T12:48:07.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe its time for more of those bonus ip weekends amiright?! or amiriot?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-08-02T12:43:40.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only get that feeling with champs?
