He keeps on telling me yes he does play league, and Isn't tricking me. I checked on op.gg aswell on all regions and his name doesn't show up anywhere, so I'm very confused especially since he tries to friend me aswell and it says I don't exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T01:39:31.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did a search on my end for anyone with the Summoner Name ChisisMdness and wasn't able to find anything either! So good news, it's not an error on your end. \n\nMy best guess is that your friend possibly got his Summoner Name and Username switched up. It could be that the name he gave you is actually his Username, which you won't be able to use to add him. Have your friend double check his in-game Summoner name to make sure he gave you the right name.","replies":[{"poster":"Sentrık","date":"2017-03-27T03:35:33.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Fmum4YJ2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-27T01:39:31.119+0000)\n>\n> I did a search on my end for anyone with the Summoner Name ChisisMdness and wasn&#x27;t able to find anything either!
