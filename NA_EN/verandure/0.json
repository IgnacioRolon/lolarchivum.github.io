During teamfights; however, Malzahar should be able to proc the effect multiple times with basic abilities before and after the use of Nether Grasp.\r\n\r\nThe movespeed is welcomed on somebody as immobile as Malzahar, but +7% ms (23.8 before boots, 25.55 at tier one, 26.95 at tier two, and 28.35 with alacrity) isn't going to help you win very many races. \r\n\r\nI also found that Malzahar's attack animation made orb walking to generate charges very slow. Anecdotally; I found that running around without attacking (unless a minion wasn't going to bounce Malefic Visions or was about to die -- gotta get that CS) was more effective use of the item.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried Luden's Echo on Malzahar in a PvP game, yet. All of my findings are from 1v1 custom against a bot. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please share.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-15T06:56:52.457+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Luden's Echo is weird in the way it works. It will PROC off of ANY spell damage whether it be a DoT or an actual spell being used, HOWEVER... Luden's Echo does not gain stacks when damage is dealt, it gains stacks when abilities are CASTED. Considering how long Malz's CD's are, he can't really put the item to as much use as many since he can't spam the abilities to keep it up constantly. It could work, but Malz doesn't scale properly with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Verandure","date":"2015-03-15T18:28:16.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tend to agree. The item was clearly made for sustained, low CD dps mages -- like Cassiopeia. I just felt like testing it out on my favorite Prophet (still going to try it with some different builds to see if I can't make better use of it).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XianShetsu","date":"2015-03-19T09:44:38.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run a Teleport/Flash Malzahar and I usually rush Luden's Echo (I replaced Sorc Shoes in my build with this) after getting tear & a pink ward.\n\nIn short, It is \"Amazing\"\n\nMalzahar's greatest strength early game is pushing and this item only increases that strength tremendously, especially when you go against a roaming opponent. The moment you see them leave the lane, you just have to push (Made easier by Luden's Echo), take the tower and when you force the other laner to back to base, you can just travel to another lane and push for them as well ;p\n","replies":[]}]}
