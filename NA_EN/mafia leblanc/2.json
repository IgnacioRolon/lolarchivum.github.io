Unless you are using the beta client, when someone types in the champion select chat is pulls the taskbar up(on windows) and pulses an orange glow indicating that someone has typed _Something_. So Tabbing doesn't really do much, as well as that people can in no way be as *AFK* as they were in the season 3 champion select being that bans are not on team captain, and rather placed upon the \"team\" now. \n\nBesides, where did you get 90%?

All is well.  Fast forward another season, autofill is added.  MAYBE 1 in 10 games you'll get autofilled.

It was that the overall quality of ranked goes down because players are not playing on their best roles. It is a step back towards the archaic season 5 model which should never have been taken for ranked.\n\nYou also seem to think that Autofill is an automatic lose.\n\nGuess what?  You don't HAVE To play an ADC if you get bot lane.  If you want to play mage, play a damn mage.  If you're really that proficient with that champion, I'm sure you've faced an ADC mid lane as them - just crush the lane and play smart.  Most mages/assassins just totally wreck most bot lane and make any ADC cry and get toxic.\n\nAs long as you win your lane with the champion you are best with, you have a really good shot of winning, even if the teamcomp is subpar.  The way the game is now, much of the game is decided by 15 minutes.  If you picked a champion you're comfortable with, and are matched against an autofill sona ashe lane, you're going to stomp them and make them useless all game, get them flamed by their team, and collect your free elo.\n\nI was filled as bot, mid wouldn't swap, so I went LeBlanc bot in place of ADC.  Even though Lulu fed first blood, we crushed bot lane and they had to leave their lane and go mid to farm while being yelled at in all chat and asking us to report them, because they would explode if they stepped off turret.\n\nThe one good thing that season 7 did is really shook up the meta, and it's not uncommon to see almost every single champ in almost every single role, and not have it be auto trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-01-12T16:02:02.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mafia LeBlanc","date":"2017-01-12T16:39:52.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=haaaaaaaalp,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QkGjvdjv,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-01-12T16:02:02.608+0000)\n>\n> It isn&#x27;t about auto win or auto loss, it degrades the quality of ranked games. Any good team will punish you hard for not following the meta, that is why the meta is so prevalent. By trying to break the meta, you are essentially hoping your opponents play poorly which should never be the goal of a ranked queue.\n> \n> I wouldn&#x27;t mind autofill for normals but it has no place in ranked and a step back towards the old archaic ranked queue where you do not have everyone playing a role they know well.\n\nThat is absolutely not true.  Especially in this season.\n\nThat is the one thing I actually really like about this season - it's the first time since season 1 where I've seen people allowed to pick almost any champion into any role and not get flamed by teammates.  \n\nI've seen people pick Yasuo ADC, Twitch jungle, Irelia mid, Annie top, and won.  As people have seen with Ziggs ADC, I think finally people are starting to realize that the best pick isn't always the 'meta' pick.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2017-01-12T09:00:32.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"you do get autofilled pretty often but my main issue is that you are forcing someone into a role that they are not comfortable in.

Especially considering the role most people get autofilled into is the least played, arguably least fun, and hardest role to carry from. So of course there are going to be complaints. Even if support isn't the lane theat you are getting filled into, you should not be getting filled into a role you cannot play or cannot play well.
