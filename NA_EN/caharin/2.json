So, let's skip the extensive writing and just hop on it!\r\n\r\n- If I'm a toplaner, I never ask my jungler partner for ganks. Very rarely he ganks me.\r\n\r\n- As a jungler, he only ganks mid and bot. He only ganks me if I'm in deep and need to get the pressure off.\r\n\r\nSo, why am I sharing our DuoQ experience with you guys? And why would a poor Silver player know anything about the game? Simply put, toplane don't need ganks. Most of the time. \r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is that if the enemy jungler ganks me and I survive (90% of the time) the jungler just wasted cooldowns and time up here. Now that he's here my team can:\r\n\r\n- Contest a 4v3 drake in their favor.\r\n\r\n- Go 3v2 in botlane.\r\n\r\n- Go 2v1 in midlane. \r\n\r\n- Get tower mid.\r\n\r\n- Get tower bot.\r\n\r\n- Ward their jungle.\r\n\r\nUsually I end up playing Rek'Sai, Udyr or Nasus top, and ganks won't bother me because all I do is farm all day. Maybe get a kill or two. If I play Riven, I find myself camped as hell, just to keep me from snowballing. And I love this. Because we stall the game, I get items, I still wreck face. So in the end, ganks toplane doesn't matter. I play it safe anyway.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe players who go top should not expect ganks, because mid and bot can carry alot harder, at all times in the game. And this is my personal experience with about 300 DuoQ games with him. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: The only point I want to make with this thread is that a jungler can do so many more things than gank toplane. DOn't be selfish if you're top, just let your jungler give your carries the potentiall TO CARRY!

If they use that well, they can win games. If they get camped, that's awhile before they can really contribute. Bot's a very advantageous lane to gank in a lot of cases, but half the fun of being a jungler is making it up as you go each match. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-01-16T17:03:25.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"an early gank top before dragon is a viable objective can often set a huge snowball rolling. top laners are typically very good duelists with big snowball potential (like Riven) so i almost always like to direct my first gank towards top if possible.\n\nafter that early stage you're correct though, going top is dangerous due to drake and the threat of losing both of your bot lane to a dive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominnion","date":"2015-01-16T16:42:18.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find top lane the easiest to gank, personally.

I always go bot ( through the bushes in the lane itself and wait ) when the lane was pushed all the way up to the enemy's tower if I'm a using a good dueling jungler, same case apply to mid and top. \n\nWhy ? Because the other jungler will most likely gank that lane, I'll be sticking nearby to counter gank and turn the fight around. People keep giving idiotic tips like if a lane is pushed, don't gank there. This is why Bronze and Silver jungler, or even gold can't do well, they just leave if a lane is pushed, they doesn't bother finding out the concept of countergank. In higher elo some people even refuse a jungler gank because they know that the lane will \"Turn\" because the other jungler will be there and they'll get wreck 2v2 or 3v3?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimspeake","date":"2015-01-16T18:05:05.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bot lane never sweep, freeze, ward and are usually overextended plus feeding. welcome to bronze.\n\n\nedit: also if getting your top a kill will give them lane dominance its usually worth giving an early gank, this isnt high elo so its not like the other team will try a 3:30drake if i go top. everything is situational, in your elo you prob need to play like that, in mine i do whatever i want as long as my ganks r better i win","replies":[{"poster":"Caharin","date":"2015-01-16T18:22:55.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A valid point.
