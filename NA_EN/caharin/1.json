They were picked = open the tear gates.\r\n> \r\n> Especially if it's a frustrating champion to play against. People feel shitty when they get wafflestomped in lane by Leblanc, even if they have a 56% chance to win against Leblanc. So they are looking for an excuse to claim that the champion is OP in order to feel justified about their whining. Champion was picked in LCS? Great, you don't have to admit that you failed to counter them or don't find their counters fun - it must be because they HAVE no counterplay.\r\n> \r\n> And of course, winrate in solo queue is considered irrelevant when the champ you're complaining about has a low winrate, but very important when the champ has a high winrate. You'd think pick/winrate in LCS (where everyone gets paid for being really good at the game) is less important than shit tier winrate if you're in shit tier, but no, that's not how this community thinks.\r\n\r\nI feel like this sums up the recent weeks. When Ahri had DFG removed and her damage amp removed, people were crying on how nerfed she was, that she would not be able to oneshot squishies now etc. etc. but once she saw play in LCS with patch 5.2 changes, all that was completely forgotten because she is still strong.\r\n\r\nSame with Kalista. People had some complaint on her passive only being good vs. melee without dash, and that her ultimate is just lackluster. And that her E would take too long time to get some worthy damage. And then they saw her Rend deal 1.4k damage to drake, and all of a sudden she is the new OP. It didn't matter that any Kalista needs to stack a good 40 spears to deal that damage. Even with 2.5 attack speed that would be 40/2.5= 16 seconds of constant attacking before that limit. \r\n\r\nI'm tired of people thinking the LCS picks are OP. Fizz AD top is not OP. Nida jungle is not OP. LB isn't even OP. Why are people so locked on the LCS scene and what's played there?\r\n\r\nTL;DR - I hate seeing the LCS picks become the new meta because the picks are deemed OP byt he community. Also, the quote within this post is extremely accurately describing the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-10T20:30:17.906+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"The boards were REALLY confused when Olaf was picked.\n\n\"Oh shit Olaf must be OP!

Nidalee jungle is also pretty binary imo; either she exerts insane early pressure and snowballs and becomes mediocre later, or she basically doesn't do anything; I don't think this is healthy either.

Yes. Yes, that...kinda tends to happen when you get buffed. Did you just start playing this game?\n\nYou know, I always wonder about this logic... If people just whine about a champion when they \"get rekt\" by them or just because \"they didn't counter them\" how come it's always the same few champions?

Is this some huge conspiracy where a ton of people all just decided to pick and hate the same champion for no reason? If people just complain about any champion because the champion \"outplayed them\", why is it only a tiny percentage of champions that are complained about? Why doesn't the community complain about Veigar, or Yorick or Brand or Ashe? Do they just never \"outplay\" anyone?\nWhat's that, you say? Because these current op champions keep getting picked over and over again? Well then you gotta ask yourself \"Gee, why do these few champions keep getting picked over and over again, I wonder?\".
