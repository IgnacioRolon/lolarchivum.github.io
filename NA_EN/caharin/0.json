I was playing my dear Riven (only one win out of 6 games sadly, but I'll get there once it stabilizes MMR or I get more skill in my matchups) and my jungler picked Pantheon (considered one of her hardest counters) so the enemy picked Darius. Now, I managed to win lane after some trading with E and potions/lifesteal, but I can't stress it enough how gambreaking Darius' passive is right now. \r\n\r\nHis Hemmorhage keeps doing damage after the Hemmorhage ends. I wondered how I could take so much damage from just two stacks when he had nothing, and then I end up fighting him. I kill him but end up fully stacked and low. Ofcourse I Valor under turret and stay there. Valor blocks a ton of the damage, and I watch closely as Hemmorhage ticks away. Valor is gone, so is Hemmorhage. I'm on 60 HP, everything's good. No Hemmorhage, no minion aggro, no more damage. \r\n\r\nSURPRISE MOTHAFOCKA! \r\n\r\nKilled by a last tick of Hemmorhage. And it was two seconds after Hemmorhage supposedly dissapeared (the debuff icon was not showing)\r\n\r\nPlease Riot, Fix this! And players, beware against Darius'!","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-01-25T23:45:58.113+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":17,"body":"You're Riven, so ummm, should I be supporting this...?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-01-26T00:07:07.753+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatzBoyFTW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GzEr5GRh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-25T23:45:58.113+0000)\n>\n> You're Riven, so ummm, should I be supporting this...?\n\nIf your decision to want a damaging bug to be fixed is based on what champion someone was playing when they found it you have problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Caharin","date":"2015-01-26T00:24:34.111+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Dusteon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GzEr5GRh,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-26T00:07:07.753+0000)\n>\n> If your decision to want a damaging bug to be fixed is based on what champion someone was playing when they found it you have problems.\n\nSomeone gets the idea atleast! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2015-01-26T06:19:25.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Dusteon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GzEr5GRh,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-26T00:07:07.753+0000)\n>\n> If your decision to want a damaging bug to be fixed is based on what champion someone was playing when they found it you have problems.\n\nWhat if it's teemo?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Ðaríus","date":"2015-01-26T06:09:10.300+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":20,"body":"it's not a bug and doesnt need that to be nerfed he's already weak as is\n\nIt doesnt happen often too so stop trying to get your counter nerfed you filthy riven player","replies":[{"poster":"Brenticus12","date":"2015-01-26T08:53:24.598+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a clarity issue if they're not even showing how long it lasts.\n\nI hate Riven players as much as I hate Kat players but a bug is a bug and has to be rectified.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caharin","date":"2015-01-26T08:22:56.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Keep hatin' on a perfeclty balanced champ lol! :P\n\nThe problem is not that Draius beats Riven or anything.
