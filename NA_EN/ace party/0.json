For example i decide to change my resolution to 1400 x 900 and try it out (in the game's config file) and next time i enter a game after champion select i get a black screen and i'm forced to shutdown my laptop. The game works fine with my native resolution which is 1600 x 900, but nothing below that. I would like some advice on this problem.{{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T21:56:30.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to do a little troubleshooting with this myself, as you should be able to change the resolution to something other than your laptop's native resolution. \n\nIt looks like the resolution you were trying to use is a little off, as 1400x900 isn't a supported resolution (1440x900 is though). Try going into a practice game, opening the options, and changing the resolution to one of the supported ones through those in game options.","replies":[{"poster":"Ace Party","date":"2017-08-05T07:07:21.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for your help it seems that i typed the wrong resolution and it ended up in crash :P","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-06T20:17:32.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries bud, happens to the best of us ^_^! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
