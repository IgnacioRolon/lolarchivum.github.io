{"poster":"Reyndria","date":"2016-11-02T21:44:34.148+0000","title":"Sazi, The Witch of the Wilds","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overview:\r\nSazi is an AP-based support mage who uses a combination of crippling voodoo to wither down her opponents, and some not-so-crippling voodoo to cleanse her allies&#039; spirits.\r\n\r\nPassive: Natural Instability &ndash; Sazi has two different modes; A support based &ldquo;prosperous&rdquo; side and a damage based &ldquo;corrupted&rdquo; side. She is unable to control her transformation, and every 3 minutes she will transform and gain the skills of the opposite branch of magic. Additionally, while in her prosperous form, she gains bonus mana regeneration, while in her corrupted form, she gains bonus ability power. Sazi&#039;s abilities can change this timer around a bit.\r\n\r\nQ: Regrowth/Faeflame &ndash; Sazi stores 3 charges of this spell, and will regain 1 charge every (45/35/30/20/15) [also affected by CDR] seconds and 1 charge when she changes forms. Regrowth in her Prosperous form heals a friendly champion. Additional healing on the same champion within 15 seconds is 50% less effective cumulatively (i.e. 1st heal = 100% value, 2nd 50% of 1st value, 3rd is 25% of 1st value [50% of the 2nd value]) Faeflame in her Corrupted form throws a skillshot that damages and lowers the armor of the 1st enemy hit by (5/10/15/20/25%) for 3 seconds. (does not stack, but can reset)\r\n\r\nW: Flicker &ndash; While in her Prosperous form, Sazi jumps to a nearby allied champion or minion and gains a 20% decaying movespeed bonus for 3 seconds. If Sazi jumps to a friendly champion, she shares the bonus. While in her Corrupted form, Sazi jumps to a nearby enemy, damaging and slowing them by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nE: Evoke/Erase &ndash; In Sazi&#039;s Prosperous form, Evoke calls a storm in a target area after a short delay for 5 seconds. Enemies in the storm field have their vision reduced and their attack speed lowered, and take magic damage over the duration. In her Corrupted form, Erase conjures an angry spirit to haunt an enemy champion, damaging them over 5 seconds. If Sazi lands Faeflame on a haunted enemy, the spirit combusts, dealing its remaining damage all at once and stunning its mark for 1.5 seconds Using Erase prolongs her Corrupted form for an additional 30 seconds. (breaking the 3 minute window to make her less static, making her more aggressive in lane, but at the cost of being able to heal allies or escape in later fights.)\r\n\r\nR: Ancestor&#039;s Echo &ndash; Sazi calls upon the spirits of her departed tribe members, which give her and allies in an area around her increased damage for 5 seconds, and cleanses them on activation. In addition, Ancestor&#039;s Echo will set Sazi IMMEDIATELY into Prosperous form. (again breaking the 3 minute window...with a long cooldown.)\r\n\r\nLore:\r\n\r\nDeep in the plague jungles of southern Runeterra, there once was a tribe of some renown. They were a peaceful tribe attempting to heal the plague from the land, and bit by bit, they were making progress. Not all were keen to see this happen, as many an ill being thrived here. In a tragic event, most of the tribe was destroyed. Several tribalists now wander the land, looking for clues as to what really happened to their small but strong tribe of warriors and shamen. Sazi was among the best shaman of her tribe, and faced the task of fighting their dangerous jungle home to look for such clues.\r\n\r\nSazi went deeper into the jungle and fell ill. Several days passed, and she knew that this was no natural sickness. Slowly, she felt it corrupting her. The land itself twisting her very core. Sick and weak, Sazi crawled her way out of the jungle, but it was too late. The dark power had taken hold of her, but not completely. Burning with her desire to find the caster of such foul magics, Sazi vowed to overcome this curse and exact retribution for her tribe, as well as a cure for her home.\r\n\r\n*Thinking of special interactions with janna, lulu, nidalee, and zyra.* Also considering interactions with people who could potentially be the source of corruption (dark mages/toxic people)\r\n\r\nPlease leave your thoughts for me, as this is a work in progress.

She'd be an answer to some of those wombo combo team picks, so your whole team doesnt instantly lose from only having one tank against amumu/kennen double ults...well...they'd probably still lose, but it'd still give them a fighting chance if they played it right.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheRealmMaker","date":"2016-11-02T22:34:17.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice but should have a pet with her to follow her like a witch flying pet","replies":[{"poster":"Reyndria","date":"2016-11-09T22:31:39.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a concept art possibility, but the pet would probably still be a noncombatant, familiar kind of thing.
