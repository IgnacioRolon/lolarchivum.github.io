Why punish us? We dodge games for a couple reasons. \r\n1.) We don't get the role we think we can carry the game the best at.\r\n2.) We think a player or players is going to troll the team and force us to lose.\r\nOut of these 2 reasons i do not see a reason for us to lose LP. \r\nIn my opinion the only negative effect that dodging should put on someone is having to wait awhile before you are allowed to queue again.\r\nAre there any negative effects of removing the LP loss from dodgers?\r\nI do not think so. If you think that they will just join lobbies and dodge no matter what to ruin someones day, then let me ask you, would you really honestly even care? boo hoo you have to queue again. Removing the LP loss from dodgers is to promote LP gain and climbing the ladders. \r\nWhat are other your guys thoughts?","replies":[]}
