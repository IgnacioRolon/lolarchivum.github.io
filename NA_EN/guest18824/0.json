I played a game which I didn&#039;t do to well on Orianna mid.  The Sona support started being rude and annoying so I muted her and thought nothing of it.  A couple minutes after the game I accepted a friend request as I do all I receive.  The Sona went out of her way to add me and call me a &quot;fucking retard&quot; and to tell me to &quot;uninstall league.&quot;\n\nedit: The player immediately removed me after and the conversation was deleted automatically so I have no proof of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-08-16T16:38:24.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your only chance is to submit a support ticket and explain the situation.
