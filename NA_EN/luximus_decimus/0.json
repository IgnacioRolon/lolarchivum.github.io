When I enter into the Legacy client, the launch button reappears. The only thing I have done differently that might have caused this is that I am clicking on the actual program and not on a shortcut to the League client. Is this normal?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T04:13:28.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, this is normal. The patcher for the Beta Client is designed a bit different and allows you to sign into the client while the patching process finishes up in the background. This is why you're brought directly to the login screen rather than having to wait for the process to finish, then hit *launch* to get to login, like on the Legacy Client.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
