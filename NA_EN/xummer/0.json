Never before have I had this issue. \n\nI'm from NA, with 40ms. I usually enter my credentials and login immediately.

Why? It's so annoying. Client issues, login issues, random disconnects. Never, EVER happens in any other game, I swear to you.\n\nEdit: 1 minute after posting this, the \"Authenticating...\" message disappeared (Failed) and I got a error saying \"The server is currently busy. Try again later or check the server status\".\n\nFantastic. Lovely. I was in the middle of a game, carrying my team, having fun, then I randomly disconnect and this happens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"G2 LA JI","date":"2017-07-24T18:52:31.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you living in IL or IN?","replies":[{"poster":"Xummer","date":"2017-07-24T20:31:47.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IL","replies":[]}]}]}
