It looks smooth however there are just too many things that are inconvenient like adjusting my rune pages or even post game lobby. I would really prefer to keep the old simpler design and for the information I usually look at, it seems to be more efficient.  Not only that, ever since i downloaded the beta client its crashed 2/3rd of the time I try to load it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T21:04:21.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can continue to launch into the Legacy client from the login screen for now, but eventually, the new client will completely replace the Legacy Client, obviously when it's more polished and stable.

This causes problems such as causing severe delays in champ select, hard enough that you cannot change masteries, select champions, etc.\n\nIs significantly reducing this issue on the radar for potential clean-ups before the beta goes live as the only client option? Or is that not included in 'polished and stable'?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-20T22:20:26.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would imagine that would be included in the *stable* part of *polished and stable*.
