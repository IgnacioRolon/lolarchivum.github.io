Because, as you said, the odds should be similar.\n\nNot to agree or disagree with the point, but your \"7 wins in a row\" aren't random independent events.\nFirst - you win a game you feel happy. You probably play better when you're happy. Also, you win a game you played well - your mind was clear things were going good. You play well one game you're likely to play well the next game. You're directly making your games correlated which makes these streaks much more likely. \n\nThen on top of that, matchmaking sort of encourages these streaks even if not intentionally. You win a bunch in a row (the last few maybe you get carried) and your MMR goes above what you deserve. Now you're not as good as your opponents and you lose a few in a row, then a few more because you're tilted from the losses (especially tilting when the losses are your fault because you weren't as good) and then your MMR goes below where you belong. Then you win some games because you're better and now you're playing well and happy from winning and win some more. It can go back and forth, where you build momentum to create a streak and eventually you break your boundary and get pulled back.\n\nNow, I don't really believe Riot intentionally tries to force win or lose streaks on each person. I believe there are valid explanations for why they happen in a matchmaking system that's attempting to produce 50% win chance games (i.e. a fair system).","replies":[{"poster":"Moetaro","date":"2017-02-26T04:19:56.880+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"If the mood decides the outcome of the streaks in such a hard way, then I (and the big majority of LoL players since op.gg) must suffer from bipolar disorder.\n\nI've played several team games based on \"elo\" points.

MMR Matching works exactly the opposite way. You dont try to force people 50% W/L ratio fukcing their lifes untill they cannot carry anymore, and then letting them in a losing streak to put them later in winning (unloseable) streak to even things up. (Or just boosting their teammates until they cant avoid to be carried, if it's the opposite way).\n\nIn a mmr matchup, if you start at 1500 and you are 2200, then you will win next to all your games, and your winrate will go from ~100% to ~50% bit by bit until you reach your 2200 elo. You wont find any losing streak either (variance happens, but those streaks will be short AND spaced, if any).\n\nIf it's the opposite, you start at 1500 but you belong to 800, then the opposite will happen. You wont find winning streaks either.\n\nWhat happens in LoL is something different, they try to force a 50% W/L ratio until eventually you get your elo, instead of forcing equal elo in your matchmaking until eventually you reach 50% W/L. It works too, you will climb if you deserve that elo, it will not stuck you nor anything, BUT it will take you WAY WAY WAY more games to reach your actual elo, whatever it is.\n\nOk, listen, I find a really hard time trying to explain once and again what it seems obvious to me.

They take few risks, and as such they tend to have few deaths, but they also rarely become the determining factor in their games. \n\nOther players are more aggressive. They take lots of risks.
