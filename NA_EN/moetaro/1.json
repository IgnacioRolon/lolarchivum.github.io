THe trick is to not buy into your team mate's bad plays and set goals. Goals should include things like \"I should be X level or higher by Y minutes.\" or \"I should be on my X item by Y minutes.\" After you set goal like that they become easier and easier to achieve which lets you move the Y down.","replies":[{"poster":"Moetaro","date":"2017-02-17T00:34:32.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you very much for the advices.\n\nI had realized this one \n\n> THe trick is to not buy into your team mate's bad plays\n\nBut I still buy into every bad move my team make (plus the bad moves I make, ofc).

Setting goals makes the game so much fun IMO. Without goals it is really hard to judge wheher or not YOU are doing well or not, you can only see how your TEAM is doing. Whwn you have goals you can track your own progression. Go to  game where you did well and set the goals based off that game. As you get better at hitting those goals consider revising them to make them harder to hit.
