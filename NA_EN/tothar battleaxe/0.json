I wasn&#039;t doing so well, as I don&#039;t play Ryze but would like to learn him. In essence, they didn&#039;t like my poor play, and my teammates started referring to me as a &quot;%%%%%%&quot; and a &quot;%%%%%.&quot; After typing in allchat that I would be reporting our Caitlyn for racism, Vayne then called me a &quot;%%%%%%&quot; as well. I reported them as normal and I would have moved on from the subject except for two things. First Blitzcrank said, &quot;are you even black&quot; and proceeded to tell me that I couldn&#039;t be offended by his use of racial slurs against me or another. No, I am not black, nor am I Asian, nor am I personally offended. I do, however, have a problem with people using slurs in any case against anyone. Second, they then told me that because the system is automated now, that they would get away with no penalty even though this type of behavior used to get people permanently banned when we had the Tribunal. I understand why we no longer have the Tribunal, but I sincerely hope we have people reading over reports regarding racism and hate speech. Spending all of the hours and manpower on reading over reports of toxicity, I get that would be a bit of a stretch. However, if we aren&#039;t taking things like blatant racism seriously, why bother with a report system in general?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-14T02:53:47.409+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Second, they then told me that because the system is automated now, that they would get away with no penalty\n\nActually, that behavior easily results in being escalated up to a 14 day or permanent ban upon review of their case. If they are frequently negative players the reports against them are likely to be reviewed in short order, and be punished for this severely.\n\nIf you go through the PB&M board and look at ban cases you'll see this kind of behavior does indeed get punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Tothar Battleaxe","date":"2017-03-14T02:58:28.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'm glad to hear that these types of cases get looked at. I sort of miss the days of the Tribunal, as I used to participate frequently. Hopefully there are real people on the back end of the report system and we can make some headway into discouraging the worst types of behavior.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-03-15T04:15:14.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They lied.

If they did use racial slurs, that's a 100% sure 14-day ban or even a permanent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mostro Gallo","date":"2017-03-14T03:46:19.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, racism is a huge no-no in this game surprisingly","replies":[]}]}
