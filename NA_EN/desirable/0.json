There could be a lot of different things that are blocking that, so let's start small and try some troubleshooting options to find a solution.\n\nTo start, I'd suggest trying to power cycle your router, then follow it with manually forwarding any ports that LoL needs. Steps for that can be found [**on our guide  over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq6).
