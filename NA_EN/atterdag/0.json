For the keyboard, I'd try checking for any possible driver updates that might be affecting it and you may need to try resetting your config files if that doesn't help.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\n\nAs for your pc shutting off randomly, it might be happening from overheating. Check that your fans are working properly and that there isn't any dust buildup blocking them.","replies":[]}]}
