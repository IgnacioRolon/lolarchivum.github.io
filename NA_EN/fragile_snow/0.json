Please help","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I got a quick question about the border:\r\n\r\nI understand that the border is tied to the icon and will only show if I play as Dawnbringer Riven even without equipping the icon. My question is: will I still get the border for Dawnbringer Riven even if I don't have the icon after the event ends? \r\n\r\nI'm asking this because once I'm done collecting enough tokens to unlock said icon and border I'm going to switch to Garena and buy Dawnbringer there but problem is I don't have time to unlock the tokens for both regions. \r\n \r\nIf anyone/rioter knows, please enlighten me, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T03:25:29.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The border is tied to that icon specifically. If you start a new account on Garena, you won't be able to transfer that summoner icon to the new account and won't be able to have the border. If your end goal is to have the border on Garena, you may want to create that account now and purchase the border.","replies":[{"poster":"Fragile Snow","date":"2017-06-30T10:32:39.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Q1wvJ7vA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-30T03:25:29.439+0000)\n>\n> The border is tied to that icon specifically.

Thanks for the response, I appreciate it a lot fam. \n\nAnd I see that you misunderstood what I meant with Garena. I have accounts on both servers, just that I have yet to commit to unlocking Dawnbringer Riven on Garena.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T20:16:40.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad!
