I'm really about to quit this game","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your Leaver Buster for Ranked needs some serious work Riot. I just lost a match worth of LP Because YOUR CLIENT CRASHED. And YOUR CLIENT said i left the game after i tried to log back in 3 DAMN TIMES and YOUR CLIENT wouldn't re-log. I am in Bronze 4 and i would like to scale but i can't do that when your leaver buster thinks i left a game when in reality your client crashed. I honestly don't even think you will rectify your mistakes or this problem since you have been shoty on listening to people in the past. I have put money into this game, i have put time into this game and i have put effort into this game. And i am stuck in bronze because every time i start to do well i still get stuck with crap teams. One win one lose, over and over. And you built a team game where every person i talk to in a higher elo says I have to carry if i wanna scale? There is no I in the word Team but these people think its the only way. They are right too. This isn't a team game anymore. Its your money pit is what it feels like. It feels like your only concern is money and not what happens to your players. wanna fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2016-09-10T16:23:28.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me last night. No errors, no nothing, the client just literally vanished about 20 seconds into champion select.\n\nI go to restart it, and it says that the game is already running.\n\nMeanwhile, the game is toast, I get LPQ'd for 5 minutes, which as far as I know, is the first time my account has ever, for any reason, received any negative action of any kind.\n\nI'd love to provide any kind of logs if you think they'd help, but I don't think it's possible to convey in words how irritating it is being flagged as a dodger due to a technical problem out of my control.","replies":[{"poster":"M1NAT0 NAM1KAZ3","date":"2016-09-10T17:19:28.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with you on all aspects.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T15:12:34.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game crashing can count as a leave because you are no longer present in the game, and the match is down a player which is a negative experience for other players even if it was unintentional.  The best way to restore your standing with the system is by constantly playing without any interruptions, and I'd like to help you get there.  Give me more details on the crash you're getting so I can look into this for you.  For example, are you getting any error messages?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"M1NAT0 NAM1KAZ3","date":"2016-09-10T15:28:16.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only error that popped up was that the client had crashed and that it wanted me to restart. So i did and 3 times that i tried it said it couldn't connect to the pvp.kernal. it was just long enough to keep me out of game.

If this is the case then your crashes could be due to a few reasons like bad drivers, game files, or even hardware.  When you have time, I suggest going through each step in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to get this fixed up for good.  It would be best to test anything out in a custom game to prevent any penalties.  This should get you back in game!","replies":[{"poster":"M1NAT0 NAM1KAZ3","date":"2016-09-10T17:18:59.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will do all of that however i remembered that league also patched 2 things when i logged in the first two times then just crashed the 3rd time. i have been playing fine since this incident.
