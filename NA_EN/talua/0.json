I know it says there's a problem with playing in full screen but my game bugsplats before i can even get into the loading screen, I hit try again and instantly back to bug splat. I have submitted over 40 reports of this and no one seems to be working on the problem. I know i'm not the only one experiencing this, its just really annoying to be completely unable to play. (I have also re-downloaded the game twice and nothing changed.) Any help would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T02:55:48.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats usually indicate that there's something up with either your System's Drivers or Hardware that's causing a poor interaction with League.
