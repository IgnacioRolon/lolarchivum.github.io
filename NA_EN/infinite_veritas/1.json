Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So there you are...just hanging out and getting ready to play League of Legends.  I mean, patch 5.18 is gonna be what the World Championships are played on!  We gotta check it out, right?  However, this time when you try to patch League of Legends you encounter a patching error.  You don&#039;t know what it is, but it&#039;s there...We imagine your reaction looks something like this...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JdLM13V.gif\n\nFear not...We&#039;ve got you covered and we&#039;re going to get you back in to League of Legends as quickly as possible!  The solution to your problem can depend on your symptoms so take a look below as these links should fix most issues!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n> ***Launcher/Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press \"LAUNCH\"***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n\n> ***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general \"Unspecified Error has occurred\" message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"stefan999x","date":"2015-09-30T14:57:15.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi guys pls tell me what happend with my points in the ward .
