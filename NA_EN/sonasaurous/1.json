Its true people dont report for proper reasons enough, most of them are rageing little kiddies, but the system weights their reports really low Im sure as they probably report 3 people on their team every other game. People get away with being extremely toxic in pregame lobby then people forget to report them afterwards.\n\nAnyway OP, just wait for 30-60 seconds, yes it will feel like a waste of time, but think of the 20 minutes of frustration you will feel if you get qued up with them again durring that 30-60 seconds and you will know its worth it to wait.","replies":[{"poster":"KrugLyfe","date":"2016-01-20T17:16:55.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i don't bm in chat i just spam taunts and the level 5 skill thing","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2016-01-20T17:50:53.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except doing this intelligently would mean that you can't be on the same team as them for some timeout.

And that's reporting everyone! If you only report the bad/good players it's an even smaller number that only effects less than 4% of the population! And this comparison covers your typical plat/diamond player (it's a 5x larger pool for bronze silver gold). Furthermore, safeguards could be put in place. Like a report limit, or even the need for 2 reports on a player to validate the report (this would really only be necessary for masters/challenger players anyways).

A couple of games of league can get you close to 2 hours of play, if not more. We are all busy folk, with work and study and family commitments.
