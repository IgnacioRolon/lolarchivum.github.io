I love Soraka in all her purple-skinned glory. Though I&#039;m not particularly sure if you love her in all her purple-skinned glory?\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s review:\r\nBase skin: Purple\r\nDryad skin: White\r\nDivine skin: White\r\nCelestine (aka Base skin 2.0) skin: Purple\r\nReaper skin: Blue-Green (acceptable, because it meets the theme of...dead)\r\nOrder of the Banana skin: Purple\r\nProgram skin: Apple product\r\nStar Guardians skin: White\r\nStar Guardian recolor (aka PJ skin) skin: White\r\nUpcoming Winter Wonder skin: Elsa White\r\n\r\nSo removing Program, in which she&#039;s not alive (and keeping Reaper, for assuming that &quot;undead&quot; is more alive than &quot;not alive&quot;), 4 out of 7 skins (or 5 out of 8, if you count the PJ skin) depict Soraka as white, while only 2 of her skins depict her as her actual skin tone: PURPLE. That&#039;s 57%-62% (including Program: 55%) of her skins depicting her as White, while only 25%-28% (including Program: 22%) depict her as her actual skin tone. \r\n\r\nNotably, another champion suffers from not-being-allowed-to-stay-purple, and that&#039;s {{champion:117}}, in case you were wondering. On the contrary, another predominantly purple-skinned champion that IS allowed to consistently stay purple (or blue) is {{champion:36}}. And then there&#039;s {{champion:13}}...who is about 1-2 more skins away from being every color in the rainbow. \r\n\r\nI love Soraka and the fact that&#039;s she&#039;s finally getting a Winter skin, but did they really have to make her look like a mix between Rapunzel and Elsa? There are better ways to get across the winter theme while keeping her lovely purple skin...as well as better representing her visually as &quot;Soraka.&quot; I feel like Riot didn&#039;t even try.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-20T20:08:53.837+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:202}} This would be easier if Soraka came in more colors.","replies":[{"poster":"Sonasaurous","date":"2018-11-20T20:13:30.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She needs to be more like Ryze and strive to be a rainbow.
