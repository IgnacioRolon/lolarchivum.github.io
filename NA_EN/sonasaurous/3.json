New champions come out with like 5-10 minutes of special interactive dialogue, while older champions are still stuck with 1-2 jokes and taunts. It gets stale after a while.\r\n\r\nSo, what are some champions you want to see get VOs, and what are some lines you&#039;d like to hear them say?\r\n\r\nFor me, I&#039;d like a {{champion:37}} VO.\r\n\r\nNow, I know what you&#039;re thinking:\r\n\r\n1.  She&#039;s a mute\r\n2.  Her dialogue would be so boring because she doesn&#039;t say anything\r\n3.  Fuck Sona, who cares?\r\n\r\nI love Sona (obviously), and tbh her dialogue has always been lame. I love the idea that &quot;Only you can hear me, Summoner&quot;--even though Summoners don&#039;t exist anymore in the new lore, and thus this quote is dated. (A simple, &quot;Only you can hear me&quot; or a newer but similar quote would do). She&#039;s also an Ionia...that was adopted by a Demacian and raised in Demacia...who speaks Italian. Riot, please.\r\n\r\nBut I mean her in-game dialogue:\r\n&quot;A symphony of justice&quot; (the Demacia quote)\r\n&quot;Accelerated movement, I concur&quot; (Sona&#039;s response to the Summoner)\r\n&quot;Accurate, like a metronome&quot; (Generic movement quote, about music)\r\n&quot;Adagio, Summoner&quot; (response to the Summoner directly--should be changed for above mentioned reasons; music related, means &quot;slow tempo&quot;)\r\n&quot;Brioso, brioso&quot; (music related dialogue, &quot;lively music&quot; basically)\r\n&quot;Delicately&quot; (Sona always says this when I&#039;m going ham, so I always take it as her lecturing me lol....wow I have no life)\r\n&quot;From my mind to yours&quot; (again, the connection between Sona and the player--which is good and unique to her)\r\n&quot;Harmoniously&quot; (another one word response, music related again)\r\n&quot;Order through music&quot; (music related)\r\n&quot;Quarter time&quot; (music related)\r\n&quot;Shall we resolve this dissonance?&quot; (Why yes, Sona, we shall. :) also, music related, dissonance = &quot;tension&quot;, or lack of harmony)\r\n&quot;The fanfare ascends.&quot; (idle dialogue)\r\n&quot;With perfect tempo.&quot; (idle dialogue, music related)\r\n\r\nAnd....that&#039;s it. Everything she says in her mind is related to music--which is fine, because she is constantly playing her etwahl. Her jokes are also understandable, as she can&#039;t tell a joke verbally to other champions (so she plays her etwahl like a guitar), and similarly is her taunt (where she plays her etwahl like a bad piano). Even her laugh is the sound of a harp...even though she has a laughing animation where she&#039;s not touching her etwahl at all.\r\n\r\nThe point is, I&#039;d like to see some more dialogue for Sona that continues the theme of her talking to the player. &quot;From my mind to yours....lemme tell you how I feel about this champion.&quot; Her taunts can be her own remarks about other champions that she tells the player; let her laugh in her head (which we have all done at some point); give the girl a music joke for all I care. \r\n\r\nRight now, her quotes are mainly just music references and one word responses. I know Sona has a personality in there, and she has her own thoughts and reactions. I don&#039;t think it would be out of place or wildly beyond her theme as a mute to be able to communicate those thoughts to the player.\r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s just me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2017-03-10T20:40:15.111+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:33}} \"Fine\" \"Yep\" \"Okay\" \"Yes\" \"Correct\" \"All right\" \"Sure\"\n\nAnd they could even give him a new VO for his Chrome skin that looks evil: \"No\" \"Incorrect\" \"Never\" \"Wrong\" \"Unacceptable\" \"Nope\" and a special interaction when he kills someone \"KO\"","replies":[{"poster":"Shadowkirby14","date":"2017-03-12T04:35:48.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Killing an Enemy: \"Wasted\" \"Rekt\" \"Scrub\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonasaurous","date":"2017-03-10T21:16:31.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be hilarious XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternal791","date":"2017-03-10T21:01:28.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play Rammus but this needs to happen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eternal791","date":"2017-03-10T21:00:22.016+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx upon activating her passive: \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nI can just picture Jinx running around screaming senselessly as she shoots everything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-03-10T22:26:59.111+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:8}} : 2 hour long track of nothing but puns, plays constantly no matter what and repeats","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-03-10T21:19:29.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sona is weird because she's mute.

As it stands now, with the removal of the Institute of  War and Summoners, there's really no way to explain how a mute will be speaking to you, the shop keepers, enemies she kills or attacks, or really anyone else without making her something like a telepath. The mute aspect of Sona is one of those very very limiting design aspects of her character that will artistically prevent her from having a fully actualized voice over without either breaking it or giving it some absurd explanation on why you can hear her speech.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-03-11T03:48:22.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally with you on the Sona thing. I'd love to hear her talk about more than just music.\n\nSpeaking of, how do you think the upcoming lore update will change Sona? I think it would be cool if she were a telekinetic empath of sorts who communicates solely through music, inspiring her audience without so much as uttering a word and feeling what they feel just by listening to the drum of their hearts. Not sure if that entails removing the more violent / fantasy aspects of her character such as her ability to physically destroy things through the magic of her etwahl, though I doubt Riot would do that simply because she needs an in-game reason to deal damage. \n\nFor Quinn, I'd love if she had more lines in regards to her twin brother, Caleb. His death was a major driving factor in her life which led her to become a part of the Demacian elite. Something so simple as _\"This is for you, Caleb\"_ would be cool, perhaps as a quote that she says before entering combat. I'd also like some more interactions for her with other Demacian champs since we don't really get a clear picture of how she feels about or interacts with them. And of course, a few lines addressing Talon would be a huge help in understanding the nature of their rivalry.","replies":[{"poster":"Sonasaurous","date":"2017-03-12T22:39:16.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've already headcannon'd it that Sona is telepathic to some extent...because her in-game model elegantly glides around, she is never actually holding her etwahl in any way (not even a strap), and, of course, she communicates telepathically with the player.

I dunno.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-03-10T20:32:18.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:107}} \n\nI'd love to see more insight into Rengar's personality. I understand he's all proud, trophy hunter cat-man, but there's room for depth in there. What is he like when he's not stalking the jungles? How does he interact with people? For example - we know from Gnar's lore that Rengar keeps a hunting journal to jot down his thoughts and feelings during his hunts. Are they just for himself? Does he have any friends, or fellow hunters that he discusses tactics with and takes criticism from? Perhaps {{champion:76}} would be a good candidate for a person like that, someone Rengar can be bros with and talk about the nature of the hunt.\n\nHe also strikes me as a very proud person who'd love the opportunity to brag to people about his hunts. Does he go into towns with warriors and share tales of great hunts with them, or does he avoid civilization and it's comforts, subsisting completely in the wild? If so, where did his armor and weapons come from? These are all things updated dialogue could provide insight into.\n\n{{champion:58}} \n\nAn updated VO for Renekton would greatly depend on whether or not Riot is going to redeem him at any point. Will he overcome his madness and see the truth of what happened with his brother, or is he doomed to berserker rage for all eternity, until he's struck down? If he's redeemed, it would be cool to see how he feels about being Ascended, and dialogue on how it compares to him being a person would be neat. Can he even remember being a human before?\n\nIf he were redeemed, his rage towards Nasus would obviously be redirected towards Xerath, but it would be more sane, of course. If he isn't to be redeemed, and be written as a tragedy, it would be great to see some sorrow and a greater sense of betrayal under those scales.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ethereal311","date":"2017-03-11T18:25:23.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tristana:\n\"Ammo holds make for good targets...
