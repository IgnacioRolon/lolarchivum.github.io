Yes, I have taken it into consideration so I decide to mute the players harassing me. Now, I am left without proper team communication because of your steps to avoiding conflict with toxic players. My reputation is at the mercy of my toxic teammates and the enemy team. That&#039;s not fair. I have to rely on your algorithm to find the toxic players who say &quot;plz&quot;. I am following the meta and I got fucked by a Nidalee who spent more than me to get where she is. Now I&#039;m frustrated about it because I got punished. Well, I complain about the champion and I criticize your (Riot) champion development and then I get dragged into a conflict with my team mates whom, I muted shortly after. Now I have to play a toxic game, silent, because I had to mute my team. The only retribution I get from playing with toxic players is to get into the post game screen where I will undoubtedly be berrated, insulted, attacked, and humiliated by teammates and opponents alike so I can tell Riot that some other people were being mean to me. I&#039;m an adult and I speak like an adult. I can properly defend myself to the likes that Riot will never be able to.\r\n\r\nIn my time playing this game I have been attacked for not playing the meta. I have been humiliated for my free speech and personal beliefs. I have continued to personally be as civil and helpful as possible. I teach, I mentor, and I save lives. Do I speak out my frustrations? Yes. The fact of the matter though is that my free speech is being impeded on not just by the community but by Riot&#039;s Player Bevaior Reform system. I&#039;m left fighting new variables daily because of other player&#039;s freedoms on these servers that I don&#039;t have. If I&#039;m left a lower class citizen on the League servers that&#039;s fine but I&#039;ll be damned if I&#039;m not allowed to act upon my rights given to me by the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights to be exploited by the Capitalistic system I was born into.   \r\n\r\nLift my restrictions and fix Poppy","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-08T22:44:34.107+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"The right to free speech does not apply here.

You are perfectly allowed to question their practices in a civil manner here on the boards, but you've changed the subject here.\n\n> **Freedom of Speech!!!!!**\n>\nDoesnt apply. No really. If were talking about American law, the First Amendment only applies to the government making laws that prohibit speech and, even then, freedom of speech isnt absolute. For example, you cant incite a riot, plan to kill the president or yell fire in a crowded theater.\n>\nAlso, theres nothing in the First Amendment that protects you from the consequences of your speech. People are fired all the time for making derogatory comments about their employer. My workplace, for example, has a social media policy that says that I can be terminated for badmouthing the company. They dont ask for passwords and access as some companies have been known to do, but it wouldnt be all that difficult to find me on the internet, knowing my real name, phone number and address.","replies":[{"poster":"SlangoYappi","date":"2016-01-08T22:57:15.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"Ahh, but, Riot gives the punishments for my speech...
