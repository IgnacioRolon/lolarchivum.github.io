We've been saying for years that their system sucks and that people would get banned for no reason because of toxic players reporting you for nothing every game.  That is why you have to play ARAM every 3 games. I've encountered some supports who look into your situation even watching the replay of the game. But I've encountered many lazy supports just wanting to look at your past actions and attack you. Your past actions being from those trustful toxic players who report you because you didn't make it in time to help them or you didn't follow the build they want you to play. I'm keeping it real but I know most of the toxic player base dwells on the boards too. But I'm keeping it real, that is how Johnny C do! \r\n\r\n\"I was asking this here support on my other account why their support team are lazy and suck. I found out they they don't have a central authority in the player support division. Meaning there is no one managing the player support team. They are pretty much only graded based on your surveys at the end of the support ticket. I'm sure this is in the wrong spot but I'm just keeping it real for you all. That is how Johnny C Do. They is how Johnny C Do.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-08-30T02:18:04.361+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello.

If you had some actual constructive criticism then that would be one thing, but your post was nothing of the sort and was just you being rude and disrespectful, hence the deletion.\n\nIn the future if you can't voice your grievances without resorting to things like insults and the like then don't respond at all.\n\nEDIT (8/30/19): Neglected to mention this before (and apologies for that) but I wasn't the one who handled this deletion. Also us volunteer forum mods don't work for Riot so please keep that in mind for the future. Looking back on it now with a fresh mindset I can see why you might be confused by the deletion. Your post was in the TFT Bug Report subforum, which is for TFT related bugs, which your post was not. My guess is the OG mod who did the deletion saw the first line &amp; the forum it was in and decided to file the deletion under DBAJ.\n\nPersonally I don't have a problem with you posting it again, though obviously it would have to be in a different forum. Also I would recommend it be without the \"why their support team are lazy and suck\" line, as that's just needlessly antagonistic imo and doesn't really contribute anything to your topic as a whole from what I can tell. I'll try to get that mod to chime in here though so please be patient until then.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-08-30T03:08:59.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> In the future if you can't voice your grievances without resorting to things like insults and the like then don't respond at all.\n\nPrandine, with all due respect, I think this is a little bit of an overstep. I'm not sure if the proper interpretation of the universal rules stretches to disallow expressing...intense...displeasure with Riot.

Looking back at the post now with a fresh mindset I can see both sides of the coin. On one hand everything after the first sentence is fine, but on the other hand the first sentence can definitely be seen as insulting. Also it appears as though the OPs thread was originally posted in the Teamfight Tactics Bug Report subforum. My guess is the OG mod who did the deletion saw the first line &amp; the forum it was in and decided to file the deletion under DBAJ. I can definitely check with the mod who handled the deletion though and see if they are willing to comment on this post. I've also edited my original post as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-30T03:30:43.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prandine,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=R7hEoGnk,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-30T02:18:04.361+0000)\n>\n> Hello.

It hurts my face. Boy, I really hates it.\"\n\nThis is an accurate, informative, useful review. Does it have graphs and big words? No. But not everyone uses graphs and big words and types eight pages in an effort to get their post accepted for Gameplay+ (OOOOO BURRRRN). It's not the nicest post, it's pretty harsh, and I found the \"keeping it real\" part intensely aggravating... but I don't think it absolutely needed to be deleted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-08-30T00:20:12.715+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a comment/post removal it should say in your notifications the reason behind the removal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-08-30T23:15:20.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to add to what Prandine had mentioned, I'm also ok with reposting the material without the insults and in the appropriate board (I think this was in gameplay, iirc?).
