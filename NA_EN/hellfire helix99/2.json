My mouse continues to be responsive during gameplay and all functionality related work as expected. My voice chat continues working flawlessly. As op said, I am also only having this problem in league, and ONLY while in game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellfire Helix99","date":"2016-08-04T20:10:14.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition, this problem only occurs when playing League of Legends","replies":[]}]}
