If this was back in season 2, I wouldn't have a problem since that was pretty much my normal ping (more so around 120) but now that I am used to 25-40 ping, this is a big issue for me.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I am wired.\r\nSecond, only seems to happen during ranked games (maybe once during a normal).\r\nThird, the only solution I have found to fixing this problem is quitting and reconnecting to the game. (Wouldn't be a big deal if my load time wasn't horrendous)\r\n\r\nNow the weird part here is, the resolution to this problem is by dcing and rcing back into the game. I don't know if dcing and rcing is resetting my IP connection to riot servers or something, but I shouldn't have to reconnect to fix my ping.\r\n\r\nRight now, I am wondering if this problem is on my side (most likely my laptop) or server side.\r\n\r\nPS: before anyone asks, yes I do check ping before entering games.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T22:38:00.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right that reconnecting shouldn't be the resolution to this, and it's important we get this fixed up for good.  Your IP shouldn't be changing, but there may be settings in your OS or network that could be causing issues staying connected to the server.  I suggest going over each step in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to strengthen your connection and making sure everything is setup.  Let me know if you have any issues after!","replies":[]}]}
