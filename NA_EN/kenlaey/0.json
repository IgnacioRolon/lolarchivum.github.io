The Aftershock is active after she stuns or uses R and it gives her magic resist and some bonus armor so you will still be able to turret dive like its a normal build. You just won&#039;t be able to poke as much with your q and it won&#039;t do as much damage but you have more potential in escaping or surviving ganks from the enemy jungle or just a roam from another lane. You won&#039;t have to build Rod of Ages I don&#039;t think so but building in the Morrelonomicon will give you the mana and damage you need. While Liandry&#039;s will give you the health and penetration you need. CDR is also lower on her w so that means she can do better in team fights, and won&#039;t be easy to kill. For defensive items go ahead and build zhyonas or banshees, and for additional damage you can finish your build with Void Staff.  This is also very good for solo q playing a Ap tank that can take lots of damage in but still input lots of damage out. I recommend this for SoloQ and if you play this for sure you will have a fun lane.

Ranged mid champs should not have a problem unless she goes in. If you are a melee mid lane all you have to do is push your lane and roam (i went around with Lee sin and had an awesome game). I wouldn't say this is going to be a huge problem yet, but will need more games against this.","replies":[{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2018-10-17T22:06:06.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird , i main Lissandra (i have lik 250K on her ) and ekko is the hardest match of all , maybe i should try this aftershock thing after all","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-10-16T16:04:34.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello?
