If they start spamming just mute for 3-5 mins.\nSometimes info like I will splitpush, make sure to keep an eye on them is hard to be translated into pings, (make up your own example if you wish)  thus player will at least know that this info won't reach you, so he won't attempt to do anything like this or will be warned.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2018-01-04T23:13:16.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, just pretend they're kittens.\n\nJust start using the laserpointer (blue ping without a name) and they will too.\n\nPeople don't tend to remember neutral experiences; they focus on good ones (sometimes) but mostly negative ones (which telling them they're muted falls under).\n\nThe info is still helpful to the rest of the team.\nThem being muted by one person doesn't change that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mr Jungle OTW","date":"2018-01-05T17:13:26.973+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's an odd question to ask when you've already told others the answer on your other account. \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/uuPx9Ycx-if-you-mute-all-more-than-likely-youll-get-reported?comment=00030000","replies":[{"poster":"Some Random Jerk","date":"2018-01-05T18:53:33.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry friend I don't know you or this other account.
