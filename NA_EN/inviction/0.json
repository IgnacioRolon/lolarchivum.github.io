Well whenever I was getting into the match my screen was messed up so I closed the League and tried to reconnect from the Client but it kept saying I needed to be connected to the Internet \"please check your internet connection\" or something like that. And so I tried closing my client to trying restarting like that but the picture above shows why its not allowing me to do so. And keep in mind I started a match before all of this so if the game finishes while I'm not there more than likely I'll get reported for AFK and personally I'd find it not really my fault for the LoL Client not allowing me to log-in. So, lets not get me banned for something like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T16:57:15.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an issue we're currently investigating, and appear to be happening while trying to login while in a game.
