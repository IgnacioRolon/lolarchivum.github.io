Its upsetting for me to see my Q only bounce twice when it should bounce four times, harming my foes or giving me the last two minions. Thanks for reading this, have a nice day!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-28T17:54:01.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TheLegend127 - \n\nThanks for the report!
