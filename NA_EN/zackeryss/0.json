I wanted to make this thread to honor our most honorable soldiers, who battle for American freedom. These people have gone above and beyond to keep America... American.\r\nhttp://projectfandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/guile-alpha3-fixed-1024x1024.jpg\r\n\r\nGuile.\r\n\r\nThis guy is Super American. know why? He was the MOST American soldier in the street fighter series. Slappin fools for the good ol&#039; America. Literally everything on this guy calls for patriot. He even has the flag, the U.S.A flag, tattooed on his arms. That&#039;s some serious patriotic stuff, seriously, props to him.\r\n\r\nhttp://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/patriotic-gameart-mario.jpg\r\n\r\nMario.\r\n\r\nOk. I have no idea why Mario is holding this flag. Maybe he found it and just wanted to carry it around? Maybe he stole it from someone this 4th of July. But... why would he want to steal this flag? But wait... OF COURSE!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lymzLW8.gif\r\n\r\nThank you Mario. Up next we have someone who pretty obviously deserves to be on this list.\r\n\r\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kF-JVSRcmI0/Tq15hOuzKXI/AAAAAAAAA-c/-Tv4jbkM0Ew/s1600/Captain+America+movie.jpeg\r\n\r\nYep. Captain America. Captain America always fights for justice. Every day, you can expect him to stand up for what he believes is right. Here is a little thing I found from Cap that you might like\r\nhttp://www.stuffeddrunkandmerry.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/captain-america-wikilieaks.jpg\r\nYep. JUSTICE. I mean, even his shield is Red, white, and blue with a star in the middle. How much more American can you get? Let me find an image for that shield... just a sec...\r\n \r\nWAIT... \r\n\r\nWHO IS THAT?!?!??!?!?!!&gt;!?!&gt;?\r\n\r\nhttp://stream1.gifsoup.com/view8/20160310/5299733/captain-america-civil-war-spiderman-takes-shield-o.gif\r\n\r\nNO!!!!
