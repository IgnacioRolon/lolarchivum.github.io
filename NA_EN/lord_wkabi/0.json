Why can Riot not review the logs and bug reports to overturn any penalties enforced on a summoner?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T03:58:54.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have run into the issue we recently made a [**sticky**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/nxyEq9WA-532017-14-screen-directx-error-issues) about. Rest easy knowing that we can see if that issue ended up giving you any unneeded penalties and are willing to help with that as well if possible. In the meantime, I'd strongly suggest trying to delete your game configuration files, as that seems to have been helping for most people!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nHit me back and let me know if that helped!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord WKabi","date":"2017-05-31T00:38:10.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broporo,\n\n   This actually did work for me.
