It's also put supports in a much more interesting spot, where they're able to invest in items rather than being forced to sink anywhere near as much money into vision.\n\nTrinkets are one of the best things that happened to LoL 'lately' and as a support main, I was really happy when they introduced them. Warding was never only a support thing and with a free trinket for everyone, people learnt to use vision to their advantage.\nBut as a support, I still rush Sightstone and change to Sweeper's as soon as possible to achive more vision for my team and deny said vision to the enemy team (to prepare for ganks, etc).\nI prefer Sightstone over Warding Totem since I can instantly place three wards instead of one (or three at level 9 with a 60 seconds cd after each charge). But besides the wards, Sightstone is a rather useless item to me and feels more like wasting an item slot, especially if you can have a Greater Stealth Totem for free.\nSure, your build is all about decisions and finding the best item for what you want to achieve but at this point, chosing between Sightstone and Warding Totem is more about personal preferences than real value.\nI also know that Riot doesn't want to offer upgrades to the Sightstone because they don't want to force supports or junglers to buy this item but I personally do not feel forced to buy it. I just want to buy it - to help my team as much as possible. But I also want it to not feel like a huge sacrifice for supports...\n\n**TL;DR:** Sightstone is one of the few items supports can choose from to actively aid their team (besides tier 3 gold income items, Locket or Mikael's, ...) compared to all the damage items that exist for carries and it feels weak next to a free Warding Totem.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tl8Arxck,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-16T08:33:15.011+0000)\n>\n> Something that is a bit of barrier to appropriate trinket use though for some players is that they're put off by the upgrade cost.

Many players don't upgrade their trinkets because they just spent all their gold on more damage or simply forget about it and noone farms 250 gold and recalls again just to buy an upgrade. Free upgrades definitely would make those items more popular. Maybe even if they'd only be free for the time of the preseason.\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure if it's healthy to offer free counterplay against invisible champions and traps once people reach level 9. Sure, we used to have Oracle's Elixir and still have pink wards for only 100 gold, but both needed to be bought and the ward uses one item slot.\nPlus, offering a free Greater Vision Totem is like removing the gold cost from pink wards. Players could (and I'm sure a lot would) upgrade their yellow trinket for free, place a pink ward and then swap it for the red or blue trinket.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimzzz","date":"2015-07-16T18:15:08.324+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> noone farms 250 gold and recalls again just to buy an upgrade\n\nI beg to differ, especially vs teams with stealth I will always go get that pink ward, multiple times farming just enough and recalling as soon as I can upgrade.","replies":[{"poster":"Falbindan","date":"2015-07-17T11:59:54.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By noone I didn't mean literally noone but about 95% of players in my elo who still think warding/vision in general is a support's job.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2015-07-16T12:14:36.081+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tl8Arxck,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-16T08:33:15.011+0000)\n>\n> Overall we're pretty happy with the ward limit per person.

Because if people can't understand the value of wards, they will not understand the value of CLEARING wards. Which will make the total amount of vision in most games unbelievable large. They might as well remove FOW. \n\nI prefer games with less vision because it enables more action. More vision just makes the game super safe.

If I'm about to tele into a teamfight I might grab an exlir instead of the upgrade. Theres lots of reasons not to take it. \n\nThat said I agree with you you're right, the gold cost is relatively small and for the most part there's not really much point it existing. It only really serves as a barrier for noobs. But in a way that's good because noobs don't understand the value of vision _and counter vision_ so it balances out.

What I'd love even more is if you take this to the logical extreme and completely remove the \"opportunity\" to trash your personal gold to provide more vision for the team.  Trinkets allow vision to be limited by resources built into the trinket system: time, charges, the trinket slot.  Not only does that not need to interact with the gold and stat-item slots, it's actually better if it doesn't.  Gold is an individual resource.  Spending it for diffuse teamwide benefits has strong balance implications.\n\nBecause it can never be a genuine choice to have vision or stats.  The team needs vision, but it also needs some people to have strong stats.  So weakening yourself with vision items (either Sightstone or consumable) is a poison pill that *someone* has to take so that *someone else* can win fights.  And then it turns people off the role that gets stuck with that burden.  Or they just reject it and throw, and everyone has a bad time.\n\nA word like \"selfish\" shouldn't even be able to apply to how you spend your gold; the normal expectation should be that you're spending it to become the best (insert champion name) you can be, to become better at doing the things that champion does.  This should be no less true for peel and heals/shields and magical journeys and eating your friends than it is for dealing tons of damage.\n\nThe competition (maybe you'd prefer if I don't name names) is already proving that allowing supports to be full champions with a similar power level to any other doesn't ruin a MOBA.  I wish a support was allowed to be powerful in this game too.\n\nAs if that wasn't ambitious enough already, I'd also like to see more vision options than just wards or nothing.  Blue trinket hasn't really caught on, probably because the uptime ratio is so terrible compared to leaving a lasting ward; but what if it had a significantly shorter cooldown in exchange for having nearly no duration?  (Or, for that matter, what if it lasted for 10 seconds of vision that you couldn't negate by any means other than leaving the area?)  What if anyone could spend a trinket slot to get (a watered down version of) Quinn, Kallista or even Ashe's vision abilities?  What if Twin Shadows was a trinket instead of an item with unimpressive stats, would it see more use if you could get the active a la carte?\n\nThe current trinkets seem like they might have been intended to be a sort of rock, paper, scissors of vision that never really developed (scrying orb can't be swept, but also can't sweep regular wards and is worse than regular wards if they are not frequently swept).

People who were warding a lot before the reduction in upgrade price were the first to embrace the upgrade price reduction and fall in love with it (like I have).\n\nBut I still commonly run into players who place <6 wards in an entire game and spend that entire game with the starting yellow trinket, some who even place an average of ~2. And I'm including ranked games, and not just all bronze ones. Those people might upgrade their trinket at their first back after lvl 9 if it's free, but that doesn't mean they'll actually use it more.\n\nThe average player in League is vastly under warding right now and probably always has been. Personally I under ward almost every single game. I especially don't buy early greens often enough. Despite that I am almost always the top warder on either team (if you exclude people with sightstones when I don't have one).\n\nWhat players need is a way to learn the value of vision. Vision shouldn't be a thing you almost completely ignore as a new player until you've been playing for days or maybe even weeks. Introduce it in the starter tutorial and make it at least a little relevant, including vs early bots. Right now if you play against intermediate bots the bot 'support' buys a sightstone, almost every bot buys a green ward, and yet none of them ward things. Those items just sit in their inventory useless. A simple 'if safe, ward these certain spots with trinket/sightstone' addition to their AI would be a great start.\n\nOf course what people really need is a bit more than that. They need clearer ways to understand the value of vision in their regular games vs players. They need better post game metrics related to vision (and they should be accessible without opening a web browser). Partly they could use some community involvement like user made tutorials on warding and sweeping wards.\n\nYou can't force a horse to drink the water.

When people ask for combat stats on Sightstone they're not asking for a 2500 gold item with 80 AP and 15 magic pen or whatever, they basically just mean an alternative to Ruby Sightstone (similar price) that instead of giving a flat amount of health, gives a smaller amount of health and a more relevant stat like AP or AD. It would still be a horrendously slot inefficient item regarding combat stats, with essentially no reason for a carry to take it over Greater Stealth Totem, it'd just feel better on supports and junglers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nutty","date":"2015-07-16T20:58:39.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tl8Arxck,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-16T08:33:15.011+0000)\n>\n> Overall we're pretty happy with the ward limit per person.

They've introduced cheaper and more accessible vision tools but they had to put in the ward limit so that a team couldnt just remove FoW completely (supports would upgrade their sightstones and just pump out wards like no tomorrow, as well as junglers) If there's one thing I absolutely agree with one hundred percent right now, it's the vision changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-07-16T14:56:49.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"make cv a support mastery and remove the spellvamp/lifesteal mastery let the cv recover some sightstone wards over time so you dont have to back to base all the time to refresh or based on how many wards you already placed let it give you 1 free sightstone ward for every 6 or 10 wards placed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RISE Shlack123","date":"2015-07-16T13:30:20.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed that no matter what role I play, I tend to do the most warding.
