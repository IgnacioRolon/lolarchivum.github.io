I am a budding composer that loves video game music and the music of LoL, and was just curious.

For one thing, coming up with music is our job. That's what we love to do, what we're good at... why give away all the fun? We also have a very privileged perspective on what we do. We talk to our writers, designers, artists, etc. No music is really born in a vacuum, we strive to make it really specific to each champion/event/skin, etc. As knowledgeable as they are about League of Legends, our players don't have the necessary background on what it is that we are working on. \n\nI'm not going to delve into the legal ramifications of this matter, but let's just say that would be a severe _faux pas_.\n\nSo... community, don't worry about posting your work, we won't steal it!","replies":[]}]}
