Let's be 100% honest: When you just hit 30, would you, as you know now, consider yourself properly prepared for ranked? Now add about 10-50 champions to memorize in addition to when you started. 30-40 champions in my case, for example.\n\nNow, what about other people? Ranked doesn't NEED a small barrier - it is the big show. It's the main attraction for many people, and the last thing that people need for their main draw is people that aren't near experienced enough to come into what is supposed to be the Adult Swim of the game, where only those mature enough and ready for everything should be. \n\n10 bans total is not anywhere near unreasonable right now. If that means that new players need 20 champions or whatever instead of the previous 16 or so, then, uh... so be it. It gives them more time to prepare while they gather the necessary champions. The only people it might stymie are smurfs, and they're smurfing so they're likely to know what they're in for ahead of time and decided to do it anyway, so there's no reason to keep the barrier low on their behalf.\n\nI'm not seeing where the cons outweigh the pros. I can see them evening out against the pros, but not outweighing them. As for stagnation: I don't play ranked myself, and from what I've seen it really isn't stagnant enough right now to give two shits about complaining about that, even in those featured games.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-04-06T05:07:47.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> When you just hit 30, would you, as you know now, consider yourself properly prepared for ranked?\n\nI'll be honest, I don't remember how I was at 30. It was over two seasons ago, things were a lot different then. I don't THINK it was too bad though, otherwise I'd have never really kept up with ranked. Honestly though, 30 levels is a lot of time. Unless you're dumping money into boosts, you do have to work for it. Its plenty of time to gain enough experience for, at the least, bronze or silver. \n\nAnd as I mentioned, the issue isn't entirely about players getting into ranked. Its also about how the bans themselves would be used. In the LCS, it would be used to ban out entire players. Imagine if Faker couldn't play any of his mids. Does that seem like a fair match? And, yes, you could say \"But he should know every champ!\". Which is fair, but EVERYONE those 4-5 champs which they absolutely rock at compared to the rest.\n\nAnother con is that it would reduce diversity. Right now, there are plenty of strong champs, and not enough bans for all of them. Which is entirely the point, atleast this way all champions have a chance of making it onto the field. If there were more bans, then some champs would LITERALLY be permabanned, in which case the next best champions would be permapicked. It just creates a revolving door.  \n\nThe other argument, to my recollection, is \"Let people choose their own bans!\". In which case, people would only ban what benefits them, not the team. Going Heim mid? Ban Syndra. Want to do Fiora top? Get rid of Jax. While this is possible in the current state of affairs, it is the HOPE that the captain has the sense to use the bans for the sake of the team, rather than himself.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-04-06T15:32:34.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure you could ban out a person, but doesn't that take bans from elsewhere?

What Riot ought to do is set up the idea that we've been recommending over and over - everyone gets a ban. \nThis way, everyone can ban the one champ they don't want to see in the game, and we have our 10 total.  \n\n\"Wait Keev, you aren't thinking about the players starting up ranked for the first time!\"  \n\nYes I am.  If you're starting ranked with the bare minimum of champions, you have very little to counterpick with.   Now factor in how little playtime you'd have to get enough IP to get the minimum. You could potentially throw the game from champ select due to the lack of picks or the lack of game experience.  When you're playing longer, you're being exposed to the game more,  you're seeing what the champions do and how they fair against certain picks, you're learning how to build, and are improving as you become more experienced.\n\nLet's move away from the fresh starters, what about the rest of us?  Well, what about us?  People complain about the static meta every time one has appeared.  With 6 bans, meta picks still get through.  With 10, the pool becomes more limited, and we are in a position to alter the flow of the game right from champion select.  In the next game, a different 10 could be banned, and thus different picks come out.  Sounds like healthy diversity doesn't it?\n\n\"But I'm a one-trick-pony and can only fall back on 1 champion if they're banned!\"\n\nSo playing 1 champion and becoming powerless after 2 button presses isn't your fault in any way?

I'm not sure what \"more bans\" would do, honestly. Lemme just randomly spout out a wall of text here. \n\nWhat is a ban? Well, it's the idea that there are certain champs that people don't want to play against, be it because they're incredibly hard to deal with (read: {{champion:19}} back in preseason) or that people just think that they're stupidly OP (read: {{champion:53}}). Bans allow people a surefire way to counter something: the captain just make sure people can't even play the champ.\n\nThere are currently 123 champs in the game. In most ranked games, it's likely some champs aren't owned by anyone (à la Urgot back before he was cool). Why do I assume this? I think that the amount of IP it takes to buy champs is somewhat high (especially if you're going for 6300 IP champs like {{champion:103}}  or something), so it'd take a hella lot of grinding to get to all 123. Most people are going to buy champs that seem like they're effective/fun, so stuff that isn't either of those probably aren't high on the priority list. (Think...maybe {{champion:133}} , who is apparently super buggy, moderately effective, and costs 6300 IP.)\n\nSo, let's say that between all ten players, they have around 80% of the champion pool. So that makes it around...what, 100 champs? So you're really not banning out much of the champ pool at all with six bans.\n\nFor most players, I honestly can't see the problem with having more bans. More bans just means that people'd have to have more champs before going into ranked, and they'd have to worry about more \"meta picks\" getting banned out, as well as a higher probability of getting banned off your main(s). It's pretty standard for people to get a solid roster (around 5 champs) of their role as well as a couple others to fill if need be, so I don't think people will ever get banned out in most games.\n\nI think one-trick-pony players at high MMR will suffer if there are more bans, even with only two more. Example: Pretend I'm a high elo player (hah that's funny) and I think Annie Bot is in my game, because I know he was queueing up at around the same time as me. I know how lethal that person is on Annie, so I instaban it. Thus, he's forced to play a champ that he's not amazing at, thus giving my team a better shot at winning. More bans would make this procedure more common; you can ban out the stuff you wanted _and_ the one-trick pony's champ. \n\nThe question is, should Riot punish people for becoming absolute masters of a single champion? My gut instinct is \"yes\", because to be good at the game, you should be able to master all facets of it, and that includes each role. However, there's an equally strong argument for \"no\"; by specializing towards one champ, you show dedication and deeper knowledge of mechanics than someone who just fills for the team. Why shouldn't you reward that dedication? This also touches upon pro players; those players have mastered a few champions to a high degree, and so allowing more bans can force play to play sub optimally on champs they don't have as much experience with. I dunno about you, but I'd rather see amazing play on a couple of champs than pretty good play on a lot. (That's my personal opinion, so feel free to disagree.) \n\nWhat I don't think more bans will do will be to cause metas to move faster. There's no reason that more bans won't just expose more powerful champs; if anything, I think there'll be a brief period of quickly shifting meta as some of the bans that people wanted to ban come down, and then a rise of a new meta right in its place. Then the meta will semi-stagnate again. I think FOTM champs will see shorter lifetimes, due to the capacity of the ban phase to incorporate those champs more easily without giving up meta-strong champs, but I don't think they'll ever go away completely (because bans tend to lag the most after a champ becomes OP).\n\nI also don't think that more bans will allow the banning out of entire compositions, unless the number of bans goes up to like...maybe 20% of the roster. I feel like the general idea of a composition will keep even with more bans; you'll just have a suboptimal champ filling in the same role. If they're someone that can make solo plays, well so's the better!\n\nUh, that's just my opinion.
