That root duration is too high considering the fact it goes through minions and gets stronger as it goes through them, plus the damage on that ult is absurd considering you can't even see the windup and it's uninterruptible. If a champion's only real drawback is the lack of reliable mobility, you fucked up somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"AR URF","date":"2018-12-22T01:34:43.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Refer A Friend 1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4ctrEQG5,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-12-21T21:36:16.260+0000)\n>\n> People complain about damage as a whole.

She has one brief mobility, and Any player worth their salt isn't going to fall for the 3 second clone who doesn't even attack.\n\nShe doesn't have a Stealth. I don't know where you get that she does lol. She \"Vanishes\" for a half a second while casting W, but that keeps her in place.\n\nHave you even ATTEMPTED to escape using her R? The Stun only lasts 1.25 seconds max.. Most of the time it does nothing at all to gain distance, because when it's actually casting, IT STOPS HER FROM MOVING. Any champ whose actually chasing her..... should have enough gap closers in their kits to compensate for whatever small distance it makes.\n\nYou're basically arguing that any champ that has multiple CC's is broken, and has \"escape mechanisms\"","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2018-12-22T03:48:05.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You asked a question, I gave you the answers.
