Meaning that the game may have already transitioned to the loading screen and your network is trying to catch up.  You'll want to go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tighten up your connection as you transition from champ select to the game.

You can also still have an unstable connection without completely cutting off.  It's really important to go over those steps in the guide to rule out possibilities.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
