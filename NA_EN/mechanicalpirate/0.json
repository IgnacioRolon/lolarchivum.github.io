Yeah she was a little overtuned when she was first released, but they continued to nerf her little by little until she became pigeon-holed into building tank due to one powerful form of CC (Hello Elise). I use to love playing Rek'Sai top, but after the most recent nerf to her rage generation upon resurfacing, she just cannot sustain herself against characters with way more powerful kits (which includes practically every top laner). \n\nInteresting, unique champion turned \"knock-up bot\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fowus","date":"2015-09-28T02:32:55.770+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, she's just a knockup bot at this point :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"pPbwi30RyP","date":"2015-09-28T18:16:34.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"overnerfed champ:(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ignis0","date":"2015-09-28T12:22:34.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather see some sort of sustain type added to her kit like a shield when using q or life steal in the e.
