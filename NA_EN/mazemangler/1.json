On old karma her shield was an actual **shield** that could save an ally's life (around 700+ hp with 500 ap) and if mantra'd would comletely change the landscape of a team fight. Her Old Q and New Q are both good spells if viewed alone (in fact, many could say new Q is better), but in context of their current kit's, I'd say old Q had more synergy than her new Q does. New Q just doesn't really do much for controlling the flow of battle like the old one did, and it's tiny aoe coupled with the fact that the rest of her kit wants to hard engage (with that snare and speed boost shield) her new Q actually fights against her kit to some extent by wanted to be as far away from the fight in order to wear the opponent down instead.\n\nSo, in the end, I feel that several aspects in her kit are: 1) fighting against each other, and 2) limiting themselves due to providing too much utility (shield suffers in raw shield due to the really powerful haste it has, my favorite aspect of old karma[shield bomb] was removed due to aoe shield+haste being too strong)","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-08-14T16:05:54.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nostalgia is not a reason to change a champion back to what they were.

It's okay, but honestly, come late game, it's just a drop in the bucket with all the damage being thrown out. More often than not, I'm using my shield more for the haste it gives rather than the raw shielding  power it provides. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'd like to see a champ's shield actually be about it's raw shielding value instead of what paltry bonus it provides. (look at every other shield a supportive champ can give their allies. Not one of them is defined by it's raw hp value, but rather what special effects it gives. Janna gives ad, morg gives cc imunity, lulu gives pix, karma gives haste) Honestly before both karma's rework and janna's nerfs, janna had a very comparable shield to karma's as far as raw damage is concerned, but janna rarely ever built and solid ap as a support because she had so much utility, she benefited more from building more utility and facilitating her team that way. (just so you know, janna's raw hp got nerfed so that riot could buff the amount of ad the shield provided, it wasn't because raw hp shields were bad)\n\nAnd yes, nostalgia is not the best of reasons to revert changes, but that doesn't mean we can't learn from what was to improve what is now. And that's what I'm trying to point out. Yes old karma had her problems. But they weren't so bad that it merited such a drastic change.\n\n(also, as a side note: no, I don't want karma to have her old passive back.

Honestly I think she relies too much on q. What is q? wave clear, poke, main damage, main and safe way to refund mantra, most damaging, zoning, burst damage. Then we have a rather weak shield on it's own that can be useful and saves lives from time to time. w that has it's moments (are they close, do they have low health) but is so overlooked which makes sense; why would you want to go all in for a delay snare with meh damage. It was very good that they buff the ap scaling which is what the non empowered spell needed but they could've kept the some sort of multiplier on her w but it doesn't help with the poor utility it has. When she builds on ap the only thing scary about her is her mantra q, not her shields, and definitively not her w. which brings up another point why are we jamming her q with so much power. Nid gets fried for having her spears doing one shots (still gets fried for having javelin toss) and her rework did a good job of making her other skill other than pounce and heal important/relevant other than keep it\"cougar is tankier and faster transform to get away\". I get that soul flare is less of a problem because it doesn't scale off of distance, has mantra limitations, and opponents can simply walk out of the explosion (which is like 1/4 of the mantra damage) but really the direction Riot is taking her she is an overstuff q. Riot should revisit her kit once more to smooth her out her power rather than what they have been doing for her which was let raise up her numbers once more.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MazeMangler","date":"2015-08-14T08:24:57.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all: \n\nThank you\n\nThanks for replying in such a frequent manner. I lurked around the boards and i thought it was disturbing how few red responses showed up. That changed and i and i think almost everyone who uses this forum is gratefull for the change. Especially you... they call you ,,the saint'' already ^^.\nWell less fawning and more usefull conversation i guess:\n\n\nNow that you mention it, you are right. It would be just another point-and-click-protection. The problem that this skill causes is the intersection with mantra'd e, especially after the latest buff (? i think it was one?). The damagetransfer would have to be so strong that it's worth more than the aoe-shield that doesnt have a healthcost. Of course there could be synergy too: singletarget-bullwark with w AND e.\n\nTo hold it back from being op, there could be a set limit of damage until the tether breaks. If that happens, there could happen two things, according to the state of the ability:\n\n1. It's op:\nWhen the limit of damageabsorbtion gets trespassed, the tether breaks and karma gets X% damage of the already absorbed damage as bonusdamage ( think of a zedult ). This would ensure that hitting the primetarget wouldn't result in absolute frustration for the enemyteam. In reality they would do more damage, just not on that vayne that uses the extraseconds pretty well.\n\n2. It's underpowered for an ult:\nWhen the limit of damageabsorbtion gets trespassed, the tether breaks and karma and her ally give of an empathic shockwave around them (wild guess: 200-350 aoe), dealing X damage (think of a maokaiult). This would ,,reward'' the karmaduo for taking the damage and staying close to an enemy. It is also reminiscent of the shieldexplosion a rather unique skill (i am a little sad- from explosive shield to MORE shield in one patch).\n\n\nThere are other levers that could make this ability unique. For example: Multiplicate the damage karma receives (1.2x?), Give the ally armor and magicresist, duration and range of the tether, let Karma press w again to break the connection, or let enemys BREAK the connection when they walk/dash through the tether (nice idea from CakeTheIvany below) . And i bet you guys could come up with better ideas.\n\nWell, i hope i could show that this ability could be balanced so karma wouldnt be the best livesaver by far.

While in her current state she is decent, her entire identity (even the fans!) has been foregone.\n\nI know her Q and E are in a good place right now, but her W is a very simple spell. It could use some kind of overhaul to at least give some karma back in her name.\n\nW Enemy: Enemy cast remains the same\nW Ally: (New) Transfers X% of damage taken from target to Karma.\n\nMantra W Enemy: Reduce duration of root slightly. % of damage done by target is dealt at the end of the duration of the tether.\nMantra W Friendly: (New) Transfers X% of damage taken from target to Karma. At the end of the duration of the tether or when it is broken, all damage transferred is returned twofold to attackers.\n\nThis matches the ideal of Karma -- give, take -- that each of her abilities used to have and which she has now lost entirely.\n\nedit: To answer the question in your post.\n\nWhen Janna and Lulu shield you, they enable you to win trades in more reasons than just because you have the shield. Pix and the AD boost mean you are more confident that you will come out on top of a trade, while a speed boost only helps you to actually engage. Because of this, Karma support is left with the choice of maxing her Q and dealing good poke or maxing her E and being a lackluster version of Lulu.\n\ndouble edit:\n\nThought of something really cool!\n\nMartyrdom! Soraka kind of already does this, but she cannot actually kill herself. What would be really cool is if Karma *could*, and if she died as a result of the transfer damage her ally gained an invulnerability shield. Karma gave her life to protect her ally, and in making the sacrifice she was able to do great good. That fits the religious idea of Karma perfectly.
