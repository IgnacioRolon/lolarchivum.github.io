Normal MS, no fps lag, everything was working fine. I then go to start a new game and my ping spiked all the way to 400 and constantly stayed there. I did router resets, checked for downloads and even tested other games for connection issues. The thing is, I only found connection issues for LoL. Has anyone else that has had this problem that could share to me what they did to fix it? Would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T02:53:38.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there's specifically an issue in your network routing to our servers.

It's only LOL I have a problem with. I'm about ready to not play the game again because it's full of bugs. They have all kinds of cash to pay for LCS events but none to stick into a server. It's pretty sad.","replies":[]}]}
