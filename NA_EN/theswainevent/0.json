I worked hard to climb from b4 to silver. I dont think its fair to lose out on ranked rewards. I can understand losing honor level but to take away rank rewards is cruel after all the effort and time we put into rank. Only reason i was suspended was due to teammates trolling me in rank and me tilting back a little too hard. Yes i must take responsibility but i dont think skipping to the suspention was fair. I heard riot has suspended a lot of people within the past month and it seems concerning. I acvepted the fast that i kost my honor level and coulnt have my suspention lifted but seeing that i wont get my ranked rewards puts me down a lot knowing i wasted my time playing rank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T17:12:32.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, unfortunately suspended accounts after the set August date won't receive borders or any season rewards.  :(","replies":[]}]}
