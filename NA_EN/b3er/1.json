So sometimes more is better, granted you may have to spend a little extra time typing it out.\n\nMy two cents. Generally if you say you want to help and explain your plan, teammates are more understanding than if you just ignore them.","replies":[{"poster":"B3ER","date":"2014-11-18T22:07:21.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a slow typer. :(\nPartly from being slow myself and partly from having deep keys in my keyboard.

Only do this if you're confident you can win if the enemy jungler comes for a counter. Toplane is probably the snowballiest lane atm, if you can get an advantage and freeze it there's not much the enemy can do about it. \nAnd don't play junglers that are only good at ganking through river because river will most likely be warded. Take something that can gank from the lane brushes.\n\nAlso, if you're doing golems and your trinket is up, just do a drive by gank for some zoning/damage and drop a ward on your way out. Since nobody starts with wards anymore you'll only going to have your lane warded 50% of the time. Botlane can avoid this by cycling their wards and midlane is a short lane populated by champions who can destroy waves from the safety of their tower.","replies":[{"poster":"B3ER","date":"2014-11-18T22:05:54.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of my games I do my level 3 gank in top lane.

At my rank top laners forget to ward at 3 minutes. (too focused on securing early advantages).\n\n3. The longer I wait, the more tanky/slippery they get therefore harder to gank. \n\n4.

Also a lot of less skilled players consider it your \"job\" to do all the work for them.  Depending on what jungler you are playing, perform to their strengths.  Farm if you are a farmer and gank if you're a ganker.  There is nothing WORSE then ganking when you're weak and giving up kills and possibly buffs over to the enemy lane.  As for your second point, if they are relying on you as a crutch, they themselves already most likely don't understand it, so they will blame you no matter what as long as bad things happen.  One thing I will say in their defense, though, is if they ARE being camped/ganked, you either need to be there to help or doing something ELSE on the map objective based, be it kills or tower/dragon, because if you're just afk farming when they are getting dove, that is bad in most cases.\n\nYou also are making the right choice in abandoning a losing lane, especially if they lost it themselves 1v1.  Just make sure you are actually trying to do something constructive.  If a lane is being ganked, it means you can exert pressure where the opposing jungler isn't.  If you don't see a good choice, then counterjungle, it being your smallest \"victory\".  As far as baddies go, not much you can do bro.  Just play your game and play the best you can, don't rage/be toxic, and you'll be good to go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EMOFRATPARTY","date":"2014-11-16T00:13:02.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">My point is, though, that some players can be complete fucking cunts.

Try not to react so strongly to feedback that may not be constructive; focus on your game and if that happens to intersect with ganking for the people who might have been upset, so be it.  \n\nLike many other Summoners are saying, you can mute them and still communicate with pings, but consider how you *want* to be affected by criticism.  We're not pros.  Mistakes happen.  Keep your head up and remember that it's just a game, albeit a very competitive one.

Obviously you should focus on other lanes to get them fed but also try and help Top even if its just to let them get some farm for awhile. Another thing you can do is tell them to take Golems/Wight when they can, it makes them think you are still helping them even if you cant actually go up there and help. If you succeed in getting Mid fed, ask them to go Top to help so you can focus on objectives and Bot lane.
