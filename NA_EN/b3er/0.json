Next year she seems like a strong, but not guaranteed, contender for a spot though.

If you want Eve to fit the agony and torment thing then she needs to be diving in like Xin Zhao, killing the squishies over the course of a couple of seconds. But Eve dives like Vi, to initiate on the backline and let her team kill everyone while she... tries not to die. Vi is actually a kind of iffy example because she has significantly more DPS than Eve does after the initial burst.\n\nI think it's actually quite a clever assessment of Eve that she should be a diver rather than an assassin, but she needs to be a damage-oriented diver at the very least whereas right now she's leaning more towards the type of diving a tank does.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Fury","date":"2016-04-28T00:10:33.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a bit late to this discussion but I had an idea for Eve to be the diver that tries to stay and defeat her opponent at all costs.

This puts a massive slow on their entire team AND gives you a 1500 shield - which sets your team up for success.\n\nNow, the more common route is when someone else initiates (either on their team or on yours) - I come from the side/behind and almost ALWAYS am able to get a 3 man ult (generally on the ADC/APC/support) but I aim my ult in the area that I will hit the MOST people, not always on my target (this is pretty important) \n\n**Finally, You have your W to close a gap, you have your blue smite to slow your target and close a gap, you have flash, you have your ultimate slow, AND you should have rylais which is a perma slow - this gives eve a TON of things to allow her to stick to her target** \n\nI generally try to blow up the apc or ADC (I normally can with a combo by mid-late game with a bruiser build). but if they kite back / live with the help of the support you will be tanky enough to run away after you use your combo - this will at the very least leave them with low enough health that they likely will be out of the team fight","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2016-04-27T18:48:07.727+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":12,"body":"You talk as though you yourself weren't personally responsible for the way Eve is right now.\n\nYou say she's supposed to be an Assassin?

Evelynn is probably the least mobile assassin in the game, and her binary stealth mechanic doesn't seem like a fair way to shore that up. \n\nDid Evelynn see any  noticeable difference after the removal of Runeglaive (during whose reign Evelynn received a mana cost on her W that was not adjusted for after Runeglaive was removed)? \n\nWith the upcoming mage update and the tendency of mages to focus on building mana, where does that leave Evelynn?

I like the original Ult way better just because it was true assassin evelynn. Kill one target and instantly focus on another. Also it was mentioned that evelynn was vampire or whatever. She did lots of damage and healed her on a kill also gave her resets.

With a few tweaks she could go from tank to assassin. \n\n1.  Her w should put her passive off of CD and make it half the sight range too. This way when she gets seen she can enter stealth more easily. \n\n2. Give her a reason to want to flank and skirt the back lines before going in. Give her q a small stacking DoT (let's call in torment) that slows a target by 1% for each stackof torment. At 5 or 10 stacks it slows in an area. And begins to stack torment on other champs. She fills her target with pain and makes it that the rest of the team doesn't want to be near. Making assassination easier. \n\n3. Give her ult damage scaling from tornent stacks on a target. And a larger bonus shield for how many stacks of torment they had. \n\nThe biggest problem with these changes is that they could also be played as a diver. To avoid the tank build, give the ap scaling a tweak. Or make it so that the stacks of torment will only stack on one person until you get to 5-10 stacks. Anyone else that gets hit will have the stacks start at one on them and removed from the original target. Also tgis is just something that I thought about for the past ten minutes so there are likely more problems. But just throwing in My two cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gear Kitty","date":"2016-04-28T16:04:52.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On paper, Eve's kit theme says Assassin/Skirmisher. Stealth has always been key to her identity, and the design and play space of \"only True Sight and mid-range champion sight can see me\" is integral to her motif.\n\nHowever, the moment you're loaded into a game against actual humans with functioning brains and knowledge of the game's mechanics/meta, she falls flatter than a Jinx.\n\nTo be a (melee) assassin, one must be able to get, and possibly stick, to their target(s). In (almost) every case this involves a gapcloser, sometimes several, in order to reach their high value victim. It's considered normal for an Assassin to dive into the fight, drop a carry and die and be called successful. Eve can't do that.\n\nHer sticking power is hoping they have no CC and only one Slow. Only a couple other (ACTUAL) Assassins lack a Garen-teed way to engage onto their target, and their kits give them different avenues of engagement.\n\n________________\n\nTwitch has proper True Sight Only Stealth to reach his desired position. Resetting on kill/assist gives him away to continue on or get out.\n\nJhin does not want to get close. His entire aesthetic is being THE SNIPER; Slowing traps and long range is how he finds targets.\n\nMalzahar is only classified as an Assassin because of the excessive lockdown he can drop on a single target (as he violently throws up on them).\n\nTeemo and Xerath are not Assassins, Rito. One is a Teemo, the other is just a dedicated-ly long range Mage.\n\nEvelynn and those three are the only \"assassins\" who don't have a sure way of getting to their target. But Eve is the only one who isn't ranged. Convention says that she then must be really good once in melee: in damage output, survival, or other.  The sad part is, she's not.\n\n____________________\n\nShe has DPS damage that requires a ludicrous amount of Offensive Stats to be a kill-threat in the short amount of time she'll have before her target gapcloses away. This flaw in her playstyle means a new (and better) build was found. Tank Eve. Tank build allows her to survive in melee while fulfilling the same general roll as a Sion or Rammus; excessive melee threat and disruption (though for her it's that even tanky, her damage is dangerous over a time) She's better built as a decoy than an assassin.\n\nRiot has made a fix that would alleviate her sticking problem. No, not the Belt, there's a pointy stick with \"_Blank_'s Right Eye\" etched on it, once I find the Rioter who suggested 30-sec CD dash item.\n\n**Grounded**. Give her Q Grounded on first application, for say, 1-3 seconds. Functions like Udyr Stun where it has an application cooldown per target. She has no CC aside from Ult Slow, which is too long of a CD to use like most other Skirmishers use Slows.\n\nIf you don't want to get her a gapclose, she needs something more than what she has to remotely work as an Assassin, especially with more dashes on the way. She's the only Jungler without a gapclose OR disabling CC, which means her play relies on her enemy being bad, not her being good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-04-28T10:48:51.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"problem is her Q spamm and sticking potential make her a better diver/tank than assassin, if her Q was a high scaling, high CD nuke that would make more sense, but then her invis make her talon and we all know talon isnt really fair, i lost my grandma from a heart attack i dont wanna be next","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2016-04-28T07:50:26.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to ask if it is acceptable for a champion to have a kit that does not correlate with a champion main theme.
