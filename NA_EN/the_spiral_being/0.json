I think to streamline with the quality bar or where skins are now, a couple things would need to happen. We would need to re-imagine the shape language for the skin line, which would likely mean cleaning up the skins as a whole, and smoothing them out. I would like to see a darker red being used, in the color pallette because, it is Crimson Elite after all. For Riven, maybe give her some more armor on her lower half, to eliminate the idea of a bodysuit, since she's the type of champion who rocks  armor in the first place.\n\nAgain, just my person opinion.

You should definitely pursue this. Always thought Crimson Elite had potential to be a good skin line.

Maybe that could be the perfect opportunity to get a basic and consistent design down?\n\nYup, Crimson Elite is, in a nutshell, the opposite of the Commando line, which would learn it more toward a Noxian style.  I'd like to see a more unified approach to this line, personally, because I think it would be really cool to have a Commando team versus a Crimson Elite team, but I do agree - I think there needs to be a stronger fiber of continuity throughout the skin line, especially if we'd like to continue with it. I mean, that's what makes the really strong skin lines, right? Like Arcade! \n\nI wasn't working at Riot when the discussion of Crimson Elite Katarina was going around, but from the looks of the comments, it wasn't up to par with our quality bar for skins. That's not to say that it will *never* be seen, again, 'cause you never know (and I actually don't either!). We tend not to confirm a skin until it's at least on PBE for reasons like this - we don't want to set expectations or let people down, should the initial idea we come up with not be the strongest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swwillffx","date":"2014-10-17T14:17:59.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Also, hasn't there been a Crimson Elite Katarina in the works or hinted at or whatever for the longest time?

Just curious to see what you don't like and how you'd make it better! ^-^\n\nWith Crimson Elite Riven I'd suggest removing the helmet and give her red hair or her regular colored hair with a ponytail or something. The helmet to me looks ridiculous and is one of the main reasons I don't use the skin. If you do keep the helmet, change the design a bit but don't make it fully cover her face like Talon's, he looks like a beetle and he could stand to lose the helmet or have it designed closer to Riven's version.\n\nKeep the skin tight suit, I like that. I feel the cape needs some work too. It doesn't flow as well animation-wise (I guess cause it's an old skin) and would like it to probably be a little darker with some more designs on it and possibly longer reaching just above her rear. Don't cover the rear, we gotta keep dat shiny booty. Probably the saving grace of the skin.\n\nThe boots could use some work. It just looks so plain. The color of the rune on Riven's gloves could also be darkened a bit. Also, maybe move the insignia that's under Riven's chest to above her chest. I don't know why but having it under her chest looks like it could hurt. Just my two cents on the whole thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2014-10-17T20:53:14.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that Crimson Elite Talon is Talon's best skin- the helmet reminds me of Judge Dredd, and I like the way the blades are shaped.\nI want to like Crimson Elite Riven, but I don't. It's Riven in a black rubber skinsuit with a helmet that doesn't look in any way related to the rest of the skin. I guess it makes sense to have the golden helmet (something to share with CE Talon), but the skin doesn't offer much else. The arm bits are lumpy and out-of-place in-game. We already have Battle Bunny for a skintight pervy skin. Perhaps the collar/cape thing could be made more imposing?","replies":[{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2014-10-17T21:11:51.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!

The gauntlet does not fit well with the rest of the skin, it is far to clunky looking and does not even fit the color scheme.\n\nThe skin line as far as I know was not actually meant to depict the upper echelon of noxus.
