It was whether the punishment fits the crime.\n\nWell, if you had a 25-game CR recently, then yes, the punishment fits the crime. You're supposed to learn from your previous warnings and punishments, and the fact that you continued to misbehave means that Riot needed to take the next step up in punishing you; hence, the 14-day ban.\n\n> You can only see one side of the conversation.\n\nWe only need to see one side of the conversation; yours. You're punished for your behavior alone, nobody else's. If you break the rules, you get punished - it doesn't matter who else broke the rules, or if someone broke the rules worse, **_you alone are responsible for your behavior._**\n\n> You would have seen all the toxicity of their side that i wanted to defend myself.\n\nYou're allowed to defend yourself through using the mute feature. Flaming back is _retaliating_, not defending yourself.\n\n> The Top and Mid lanes fed so they kept trying to ff at 15.\n\nSo? If you don't want to surrender at 15, just vote \"no\", and if they're complaining excessively, just mute them.\n\n> When you only take one side of the chat log it will look like garbage 100% of the time.\n\nIf it looks like garbage, smells like garbage, and feels like garbage, it's probably garbage.\n\nAgain; **_you are punished for your behavior alone. Nobody else types for you. Nobody controls your behavior but you. You are responsible for your own behavior._**\n\n> If the whole chat log was available it would’ve been easily seen i was on the defense.\n\nWe would see that you were on the counter-attack, and it would not change whether or not your behavior was punishable.\n\n> I never harassed.\n\nYou're not the judge of your behavior. Voldymort and Rujitra both gave pretty apt appraisals of your chat logs, so refer to them.\n\n> The only reason i asked for a report was that teemo fed top lane and then sat in spawn.\n\nAsking for others to report someone is functionally useless, and can constitute harassment. The IFS doesn't care how many reports are filed against someone, it only cares that someone is reported period. More reports doesn't increase the likelihood of a punishment. All it takes is _one report_, and someone's behavior will be reviewed.","replies":[{"poster":"Dan Marik","date":"2019-08-29T03:31:49.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I am allowed to defend myself with just above equal force used against me.

This isn't the real world and you are not under threat of physical harm. You agreed to the rules, which do not allow you to flame in response to flame.\n\nThe [Code of Conduct](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#code-conduct) states exactly _**nowhere**_ that you're allowed to break the rules in response to someone else breaking them; it doesn't matter if you're counterflaming, counterflame is still flame, and it's _not allowed._\n\nSo, if you respond to a flamer in kind, you're going to get punished. That's not up for discussion.\n\n> This isn’t a conversation about whether or not I was wrong. I did not harass.\n\nYou can repeat that as much as you want, it doesn't change that your punishment was justified and that you _did_ in fact harass your teammates.\n\n> And calling for reports against a player who is breaking the rules is allowed.\n\nNo, it is not. Report-rallying is considered harassment, as explained [twice here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/k0tL1els-in-the-context-of-asking-for-reports?comment=000000000000) in [this post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/k0tL1els-in-the-context-of-asking-for-reports?comment=00000000000000010000), as well as here in the [Riot Support article \"Reporting a Player\"](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884).\n\n> They later clarified. Asking for reports is considered harassment. It just doesn't rise to the level of things like racial slurs and death threats.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> It was an attempt at providing some clarity to the nuance.\n> \n> Saying, 'Remember to report the graves for constantly telling our top laner to kill themself', is not punishable.\n> Saying, 'Report our top laner for feeding', which they were just having a bad game, is punishable.\n> \n> There was a post on reddit complaining that 'asking for reports causes bans', and there was a lot of conversation about it. This is what prompted the post. It ended up causing more confusion, which is when I tried to explain it a little better.\n>\n> ---\n> \n> **Things to avoid**\n>\n> ...\n>\n> - Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.\n\nAdditionally worth pointing out in that Support article, is this tidbit;\n\n> - Negative behavior is **unacceptable** regardless of the circumstances or who started it. It can be tempting to respond to negative players with negativity of your own. Our systems do not care who started the behavior and will treat each reported player based off the merits of their own case. The only way to handle these types of players is to mute them and continue playing the game followed by giving them a report at the end of the match.\n\nSo, you remember how you said you're \"allowed to respond (to flamers) with equal force\"? Yeah. That's not how it works. If you respond with equal force, you will be given equal punishment.\n\n> The worst that could be considered of me is that I don’t take disrespect.\n\nWell, what can I tell you? You may not take disrespect, but Riot doesn't take people not following the rules. You break the rules, you get punished, and if you flame back when you get disrespected, Riot's going to punish you. Them's the 8r8ks.\n\n> Muting is not a defense mechanism it’s a way to run away.\n\nIt is a defense mechanism, whether you like it or not. It blocks out all of the flame and disrespect from that player 'til the match is over. If you don't use it, that's on you. Just don't complain when you continue to break the rules and continue to get punished because you refuse to use the tools at your disposal.","replies":[{"poster":"Dan Marik","date":"2019-08-29T04:47:05.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Harassment: aggressive pressure or intimidation.\n\nAs this is not the real world I cannot apply pressure and as I cannot be intimidating without using threats I did not harrass. \nI will not need your apology on this. \n\nAsking for reports is not against the rules and therefore is a null-point.\n\nAnd correct, if I respond to equal force I deserve equal punishment.

Thanks.\n\nIn LoL, harassment means giving people flak and bothering them. When you call your teammates \"blind,\" tell them to \"stfu,\" call them \"garbage,\" throw their scores in their faces, and so on, that's very annoying. You were punished for this negative behavior. Since you've done it before, had punishments, and ignored those punishments, Riot is ramping up the punishment in hopes that you'll sit up and take notice. You don't have to agree with the rules, you just have to follow them. If you don't, you'll end up losing your account.\n\nMods have no control over in-game punishments and thus cannot help you here. But if they could, they wouldn't, because your punishment was fully justified.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-08-29T05:05:56.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dan Marik,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bnpE86y9,comment-id=00030000000000010000,timestamp=2019-08-29T04:47:05.753+0000)\n>\n> \n> Asking for reports is not against the rules and therefore is a null-point.\n\nIt is a reportable offense. At best, it’s a useless statement, as it only takes 1 report to trigger a review of one’s actions. At worst, it can be considered harassment, especially if you’re making it apparent that you feel more reports will cause a punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Dan Marik","date":"2019-08-29T21:24:12.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alrighty finally a moderator.
