{"poster":"Of Shipwrecks","date":"2014-10-27T19:27:06.425+0000","title":"NEW Teemo Skin Idea, \"FINDING TEEMO\"","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":132,"down_votes":23,"body":"Okay, so...\r\n\r\nTeemo needs a new skin. And what better than a skin that kinda makes sense along with the name?\r\nSo I came up with FINDING TEEMO. FINDING NEMO. C'mon guys, stick with me.\r\n\r\nNow shortly after I thought about this I googled it, and didn't see any concept art for him at all.\r\n\r\nSo picture this!\r\n\r\nIt's called \"Finding Teemo\". Now Teemo's passive allows him to turn invisible when he stands still, so when that happens the first thing you think is, \"WELL SHIT. WHERE IS TEEMO. I HAVE TO FIND HIM.\" Well when he enters his passive it can be called \"Finding Teemo\" due to him being Invisible and you not knowing where the hell he is.\r\n\r\nSo some more ideas for this is his Shrooms, they HAVE to be Sea Urchins. If anyone out there doesn't know why this is a must, its because Sea Urchins ARE POISONOUS. And if you step on one you're screwed, just like Teemo's Shrooms.\r\n\r\nNext, I figured his Blowpipe can be a long piece of coral, as you can see in my picture. I feel like it would compliment his skin along with his name. Also his darts can be Urchin Quills. Some Species of Sea Urchin toxins can cause blindness if you step on one so it MAKES SENSE for his \"Q\".\r\n\r\nHis \"W\" like on Super Teemo, he flies. So when maxed out on Finding Teemo he can like hover with a motion and swim!\r\n\r\nWhen Teemo recalls he can swim around in little circles.\r\n\r\nI took the time to draw out this picture and then draw it up in illustrator to kind give you guys an idea of what exactly I have in mind. SO lemme hear your feedback, and lets bump this up!","replies":[{"poster":"yupster","date":"2014-10-27T23:17:18.431+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is so awesome!
