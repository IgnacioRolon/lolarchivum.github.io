(7.22 pre-season)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":43,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't know if it's because there's a lot of new shit going on in the game, but I have like 30 lower fps than usual. And then I had low fps to beging with. I have an i5 2400 processor, which isn't that good but it should be enough for LoL and a GTX 1050. I used to have around 100-150 fps before and around 70-80 in teamfights on medium-high settings. Now, I got way lower fps. I'm never over 100 and like 50 in teamfights and there is no way my computer should have that low fps when I can play PUBG with mostly 60+ fps, which is a way more demanding game and in fuckin beta as well.\r\nI think LoL always been a bit badly optimized, since you can see streamers like Imaqtipie hit 75-80 fps in intensive teamfights with his fuckin i7 7700k processor and gtx 1080. Like wtf how is that even possible? The game is very old and looks kinda bad compared to the new stuff coming out (in terms of graphics) and the fps is still VERY low.\r\nA strange thing is that people with similar components to those that I have, or even worse ones gets higher fps. I've tried everything like maxing windows 10 in terms of gaming performance and re-installed the game multiple times but I do think the problem is with LoL, since I got no problems with other games. CSGO is 200+ fps almost all the time with maxed settings for example, and it's a bit more demanding than LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-09T20:40:34.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, I've brought this up to our tech folks and we need ya'll to send in those logs previously requested so we can investigate further.

As I said before, I've always had lower fps than my computer should have to begin with. And I have never had fps issues with any other game. This could have something to do with the ancient game engine LoL is using I have no idea. But I truly believe that the biggest and best video game in the world should function better than this.

The people that made this game good years and years ago are long gone getting their dicks sucked in the Caribbean, now all that's left are these silicon valley morons fucking shit up. Not even asking you to balance it or fix it since we all know you're incapable of doing that. At least make it functional. Fix your fucking game.","replies":[{"poster":"LadyLuxanna","date":"2017-11-11T06:28:15.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol wut","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Diikoo","date":"2017-11-10T21:14:04.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same...\n\nBefore patch 7.22): 160-210 fps all ultra\nNew patch 7.22): Earlygame 70-120, Lategame 22-55 fps... all normal...\nI hate this patch {{sticker:sg-shisa}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starry Meadow","date":"2017-11-10T18:04:40.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a weird issue as of late where my fps start to decline the longer the game goes on. usually start at like 144ish but then around the 20-30 min area my fps drop down to 50 and it's like almost unplayable. leaving the game and rejoining seems to fix it, so i don't think it's a overheating issue or anything. i've tried cleaning out my pc, reformating my ssd, reinstalling league..basically everything but downgrading my drivers. my gpu is a radeon rx 480 with the latest drivers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXLove YaoXx","date":"2017-11-10T17:54:19.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"low fps late to mid game, restart the game, fps went back up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxicYasu0","date":"2017-11-10T11:37:08.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AH THANK GOD ITS NOT ONLY ME. i was soo scared","replies":[]},{"poster":"xSmog hehexd","date":"2017-11-10T01:02:36.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here with gtx 980m i7 6700hq","replies":[]},{"poster":"NONER","date":"2017-11-09T22:37:41.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here...\nGTX 970,I5 6600 and fps drops to ~90-80 in late game teamfights.\nI got 144hz monitor so there is a big difference between 140 and 80 and you can easily feel it...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ßarbØssą","date":"2017-11-09T18:45:34.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me as well, I had into the late game 120 fps or a bit less, but I still didn't experience any short lags/cuts/delays before the patch, so it is definately caused by the new patch (7.22).
