Is the loot system currently bugged? I wanted to play as my robot kitty :( thanks in advance if anyone can help! {{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T02:01:48.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I pulled up your account and saw all the back and forth reversions happening. Since it didn't work the first time, it was most likely due to the skin not having been added to the list yet. I saw you still had a ticket open, so let them know this happened again in your ticket to see if they can get it reversed again.","replies":[{"poster":"Meishan","date":"2017-11-10T06:34:15.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the same boat!\n\nopening a ticket","replies":[]}]}]}
