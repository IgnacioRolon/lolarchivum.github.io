Let's try that reset with the steps below:\n\nFirst, you'll want to **log into League** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your installation folder, which should be here:\n\n> **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nDelete the folder named **CONFIG**\n\nOnce you've deleted this folder, leave the custom match you were in, then hop into another to confirm the reset was successful. Let me know if this worked!","replies":[]}]}
