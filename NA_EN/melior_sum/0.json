Guess what, if you didn't have any MR built back then and they had those items, you'd still be taking near true damage, but you now also have the option of taking things like nullify orb, and dipping into the resolve tree for bone plating and extra hp that will give you much more survivability in lane than some MR blues would, ontop of scaling later into the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-10-05T18:17:57.242+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Not Grouping,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n691E7oY,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-10-05T15:26:15.419+0000)\n>\n> it was a literal staple\n\nhttps://www.qvsshop.co.uk/ekmps/shops/qvsshop/images/metal-pegs-staple-[2]-2103-p.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Slythrin Umbreon","date":"2018-10-05T20:52:21.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://magazine.promomarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/10/Staples.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ætheist","date":"2018-10-05T18:50:04.267+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Our primary aim this preseason is to generally improve the quality of the time spent you spend in game.
