That rune is 100% required if you play solo, the level of damage you take pre-6 is ludicrous, as if it was already bad enough the damage just gets even more bogus at later portions of the game. \n\nIt's very disheartening and discouraging to have legit 6 tank items and still get blown to shreds in less then 2 seconds. The effectiveness of resistances have hit rock bottom in this season.\n\nEDIT - When Bone Plating first came out it last 5 seconds and reduced damage by 20-50. Since then it was nerfed twice, reducing the time to 3 seconds after dmg and reduced damage 15-40. So I have to say that was a pretty big nerf, but Electrocute is fine. Being able to take 20% true damage is fine. Taking 1.5k+ true damage in a team fight that last 5 seconds is fine, bone plating NOT FINE.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2018-08-09T22:27:08.322+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my experience Bone Plating is overrated as hell.

If you have bone plating and they don't, you win the trade. If you both have bone plating the trade then your skill/kit relativity to theirs determines who wins, if you don't have bone plating and they do you will lose every trade unless they mess up or absolutely suck.\n\nIf you take Resolve as primary or secondary, Bone Plating is something you will take 90% of the time because there are no better choices and the fact that it gives you enough survivability to live through some of the burst it's a no brainer, you have to take it. \n\nThe only time I would forgo this rune is if I was playing with silver or bronze players.

Bone Plating, Second Wind / Chrysalis is decent, Overgrowth and MAYBE Unflinching but I find the Precision Tenacity to be vastly superior.\n\nBasically you have to take all the runes that help you survive burst and sustain as long as possible or you lose the lane, but even then it's not always enough, the damage ultimately engulfs everything.\n\nConditioning needs a buff, Font of Life could use some work because it's basically a support only rune, and Unflinching/Revitalize need to be looked at. Personally I feel the value I get from Unflinching/Revitalize is too low for them to be worth taking.","replies":[{"poster":"Shädäm","date":"2018-08-11T03:37:30.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, the only Rune pages that are viable are Domination, Precision and Inspiration.\n\nIn Sorcery and Resolve most tiers have one legit rune.\n\nJust look at second row of Sorc.
