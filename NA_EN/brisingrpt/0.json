My account was in process of transferring. I checked up on the email If I was hijacked and changed the password, the account was still there and I couldn't login in any region. After that I contacted the support and they told me the account was in EUNE server (Previously I created and never changed it from EUW). I tried again on EUNE several times and I couldn't get in.\n\nRight now I tried to log in in my account once again and this message shows up\n\n\"Player Banned\n\nThis account has been permanently suspended. Please check the email address associated with your League of Legends account for additional details\"\n\nI have been talking with the support since 2 days ago. Today I just answeared with some info of the account (Creation date etc) and now I just come up with the account perma banned and no explanation on the email. I'm really worried. I spent a lot of money on that account and I had it since season 1.\n\nEDIT: This wasn't the account that got perma banned, this is another one.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T02:56:01.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Continuing to work with support is the best move here. I understand seeing the account suspended can cause a lot of internal red flags to start going up, but you're already in contact with a specialist that can answer any questions about the account after we've confirmed you're the account owner.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"BrisingrPT","date":"2017-02-23T18:53:03.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your attention and fast response. I already got my account back. It seems that they banned the account intentionally in case that I wasn't the owner of the account and was \"trying\" to steal it. When they verified that the account was mine they gave it back to me.","replies":[]}]}]}
