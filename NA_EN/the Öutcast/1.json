Don't talk to them if possible. Muting everyone is ok, might not result in the greatest synergy, but it's better than tilting from trash talk.\r\n\r\n2. If they add you post game to talk trash, don't accept or decline the request, just let it sit there for a week or so until they forget about you.\r\n\r\n3. If you must talk to them, avoid antagonizing them, avoid criticizing them unless they SPECIFICALLY ask for criticism.\r\n\r\n4. Don't be toxic yourself. You attract the kind of person that you are.\r\n\r\nIf I've missed anything, feel free to comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Sa1nt","date":"2019-11-09T21:46:00.042+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Someone gave me this idea yesterday or the day prior, listen to more peaceful music when people start being toxic. The toxic player gets you excited, while the passive music gets you relaxed. A nice happy medium, so that \"hopefully\" you can stay neutral!","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-11-10T02:45:29.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is effective.
