Understand that if you don&#039;t even consider getting  a sight stone you will be considered a troll at this point. \n\nNow I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s bad to build full ap, items like {{item:3165}} and {{item:3001}} are really good on supports. I&#039;m talking about items like {{item:3285}} or {{item:3089}}. \n\nThere are so many better support picks that these AP champs that have way better peel but I won&#039;t say don&#039;t play them. After all I&#039;m all about playing any champ in any role but that doesn&#039;t mean purchase a mid lane build as a support.\n\nThere are so many great support items, like {{item:2301}} or instead buy {{item:2049}} and {{item:3092}} , theres {{item:3107}}, {{item:3190}} and even {{item:3060}} you can purchase on ap supports. And if you&#039;re doing really well {{item:3041}} isn&#039;t half bad either.\n\nBut no matter what buy a sightstone, it&#039;s the most useful and one of the important items in the game. And try to consider a {{item:3107}} because it&#039;s personally my favourite and I believe its favoured by others as well. Not to mention if the enemy team has one then you&#039;ll need it to counter the enemy teams redemption. Also buy a {{item:3364}}, placing wards are important but clearing the enemy&#039;s wards is equally important as well.\n\nFinally I know that you guys like to get some kills, but please try to let the adc get some so they can do some damage in a team fight for late game.\n\ntl;dr: Buy {{item:2049}} and consider {{item:3107}} and other items. And try to let the adc have some kills sometimes.\n\nedit: I'm talking about ranked matches.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Nihagi","date":"2017-04-02T01:40:38.687+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agree that warding and clearing wards is important.\nBut you should also try and not assume all supports work the same.\nSome champs work better as placebo mid laner depending on your adc partner.\nbasically trying to say, its all about play-style of you and your teammates.\n\nWhile staying to the somewhat meta builds is easier to work with when you play with randoms, cause its what most people are used to play around.\nAsk the adc for what type of play-style they prefer.. and play around that, you are support after all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-02T01:19:24.023+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Luden's a wave clear item, it's pretty stupid to get it on supports tbh.

I haven't seen an AP support in a while without {{item:2301}} . I actually haven't seen one who has done that since last season when you could easily play around these AP picks.\n\nThe issue right now is that there are only two worthwhile items for supports in general to grab. That's {{item:3107}} and {{item:3190}} . They're cheap, and are probably some of the most OP items in the game currently.\n\nAside from that? The support items are all pretty lackluster. Don't buy {{item:3060}} since it's pales in comparison to it's counterpart.\n\nThe only exception is {{item:3504}} for healing/shielding supports. That item is also pretty ridiculous in many different situations. {{champion:99}} won't be putting out that many sheilds, so it isn't useful on her. She should build AP. \n\nI'm a Gold {{champion:16}} main and I hate these mage supports that abuse {{item:3303}} as much as all of you. However they need to build AP to be effective, otherwise there's no point in taking them at the moment.\n\nWe're seeing AP building supports bot lane for 2 reasons.\n\n1. Damage is out of control. Certain AP champions can do so much damage with very little. They used to have a rough time bot against experienced supports, but now their damage is so insane that it is pretty easy for many to get zoned by these guys. {{champion:63}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:99}} \n2. Assassins are OP right now. A lot of supports are having a difficult time protecting their carry after the laning phase. As an AP building support you can delete the assassin before or after they get to your carry, or cause them to disengage and think twice.\n\nThe meta and the increase in damage is at the heart of the issue. Riot will have to step in at one point, especially bot lane. Nobody is having fun there, but for right now? I'd say abuse that crap and build AP, otherwise what's the point of picking that? You'll turn into a burden for the team with not as much utility to fall back on.","replies":[{"poster":"hi im bannned","date":"2017-04-02T19:06:35.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, but peeling adc should be a way better objective instead of support attempting to even killing the assassin when generally during late game its barely do able.
