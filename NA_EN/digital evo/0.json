They have even gone to 0 fps. ZERO FRAMES PER SECOND.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue with my laptop it is high spec. if i terminated the game and reconnected i will be back up to 160fps but as time lapses it happens again!! \r\n\r\nThis makes the game virtually unplayable - i have ran full repair a few times and no difference.\r\n\r\nHELP","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T17:05:36.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your pc may just have some general wear and tear and could use a tune up.
