In order to receive a box, the following must be true:\n\n1. You must own the champion you're playing on.\n2. You must not have earned a box on the champion you're playing on during that season.\n3. Your teammate who S-ranked must NOT have ALREADY EARNED an S-rank on the champion THEY are playing on during that season.\n\nI've received a couple of S-rank boxes from random party members, solo-queue in ranked. The thing to keep in mind is that if you're playing primarily ranked games, the champions that a person are proficient on (aka play regularly, and would more likely S-rank on) will probably be played more often. Meaning if it's not their first few games of the season, the likelihood that they've already S-ranked PRIOR to that game is higher. This prevents you from getting multiple chests from the same person playing the same champion. For example, I jungle primarily Elise and Kha'zix. I have S-ranks on both of those champions. Neither I (nor any other team members during this season where I get another S-rank) will receive another chest on either of those champions.\n\nIf I'm mistaken on this, I would love a red-post response and clarification (particularly on point #3).","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-04-13T14:59:53.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It literally explains it in the link given by the red post.\n\nNotably: \n> If someone in your premade group earns an S rank, you’ll receive a chest as well!

This makes more sense, and I must have been mistaken, and either I S-ranked or been queued with people who S-ranked in those games I was thinking I got from random strangers. I don't duo-queue often, so I didn't think that this was what was happening.\n\nCheers for the clarification.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-04-13T23:43:14.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm pretty sure you can still earn a box for someone else if you already got an S on the champion you played earlier in the season.

You could essentially duo-queue and get chests on every single champion while letting your friend play only 1 or 2 of their absolute best champs and S-rank every game (or near enough to make no difference), capping your chest-gain.\n\nNot that this really makes a huge difference considering the droprate on keys, so unless you're going to end up spending RP on keys it doesn't really benefit you. Hell, I'm sitting on 2 fragments and 4 unopened chests right now, and I haven't even been focusing on chests, and rarely play with friends.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
