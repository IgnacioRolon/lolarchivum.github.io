Especially if they lock in a mechanically difficult or new champion. If it is their first time ever playing the champion, or if they have a 5% win rate over 50 games on that champion, I will dodge the game.\r\n\r\nThis does two things: It makes sure that I don't play with players who intentionally feed every game, and it saves my mmr and LP by preventing a loss.\r\n\r\nThis text is no longer in the client as of the most recent patch, and some players I can still check their op.gg by typing in their summoner name manually. But if their summoner name has special characters that's just impossible. There's nowhere where I can copy-paste their summoner names to check their op.gg.\r\n\r\nI could have an inting player with a 5% win rate or a boosted player with a 45% win rate in my game and not even know it because their summoner name is █╤Θ≥. I'd much rather dodge a game than lose because of this.\r\n\r\nI contacted support and they said that they believe this is a feature rather than a bug so now I'm complaining.","replies":[{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-12-13T03:15:21.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought this was a glitch in the client.
