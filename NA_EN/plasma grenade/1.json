When I reconnected, it was already 1 minute in. Not that bad, but then i went into lane. Xin ganked me twice and I eventually was 2/0/1 and level 5 and decided to back.\nI bought a sheen, and then suddenly got an attempting to reconnect bar at the top of my screen. My wifi NEVER went down, and I never disconnected from it. So I waited about 4 minutes, with no response. I then asked on discord and someone told me to relaunch the game. I did that, it worked, but the level 3 0/3/0 Mordekaiser was now level 6. I couldn't do anything top because he was so far ahead, and then we eventually had to surrender because it was pretty much a 4v5 due to me having been disconnected. I lost my second  promo game due to this, therefore losing my entire series. All because riot randomly decided to disconnect me from the game. Could I be put back into my promos because this is in no way fair.\n\nEDIT: Riot also did some sort of update because when i tried to launch into legacy client it was updating, so this update could've caused this to happen and made me lose my promos","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-31T17:27:37.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I promise we're not trying to sabotage your series and there weren't issues with our servers, but it sucks to hear that the disconnect impacted your game that way.  Even though your net may be working fine elsewhere, you can still run into problems reaching specific servers.  In this game, it sounds like your connection was failing comms with the game server and kicking you off.  \n\nI highly recommend going over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure that your network is tuned up and not degrading to the point of disconnecting you from the game.  Hopefully, this will help prevent the potential of future d/c's.  Good luck on your next games!","replies":[]}]}
