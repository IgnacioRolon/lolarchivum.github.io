No wonder why you’re losing. Although support seems like an “easy” role, it’s not entirely true. Supports need to keep up with vision, sustain their teammates, land cc, assist teammates in kills, engage or disengage, and not tilt when their team is doing poorly. You can also argue that support is one of the most impactful roles IF played right, especially late game. Basically whoever can keep their team alive longer in fights or land a cc chain or can tank a ton of damage, wins. Plus support isn’t a role for everyone, you have to be willing to sacrifice summoners, spells, ults or even your life in order to protect one of your teammates. Like flashing in front of a teammate to block that Cait or Jinx ulti even if it means ou die. You have to be selfless and not blame your team on a simple rune pick or item build, if so, this role just isn’t for you and it isn’t for everyone either. \n\nHave a nice day :D","replies":[{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2017-12-17T20:55:02.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"ohhh man vision easy, cc easy peel easy, not hard to do. people hate doing it becuase its boring","replies":[{"poster":"Spartan DMG 02","date":"2017-12-17T21:15:16.953+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then don’t play support, for me I love peeling, or landing a nice cc chain, or saving my teammate at the brink of death.

The properly timed and placed ward can save your team, let your team pick off enemies, steal objectives, etc. Sure, everyone can ward. But not everyone buys a sightstone. I like the vision game enough that I 'usually' buy a sighstone as a jungler. There's no substitute for vision. Also, you know how when players get to your base turrets and they ward over the wall? A properly placed control ward lets you see and kill their wards, but they can't easily get to the control ward. I've had ward-battles last well over 60 seconds.\n\n- I enjoy making plays. A perfect Alistar Flash-Q-W, an expertly-timed braum shield, a max-ranged Nami heal that keeps your ADC alive AND chunks the enemy down enough that your ADC gets that last hit for the kill, a Thresh Lantern over a wall to save a jungler, an Alistar head-butt that Knocks the Kha'Zix out of the Baron pit to prevent the steal... I could go on and on.\n\n- I like saving the adc and other team-members the enemy considers high-value. Maybe I have a hero complex, I dunno. Sacrificial cow. Taking one for the team. #FeelsGoodMan\n\n- Since you're warding more than anybody (well, you SHOULD be) your map awareness should be consistently higher than anyone else on your team. Ideally.\n\n- Zoning. It's not just pulling merchandise forward on shelves at Wal-Mart.\n\n- You're the power behind the throne. You've seen the Simpsons, right? Why be Mr. Burns when you can be Smithers. Your ADC wants to get fed. Hopefully, you're feeding them. It's not about the glory for you as a support. There are other roles for that. The ADC gets the glory. The ADC gets a triple kill? That's awesome. Chances are they couldn't have done it without you. While everyone else is giving them high-fives and slapping them on the back, you're thinking to yourself \"I made that happen\". While they're boasting in all chat you've already mentally digested the team fight, have taken note of what worked and what didn't, and are planning your next round of ward placement based on towers, position and objectives. While they're playing league, you're playing 3-D chess.\n\n- I enjoy trying to adapt my playstyle based not only the ADC champ, but also (and more importantly) the -player- I'm supporting. Are they aggressive, moderate, or passive? Will they try to freeze lane or even know what that means or how to do it? How are they at CSing - should I swap out ancient coin for relic shield or vice versa? Are they super skittish? Do they push so hard I need to over-ward the river? Are they gonna be okay of I go on walk-about as bard and collect a few chimes, or will I better serve the team by babysitting the Annie main who happened to get auto-filled as ADC? Are they willing to try new things? Will they get that last hit and score a kill or are they going to back off and I should go for the \"Kill Secure\".\n\n- I like item actives. *shrug*\n\n- Generally I like helping people. Don't get me wrong, it's kinda cool to go 19/1/5 as Kalista/Diana/Katarina/Jinx/Yi... but I find more 'enjoyment' and personal satisfaction when I see my ADC has the above score and I've gone 2/4/27 on Alistar at the end of the game. Moo. Who wants steak?\n\nSo, that's why I like 'support' the best. You may think it's easy, you may not. But it's what I like to play. YMMV, and so I suppose it's great there are other roles for other types of players. I think all roles are equally hard to master, and for myriad different reason. Different players will have easier or harder times playing specific roles and positions. I guess it's pretty cool we don't all have to do the same thing, right?\n\nADC is my least favorite role - not because it's hard (it is!) but because I find myself getting bored. Probably means I have much more to learn. And Yet ADC mains love it. And that's not only okay, that's GREAT. I think that Jungle is - by far - the most challenging role there is. I like playing it. It's my 2nd favorite role. And I suck at it. But it's FUN.\n\nAnd in the end, isn't 'fun' what a game should ultimately be about? Unless you're pro, in which case, the fun comes with the paycheck, I presume.\n\nJust my thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Executioner","date":"2017-12-18T21:50:21.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are the try MVP.","replies":[{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2017-12-19T01:00:55.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL... thanks...

ADC in anything but bot lane requires the enemy laner to HARD feed you in order to work out and the enemy jungler to just ignore the lane which is why ADCs in off roles have notoriously had sub 47% winrates across the board because they bring nothing to the team that a typical top/mid laner doesn't bring.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tactrix","date":"2017-12-17T12:36:32.045+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to see a mage jg survive against any real jg, that would be funny to watch.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-12-17T20:31:08.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tactrix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1rTeqpmi,comment-id=0007000000010002,timestamp=2017-12-17T12:36:32.045+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d love to see a mage jg survive against any real jg, that would be funny to watch.\n\nThere are Fiddlesticks, Morgana, and Karthus.
