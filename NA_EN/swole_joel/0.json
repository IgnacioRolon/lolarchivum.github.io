No problems there.\r\n\r\nThen, as the game is loading, I get the message, \"You have disconnected from the game\". I click retry and it goes right back to that message. \r\nWeird thing is, if I disconnect from my wireless network and relog, I can get right back into the game and It's fine from there. I lose about a minute from the game.\r\n\r\nAfter the game, it told me that my account was being used on another device but I've never given my password to anyone and it never said that in the three years ive been playing.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T21:56:30.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the client did pop up saying that you had logged in from another device, that is most likely the reason you were having issues getting reconnected.
