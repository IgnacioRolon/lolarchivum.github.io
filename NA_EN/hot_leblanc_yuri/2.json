He's been popular in competative since his rerelease through thick and thin simply because he's a melee champ who can fight other laners at range.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2019-08-06T19:04:22.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ah its another \"Nerf {{champion:266}} \" thread again. He's actually extremely well balanced right now looking at his winrate across all elos. Sub 50% overall winrate to allow there to be a skill ceiling, low winrate in low elos, high winrate in high elos. It's exactly how a high skill cap champion should be. Aatrox does not need any more changes.\n\nI'm genuinely confused why many non-pro players have a problem with him. I think he's honestly pretty easy to deal with especially after they removed his revive. What else do you want changed? If they nerf him anymore he will probably drop to Kalista \"unplayable in a non-competative setting\" tier and I don't think anyone wants that. Get grevious wounds, and stop playing squishy tops into him. \n\nLooking at this thread and your match history, you posted this after you got smashed by an {{champion:266}}  top after playing {{champion:10}}  into him. Did you think playing one of the weakest early game champions in the game would work well into him by sheer magical force of will or something?","replies":[{"poster":"Hot LeBlanc Yuri","date":"2019-08-07T10:25:31.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt play Kayle into him, he played Aatrox into me, and i was actually winning lane untill he 3 shot me under tower at lv 8 and walked away with more than half hp.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-06T02:05:51.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Who are you playing that you don't have counterplay to Aatrox?
