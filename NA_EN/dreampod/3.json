I'm pretty sure that I never received the 10th anniversary mystery skin for players that already owned the Riot Kayle skin.  I see the 10th anniversary icon in my purchase history but the only other things there or in my gifting history are hextech crafting or purchases I made.  Could you have a look into my account to see what went wrong?  I've been playing this game since beta and while I don't feel entitled to free stuff it is a really cool and generous thing that you guys are doing for the community and I'd like to enjoy it too.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Dreampod","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T04:53:22.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems you didn't own Riot Kayle prior to the event and received her skin as part of the anniversary event. \n\nLet me know if you're having issues using her skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreampod","date":"2016-10-14T05:16:40.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Odd.  I was quite certain I got her from hextech crafting about 4 months ago and I checked my account and saw her available when the anniversary gifts were announced (before distribution started).  Is there any way to view our accounts purchase history beyond the most recent 20ish items?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-16T22:48:15.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Purchase history goes back 90 days, but I can tell you that Riot Kayle was added on your account within that timeline, so if it doesn't show up in your purchase history, it was added by us. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
