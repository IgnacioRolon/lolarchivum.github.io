The work you do for help &amp; support is great and really important but it clogs up the Redtracker due to the volume and makes it nearly impossible to keep track of red posts on gameplay and balance.  Could you guys please talk to your web developers and split the Redtracker so that it separates posts in the Help&amp;Support board and everything else.  Again the support stuff is great that you do it but isn't relevant to 99% of the players and prevents them from being able to usefully use the boards.\r\n\r\nThanks and have a happy Easter,\r\n-Dreampod (League player for 8 years and counting)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-18T03:43:06.473+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \nThanks for the shoutout and sticking with us for so long! \n\nOnto the nitty gritty. I'd be more than happy to pass that feedback along! I understand that a lot of our players are only here for their gameplay strats and lore theories. For them, the Red Tracker might be a little annoying if my name keeps popping up for technical issues when all you want is to see if someone finally replied to your epic post. \n\nI'll be passing this along, but for the future, this kind of post would best go in the [**Boards Feedback**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback) board. You'll be able to get a lot more visibility there!","replies":[{"poster":"SLAIN2","date":"2017-04-19T09:13:10.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"update button like pls @Broporo \np/s new cmt construction contributions public LOL NA EUNE KOR JPN.i hate cmtnot have button like as facebook twitter","replies":[]}]}]}
