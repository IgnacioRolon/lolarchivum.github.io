However, I just got the pop up on my screen with no opening animation or information on what was inside and I can't find anywhere in my summoner profile or hextech crafting area that shows a mystery box to open.  Where would I find that to open if I still need to and if it automatically opened could you check my account and let me know what I got since I've got sooooo many skins I'd never find it just by digging through.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDreampod","replies":[{"poster":"Mooo Mooo Milk","date":"2016-09-17T15:09:52.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I opened mine, it just gave me the icon and didn't give me a mystery skin because I already own Riot Kayle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tweetz","date":"2016-09-17T10:12:49.772+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here i did only get the summoner icon even tho i already have riot kayle and kayle i did only get a pop up for the icon nothing more... i wonder if iam going to get the skin...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merfyz","date":"2016-09-17T05:54:33.615+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This also just happened to me.
