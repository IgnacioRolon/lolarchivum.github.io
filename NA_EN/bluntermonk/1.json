Top? How much a threat you can be while adc shreds the enemy. What makes an adc good? suvivability, sieging, drag/baron control (basically everything).\n\nHere's my biggest gripe. ADCs are ALWAYS meta. ALWAYS. So why does an adc Kalista get the unlimited baron damage ability. As an adc she is already extremely important to taking the objective.
