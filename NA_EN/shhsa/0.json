If this is still happening, I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help resolve this.  The leaverbuster penalty would only happen after multiple games and not one infraction, so it's important to get this fixed up.

So this is not one occasion. I don't think you really get my issue. I am connected to the game, so there are no connection problems. The only struggle is, there is a black screen in front of it. If I Alt tab and go back to the game, I can see myself in the base for like 200 ms, and I'm even capable to move if I'm fast enough.","replies":[]}]}]}
