There's isn't much to discuss, it's just made to promote offense over defense, it's working as intended.\r\n\r\n**Second, AD itemization it's not specific, it works well as item are effective all around.**\r\n>Hey, I'm Veigar {{champion:45}} , I'm a burst mage, and because of that, I build {{item:3151}} , an item made to deal a significant damage against health stackers.\r\n\r\nSeems silly,right? :D\r\n\r\n>Hey, I'm Zed {{champion:238}} ,  I'm an attack damage assassin, and because of that, I build {{item:3153}}  , an item made for fighters to deal significant damage against health stackers.\r\n\r\nThat still seems silly, but the problem is: it works.\r\nSame with most adc really, their building Botrk to deal against tanks or fighters with tons of health doesn't impact significantly their damage against low health targets.\r\n\r\n**Third, last whisper works too well against squishy targets and synergize too much with blade of the ruined king**.\r\nYou remember the Vayne problem? That when Vayne is too strong in a certain meta you can't itemize against her because of percentage of max health true damage?\r\nWell, Botrk is really similar, once you have last whisper.\r\nWhen the adc, or assassin, has both items, you can't itemize effectively against it.\r\nArmor gets mitigated, health increases the botrk damage. Also, as with blade of the ruined kind, while Last whisper is made to counter heavy armor targets, it also works well against low armor targets.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, while an Ap champion builds item to be effective against a certain kind of target and lose effectiveness against others (example:{{item:3116}}  Rilay and{{item:3151}}  Liandry to counter assassins and deal damage to high health targets, vs{{item:3128}}  DFG and Rabaddon{item:3089}} to deal massive damage to squishies, etc. etc.), an AD champion with the same build keeps high efficiency against all sort of targets, since most of his itemization is not specific and works well around.\r\nYou build an IE, then a Botrk instead of a BT, and a last whisper, and you deal massive damage to both squishies and tanks.\r\nWhile it's true that void staff has some of these issues, magic damage is gated by cooldown , while auto attacks aren't.","replies":[{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2015-01-02T14:27:48.686+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well written, and IMO, accurate. AD itemization is too broadly effective. IE works great against a squishy target, but is also an effective first item for attacking a tank. Shiv gives good burst/waveclear, but also provides mixxed damage and increased sustained damage. LW reduces the effectiveness or armor stacking, but is also a great damage increase against targets with low armor.\n\nRiot mentioned that they were looking into making LW apply only to bonus armor, but I think Yasuo's ult showed them that that was not an effective solution. \n\nConversly, defensive itemization tends to be very effective in its specialization, but not broadly effective. BViel is great for avoiding intiation spells or burst combos, but falls short as a defensive item against sustained magic damage.  Spirit Visage is absurdly powerful in drawn-out fights, but is vunerable to burst. Warmogs provides good HP and sustain,fails against %HP damage. QSS is great against champions that rely on some form of debuff, but doesn't do too much against straight damage. Thornmail (And Frozed Heart, and Ninja Tabis) is great at countering AA damage, but leaves you with a lower HP total. \n\nNow tanks (actual tanks) tend to have tools to cover one or more area of defense on their own, so the lack of broadly effective itemization doesn't hurt them as much. It is an issue which shows up mostly for bruisers. But actual full tanks are having a hard time finding a spot in League right now. They tend to be too slow in the jungle, and lack the threat in top-lane. I am (cautiously) hopeful the new item on PBE will increase tanks viability in the top-lane. (By providing them with a way to more seriously threaten structures solo.)\n\nEDIT: I wanted to more strongly state that actual TANKS tend to have fairly good/broad defensive options thanks to their intrinsic defense steroids. Bruisers who build a damage item first do lack a solid \"I would like to not die in 2 hits\" item.However  bruisers should NOT be able to go a couple of damage items and still end up nigh-unkillable, but they should also not die in half a second.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Devout","date":"2015-01-02T15:25:01.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I wouldn't use Yasuo as an example of bonus armor being a bad lever to fix arpen.\nThe problem with Yasuo is that while Last Breath applies only to bonus armor, it stacks with your  armorpen from item and effects.\n\nA Yasuo with last Whisper ignores around 65% of the enemy total armor, so stacking armor doesn't really help.\n\nI think Riot should address Last Whisper to be slightly less effective on squishies on when built on ad assassins, something like having different values of arpen between physical damage spells and autoattacks.\nOn the other hand, they should increase the viability of items like Black Cleaver for bruisers, while trying to make champions armor reductions  more impactful.

The game currently is less about surviving longer than your enemy and more about killing your enemy faster, so building mixed tank/damage on someone like Shen or Maokai is much more effective than grabbing straight armor and MR with no damage.  \n\nIt feels Riot went the complete opposite way with how they used to run tanks.  Rammus was banned in most ranked matches because he was nearly impossible to kill, a long with a few other annoying tanks like Shen.  Now tanks, mid to late game, are so easy to shred that tanks are RARELY banned in ranked, it's mostly champions who can easily escape or disengage, like Morg, Fizz, etc.\n\nIt's become less about tanking damage and more about completely avoiding it altogether, since there really is no way to truly tank damage anymore.  Early game, facing a tank can be annoying, but not completely unbeatable, since ganking can put you ahead and at that point you can just harass the crap out of them, but then they're even more useless mid to late game since even then they can't fulfill their role in the slightest if they don't get any kills or at least farm.\n\nTL;DR Remove some of the tank shredding power but don't make it completely irrelevant, that way running straight tank can be viable again, but not unstoppable.  The ability to kill tanks is a little high but not completely unbelievable, since a tank shouldn't be an unstoppable juggernaut.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Devout","date":"2015-01-03T11:08:00.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should make Botrk and Last Whisper more AA reliant.\nWhen you have both items, you are the ultimate tank buster, you shouldn't be as effective against squishies as someone who has IE+PD/SS\n\nAlso, making Last Whisper AA reliant would make AD assassins less effective in bursting tanks/fighters, which is common in this meta,","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonface","date":"2015-01-04T06:37:37.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have to agree with you Devout, I think changing LW to AA only would make it a much more viable idea.
