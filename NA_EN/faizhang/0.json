I know that nobody will ever really see this, but let me just start out from the beginning. I was never really socially acceptable and thus had very few friends. During my 6th grade year i sat in the corner of the playground daily because nobody wanted to play with me. If something was finally going right at school it was a disaster at home. My dad... has basically caused me to be a shell of what I once was. I mean, who the hell holds a gun to his wife in front of his children? I painfully forced myself through all of that and the rest of middle school.\n     Highschool hit and I decided to start doing online school. I did this just in time for my older brother (whom I hadn't seen in many years) to come stay with us. He stayed for over half a year, and it was the best time of my life. He may have been a bit tempermental, but he was fun for a change. One day I saw him playing League of Legends on his laptop and I thought to myself, \"Hey that game looks really fun. Maybe if I can get good at it we could play together.\" And so he became my mentor. \n     I began by maining support to his adc. I progressed greatly, and rightfully so. I finally had something that I was good at. People wanted to talk to me without even knowing my first name. I felt... accepted for the first time in my life. Hitting level thirty felt like the climax of a roller coaster. I did ranked and got placed in Silver III. Too bad it was just in time for Season 5 to start and am now in Bronze IV. But you know what? I don't care about my elo. \n     League has brought me more joy than anything in my entire life. I'm a Bronze IV noob and I like it. Even the trolls and afk's from time to time can't get at me. This is my world and I progress as long as I try harder. There isn't anyone to stop me. So... thank you Riot. Thank you for giving me a home where I finally feel welcome. v(=∩_∩=)ﾌ\n\nEdit: I didn't expect this much love from the community and waking up to see all of this made this the best Friday in a long time. I'm actually tearing up a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Kayn","date":"2015-04-23T17:23:02.405+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're all nubs together <3","replies":[{"poster":"FaiZhang","date":"2015-04-23T17:28:26.346+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long live nubs! >‿‿◕","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Kayn","date":"2015-04-23T18:20:21.572+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can sort of relate to your situation.

It becomes much easier once you make it out of school years as school aged people are generally too out of touch with reality to understand things like human decency.\n\nI love gaming.  Always have always will.  I once spent most if not all of my spare time on various games.\n\nBut as this poster said.  Use the game as an outlet and an escape, but please remember that your life exists in the real world and cultivate that as best you can.\n\nI am 28 now.  I have a full time job a wife and 2 beautiful kids.  In school, I had only a few friends.  I was a tiny guy so the girls were always chasing the football players around.\n\nThe point of me saying this is.  There are people in REAL life who will see you and appreciate you and want to know you.  You will meet a man or woman who loves you.  You can have a life the way you want it to be outside of this game and away from your past.  You just have to go and take it.","replies":[{"poster":"FaiZhang","date":"2015-04-24T14:29:30.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the words of wisdom.

I know that nobody will ever really see this, but let me just start out from the beginning. I was never really socially acceptable and thus had very few friends. During my 6th grade year i sat in the corner of the playground daily because nobody wanted to play with me. If something was finally going right at school it was a disaster at home. My dad... has basically caused me to be a shell of what I once was. I mean, who the hell holds a gun to his wife in front of his children? I painfully forced myself through all of that and the rest of middle school.\n>      Highschool hit and I decided to start doing online school. I did this just in time for my older brother (whom I hadn&#039;t seen in many years) to come stay with us. He stayed for over half a year, and it was the best time of my life. He may have been a bit tempermental, but he was fun for a change. One day I saw him playing League of Legends on his laptop and I thought to myself, \"Hey that game looks really fun. Maybe if I can get good at it we could play together.\" And so he became my mentor. \n>      I began by maining support to his adc. I progressed greatly, and rightfully so. I finally had something that I was good at. People wanted to talk to me without even knowing my first name. I felt... accepted for the first time in my life. Hitting level thirty felt like the climax of a roller coaster. I did ranked and got placed in Silver III. Too bad it was just in time for Season 5 to start and am now in Bronze IV. But you know what? I don&#039;t care about my elo. \n>      League has brought me more joy than anything in my entire life. I&#039;m a Bronze IV noob and I like it. Even the trolls and afk&#039;s from time to time can&#039;t get at me. This is my world and I progress as long as I try harder. There isn&#039;t anyone to stop me. So... thank you Riot. Thank you for giving me a home where I finally feel welcome. v(=&cap;_&cap;=)ﾌ\n\nI can relate.  Not that I went through an abusive home life.  I didn't.  My brother was a trouble child and required most of my parents attention and energy during his troubled older teenage years while I was 5 years younger and mostly well behaved.  So naturally, while my parents were great and loved me, I was more or less left to my own devices.  I had a few friends but also never really \"fit in\" in school, whatever that is supposed to mean.\n\nBut anyway, I discovered online gaming in the form of StarCraft and Age of Empires and other games of the time.  I soon became well known and liked amongst a HUGE community of players who didn't care anything about what I looked like, where I was from, or anything other then how we played together and how I treated them.\n\nI then got into competitive gaming and played CS:Source for a long time, and realized I wasn't cut out for the high end play and began working for Pwnage.TV and doing shoutcasts for high end competitive matches and I never felt more accepted and welcomed in my life then I did when interacting with that community.\n\nI am happy for you that you have found your home.  I am infinitely sorry for your troubled upbringing.  Use it as motivation for your future.  Again, I cant imagine as I really did have a loving father, and we are much closer now than we were during those years.  I wont pretend to understand that point.  But use it however you can and never let anyone rob you of your joy.\n\nFriend request me if you like, Id love to see you on the Rift.","replies":[]}]}
