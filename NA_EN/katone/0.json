I dont judt loose bei my mates are bad , but last 20 Games its really difficult to win with 6/2 or better, even just 1 is feeding. \nI have my third loosing Streak in 20 Games with 4 looses. \nAnd at this Point i am not the only reason for getting demoted. Riot matchmaking Is Bad because i am S2 and play with Bronze 1 vs Gold 3/4. \nand i mean when i loose games its always 100% the fault of all Players in the loosing Team. So MMR makes not much sense aswell 😅. \n\n{{champion:18}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"lizmapo","date":"2019-03-08T04:55:44.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"50 percent of winning rate is nice.\nHowever instead of matching better players as you improve your skills, they will simply ruin half of your game by matching trolls.\nRemember bad players are also part of the game, please consider their feelings!\nAlso you still have half of your game not ruined so please enjoy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iDarkWind","date":"2019-03-07T14:42:26.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me. I seriously can understand your pain. Believe or not it happens even in higher elos, and there are and will be games where you just lost on champion select, because of your team players, picks whatsoever. However, I can't find any good reason to someone to be so hardstuck in low elo while trying to seriously improve. I don't.\nI find it very easly to comeback on those ranks and even literally 1vs9. I'm not telling you to \"git gud\", but basicly my advice is to stop looking at your team performance and start thinking only about yours and don't tilt. Also, blaming Riot for \"their stupid matchamking\" (wich LMAO is so fvcking true) won't help at all.\n\nBut yeah, this season has been a big fiesta. I've met many players in Masters that actually have something like 40% Win Rate, I just don't get it, how is it even possible but whatever.\n\nEDIT: Yeah. I just played a game where my bot lane was Platinum 1 and the enemy Team was with 3 Diamond I, 1 Master and 1 Diamond III, meanwhile I was the only Master in my team  with one Diamond I and one Diamond II.\nAnd the Diamond I was a pepega, great.\n","replies":[]}]}
