This also happens with Zyra, where the recall locks to the camera. Since Baron is an empowered recall, it's not the same animation. Lemme see if we can adjust this for the empowered recall. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2016-02-19T19:56:47.607+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always wonder, is it normal for lulu to turn her back on us when she do her dance?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-19T23:23:48.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looked through the bugs for this, and it appears to currently be WAI.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
