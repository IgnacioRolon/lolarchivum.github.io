Unfortunately I ended up letting my team down in the very first game, and I haven't been able to even get one game where I actually play yet.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I've loaded unto the rift, my mouse and keyboard seems to have no function whatsoevever. \r\n\r\nMouse: I can move the cursor and map by moving it to the edges. I can also hover over buttons and get hints. None of the buttons work however.\r\nKeyboard: No keyboard strokes are working, none, whatsoever. Not even escape, space etc, nothing, it seems completely dead. I can alt+tab, ctrl+alt+del, ctrl+esc. They work, and will bring me out of the game. The keyboard is working, just not in-game.\r\n\r\nI've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I've tried deleting the config folder, and I've tried importing input.ini file config files, from another pc. A pc with same exact keyboard and mouse..\r\n\r\nI'm using a LG Orion Spark and ROCCAT KONE XTD.\r\n\r\nI've also tried uninstalling all third party software, the problem still persist.\r\n\r\nI've search forum and google far and wide, but I can't seem to find anyone experiencing the same problem. All seem to have defective input.ini, but can still use the mouse/keyboard, just not bindings. My buttons just don't work. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to a solution :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-23T22:48:56.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeeell not being able to use your mouse/keyboard makes things a little difficult eh?\n\nTypically resetting those config files will do the trick, but since that didn't help let's go ahead and get you set up with a little one on one help with our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
