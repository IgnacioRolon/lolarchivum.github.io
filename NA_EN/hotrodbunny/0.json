Please refresh the page and try again.\" I'm honor 5, have never been banned, and have been playing this game religiously since I joined in 6.8 (the {{champion:44}} rework patch), so it shouldn't be an eligibility issue. I read that people had this problem earlier, and some had it resolved already; It's probably just a matter of waiting, considering how many people are registering right now, but I figured I should make a post in case anyone has any insight on how long that wait will be.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-13T00:23:38.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaa that signup page got a wee bit flooded from all of the excitementy of PBE launching again.
