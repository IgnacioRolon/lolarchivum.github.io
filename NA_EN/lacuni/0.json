If I had intended to convey the message \"Let's get dinner tonight\", it's **my** failure as the sender to not communicate it in a way the receiver (you) could understand. Likewise, if I wanted to say k.y.s to, say, my best friend who speaks Dutch, it's reasonable for me to assume they will interpret it as \"kiss\" (love, etc). However, if I say it to a stranger, especially in a video game, it's only reasonable to assume they will interpret it as me telling them to commit suicide. The situation affects the message and its interpretation.\n\nTLDR: While you may not have *intended* to be toxic, that's how it comes across both to uninvolved people here on the boards and your teammates in games. The fault is on **you** for not ensuring your messages are interpreted correctly.

We got counter picked and my thresh has odd engages as well as failed ganks/roams from mid and jog. I actually only died twice in lane but ended up with eight deaths toward the end. \nThe Pantheon on my team was extremely toxic. I typed I was going to mute him and but did not because I was recording my game and his chat. For the remainder of the game, roughly 40-something minutes, he complained. Kept trying to tell me what to build, where to go, spam pinged me when i was trying to farm my cull as I was about 50 farm behind the enemy Sivir. Told me to stop farming and group instead of shooting cross-map ultimates even though they were hitting and resulting in kills AND I got to continue farming. He only picked out the bad and never the good even though I was playing quite well post lane, I was just behind and playing like I was (playing safe, positioning extremely safe and focusing farming above all). He even got our Jax and Sylass to flame me a little.\n\nDo you think I said anything? Do you think that I “defended” myself and told him to shut the fuck up, let him know that he’s no better and half of his calls were bad?\nNo. I typed probably 7 times that game. A few to tell Thresh we shouldn’t engage because Sivir had more damage than me, once to explain to Panth in his early stages of flaming that I was 50 farm behind and still had like 60 stacks on Cull and then again to tell Panth I’d be muting him and later his pings because he kept going.
