The person keeps making new accounts (which I block) and then puts a bot on them to keep spam inviting me and another person.  The issue I have is simply that I've blocked this person, derived them of all contact to me (never even knew who they were)  but they can still invite me to games with no issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T23:45:20.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow that really sucks =\\ .....\n\nI think I have a way that I can help you out, but I want to do so one on one with you. Shoot me a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and once it's sent come back and give me the ticket #. I can pull up your ticket and work with you there ^_^.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingfireblast","date":"2017-06-06T20:07:32.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The person yesterday stopped and I haven't received invites since, I just feel that blocking should maybe include denial to invite to games. If they begin spamming me again I will contact you though, thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
