League of Legends makes money for China whereas Fortnite does not so it would not make sense for them to ban.\n\nNot sure why people even create these threads, Riot has always done this since the beginning of the game where a new champion or champions get buffs and do not seem as balanced, but they are.\nThe issue is because people just like to complain about every little thing, hence people will complain about \"insert champion\" because they or another team fed the champion so instead of knowing that they will just outright blame the reason why they lost because \"said champion\" is unbalanced.\nIn terms if something is unbalanced or not should be based on statistics like it is and no player's feelings.\nThe problem is that there seems to be more unbalanced champions in terms of not holding up to those that have a higher win rate.\nThe reason why mages where so strong in the first place wasn't really so much of a buff or rework it was do the nerfs that ADCs had got. The reasoning for this was that Riot wanted more mages and AP champions to be played but kinda backfired because it seemed that they nerfed ADCs too much. \nRiot should not have to reach out to majority of the player base in order to see if something should stick because everyone has an opinion and as such a vote could easily become extremely close.
