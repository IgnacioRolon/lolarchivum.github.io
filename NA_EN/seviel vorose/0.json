Here are my system informations:\n\nCPU: i7 - 4710 HQ 2.50 Ghz\nGPU: GTX 860m, 2gb. Driver version: 388.43\nRam: 8gb\nWindows 10 Home, version 1709, build 16299.98\n\n\nEdit: the issue goes away if i set \"borderless\" mode too, but i prefer Full Screen as i've always played like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-05T22:10:57.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, I asked our tech team about this and it may be an issue with a compatibility setting.  The following steps may help: \n\n- Open up C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.196\\deploy\n- Right-click on League of Legends.exe and click on Properties\n- Click on the Compatibility tab\n- Check the box for \"Disable fullscreen optimizations\" \n- Press Apply, then OK.\n\nAs an additional step, disabling the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) can help clear things up.\n\nThis should fix things up while still allowing you to play in Full Screen! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Seviel Vorose","date":"2017-12-05T22:31:57.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked.
