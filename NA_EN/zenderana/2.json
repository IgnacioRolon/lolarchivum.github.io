It happens pretty rarely, but typically those 'ghost' games will not have an effect on your record, since our records can't seem to find the match anymore.\n\nJust in case though, let's make sure to do a little troubleshooting with your network to make sure you're able to stay in those matches from now on. Check out our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and make sure to go through each step, as they effect different things.
