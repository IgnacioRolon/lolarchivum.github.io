After about two days my ping went to about 80, it is still at 80 in league of legends but in all other games it is in the low 30's. I try to test my internet connection on speedtest.net and i get my ping as 27-40 every time. I have been trying everything I can but nothing seems to fix it. And while I play I get random lag spikes were no abilities work and after about 5 seconds or so, it catches up and i see everything that happened during the lag spike in about a second. Does anyone know how to fix/help this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T02:36:11.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you're having some issues with a bad network route to our servers and some bursts of [*Packet Loss*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss).
