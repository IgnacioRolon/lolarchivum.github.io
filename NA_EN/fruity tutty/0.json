I understand that it's frustrating dealing with toxic premades, AFKs, camps, or some other aspects of the game but when you take a step back and make an effort to be more positive, the game will be more fun and you won't get punished. \n\n Also, most of the time 'one bad game' doesn't result in a permanent ban. A 10 game chat restriction is the most you'd get for flaming someone back without going overboard. There are multiple tiers to punishments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-25T16:30:47.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not how the system works.\nyou are Given 3 times to show reform and get your act together, if you manage to fail 3 times in rapid succession (over 1 month), I'm sorry, but you clearly can't pull your act together.\nThe population of those Perma-banned make up about 0.01% of the League community.\n\nPerma-mute is a bad idea, not only will you be (maybe) a liability, it also dosen't help to show reform as you, can't type.\n\nlets say you go to a job, you make coffee.\nyou managed to poison 3 guests with your terrible coffee skills.\nthe first 2 times, lets just say was accidents due to poor training.\nthe next time was \"an accident\"\nif you do it again, you are out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheMonkeyKiing","date":"2018-12-24T20:38:33.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wrote a post similar to this and got a bunch of downvotes too. Basically if you type and get permabanned, aka not being able to play or access your account anymore, for toxic typing then it's justified by the community. But if you are intentionally throwing, soft inting, purposely setting your teammates behind by following them and taking their cs or jungle camps then it's totally fine according the to fact that the punishment is soft if not there at all. I've done it a lot on one of my accounts and I've not gotten a 14 day ban or anything of the sorts. Zilch punishment. Doesn't feel fun to lose but hey, it's a team game so even if I wanted to win and someone wanted to throw, welp I don't get to win do I?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PH45","date":"2018-12-24T08:02:07.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are already plenty of chances to reform in between punishments.
