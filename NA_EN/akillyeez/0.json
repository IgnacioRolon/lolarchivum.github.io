I imagine this character as a Melee Plague type character that infects champions and regains health through devouring corpses. Now i&rsquo;ll try to (poorly) make some lore.\n\nRot was a simple beggar on the streets of Zaun before he knocked on a door that belonged to the Mad Scientist Singed. After the torturous experiments performed his body was disfigured and he couldn&rsquo;t live on the streets anymore. This forced him to scavenge what he could and eventually the only place he could get enough anything to eat at was the corpse field. After surviving on entirely flesh for weeks he was driven crazy and wonders the area of Zaun feeding on fresh corpses. (I know i&rsquo;m bad at lore, pls be nice lol)\n\nPassive: Has a 5% chance to infect an enemy champion with basic attacks. Infected champions take the same scaling damage and healing effects as described in Q\n\nQ - Infect - Rot bites the target and deals Level based damage 75/125/150/175/200 and infects target that deals magic damage and makes the target receive 5/10/12/15/20% less healing for 5 seconds / 10 second cooldown. \n\nW - Frenzy - Rot begins to move on all fours and receives 125% movement speed when moving towards an infected champion. This lasts for 5 seconds.\n\nE - Devour - Rot can devour fresh corpses of champions that are left on the battlefield. This will heal Rot by 5% per second he is devouring the champion for up to 10 seconds. (I really like this ability because you always see the corpses on the ground that are not used for much and grows stronger as respawn times get longer and allows Rot more time to devour multiple corpses)\n\nR - Passive: Every corpse Rot devours strengthens the disease he is carrying and makes his infection 5% more potent, scales up to 10 times\n\nActive - Singed&rsquo;s Secret Weapon - Rot launches himself forward and explodes, dealing 200/250/300 magic damage and infecting all champions within 550/600/650 units respawn time is cut in half when this is used.\n\nThis is about all I have guys, I think this champion would be really fun to play just as a top lane AP bruiser, and also a champion that wouldn&rsquo;t be super overpowered; the ult would make him more of a troll pick which would be fun to use. I also like this because I&rsquo;m a fan of the ugly champions like urgot and singed and Rot could look pretty similar to a more alive version of the undead ghouls from Warcraft 3. Let me know what you think of this and if you have any ideas!\n\nEdit: I wrote this at 3:40am so please excuse any mistakes you see","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-17T08:51:13.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems a bit like Trundle with his passive cranked up to 11, plus mobility.","replies":[]}]}
