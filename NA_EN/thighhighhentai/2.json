When I tried to login, it was stuck in loading for 5 minutes before it finally logged in. My client was working just fine yesterday, and I haven't done anything to my computer. I have low spec mode enabled.\n\nEDIT: When I tried to load into a custom game, it took 10 minutes. When I finally loaded in, I had 15 frames instead of my usual 60.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T01:23:53.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's starting to look like some players are getting a lot of packet loss all of the sudden, so I'd like to start looking into that. Hit up this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and use the game logs that took forever to load and had the low fps.

It seems odd.. some people are getting drops in packet and higher ping, yet something unknown is causing it. I've already tested another region and there are no issues yet NA reports are coming in over and over on this matter. I've spoken with another Riot member, he/she stated it was my ISP yet, if that was the case my issue on NA would link over to another region also because it'd be an ISP problem. Plus someone else on NA lives only about an hour away country wise and has the same issue with the same ping error connecting to the NA game server, so it seems to be spreading out. Whatever the issue is I think the fact that so many people are having the issue linking to this, it's not anything to do with the people, but the server itself, and sufficient enough reports and proof is throughout the board to prove such theory. I do hope this gets noticed and brought up and also fixed soon because I do like playing and I do love the work you guys put in for all this.\n\nEdit: This is to help with more of an understanding of where the issue lies mainly. Since I am sure many think it's an ISP issue","replies":[{"poster":"ThighHighHentai","date":"2017-06-18T03:16:02.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's my latest log.
