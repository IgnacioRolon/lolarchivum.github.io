Its not from yesterday, its been like this for years already. Its about time you put your attention on this problem which has grew to enormous scale. Players are abusing this crack and act terribly on the champ selection screen and the post game one. It would have been less of an issue, if it didnt actually influence the in-game experience in a very negative way. Its not been such an issue with the blind pick, but within the draft mode, players are enforcing their desired role regardless of what they are assigned by the match making. I have encountered a great amount of players who would declare they will play the role i was assigned, no matter what and they even threaten with trolling, feeding and loosing the game on purpose beside harassing. The pity is this is not a feat of the low standard modes, but actually appears in plat ranked. Just a recent example. A player said he is &quot;smurfing&quot; and will take the jungle role i was assigned. Most of the time they use this argument and others like they dont have champs for the role they are assigned etc...pretty much stupid excuses. Another player, maybe his mate, even banned the champion i had declared, in desperate attempt to force me obey his bidding. This is a common tactic. If you are to refuse they proceed to play against you in-game. Playing against your team is a next-level strategy of helping the enemy team, with little chance to get caught and be punished. It manifests with stealing monsters, baiting to get killed etc. For example such players would often smite-steal the camps i was fighting, using knock plant to get me off-location, lead me into battle and then retreat just to get me killed etc. \nA similar topic is the post-game screen when players flame and curse carelessly. \nIt would be less of an issue for me if i knew such players are being actively monitored and punished\nPlease do something!\n","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-07T12:08:49.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can report them for pre and post game... you just need to say in the additional notes that the offence took place in pre and/or post game chat.

So even in post game screen if they were toxic enough the rioter might add one or 2, maybe even 3 marks, and based on the griefing they did they will add another mark (as long as that person's game history has at least one other reported situation of griefing in past week). The automated system works differently though, giving a mark for every X reports made by different people, with the needed X decreasing with every consecutive punishment.\n\nTDLR: Adding additional notes to report about what happened and where to find the incident provokes cause for a rioter to read, and ups the chance of a punishment. Where as the automated punishment only happens if that person has been reported by numerous people in last week.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-07T18:50:05.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can also screencap it and submit a support ticket.
