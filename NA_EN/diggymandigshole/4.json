Only have SoleQ ranked and Flex Ranked...This would stop all higher lol players from carrying none skilled friends up the ranks and ruin your games.\n 2)Add Voice Chat to Ranked Games only with a mute Option in game under Tab to each player on team. This will improve games and players working together as a team\n3) Other Options would help with smurfing players would be: Players wanting to play a champ in rank would need 7th lvl mastery on all champs being played in ranked games. Swapping would be allowed in champ select only if player playing champ has a 7th lvl Mastery on champ.\n4)  Get autofill out and rather wait longer then be autofilled. YES PLEASE... Many would agree on this because gameplay would be way more competitive as players have their role.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-19T21:57:51.554+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your last thread on this failed why on earth would you try again?","replies":[{"poster":"DiggymanDigsHole","date":"2019-08-20T02:59:04.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackKnightJack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Q35lhIrc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-19T21:57:51.554+0000)\n>\n> Your last thread on this failed why on earth would you try again?\n\nI  wanted to explain it a little clearer for some people that didn't get  it or confused on some points","replies":[{"poster":"TheDistruptor","date":"2019-08-21T03:54:04.948+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like all your ideas wish more would come check it out","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zardo","date":"2019-08-19T21:50:40.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">2)Add Voice Chat to Ranked Games only with a mute Option in game under Tab to each player on team.

The biggest appeal for league is that I DON'T have to get in voice chat to play ranked effectively. I enjoy listening to music to the point where sion and kled R's are barely audible. Voice already ruined Overwatch for me, and it would be much worse in league. I don't enjoy encountering bad mics, music backgrounds, sexist people, etc etc. The issue is much worse in league because people in voice don't ping things anywhere near as often and pretty much never type in chat, so i'd be at a disadvantage in every single game.","replies":[{"poster":"DiggymanDigsHole","date":"2019-08-20T03:08:10.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zardo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Q35lhIrc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-19T21:50:40.209+0000)\n>\n> This would ruin league for me tbh.
