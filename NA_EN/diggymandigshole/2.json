(ZZ rot  and other Tower damage items or ruins will be taken out of mode)\nKilling Enemy Players in lane will do damage to tower or inhibitor from that lane. Also Nexus can only be damaged by Minions( Damage needs to be calculated still) \n\n3) Jungle will be spilt into 4 sections ( Top left/ Top Right / Bottom Left / Bottom Right)\nPlayer killing any jungler in jungle will receive Buff automatically from section(will not spawn for 3mins)\n\n4) Dragons and Baron still spawn but more often to speed up games\n\n5) Nexus does not win game kills do but Nexus being destroyed by Minions does end the game.\n\n\nIf you have any other ideas for this mode please share with me{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"IamTHEonlySilent","date":"2019-09-06T04:11:04.505+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minions with Baron buff would really hurt in this mode but at the same time it's anyone's game til the end.
