(ZZ rot and other Tower damage items or ruins will not damage Towers)\r\nKilling Enemy Players in lane will damage closest tower to them in lane killed in,  Also Nexus and inhibitors can only be damaged by Minions (Damage needs to be calculated still)\r\n\r\n3) Jungle will be spilt into 4 sections ( Top left/ Top Right / Bottom Left / Bottom Right)\r\nPlayer killing any jungler or player in jungle will receive Buff automatically from section (buff will not spawn for 3 mins) Only jungler with smite can do damage to buffs blue or red monsters. Players only gain buff by killing player in jungle section.\r\n\r\n4) Dragons and Baron still spawn but more often to speed up games\r\n\r\n5) Nexus does not win game kills do but Nexus being destroyed by Minions does end the game.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other ideas for this mode please share with me","replies":[{"poster":"BananaRagings","date":"2019-09-15T05:14:21.334+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is ranked anyway... in low elo...
