Lately it's been more like 55-60. Odd thing is, if I do a ping test to 104.160.131.1, it reports back the same ping I used to have or even slightly lower. \r\n\r\nA 15 ping increase isn't a big deal but I'm wondering why there's a discrepancy all the sudden. It seems like there's some new factor involved that wasn't there before?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-10T04:05:17.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changes in latency are typically caused by routing changes at your ISP that directly affect how long it takes for your connection to hit our servers. Ping tests will give you some basic info, but they don't give you a whole overview of your network route. I strongly recommend grabbing a traceroute log using [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/). After loading up the program, you just need to plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 min has gone by, you can export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with this.","replies":[{"poster":"atomicpunk","date":"2017-02-11T03:59:22.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I logged WinMTR at the same time as a game I was playing. \n\n[MTR Log](http://pastebin.com/8ZwrSLRP)\n[\"Logs of Lag\" log](http://logsoflag.com/#Vf52_bVtd3B)\n\nAverage ping was 46 on MTR, 58 for League despite being connected to both at the same time. All of my roommates are on at the moment so packet loss is higher than typical. Normally the averages would be 39 and 54 respectively. Two weeks ago they both would have been about 39.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-12T22:21:29.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, your MTR traceroute shows some nasty latency spikes inside your home network of up to **379ms**, where your latency continues to rise and fall in spikes between **276ms and 562ms** before reaching our servers. This could be caused by a local issue on your modem or router, so I strongly recommend power cycling your network by pulling power from your modem/router for 60 seconds before plugging them back in. If you still see this increased latency, I recommend running another WinMTR traceroute and provide it to your ISP's tier 2 technical support so they can launch an investigation.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
