It's been a little less than a month, but your progress can slow down if you have games that are a little less than honorable.  I do see some games that could have gone better, but you can reach out to our PB team in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you'd like more context on those cases.  Otherwise, do your best to play as a stand up summoner and hang in there!","replies":[{"poster":"Jasper Crow","date":"2017-12-12T20:05:39.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was unable to get keyfragments for the entire season... how is that a little less than a month?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T21:10:39.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bad wording on my part, I was looking at when you adjusted to level 0 and not level 1 as well which was around June.   To clear things up, you are right that you haven't been eligible for hextech items for a good while.  This will be the case until your account shows consistent sportsmanlike conduct.","replies":[{"poster":"Jasper Crow","date":"2017-12-13T02:00:37.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yall banned me for complaining about Foucauldian theory.. What exactly constitutes as sportsmanlike conduct? I get reported for just muting the toxic people (who have honorable flairs I might add) and not even saying sh!t! Guess that is unsportsmanlike because the honorable boarder said so..","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
