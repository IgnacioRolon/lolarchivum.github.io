I need some help because the game is unplayable. It crashes sometime after 4 mins, and it crashes every 5 to 1 minute of gameplay. It's usually on the shorter end. I tried using the hextech repair tool but it doesnt do anyhting. It just crashes too. Please help!","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-09-15T02:16:52.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dang, that's a lot of crashing. Don't think I'd feel the game is playable with that many either, but let's see if I can deduce what's causing them.\n\nWhen they occur, do you ever notice any error messages that pop up along with it? They can be Windows pop ups with error codes, bugsplat notifications, or something that just says 'League is not responding'. Can you tell me if you got anything like that?","replies":[{"poster":"0194","date":"2017-09-16T18:18:06.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did a full repair and it still crashes what do i do?","replies":[]},{"poster":"0194","date":"2017-09-15T05:04:25.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no error message. If i click on the screen after it turns white nothing happens; I have to close it with task manager and repeat the process many times until it eventually stops. Then i can play the game as usual.","replies":[]}]}]}
