I thought it was pretty cool a new event thing came out. It was yasuo vs riven. I knew instantly that i would side with yasuo because i hate riven. I didn't read the quest thoroughly and i didn't realize that you could only complete one quest. I thought you could do both so i figured i  would get the trash riven one out of the way first. Little did i know you can't do both. Now League of Legends™ Is now literally unplayable (not memeing). I can not play the game with the riven icon permanently engraved onto my account. Almost like i was drunk and went out and got a shitty tattoo. It is a symbol of shame and every time i open my game i will be filled with hatred and regret. If there is any way to reverse this i would be EXTREMELY happy. I think i will legitimately have to stop playing League of Legends™ after this. If any Riot™ employees can assist my in this en-devour please contact me immediately. \n\nP.S. I can't create a new account because i have my neat season 2 icon that i can't play without. \n\nLast day of playing League of Legends™ 6/15/2017 check my match history for proof (unless i can undo my poor choice of sides or have the riven icon terminated form my account.)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T04:48:00.557+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can change that icon at any time! When you complete that starting mission, you receive both the Dawnbringer and Nightbringer icons. From that point on, you equip the icon of the champion that you want to help represent in the final battle. If you decide you can to switch sides, you just need to equip the other icon and start doing the next days missions while repping Yasuo.","replies":[{"poster":"0194","date":"2017-06-16T06:10:45.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh really?
