So I went in practice mode to find out the problem. I tabbed out from the game to look for answers. Then suddenly the practice game I was in popped up by it self. There I noticed my game was popping up by it self exactly every minute, as if I had to pick a champion. Does anyone know a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-26T21:34:22.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It honestly sounds like a corrupt file may be causing issues with your client!
