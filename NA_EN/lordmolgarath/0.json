Recently my League of Legends Client just _stopped working!_\n\nI tried everything I could think of, I ran the application as administrator countless times, troubleshooted compatibility, reinstalled the game twice, and followed countless forum and Reddit instructions on the topic, which included deleting files and re-running the program, I even tried managing the hard-drive to get it to work!\n\nWhat I do exactly is double-click or right click and run as administrator, the League of Legends Icon Badge pops up, loads, and disappears, like normal, but then nothing happens, nothing at all, I went into Task Manager and the LoL Launcher and LoL Patcher were running tasks, but they weren't showing up on the Desktop or doing anything at all.\n\nThe only thing I can possibly come up with at this point is to reinstall Windows, and I'm not doing that, it's not an option.\n\nPlease help! I've tried everything I know!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T22:31:50.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've taken a lot of logical steps in an effort to resolve this. One thing I can think of potentially still being a problem is if you have a Firewall or Antivirus program that could block League from running.
