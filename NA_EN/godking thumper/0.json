Sound good?  :)\n\n**EDIT**: We're in the process of speaking with the VFX artist who worked on BM Talon, and she's going to play around with the particles and see if she can come up with some adjustments.\n\n**EDIT 2**: We popped in a fix that /should/ make it a bit easier to see now!

Like I'd mentioned above, there are so many degrees of colorblindness that it's pretty hard to adjust for everyone, and in our case, we only have so many colorblind folks in house that can give us their feedback. \n\nWe've had several players reach out to us directly (most of the time on PBE), and that can help us, too!  A good example here was, a player was having an issue with Blood Moon Twisted Fate's cards (he saw a video of PBE coverage) and made a post about it.  We adjusted them ASAP, and they're already fixed and in the current patch! \n\nWe're always open to bugs, feedback and concerns, so I'd hope no one would hesitate to poke one of us, especially in a case like this where gameplay is a concern.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-02-15T09:03:52.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this kind of thing apply to a lot of other skins?\nElementalist Lux seems to have just been this MASSIVE nightmare in-regards to Clarity vs Gameplay vs Aesthetics.\n\nEven now the Elementalist Lux shield is almost the spitting image of the Edge of Night Active Shield.\n\nTo the point that when watching Replays I had to double take a few times.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-02-15T20:14:47.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, we do run colorblind tests on all skins. Elementalist Lux is one of the most difficult skins to balance out, purely because she's a. changing forms, and b. uses every damn color under the rainbow. While we are considered to be 'experts of our craft', it can be hard to point out something if you've been staring/working on it for a year. IMO, this is why we had to make adjustments after release. In house, we don't have hundreds of thousands of people playtesting her with fresh eyes. \n\nI'm not familiar with any discussions around Edge of Night, so I'm not able to provide context there. I've personally only seen comments on the boards regarding it. This would be something gameplay folks would make a call on v. skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-02-16T02:55:53.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's fair enough.\nA creators haze sets in when you work on something for too long, it's understandable. \n\nLike how every aspect of SG Poppy was blue, but her abilities were originally released a goldie-yellow for some reason.\nIt seemed like a pretty obvious issue that I dunno how it got as far as it did. \n\nHer hair was blue, her gloves were blue, her boots and skirt were blue, her eyes were blue, her Splash-art was blue. Blue, blue and more blue. \nBut her abilities were... yellow? \n\n\n\nInteresting to hear about Edge of Night, I suppose if it came down to changing them, they would just change the way the Edge of Night shield looks, as opposed to all of the E.

It's less likely to happen in shorter projects. \n\nStar Guardian Poppy was a different case, and 'it got as far as it did' because the team felt it was the right call. It can be boring to have a blue outfit, with blue particles, and the team may have been trying to switch it up just a bit. There were also some gameplay concerns as to what could/should be pushed away from base. This is where player feedback can be super important. We had the opportunity to re-discuss the gameplay calls originally made to see where we could push her further. \n\nWe've done this before (re-evaluating things), such as Braum's passive being able to change, or Nidalee's overhead passive indicator not needing to be gold every time. As the game evolves, so do skins. With a new champion, it may be harder to determine what we should and shouldn't change on a skin because it's so new - and IMO, this may have been a trap we fell into with Star Guardian Poppy because her rework was new. \n\nEdge of Night came prior to Elementalist Lux, so it's hard to say which way the team would go with.\n\nAlways glad to explain where I can. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2017-02-14T05:03:35.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"NO!\n\nHe wants to see good not sound good\n\nHue Hue Hue","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Dreamwalker","date":"2017-02-14T16:50:21.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, if someone saw a red champion they would see them as green?

Man, now I am curious, I mean I knew there was color blindness, I just didn&#x27;t know there were so many variations.\n\nIt's less that they see red _as_ green, but that the colors red and green are indistinguishable.  Red looks like green which looks like red (which looks like green, etc.)\n\nIt does confer some advantages in a few situations.  Depending on the color blindness type and extent, some color blind people have an easy time spotting camouflage that is incredibly hard to see with standard color vision.  There are also some types that confer better than standard night vision.\n\nAlso, there are some people (women, because genetics) who allegedly have _super_vision - tetrachromats.  They have the ability to see even more colors than your standard trichromat human.\n\nLastly, humans can see infrared light, but at such low intensities that the rest of the visible light completely overwhelms it.  You can get filters that remove almost all of the non-infrared light and put them in goggles to see what the IR world looks like in sunlight.  I made a pair years ago, and it's spooky - all the trees and greenery are a frosty pink, some black clothing is black, while other black clothing is bright pink!\n\nColor, man.
