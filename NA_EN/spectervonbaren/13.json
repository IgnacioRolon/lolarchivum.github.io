On the other, I also feel that might be confusing, since AP is generally associated with magic damage and AD with physical damage, so an AP-scaling physical damage mage is going to lead to a lot of players stacking MR and realizing it's useless against her.\n\nOn a more abstract level, though, I think it's worth questioning what damage types really do right now: the conceit is that AP = magic damage = abilities = burst, and that AD = physical damage = basic attacks = DPS, but there are so many exceptions to those rules that everything sort of blends into each other. Some of the game's most prominent assassins, i.e. burst casters, are AD physical damage-dealers (e.g. Kha'Zix, Talon, Zed, etc.), and DPS champions like Cassiopeia, Ryze and Swain, plus heavy autoattackers like Ekko and Diana, are all AP. Some random abilities like Miss Fortune's Q, Tryndamere's E and Akali's E all deal AP-scaling physical damage, and AD champions like Corki and Shyvana are known for dealing a ton of magic damage, often more than physical. \n\nAt this point, it feels like damage types are allocated more based on which class the champion belongs to, than based on what could work on them, which isn't what's the most obvious, either, with cases like Alistar (who smacks you around with his bare hands and horns, but deals magic damage), Kindred (who kills you with magical death arrows, which deal physical damage) and Taliyah (deals magic damage to you with rocks) all being examples of function over form. It feels like some champions get allocated their damage type on a coinflip, and despite the heavy limitations this often imposes on what they can and can't build, there isn't really a good explanation for why they're intended to be built only one way and not the other. Even though League is a game deeply entrenched now in its damage types, plus its associated resists and counter-resists, I think it might be useful if Riot eventually reexamined that system and either set some clear guidelines to make it more intuitive and meaningful, or perhaps even got rid of it altogether.","replies":[{"poster":"ImNotGio","date":"2017-03-15T03:52:32.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget; Yorick's Ult deals magic damage, but scales with AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-03-15T03:55:46.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This too, I missed quite a few actually (there's also Garen's ult, which is the only source of magic damage on a heavily physical damage-based character, plus Camille's on-hit magic damage on her ult, on top of her physical and true damage, though neither technically scale). This just reinforces the idea that damage types are all over the place, and while I guess that some are added to avoid champions getting counterbuilt by armor too hard, it just makes itemization more confusing as a whole, particularly since often those damage types have been added rather gratuitiously (Camille, again, doesn't need armor-ignoring magic damage when she already has true and max health damage at her disposal).","replies":[{"poster":"ImNotGio","date":"2017-03-15T13:56:11.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's also Morde, with some of the most random scalings ever.\nMace of Spades: First/Second Strike: (+ 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90% AD) (+ 60% AP) Third Strike: (+ 100 / 120 / 140 / 160 / 180% AD) (+ 120% AP) \nSiphon of Destruction: (+ 60% AD) (+ 60% AP)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Anu3isII","date":"2017-03-15T07:17:26.864+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that you can't really afford to buy any Penetration, and Armor as a base stat is much higher than Magic Resist in general.\n\nYou would have a small damage advantage in the Early Game.
