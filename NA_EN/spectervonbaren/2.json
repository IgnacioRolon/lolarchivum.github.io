One major issue with 'combo' is just the size of the word. it'd block a decent amount of screen space and look pretty important even though its just a fun thing for a skin. On top of that we are adding this change with only a couple days left to test on pbe.\n\nThough in all honesty I don't own the gameplay in LoL I just check in with them on all effects I add to the game to make sure I don't hurt the game when adding stuff like this. I was told to avoid adding text here and while I think'd be fun I can understand where my gameplay bros are coming from.","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-07-28T19:18:01.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not the thread opener, but I'd be also glad to just have a hit counter that goes up counting the ult bounces, no need to have the word \"combo\" there (i.e., same as riven) ^_^\n\nI like the idea but I can understand if it's too late for brand, or if it's too much for gameplay (i could imagine a situation where you made arcade riven and decided it's too much noise, and that it's something to avoid for future skins).\nIf it's allowed but it's too late for Brand it could be something to keep in mind for other arcade (or otherwise fitting) skins. It would be nice on a Syndra ult for example, or for GP barrels (IIRC he already shouts \"COMBO!\" when making them explode), or on Taliyah's Q... \n\nThanks for listening ^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2017-07-28T18:04:53.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aw...","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-07-28T16:43:42.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some kind of a small icon would be possible.
