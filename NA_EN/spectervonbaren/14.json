On the other hand, {{champion:62}} also likes {{item:3071}}  but not as an in lane power spike but as a mid/late game item for teamfights since he can shred an entire enemy team with his ult.\n\nAnd there is the problem. {{item:3107}}  and {{item:3190}} are teamfight items that someone would want in the mid to late game while {{item:3504}}  {{item:3109}} and {{item:3050}} are all items meant to help you and one other person or only your ADC. They would make pretty good power spike items in lane but supports don&#039;t HAVE power spike items because they have to use 800 gold on {{item:2049}}  850 gold on {{item:3098}}/{{item:3096}}/{{item:3097}}  and  900 or 1100 gold on tier two boots for a potential 2750 gold.  So by the time a support has bought all of those it is mid game and they want to buy items that help as many people as possible since teams will start grouping then.\n\nThe issue with {{item:3107}}  and {{item:3190}}  is not that they are OP or just too good to pass up, it&#039;s that they are teamfight items that can help out an entire team and by the time a support can start thinking about buying unique items it is mid game, when teamfights start happening, whereas the other support items either only help 1 or 2 people or are specialized in who they help (Most mages and tanks won&#039;t get much benefit from {{item:3504}} as an example). And since games usually don&#039;t get to late game right now, that one item or two items you get after sighstone, tier two boots, and tier two gold income item,  {{item:3107}}  and {{item:3190}} are usually the last fully completed support items you get.\n\nSo TLDR/ for everyone, the problem is that supports have to buy a bunch of particular items in the early game and by the time they do, mid game has rolled around and so their next purchases are teamfight oriented items that help as many people as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"needHymn","date":"2017-04-23T15:48:44.298+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2017-04-23T18:31:54.781+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, play the only naked champion that can utilize a deathcap: {{champion:267}} \n\nOr am I forgetting any other naked champs?","replies":[{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2017-04-23T20:41:44.827+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:110}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-04-23T22:11:17.864+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't naked, silly.\n\nHe has a scarf.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2017-04-23T23:06:46.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And a necklace.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-04-23T23:53:01.859+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that weird belt-thingy on his chest that coincidentally covers his nipples.","replies":[{"poster":"Oelyk","date":"2017-04-24T01:56:23.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-04-23T19:04:00.942+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:96}} {{champion:154}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Golden Tager X","date":"2017-04-24T03:13:44.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:34}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:154}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hahahahyena","date":"2017-04-24T04:51:44.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:143}}","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2017-04-24T12:38:08.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh she is a plant.

Not every support is geared to do that however, and I do think that's appropriate.\n\nKnight's Vow fits better ironically on top lane tanks from what I've seen, but its stats are pretty low so it's not built that often for when you want to peel. Galio makes the item look really good. It does give sustain to tanks based on whoever s/he is bound to, so it's not a bad item in its nature, it's just not really that good of a **support** item.\n\nZeke's Herald honestly is confused. The item is bad because you can't control when you're able to use it, and it's nothing like Warlord's Bloodlust where something general like healing occurs. It's a powerful effect and the item's strength is based off of whether you get the effect or not. An idea a friend of mine had was that you'd gain charges by moving/being in combat with the person you're bound to, and at max charges the item would disable its ability to bind to champions but allow you to use the 100 stack effect by activating the item again. Would really make the item quite insane considering BoRK ADCs aren't that crit-heavy early on.\n\nMikael is just...outdated. The same issue I have with Chalice is the issue with Mikael's. MR on a support that you specifically have to dedicate to get an item just feels like a mid laner kind of thing since you're down there fighting with an AD champion. If Chalice didn't build off of a Null Mantle and just gave MP regen, its items would be in a much better state. Mikael already gives 10% more healing/shield power than Redemption, so it does have its niche.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2017-04-23T17:02:28.262+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Problem is people optimizing the items poorly.
