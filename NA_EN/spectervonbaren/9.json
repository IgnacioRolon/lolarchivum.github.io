Having learned that they were going to, yet again, rework him because they realized it was a failure was offset by the fact that Repertoir has said that they like how well he&#039;s doing now that Dragon&#039;s are valuable and that they only intend for small changes.\n\nThis means that they still do not understand what the issue is with this rework and I am going to explain it again but with an example. \n\nLet us say that Riot decides they want to make {{champion:101}} a point blank burst mage that&#039;s good against divers. Sounds like a silly choice yes? \n\nBut here&#039;s how they intend to do it, they make it so that all of his abilities do less damage the further they are from him, to such an extent that hitting with the very tip of your Q does less damage than his auto attacks. So suddenly Xerath&#039;s winrate against divers and melee champs is better than his winrate against ranged champs, people build him tanky ap with things like RoA and the new Hextech items, Riot deems it a success because now Xerath is doing what they wanted, he is good at super close range and bad at long range.\n\nNow you tell me the obvious, this is completely ridiculous, Xerath is supposed to be a siege champ that has massive range, you haven&#039;t even changed his kit at all Specter, it&#039;s just made to be worse at range because of numbers. And this is exactly what&#039;s wrong with Skarner. His kit is not designed for neutral objective control, making it so his stats are terrible everywhere but around neutral objectives does not make him a good neutral objective controller, it makes him only useful around those objectives.\n\nNone of his skills are designed with the idea of controlling objectives and the rework was one of the shoddiest I&#039;ve ever seen, it tried to make  huge changes to how people play him with the least amount of effort possible by making his numbers better when near crystals and bad when not.\n\nThis is not something that can be remedied with small changes, either he needs to be redone to something like what he was before the rework or they need to completely destroy him and redo all of his abilities from the ground up. The last rework was a half-hearted attempt at making him different and another half-hearted attempt at fixing it will just result in further failure.\n\nPlease make my favorite bug great again.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wuvyekw.jpg\n\nEdit:\nSomeone has chided me for not giving my own solutions for Skarner. I admit, I too hate threads that just complain but don't suggest any solutions but ever since my application to Riot was rejected, I haven't felt much like posting ideas on the boards. Add to that that I have already given suggestions for this issue many times in the past and am tired of repeating myself about it and to no benefit and I think I'm justified in not posting any ideas in the OP. But I will do so now anyway since I had a discussion with someone else about how they could change Skarner.\n\nOne way to change Skarner is to make his ult capable of dragging his crystals but have it have a separate cooldown for using it on a crystal. This would allow you to SET UP where you want to put them so you could plan ahead on where you intend to fight. This would actually demonstrate some skill and require proper planing, both to set them up and to make sure you don't place one in a spot you could be zoned from. You'd have to reduce the range of the effects but at least this way you wouldn't be shackled to just fighting in the jungle.\n\nAnother thing would be to get rid of all the stat shit and instead make it so they give him utility or special effects on his abilities, the kinds of effects that would make him better at dealing with baron and dragon or maybe they'd give him his old passive on his Q again. Part of what makes the current crystals so bad is that they're just stat balls which is a lot of \"invisible power\" that Riot says they don't like.\n\nAnother would be to ditch the activation gimmick entirely and make it so Skarner's abilities, when used on the crystals, do more things. Maybe hitting his Q on a crystal causes it to ring out with a harmonic frequency that deals damage, or silences enemies for half a second, or maybe it slows enemies. Hitting his E on a crystal could cause a large beam of energy to shoot out towards the nearest enemy. Using his W while next to a crystal could apply his shield to all of his allies in range for half the value.\n\nIf we're talking about changes that involve the removal of the rock crutches, reverting him back to the version of him before the Juggernaut patch would be a fantastic solution that Riot would unfortunately never go for. So if it were something entirely different then perhaps make Skarner more like an actual scorpion, maybe remove his current ult and make his Q have him grab someone for a short time (Like .5 seconds) and make his E be a spammable short duration slow and his main damage source. Maybe make his W a crystal creator that has to be placed in the jungle or a bush and have it give him increased damage and so the idea is to drag someone to their doom into the crystal zone.\n\nFor now I'll need to stop since break ended but I'll continue this later.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2016-05-19T22:27:08.160+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hate the crystals, and I think Riot knows they aren't a great idea. \n\nThere are two kinds of minigames in LoL. There are minigames that involve everyone in the game, which usually suck, and there are minigames that involve just the champion and maybe one opponent. \n\nThe ones that **force** involvement from the whole game usually suck because they occupy so much of the game-space when they are present. I would put things like Skarner's crystals and GP's barrels in this category, just as the most egregious failures, perhaps. \n\nThen there's the ideal minigame, like with Taric's passive interaction with his Q. The person playing Taric really cares about this minigame, and it directly affects your performance on the champion, but it doesn't require your opponent to think about it very much. Sure, they know that sometimes you can heal very big, and sometimes less, and that auto-attacking helps you heal for more in shorter spurts, and they can play around that. But they don't have to constantly worry about an object on the map, and getting steamrolled if they don't control if and watch it at all times. \n\nMost minigames fall between these two, and I think that's okay, but when Riot introduces something like Skarner's crystals, they need to rework it. It just occupies too much of the game to justify it's existence, even if it's \"balanced.\" It brings up, for me, the big discussion between balance and health/fun, which is what you seem to be onto, as well. Yes, he's balanced like this. **That doesn't make him fun or interesting for the game. He is not. He is a bad champion right now, and it has nothing to do with balance.**","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-05-19T22:54:07.960+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly don't think GP's barrels, as a mini-game itself, is bad, I think the real issue with them is just that failing to beat him at his minigame is too punishing.

Skarner is a champion who lacks luster and outplay fun but he is a complete menace in any game where team positioning or cc control is poorly handled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lamarson","date":"2016-05-20T18:23:35.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"logged in to upvote RiotRepetoir. lets not give heat to one of the better riot employees.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-05-20T18:03:11.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Please make my favorite arachnid great again.\n\nFTFY :)\n\nI see your point though.

I shall edit my post to add some suggestions. However, as to your feelings about his new kit, I don't see how you can miss the old phage on his Q but not also the stun passive on it, the attack speed boost, and the better damage. I despise his current E because it's made ganking so dependent on landing it, miss it because you're trying to gank a hyper mobile champ like Lucian, Fiora or Ekko? Well now you get to walk back into the jungle because that's all you got. His previous passive made it so as long as you kept up with them enough to hit them with his Q's, you'd eventually be able to stun them long enough to get a kill.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-05-20T17:56:43.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a hyper-mobile champ you'd rarely get the 3Qs anyways and \nforget ganking mid back then (which you can now do).\n\nFor those champs you listed (which are usually top/bot) there is enough space in the lane that your E is usually point-blank anyways so its not that hard to hit.\nThere's nothing forcing you to use it before their dash if you're behind them already (river gank specifically).
