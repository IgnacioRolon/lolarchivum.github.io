It was basically a crazy April Fool&rsquo;s gag that ended up becoming hugely popular. Given how popular it is, lots of players want to know why we don&rsquo;t bring back regular URF more often. There&rsquo;s one reason that we haven&rsquo;t really talked about before now:\n> \n> URF makes some people stop playing League.\n> \n> Every time we ran regular URF, we&rsquo;d see a huge spike of games being played, and then the numbers actually dropped back down to a level that&rsquo;s lower than it was just before we ran URF.\n> \n> It&rsquo;s normal for new players to join League and for some longtime players to leave&mdash;this happens all the time. But when we turned on regular URF, it was different. In NA, for example, whenever we ran URF we&rsquo;d usually see over twice as many longtime players leave the game compared to what we would&rsquo;ve normally expected.\n> \n> In other words, some people binged on URF, and then suddenly stopped playing League. And the size of the dropoff indicates that it&rsquo;s not just people coming back for URF and then leaving afterwards. Despite spending a lot of time investigating the reasons, we aren&rsquo;t actually sure whether URF causes some sort of &ldquo;hangover&rdquo; effect or if it makes regular games feel slow by comparison&mdash;maybe it&rsquo;s because URF feels like playing League with cheats turned on. Regardless, after we turn on URF, total games played go down, as do overall game hours. And they don&rsquo;t recover for a long time, if ever.\n> \n> We&rsquo;ve been trying to wrap our heads around a way to solve this problem for a while, and that&rsquo;s one of the biggest reasons you see us experimenting with variations on the mode like ARURF and Snow Battle ARURF. Although these modes still suffer a bit from the &ldquo;binge-then-churn&rdquo; effect that regular URF has, it&rsquo;s not nearly as bad (probably because you&rsquo;re not seeing the same OP champs every game).\n> \n> URF causes some people to stop playing League, but a lot of you really love it. So instead of killing URF altogether, we&rsquo;re just gonna keep experimenting to find some healthier version of the mode. Tell us your thoughts about Snow Battle ARURF&mdash;we&rsquo;ll listen and apply what we learn to ARURF&rsquo;s next appearance.\n> Ghostcrawler &amp; Riot Cactopus\n\n\nWith all the complaining about ARUF on the boards, why is no one talking about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-22T07:02:47.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Essentially, Riot is saying that they're afraid of URF mode's popularity.

Urf competes highly with ranked mode, ranked mode is designed to get you addicted considering the way the 50% win rate mechanism works. when urf comes on, queue timers in ranked is quite high, many ranked only players who are not interested in URF are frustrated they decide to take a break till the mode is over. some never come back to league. Also, URF players gets to play so many games in a row, they eventually get worn out, they decide to take a break and may never come back either, considering adjusting to normal cdr then looks really slow. Riot not bringing back normal Urf was never about op picks, its more of the huge competition with ranked mode it creates.","replies":[{"poster":"Tristanl0l","date":"2017-12-22T18:43:59.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run a pasta shop but introduced a pizza dish that everyone loves just as much as the pasta.
