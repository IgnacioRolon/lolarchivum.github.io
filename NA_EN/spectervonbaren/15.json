After 3 seconds of not auto attacking the turret, the passive will reset.\r\n\r\nFor balance purposed it could also be disabled if the user is damaged by an enemy champion.\r\n\r\nNaturally numbers are subject to change but what do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-04-12T19:15:08.156+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe.. but it sounds like it could come down, \"lets just put bami's cinder on every tank item because its so good\" rather than buffing it for its own uniqueness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2015-04-12T21:21:21.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if Ohmwrecker had 25% bonus health like Cinderhulk?
