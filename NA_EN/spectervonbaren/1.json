While I wish I could claim that our aim with this event was calculated, and that our profits have been carefully accounted for in this business decision: it's straight up just us nerding out over the chance to share with our amazing players what we do when we make these decisions. Keep the feedback coming through the the production of the skin, super hyped that you guys are pumped, now let's go make some hotness!","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-11-01T05:32:28.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think you could slide in a suggestion to whoever is in charge of this kind of thing to think about it? I really want a Tahm skin that's not a \"joke\" skin. And I don't mean I want a super serious skin like Dark Star Tahm or something but rather one that's not meant to be a gag and plays more on his devilish or fantastical nature like that Wonderland Tahm skin that was shared a while back or maybe Godfather Tahm with him dressed like a mob boss.\n\nThanks for replying to my post by the way, I didn't expect to get a Rioter in this one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-10-31T20:41:16.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah gonna be lame though if the one that's voted for isn't the one I wanted <.<\n\nI mean, all these people voting, how many of them actually play illaoi","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2017-11-01T17:10:31.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The real question you should be asking is, out of teh people voting, how many will buy Illaoi along with the skin, (pick her up after the skin release).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-10-31T23:56:27.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did you choose to do the vite for Illaoi? She's gone almost two full years without a skin, and since we're voting now this will mean the skin will be completed... In January at earliest?\nSorry for being critic this time, but I'd have preferred to just get a skin for her. \n\nAlso, Illaoi has only one skin, do you really need to make a contest to choose the next one? A champ like ahri like you wrote in another comment would have made immensely more sense\n\nThis time I'm disappointed :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zark1989","date":"2017-10-30T19:49:19.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the voting idea as well. While it is cool to be surprised with a new skin it's not all that cool to wait for a skin just to be disappointed. Voting for a champ to get a skin, and then voting for a skin would be a cool way to include the players.

This is a very dangerous idea, I'd much rather see a gate where say only players with mastery 3 or higher on Illaoi could vote.","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2017-11-01T17:11:41.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, think of it this way, if people who don't play Illaoi vote, then they''ll be more likely to get the skin and play the champ.
