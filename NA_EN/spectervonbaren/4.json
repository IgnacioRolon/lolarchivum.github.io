My concern is that you&#039;ll over-nerf him to compensate for this if he turns out to be picked as a support too much. What is Riot&#039;s thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-03T21:54:32.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll certainly be keeping an eye on Veigar. Current thinking though is that if one or more mages end up being out of line it's much more likely to be some of the ones with larger changes rather than Veigar though (I'm personally particularly suspicious of Zyra, we'll see though).","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-05-03T22:00:06.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, thank you for replying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-05-05T03:14:36.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the little master of evil can be too evilllllllllll?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-05-03T21:59:34.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one of the problems we would encounter with Veigar is due to his large AP gain, he's gonna get a lot of AP without needing items, aka either being strong while building somewhat tanky/cdr or just being weak no matter what he builds, even if you change the ratios and base damages. \nTo sum it up, I am afraid the fact he gets too much AP from his passive while his kit is weak makes just that : either he's broken and can even build tanky or he's just not good enough for the meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-05-03T21:56:23.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hes gonna be broken as hell","replies":[]}]}
