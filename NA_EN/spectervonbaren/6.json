In this case though we felt Kindred was an unusual case, since they're generally strongest in a position many marksmen players won't play. Kalista was the marksman before that, and she's got a playstyle that can be pretty love it or hate it too. We felt there was a good case for another marksman in the spot after Illaoi as a result, feeling there were a significant number of players who hadn't had a marksman that worked for them since Jinx. \n> \n> As far as mages go we're with you though that, depending on what type of mage you like, it may have been a very long time since a new mage came out that fit your playstyle too (traditional caster types, rather than hybrids like Azir). We concluded getting a true caster mage into the lineup for 2016 was important as a result, and have one under development at the moment. Not appropriate to say anything about timeframe besides 'definitely this year' yet, working actively on filling the need for such a champ though.\n\nI'm placing my bet that this is referring to Aurelion Sol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2016-02-21T05:58:29.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on his name (translating to \"Golden Sun\"), he will probably be released with the Mount Targon event along with the Taric rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2016-02-21T00:52:51.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm hoping he is both, what's a dragon without his teeth and talons","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2016-02-21T05:45:20.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shhh\n\nonly tears now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ichinose","date":"2016-02-19T17:46:53.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They MUST !\n\n# #TENCENT PLS","replies":[]}]}
