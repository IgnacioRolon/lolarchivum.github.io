With Runeglaive, you need to focus on weaving your autoattacks into her combos.  This makes Elise harder to play optimally.  When was Lichbane last in Elise's core item builds?\n\nI agree by the way that buffing the AP on Runeglaive doesn't particularly help Elise.  It seems like a change focused at other AP champions and also more so done because Runeglaive as an item is perceived as being weak (since it doesn't fill hole left by the removal of Magus).\n\nIf I were RIOT, I would seriously question why they removed Magus.\n\nI disagree that patch 5.12 is the worst patch for Elise.  I think the worst patch for Elise is one that caused the only Elise player left in the LCS to stop playing her after all the other pro-LCS junglers had already dropped her from a previous nerf the patch before.  That was the worst patch for Elise ever and the patch that caused me to stop playing her even though she was my favorite champion at the time.  A lot has changed since then in terms of meta and items and stuff.  And I think that Elise players (including many who had stopped playing her and wanted to try her out again recently) haven't adapted yet to all the changes up to and including patch 5.12.\n\nFor example, none of the top five most popular Mastery pages for Elise are optimized for Runeglaive.  That is to say, they don't take the Spellweaving masteries.  While you might say that alone isn't enough to sink the boat, the point is that if Elise players fail to adapt to the patch, then their play can't be taken as representing \"The Spider Queen's\" true potential.  There is barely a credible guide detailing how to optimize Elise properly right now.\n\nElise isn't some \"spin to win\" champion.  She has a complex kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-07-01T02:24:31.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should just make her into a top lanner again and take her out of the jungle if they cannot balance her there. \n\nGoing to piss a lot of people off by doing this.
