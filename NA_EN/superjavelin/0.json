{"poster":"SuperJavelin","date":"2015-01-20T01:37:35.315+0000","title":"2017, Urgot rework just came through","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":98,"down_votes":4,"body":"I open the launcher and log in to my account for the reduced price of 190 IP (log-in costs 5% off in honor of the installation of the NA Farther West Coast servers). I have to re-purchase Urgot for 9600 IP. Champ reworks are basically new champs, and his new model is pretty much legendary-skin tier, so it's a steal.  I only have 9599 IP, so I go to www.loldrawforpoints.esports, Riot's official crowd sourced advertisement site, and draw a crappy picture of Ezreal drinking Mountain Dew. For my efforts, I am given 2 IP. Purchasing Urgot, I queue up for some ranked. I read the patch notes 2 hours ago, so he's basically my main at this point.\r\n\r\nSince I'm playing on the new servers, I get first pick (pick order determined by ping.) The enemy bans Gnar, Azir, and Maokai. What is this, season 5? rofl. I first pick Urgot and go to Urgot's wiki to kill time. Urgot, like the last eight champs, was made by CertainlyT, so no surprise there. Gotta check out the new lore, tho.\r\n> \"Urgot has a dark, secret past.\"\r\n\r\nLore guys working overtime. That's a clean two words over the average. Always amazed me how they can say so much with so little. Letting the reader fill in the blanks is so artful. Enthralling myself with ideas of what might have happened to Urgot, i wait while the last picks on each side are automatically assigned Yasuo and the game loads in.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game automatically purchases Doran's Blade, Doran's Trinket and fifteen Doran's Potions for me, and I have to sell the blade for a Doran's Ring since I'm using vvvortic's AP Urgot build. \r\n\"Are you SURE you want to sell the recommended item?\"\r\nI click yes. \r\n\"You have not played a game with the recommended build yet. Please play at least one game using the recommended build.\"\r\nDang, guess I'll do AD 'got next game. Lane AI walks each of the laners to their appointed spot in each of the four lanes, while the jungler is kept in the jungler box at base. The jungler box opens at 5 minutes to prevent early game snowballing. Turns out my enemy laner is the archaic champion LeBlanc. She clearly didn't read Urgots rework, this'll be a stomp.\r\n- 2017\r\n- playing mana champs\r\n- playing a champ with only two dashes and two knockups\r\n- donttouchmeyoufilthycasual.jpeg\r\n\r\n\r\nI level my Q so that I get a long ranged poke and the free 10% CDR and movespeed from the passive portion. Urgot's actual passive uses the \"Morals\" resource in lieu of mana, which gives him a light and dark form. Since I'm in my light form, I get even more movespeed. At level one, I'm fast enough to dodge LB's dash. A timer for her dash cooldown appears at the top of my screen. I finally reach level three. With my passive's passives and the combined three additional passives from each of my active abilities, I'm ready to all in this scrub. I set my Ignite to Auto Cast and go on the offensive. \r\n\r\nI land a Q, giving me a stack on my Doran's Trinket (rewards good play for landing skillshots), and immediately reactivate to dash to her (since I'm in light form). She Distorts away and I use a charge of trinket to dash and knock her up under her tower. Using my shield puts me into dark form. Another Q knocks her up again now that I'm in dark form and refreshes my trinket again. At this point, Ignite senses that the enemy can be killed calculating hp regen, held items, and any nearby healing champs, so it casts. I trinket dash out to drop aggro and get the kill. Lather, rinse, repeat as I periodically back and receive portions of my recommended build from the shop.\r\n- hfw I can land skillshots\r\n- hfw meaningful decisions\r\n- hfw she just got separated from the great LeBlancs\r\nAt 6 minutes I take LeBlanc's tower, and the impassable forcefields on either side of my lane disappear. My jungler executes himself on blue buff to remove the invincibility from our jungle camps, so he's on track for a solid 10 minute gank. Everything's going well.\r\n\r\n\r\nFast forward - a late game teamfight breaks out when we're doing Dragon and LeBlanc walks over our Baron ward. Our team instantly dashes past mid lane, their team dashes from their krugs, and the fight breaks out in front of purple's razorbeak camp. Everyone blows all trinket charges and knockup abilities right away, so every champion flies off screen in a mass. I sip my coffee while I wait for us to land. Basically whoever's Yasuo lands first wins the fight. Our Yasuo lands and ults, knocking them all up again and giving us time to recharge our trinkets and cool down our knockup abilities. After a while we allow their corpses to fall to the ground. Using the previously released champion who can knock up turrets, we ignore all tower aggro and push for the win.\r\n\r\nThe LeBlanc was a good sport though, so I gift her 200 RP towards the ultimate skin. I already have mine fully paid off, so I'll be able to use it whenever it actually gets released. So, GD, my question is this:\r\n\r\nWhich of the new Urgot skins do I get for my new main? The one with movespeed or the one with CDR?","replies":[]}
