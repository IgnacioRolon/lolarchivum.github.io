Ninjas are not tanks. Shen is a ninja, nInjas are squishy and unarmoured, ninjas are fast and very deadly. Tanks are big and armoured, and they are slow and take alot of hits. Shen should be an assassin, not a tank.\n\nEDIT\nTurns out Shen's lore makes him a guardian? So hes technically supposed to be a tank.\n(Still building him as an assassin though.)

The word ninja derives from the Japanese characters \"nin\" and \"ja.\" \"Nin\" initially meant \"persevere,\" but over time it developed the extended meanings \"conceal\" and \"move stealthily.\" In Japanese, \"ja\" is the combining form of sha, meaning \"person.\" Ninjas originated in the mountains of Japan over 800 years ago as practitioners of ninjutsu, a martial art sometimes called \"the art of stealth\" or \"the art of invisibility.\" They often served as military spies and were trained in disguise, concealment, geography, meteorology, medicine, and also other martial arts. Popular legends still associate them with espionage and assassinations, but modern ninjas are most likely to study ninjutsu to improve their physical fitness and self-defense skills.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBenchedKench","date":"2017-05-07T20:45:44.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But Shen isn't a modern ninja, hes a traditional spiritual ninja from Ionia. \nBut ninjustsu might be that weird thingy where he does the Naruto hand-signs right?","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-07T20:47:11.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is a guardian which is part of what ninjas do is to protect their emperor","replies":[{"poster":"TheBenchedKench","date":"2017-05-07T20:54:18.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There you go, now I know why Shen is a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-07T20:56:05.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but i really want a secret service skin for shen \n\nhttp://imgur.com/QAnIHbL","replies":[{"poster":"TheBenchedKench","date":"2017-05-07T21:02:19.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Secret Service Skinline.\nJhin\nShen\nZed\nYi\nWho-ever Else.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-07T21:04:37.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nooo \n\nshen is a bodyguard who comes out of no whwere to take the bullet to protect his \"carry' aka president","replies":[{"poster":"TheBenchedKench","date":"2017-05-07T21:08:54.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That reminds me of this time when I was playing Shen with a friend.\nWe were duo-bot, the enemy team had a Jhin adc.\nI managed to block the three shots, but my friend was still at 100 HP, and the fourth shot would have killed him. \nBut like a dumbass, my friend decided \"Im going to flash to the side to try to juke.
