As such, all of the steps below are recommended for you to regain full control of your League of Legends account:\n\n1. Download [MalwareBytes Free](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/), or another antivirus application, and run a complete computer scan. Remove any malware following that scan. \n2. Change any passwords that you believe may have been compromised. You can change your League of Legends password by going to the [League of Legends account area](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/protect) in the top-right corner of this page. Click on your summoner name, and select \"Settings\". In the box that comes up, click \"Change Password\" and follow said steps. Note: You'll want to also change your email account password to ensure that your account cannot be compromised again. \n3. Now that your account is secure (hopefully), we'll deal with the issue of the unauthorized actions: \n\n_____________________________\n\nAs this is an account-specific inquiry, we can't assist you much further on the boards. You'll need to [submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) regarding your issue. A few tips as you submit your request: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Rioter request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue. \n2. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n3. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. \n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-20T01:37:43.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should probably send in a ticket if you feel this way.
