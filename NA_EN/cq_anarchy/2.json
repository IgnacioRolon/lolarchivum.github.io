Like what is this if it doesn't even show   the PLAY button on the top.  Like is it telling me to go play Overwatch and quit league? If that's the case I will. Please fix the client. And also what the hell is this thing popping up every time I open the client I can't play for god sake I have an internet that works 100% fine. Work on this crapy terrible client issues, please.  \r\n\r\nfile:///Users/charliepark/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-22%20at%2023.13.56.png\r\nfile:///Users/charliepark/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-22%20at%2023.11.18.png","replies":[{"poster":"Branimal","date":"2016-11-24T05:01:58.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree man. So far I am not liking this new client whatsoever. The updates are brutally slow and not representative of my download/upload speeds. The initialization is slower, prompts me with updates/scans when it just said I was up to date. Is asking for new command permissions for icons? In the actual thing when you finally get there ( hours later) the look of it is cheap and visually lacking comparative to the previous client. Honestly, Riot should just keep the old client and not waste time on this new one. When it gets phased in and we are not able to use the older one I will be seriously disappointed. I understand it is still beta but technical issues aside it does not aesthetically/functionally play nor look better. The old one already had an update to get where it is at currently and suffices just fine. If it aint broke, don't try to fix it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T00:55:29.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't see the images you attempted to provide since they weren't hyperlinks to images stored online.
