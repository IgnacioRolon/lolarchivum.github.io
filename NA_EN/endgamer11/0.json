I have heard over the years that the code for LoL is messy, so will there ever be a complete rewrite, or at this point is there too much stuff to completely redo it? I heard that the 2.5 AS cap is in place because of coding limitations, so maybe it could be higher with all new code, along with less random bugs caused during tweaks.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-21T09:45:51.923+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of the code's updated or rewritten entirely every patch. Which bits depend on where we think there's the most value (what features should be added, where do we see the most problematic or common bugs, are there ways to make the game run more efficiently etc). \n\nAs far as attack speed goes the cap's not there for code reasons, but gameplay and animation ones. On the gameplay side having a cap allows you to take a maximum into account for balance reasons (what's the absolute max Xin Zhao can reduce his CDs by for example). Animation wise it then gives a range of possible attack speeds that attacks need to be made to look good and feel right for (do attacks remain distinct, feel natural, read clearly etc).","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-02-21T10:12:37.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would that mean you could screw around with the AS cap in a custom game mode like URF if you wanted to?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-21T10:17:44.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd imagine so, though there'd probably be a bit of code work needed to enable that of course.

I'm fairly sure Trist could reach around 2.2 AS just by poping her Q on URF and you still wanted to build a PD/IE to use the stronger crits, allowing champs to break the AS cap might have made auto champs more playable.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-02-21T23:12:01.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.
