Lol\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I&#039;m thinking of things that I would like to do later, ya know?\r\n-_-\r\nSo I&#039;ll just get to the questions now.\r\n\r\n* How do you decide which concepts go through and which ones don&#039;t?\r\n* How doyou decide who is gonna get a skin?\r\n* Are there different persons for:\r\n-Comming up with a concept\r\n-Drawing concept art\r\n-Making the 3d models\r\n-Making the textures for these models.\r\n_I know the VFX&#039;s are done by a &#039;&#039;VFX artis&#039;&#039; Because the guy who did BM Kennens particles commented about it in a thread :P_\r\n* Have you ever made a skin for a champion you hate, and did you feel any different while making it? :P\r\n* If the guys who make champions made a new champion that:\r\n-Has a Gryphon pet\r\n-Is voiced by Morgan Freeman\r\n-Has &#039;&#039;badassness&#039;&#039; in being calm and knowing what he does, kinda like Gandalf\r\n-Plays like a mage fighter\r\n-Has some things about him that YOU feel like he should have.\r\n**What would his release skin be?** Just tell me the first or coolest thing that comes to mind.\r\n* Do you ever feel stressed out because of deadlines? (I do -.-) I should ask if there are deadlines actually...\r\n* What happens if you for some reason can&#039;t finish something before the deadline?\r\n* Is there a skin concept that you REALLY wanna make, but &#039;&#039;your boss&#039;&#039; (Or whoever goes over that) won&#039;t let you?\r\n* Do you often/ sometimes/ ever get to make concepts that you really wanna make to actual skins?\r\n* Sion/GP skin? (I had to do it, sorry.)\r\n-_-\r\nIf someone at the skins team would take some time to awnser some of my questions, That would be awesome &lt;3\r\nHave a great day everyone! ^-^\r\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-19T19:33:07.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\n\nHoly crap, there's a lot of questions here. Lemme see what I can tackle! \n\n> Anyhow, I'm thinking of things that I would like to do later, ya know?\n\nI'd suggest dabbling in several different aspects and see what you like! College is a great time to find your niche! \n\n**How do you decide which concepts go through and which ones don't?**\n\nThis depends on if the team decides if the thematic is strong enough to work for a champion. If it doesn't we may shelve it for later, and potentially come back to it at a later time. This is something we did with Guardian of the Sands Rammus, Xerath and Skarner. \n\n**How do you decide who is gonna get a skin?**\n\nThere are a few different ways. \n\n* We go into a meeting with a thematic in mind and talk about which champions may work for the thematic.\n* We go into a meeting with an event in mind, like Snowdown, and talk about champions who could work for the thematic.\n* We go into a meeting to talk about a particular champion, and run ideas about what kind of thematic would work for them.\n\nIn any case, we do talk about the champions who haven't had a skin in a while to see if they're potential candidates for the theme/event, etc.\n\n**Are there different persons for:\n-Comming up with a concept\n-Drawing concept art\n-Making the 3d models\n-Making the textures for these models.\nI know the VFX's are done by a ''VFX artis'' Because the guy who did BM Kennens particles commented about it in a thread :P**\n\nYes! We have a different person for all of those. \n\n\n**Have you ever made a skin for a champion you hate, and did you feel any different while making it? :P**\n\nI'm QA, so I've been on the team working on the skin in terms of ideation, giving feedback and testing.\n\nI've worked on some skins I'm not particularly thrilled about, but it's usually because I'm not a fan of the champion. It doesn't really affect the effort I put in, I'm just more excited about some skins than others.\n\nFun fact - I've recently picked up jungle because I worked on Blood Moon Elise and really wanted to play it 'cause I love the skin.\n\n**If the guys who make champions made a new champion that:\n-Has a Gryphon pet\n-Is voiced by Morgan Freeman\n-Has ''badassness'' in being calm and knowing what he does, kinda like Gandalf\n-Plays like a mage fighter\n-Has some things about him that YOU feel like he should have.\nWhat would his release skin be? Just tell me the first or coolest thing that comes to mind.**\n\nNo idea on these. D: We have a seperate champion team who handles the creation of the champion. My team (skins) only helps to make the launch skin!\n\nThe first thing that came to mind was Spellthief. :x\n\n\n**Do you ever feel stressed out because of deadlines? (I do -.-) I should ask if there are deadlines actually...**\n\nWe do have hard deadlines for some content, especially for events like Lunar Revel and Snowdown. We make content for every patch, and yeah, sometimes it's stressful. The feeling of players loving the stuff we make helps to drown out the stress. :P\n\n**What happens if you for some reason can't finish something before the deadline?**\n\nWe make it happen in cases of deadlines for events like Snowdown! We ask for help from other teams! For stuff without hard deadlines, we may move skins around internally in terms of release to make sure the skin gets the time it needs in production before releasing it. \n\n**Is there a skin concept that you REALLY wanna make, but ''your boss'' (Or whoever goes over that) won't let you?**\n\nSea Witch Nami is a skin I'd absolutely love to have. Shockowaffel designed it! It's not that our manager/boss won't let us make it. We bring up ideas, and it's something we decide together. Just because it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it can't happen in the future! :D \n\nhttp://orig08.deviantart.net/8bad/f/2014/337/0/a/sea_witch_nami_splash_art_by_shockowaffel-d88fyz0.jpg\n\n**Do you often/ sometimes/ ever get to make concepts that you really wanna make to actual skins?**\n\n\nI don't personally make concepts, but I've seen some pretty awesome stuff by artists. A former concept artist, Sam, does an awesome stream where he makes [fan art that people suggest](http://riotpenguin.blogspot.com/2013/12/fan-art-for-fans.html)! He most recently made Blood Moon Nami! \n\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kBzPbqNnp4o/Vq6j-QnIamI/AAAAAAAAAmw/LX1yRAfmm7I/s1600/BloodMoonNami.jpg\n\n**Sion/GP skin? (I had to do it, sorry.)**\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not able to speak to what we may or may not have in development! :x\n\nHope this helps! ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-02-19T20:55:03.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooh Penguin isn't at Riot anymore?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-19T20:57:59.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not, but he[ parted on good terms](https://twitter.com/TheDirePenguin/status/699797961425813504)! :]","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2016-02-19T22:12:09.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"who is replacing him in the quest for an evil skin for every champion, I seem to remember last year a new artist joined who said that they would continue his work on making evil skins for all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-02-19T21:55:12.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh damn...\nI sure hope to sometime see his Nurse Sora become true.

I think this post would make a good basis for a dev blog, don't you think? :)\nThese are questions you (the skins team) are asked often, and I think many players would be interested in having a bit more insight in how the skins team works. The ones who regularly follow the boards know these info, but a lot of players don't. Besides, it would be handy to have everything put down clearly in a dev blog, also for future reference  :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-19T23:27:29.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, this could be a sweet topic! ^-^","replies":[]}]}]}]}
