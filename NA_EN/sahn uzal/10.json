If you autoattack without getting a crit, then your chance of getting a crit on the next autoattack increases. It decreases the variance for longer autoattack chains.\n\nThe problem is that this system makes that assumption that you're autoattacking a lot. This assumption works fine for ADCs because they autoattack so much, but if you're only doing 1-2 crit-reliant attacks a fight (like GP's barrel combos), then you're still completely reliant on RNG.

It's just a problem now because the \"mathematically best\" build is getting Trinity+IE and a bunch of ArP/AD and hoping for that 20% crit hit since almost every other crit item is just so lackluster on him since arguably a good 1/3 of its value is wasted since he isn't auto attacking.\n\nA solution could honestly be to just give his Q the Yasuo treatment where it doesn't benefit from CDR but instead gets lowered by AS to a fixed point to make P Daddy/Shiv not used solely for their bonus effect and 30% crit.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2016-07-24T19:15:24.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, at least the attack speed items still have useful secondary effects for GP. Statikk with its lighting bolt (does massive damage) and Phantom Dancer with its damage reduction (better dueling potential).\n\nAnother solution for this problem would be to create more non-AS crit items. There was an item named The Lightbringer (removed on 6.12) that gave 30% crit chance and would also give 30 AD. It also had two amazing passives: one that revealed enemy invisible traps (ex: Teemo's shrooms, Shaco's boxes) and another that would deal magic damage to enemies equal to 90% of your bonus AD for 3 seconds each time you scored a critical strike. In addition to its active effect that was essentially an old red trinket (it would also reveal stealthed champions).\n\nDespite its low amount of AD, this item would work well outside of Summoner's Rift as a means of allowing GP to stack crit without resorting to purchasing attack speed items.\n\nThis item, if properly tuned, could be activated on Summoner's Rift and could allow champions which benefit from crit but not from AS to benefit from it.

It might be that she gets no crits, but would crit with the next 3, just that this wouldn't matter as she's already dead by then.\nOne might say that this is a very hypoteticayl scenariou, but you often have very similar situations to this in game. There are often situation there 1 pr 2 crits within a few AAs make all the difference.\nAnd pseudo random is a bit mislleading. For every single hit, whether you crit or not is still 100% rng based.
