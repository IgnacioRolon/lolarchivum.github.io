Like 2/3/4/5/6? Or something?  I love Gangplank and I hate his constant nerfs. Maybe with what I suggested then Gangplank could max Q or E 1st.

Some GP mains, myself included, noticed that at some point recently (likely happened on patch 6.5) Gangplanks E had its delay between casts increased from .25 to something like .5, this wasn't listed in any patch changes so I was wondering if you had any insight on this change? Thanks a ton in advance!\n\nHere is a post to the bug report boards which includes a video of the change, can also check it on live of course =)  http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/JXm1Odun-gangplank-delay-between-placing-barrels-doubled-in-65","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-03-16T23:03:27.870+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyas!  Double-checked on this. This wasn't a bug that was introduced in 6.5.  This was part of the 5.17 nerfs: the timing on the spell looks funny because how and when it's calculated, but it mimics a .25 CD between casts as referenced in those patch notes.  \n\nSorry for the confusion.  On the bright side, should be the same barrel chaining as you've had since 5.17.","replies":[{"poster":"HotChilly","date":"2016-03-17T02:45:20.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaah ok ok.

I used to get \n{{item:3078}} >{{item:3031}} > Potentially a situational item > {{item:3508}} \nRight now, Im trying some new stuff out. I'm kinda liking this\n{{item:3078}} > {{item:3508}} > {{item:3031}} .. But if I have to get a situational item, my IE will be really delayed, and i'm not sure how much I like that.\n\nOh and do you have Sultan GP? Do you think that skin's worth it? c: I already own Captain and Spooky GP and I'm considering buying a thirth skin because #Variation\n-_-\nI also had one non GP related question... What do you think about the fact that tanks will basically always rush a {{item:3751}}/{{item:3068}}  ? I enjoyed getting things like {{item:3024}} first on Sion, but in a tank matchup I do not feel like I can... Bamis just feels like it's so much stronger.. I would ask something about {{item:3512}} but it's getting nerfed already... so I dun need to c:\n\nEDIT: There's a bug with Gangplanks farming score on the scoreboard, I don't know if your colleagues are aware of this.. But, for example, I remember in a game where I had 300 + farm. I specifically looked at my CS when I reached 300. In the post game lobby it said I had 280 farm... ;_; I could try to reproduce it in a custom game...

It was undertuned for awhile and we didn't see much of it. Now its closer to its armor counterparts, which is good.

The barrels seem like they were meant to have some of the highest counter play in the game, and be rewarded for that in the form of doing Tons of Damage, with a loss of 40% of his barrels it is now a really big deal to lose a barrel, and thats how it should be as long as they are as impactful as they are! \n\nI worry about his global ult being too strong, especially in competitive play, maybe a TF or Pantheon type of range would be good for it. Give people a little warning or suspicion when GP wanders off closer to your lane. The amount of frustration and eye rolling I see in higher elo streams when they get GP ulted in the middle of their 2v2 bot lane is pretty unfortunate to watch and probably draws a lot of GP bans haha.  Maybe a silver serpent upgrade to bring it back to global would be fun? Who knows! \n\nAnyways thanks again you guys at riot for creating my favorite champ!
