I haven&#x27;t seen these changes in a playtest yet myself though, or had a chance to follow up on them, so not sure if they&#x27;re hitting the desired mark or need further iteration.\n\nHey, Meddler.\n\nMain Malzahar player here.\n\nMost of Malzahar's power (in lane) comes from void swarming, aka, \"spawn on champion hit\". You use your W, apply E if voidlings aren't targetting the opponent already (else, you can hold it for one second or two), wait a little, and then reset your E (usually with ulti first, Q after). It's all about letting voidlings spawn, and then stunning the opponent in place just enough time for them to kill him.\n\nHealthy or not healthy, overpowered or not, that's how Malzahar wins. His new Q, E and R ratios are simply too low to be impactful without W.\n\nIf you're going to remove the void spawn on champion hit, you're pretty much _disabling_ the entire champion in lane. That wouldn't be a bad change if you were, for example, compensating that massive (champion-breaking) change with higher EQ ratios, as that would shift his playstyle more towards combos and less towards minions. But ALAS, you're not doing that. Having minions every 4 seconds has its advantages (better tower pushing, harder for enemies to disable you entirely with a single ranged hit or smite), but Malzahar does not have enough CC to keep his opponents nearby for 8 seconds BEFORE he starts dealing serious damage. This would make Malz go from overpowered to useless because he is ENTIRELY reliant on that mechanic.\n\nPutting a massive cooldown ON TOP OF THAT is just unneeded overkill. You could very well LOWER it instead, and Malz damage would still be non-existent.\n\nMy suggestions are:\n- Keep the higher cooldown, but bring back the \"champion on hit mechanic\";\n- Do not increase W cooldown at all AND give some small buffs to his QE to compensate for the moderate/ breaking nerfs to the very mechanics that makes him work in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-06-28T05:17:59.279+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is very true.

If you don't play to this only strength of his, then you're going to get demolished. \nNot to mention this completely removes jungle malzahar in the current state of the changes. His voidlings aren't being re-adjusted on damage against monsters, yet would not longer be able to spawn off of them. \n\nFrankly how they've gone about linking the skills together puts malzahar on a knife's edge. Either they will nerf something and it will reverberate through the rest of his kit's power, or they will buff something and it will be multiplied by the rest of the kit. It's a terrible state to be in for balancing... yet they were hoping to make them easier to balance.\n\nThey need to unlink the skills and remove the shared timers on the voidlings. To remove the shared timers means they'd have to go through with this change, but the current design of the skill can't realistically be balanced, it's far too inconsistent by nature. More voidlings is fine, but for balance, the core of any kit has to be the consistent parts, his E and to a lesser extent his Q.\n\nIronically moving the power away from his W would also reduce the power of his passive, as it's only real power, outside of gank avoidance, is protecting from burst to allow for voidlings to amass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-06-28T09:22:29.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen\n\nmy entire trading with malzahar is reliant on dumping voidling on opponents face applying some space aids and yelling out loud go forth and multiply\n\nit just wont work without the multiply part\n\ni mean i can use the q on my opponent and he just shrughs and laughs.\nhis solo kill pressure is already low\n\ndestroying his swarming just leaves him useless untill his other abilities are buffed and then were pretty much back to prerework malzahar\n\ncome to think of it isnt this what happened to velkoz?\n\nwhos next viktor? brand? vlad?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-06-28T01:51:35.635+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdYETmMr,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-06-27T23:58:37.888+0000)\n>\n> From memory the intent is to both nerf Malz (he&#x27;s too strong) and clean up how Voidlings function (at present good and bad uses of the spell aren&#x27;t sufficiently distinguished).

Since the rework malzahar has been significantly pushed into the \"battle mage\" design space with a particular emphasis on neutral objective control. This means he must have a strong and reliable sustained damage pattern against champions  and monsters to succeed at his function. Removing his ability to reliably deal significant sustained damage to these targets eliminates his unique strengths (making him either generically good or bad depending on numbers) rather than preserving his unique strength and weakening extraneous power (which would keep him strong at his intended role while weakening him when he is outside of his niche). I would suggest that targeting his Q or R (which are less integral to his gameplay function) would be better than targeting his primary damage source.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-06-29T14:05:33.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In what world are his voidlings the \"reliable sustained damage\" of his kit?

I haven&#x27;t seen these changes in a playtest yet myself though, or had a chance to follow up on them, so not sure if they&#x27;re hitting the desired mark or need further iteration.\n\nTo make an analogy, taking away the voidling spawn on champion hit from Malzahar kit is like taking away the teleport from Kassadin ulti. The entire champion is balanced around those mechanics, and removing them would make them completely unfunctional. And then you're still adding a higher cooldown on top of that, which is just beating a dead horse at this point.\n\nAgain, I like the idea behind the new W you guys are testing out. You just have to change his remaining kit to make up for that.\n\nProblems with old W:\n1. It can be entirely disabled in cheesy ways (one ranged hit or two, one smite, accidental AoE), which skilled Malzahar players can't do much about it. New W fixes that.\n2. It can give some cheesy, free wins to Malzahar players (void swarming chasing target until their death, even when Malz is no longer around them). Not quite an expression of skill, right? New W tones that down greatly, which is good.\n\nOther advantages of new W:\n1. It adds some much needed nuance to Malzahar's playstyle. Players can now use voidlings to break towers, further strenghting one of the champion's main strengths (lane-pushing). It doesn't seems too strong, neither, considering that voidlings will still get instant-gibbed by turrets.\n\nNew problems that the new W brings:\n1. Massive cooldown leads to boring play. Seriously, who enjoys playing a champion whose key, non-ultimate skill is on a 30 second cooldown? Malzahar isn't yasuo, who can spam and make excellent plays with the only two remaining skills. EQ combo is cool, but if that's the only thing you're going to do most of the time, it's not.\n2. The biggest one, as I've mentioned in my previous post: the entire champion kit is balanced around voidling swarming. E barely deals any damage anymore. Same for Q. Comboing them leads to decent damage, but not enough for the amount of time it takes. The main reason why EQ works so well is because your opponent has an ARMY of voidlings chasing them during that time. That's it. Your opponent is going to run toward their turret and out of your range, and your only tool to stop them is a 2.5 second surpress on your ulti. That's it. After you apply E for a few seconds, you have 2.5 seconds to kill your opponent. And how do you kill your opponent in 2.5 seconds? With 3+ voidlings eating them away PLUS E PLUS R going simultaneously (and a Q to finish them sometimes). If voidlings are going to spawn every 4 seconds now, then you'll need 8 seconds to get 3, and that's only so they can get their attack speed boost. You'll then need at least 2-3+ more seconds so these 3 voidlings can deal enough damage in the first place. That's insane(ly underpowered). Malz does not have the AP ratios to kill an opponent fast enough nor the CC to hold an opponent for 12 seconds nearby him. Voidlings do not have the health nor the armor to survive that long neither. The entire champion would simply disappear with this mechanical change.\n\nMake voidlings spawn every 3 or every 2 seconds instead. Make their attack speed stronger so that, when you finally get 3 of them, you can deal enough damage in time (whatever time you may have left) to kill your opponent. Subtly buff his EQ ratios. And no boring 30 second cooldown on W, please. Perhaps with those adjustements, Malz will become healthier to the game, while still being fun to play, if not potentially more fun than he currently is (more reliance on EQ combos and more nuanced gameplay is something that he currently needs, else he is sometimes too easy and mindless to play at its current state).","replies":[{"poster":"Rouwhorst","date":"2016-07-01T09:46:08.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great analysis.\nI think I can add something to the problems with the old W namely that the damage is too unreliable:\n\nFirst I refer to DEADLYCHUCK's comment above.\n\nSecondly his W pretty much needs his E, especially in the laning phase. When you use your E on a minion(wave), you indirectly throw away your W.  This often creates an easy opportunity for the opponent to engage, and because you do not want that to happen you have to keep his E off cooldown, resulting in a laning phase where Malzahar does not really use his E that much. This is not that big of a problem, and now Malzahar has to think when and where he wants to apply his E, which I quite like. I am just stating this here to make people aware of this.\n\nThirdly his W gets shut down pretty easily.\nYou mentioned killing the voidlings, but there are other ways to disable it:\nPreventing vision, e.g. walking into a brush causes the voidlings to lose aggro and walk back to the minion wave.\nCrowd control, e.g. Volibear's E, Jax's W can quite reliably shut down the voidlings for 3 seconds.\n\nThe problem I personally have is that Malzahar relies on an unreliable damage source and on the mistakes of the opponent(s).\nA smart opponent will just make sure to shut down his W and only then engage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-06-28T10:26:42.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, making them spawn every X seconds doesn't even seem that bad...\nCurrently, one can burst the first Voidling, and Malz's entire W is gone.\nMaking them spawn over time makes them more reliable which would allow them to deal less raw damage.\nBut making him rely on killing units...\nThat just eats a decent chunck of his power budget while being completely unreliable outside of laningphase...\nI don't know, I'll guess we'll see how it'll play out.","replies":[{"poster":"Have a Nice Game","date":"2016-06-28T13:13:04.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They still share timers, so wouldn't the following voidlings from the 4s timer not spawn if the first got smited?","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-06-28T13:20:38.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that would really suck.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-06-27T20:25:51.806+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"They look like a massive nerf I'll tell you what.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-06-27T20:30:29.468+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do.\n\n> Every 4 seconds\n\nI like that part, shooting the first Voidling twice won't completely stop Voidlings from spawning.\n\n> and whenever a Voidling assists in killing a unit\n\nSo we're giving him more laningpower, but reduce his power in mid/lategame?\nSo...
