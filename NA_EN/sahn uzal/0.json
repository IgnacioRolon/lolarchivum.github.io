I recommend taking a look at the whole post, since he covers a lot of different examples, but here's an excerpt about klepto.\n\n> Kleptomancy - Somewhat randomized loot create a series of decisions to make around what to do with your new stuff and a bunch of exciting moments. Excessive impact of randomness is controlled by a large sample size (getting a lot of loot over the course of the game), controls on which items you can get at any point in time based off what you've recently got and how far into the game it is (no Elixir of Skill early on for example). Randomness on gold bags is also somewhat mitigated by players being able to choose to opt out of the randomized reward. Giving up another keystone also helps opponents respond to early spikes in power especially (lacking a combat keystone for direct trades).","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2018-02-15T00:04:11.701+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":0,"body":"IDK about others, but my issue with Klepto isn't over the course of the whole game; it's during the early phases, when a lucky potion drop suddenly gives him the advantage on trades. Or maybe I'm playing Teemo, hit 6, and start carefully setting up shrooms knowing that in order to counter them my opponent would have to do an early trinket swap (leaving them ward-less), only for him to suddenly pull an Oracles out of his rear and clear all my shrooms. Or any matchup where my opponent (playing a champion balanced around having no sustain) gets a lot of Health (and mana?) potions and can't be out-traded?\n\nI can't plan around RNG. I can't counter-build it.

You don't need to rely on getting something to do your job, you can do your job whenever you want. And, I'm sorry again, but how are things like Electrocute any different?? \n\nYou can't play around the damage from Electrocute already more than you would normally play. \"Dodge things\" as counterplay to electrocute, is the same as fighting someone with Kleptomancy. Phase Rush doesn't give you any room to deny their speed buff, as much as you would while fighting someone with Kleptomancy. Keystones naturally have a form of power that can't be played against.\n\n Kleptomancy just gives that power in different ways, in exchange for not being 24/7 and consistent","replies":[{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2018-02-15T23:36:08.751+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would it help to mention that what they're talking about has a lot to do with perception and real-time analysis, and that the unpredictability of klepto ruins a lot of that for players to some degree?\n\nLet's take your example of Klepto vs Electrocute, or even someone having summoner spells/abilities up. Everything in that sentence you can actively plan around and account for in your decision making within reason *except*for Klepto. \n\nI can look up the early damage values of electrocute and plan around that. \"I'm at 30% and my opponent has electrocute up. I probably shouldn't try to fight right now because that will give them enough damage to all in me unless they waste X ability because that's what gives them enough to proc it.\" \n\nI can look up the cooldown for Lulu polymorph, and decide not to dive Lulu while she has it up. I can decide not to try and all in bot lane when they have summoners up and we don't because I know just how big of an advantage it gives them or decide to all in them because we have summs and they dont and the 90hp base on heal will be enough to come out of top.\n\nWith Klepto, the level of RNG is so high that it becomes really hard to plan and make decisions around it. Do I just never decide to trade pre-3 because klepto might give them an additional skill point mid fight and suddenly they have access to another skill? \"Nah, the chances of that are really low\", but if it happens I get screwed. You can clear their vision and abuse the fact that they've used all their trinket wards until klepto suddenly gives them another and your sweeper is now on cd. But how you can account for that? How can you account for every single situation where klepto might have an unexpected \"high\" that will turn the tide of the fight and do that constantly in real time scenarios on top of all the other things you have to think about during the game? You can't in a meaningful way which is the problem people have with it. You can't just never try to trade with someone because they *might* get a pot mid fight. At least with crit, you have a percentage that can be used to estimate how often a *single* thing (bonus damage) may happen.","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2018-02-16T06:38:00.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, you covered exactly what I would have when I was going to reply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-02-16T01:53:14.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> You can clear their vision and abuse the fact that they've used all their trinket wards until klepto suddenly gives them another and your sweeper is now on cd.\n\nAnd that's a choice they can choose, just like how I can choose to add another 100 or so damage to an early game combo. Inspiration is about handling situations outside of outright power, being able to have more vision in exchange for damage is the trade off. Getting gold for item powerspikes, instead of combo damage is the trade off.\n\n Why should you be able meaningfully respond to something that isn't damage? Sure ya can get a few temporary points of AP and AD from Klepto, but those don't account at all for the difference between an actual damage keystone.","replies":[{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2018-02-16T22:51:44.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that they didn't *choose* \"ward\". They *chose* \"Let's play wheel of fortune on every proc\". This isn't about direct power vs indirect power. I only mentioned direct power when talking about crit in that it is a singular function. Even the things in Inspiration you mention can be accounted for to a meaningful degree. \n\nIf my opponent has future market, I can expect them to have a gold advantage on recall even if we have the exact same farm and no kill participation. \n\nIf there's a keystone that says \"Hey, you get to have an extra ward out on the field\" I can account for that. \n\nThe problem with Klepto isn't that it's \"invisible power\" or indirect power. The problem is that it's spontaneous power, with no predictable pattern and that can be *very* polarizing early game. Maybe they'll get actual damage boost, maybe a free skill point, maybe a ward when they really need it, maybe it'll be useless all lane. I can never know what to expect from it in a game that already demands a lot of learned knowledge and information juggling/tracking. At no point am I arguing that every tree should have direct damage as the value. That would be terrible and defeat the point of separate trees to begin with.\n\nIf they plan to keep klepto as the concept it currently is, they need to retune it's early game impact and/or functionality in the same way that they need to retune \"I'm suddenly winning lane super hard because of a crit\" Tryndamere. I personally don't even have a problem with its state mid/late game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2018-02-16T18:55:35.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Klepto has extreme highs and lows that can't be played around.\n\nIt's been specifically nerfed to make the drops more regular and consistent.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-02-15T12:19:20.530+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's what I don't get: if the argument to stuff like Klepto or crit is that it generates no meaningful variance when averaged out over a long enough period of time, then the RNG powering it is pointless, because you could very well achieve the same results with some non-random system. If the counter-argument to that is that the randomness does, in fact, generate meaningful moment-to-moment variance, then that in itself disproves the initial argument that those RNG mechanics don't disrupt the game. You cannot have both. \n\nWhat has also bothered me significantly about Riot's recent stance on RNG is that it feels like it tunnel-visions on the pure statistical aspects of the mechanic, without taking into account player perception, which is the real issue. For sure, any RNG system can be made to average out over a long enough period of time, but raw power isn't the main reason why people dislike stuff like Kleptomancy or Spell Thief. Even if both were horribly underpowered, I could guarantee you that those systems would still be unpopular, because having a champion-to-champion interaction be colored by any kind of innate RNG _feels inherently unfair_. Players do not reason in terms of statistics over time, they perceive gameplay from moment to moment. Therefore, whenever there is a high moment generated by randomness (which is a low moment for the opponent), that _specific_ moment will always feel unfair. This is an instance where subjective player perception is more meaningful than pure statistics, and so I urge you to reconsider RNG mechanics with a focus on the former, rather than the latter.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2018-02-15T17:42:14.335+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Underrated comment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2018-02-15T18:05:31.848+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As always, well said man.\n\nYour insight on a discussion is always a welcome one as far as I'm concerned.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-02-15T18:29:31.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, and likewise!

Some games I'll say \"Yeah, this is definitely going better than if I took Press the Attack, Aery, Comet, Electrocute or even a fully stacked Dark Harvest right now.\", but the very next I could be thinking \"Jesus, I might as well have Predator if I want a gold income rune so I can use it to escape when I greed for this extra wave\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2018-02-14T22:27:15.945+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I still don't like plants...\n\nI mean, they're a very **VERY** minor nuisance, but just dislike them a lot compared to the Jungle Buffs we had in 2016.

It only did a tiny bit of bonus damage to a turret once, or stunned monsters.\nThere was no playing around Red or Blue smite buff - it just gave a burst of health and mana. (The former has been added to all large monster smites)\nThere was no playing around Wolf smite buff - It was done and then basically ignored. Plus it was the most useless buff ever, because you'd have already cleared your entire blue side when you smited it.\nThere was no playing around Gromp smite buff - it was a fucking joke for damage, and there was no way to avoid it in the slightest.\nThe only interaction you ever had with Raptor smite buff was putting a ward on it to waste their buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2018-02-15T02:18:26.060+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I **DID** use them but whatever dude... if this is that important to you\nhttp://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/007/508/neildegrasse.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-03-01T21:58:24.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Triistana,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iYfKE9Hl,comment-id=000800000000,timestamp=2018-02-15T01:19:59.384+0000)\n>\n> Yeah I did...
