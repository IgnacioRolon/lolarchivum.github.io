Is there a common chat hack that people use to see their opponents team chat?\r\n\r\nIve had several incidents recently where the enemy team responds DIRECTLY to my teams chat in solo ranked.\r\n\r\nIm not looking for a link, just knowing that this is common thing. Ill probably NEVER use in game chat again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T15:21:22.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless it's in all chat, I haven't heard of anything like this happening.
