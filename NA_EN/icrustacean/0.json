Fortunately it has the ability to run league on near max settings at 60 fps.  I am curious to see if anyone else has the issue where the game crashes, the game recognizes it crashes, knocks me to the reconnect button. The reconnect button doesn't work.  I have to relog and then I am able to reconnect in 3 mins and 42 seconds. I reconnect and we win the game about 15 mins later, I have an even kda and a few assists.  I get 20 min Low priority after the game for multiple offenses of this small  issue, which is out of my control. The game is crashing!  I always come back within 5 minutes. Every time. \r\nAll I really want to know is if others are having this troubling issue as the afk's that reconnect quickly have dramatically increased over the past few patches, not to mention I haven't ever bug splat like this since S4/Pre-S5. \r\n(Wrote this complaint in 20 min low priority Q)\r\n\r\n\r\n-Just a Lonely Na Cardboard Player","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T23:59:43.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes a trend of disconnection to land in a low priority queue, a single game will not result in a penalty. Because disconnections negatively affect everyone in the match, regardless of intent, the system treats all disconnections equally. This is a key reason why penalties cannot be removed or modified in any way. \n\nBugsplats are often caused by driver or windows performance issues, and our [Bugsplat & Crash guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) goes over the most common solutions for them. \n\nLet me know if you continue to see issues after taking the steps in that guide.","replies":[{"poster":"iCrustacean","date":"2016-08-01T02:26:08.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I forgot to put in there that it happened  twice in one game and then another in the next resulting in the low priority Q.  I appreciate the quick response and I will definitely check out the guide. \nBy the way It is not always a bug splat sometimes It just kicks me out and tells me the game crashed and the reconnect does not work when I try from there, but does work when i relog and attempt from the relog screen.  \n\nLove the Game \nCardboard IV NA Player","replies":[]}]}]}
