I have gotten one warning (over 6 months ago), so the permanent ban was a surprise to me. My chat history might not be the cleanest, most friendly chatting, but I certainly do not believe it is overly inflammatory nor offensive to anyone (which I have been reported for). I do not think a permanent ban is the right call in this situation, especially with little offensive behavior in games 2 and 3. What are your thoughts, and will riot even consider changing my punishment? i admit that I did not display the best behavior according to the Summoner&#039;s Code, but everyone has a rough game sometimes and it is not easy to be positive at all times. I know that I will not get punished further if I am given a chance to recoup my account, and I rarely display such poor behavior in games, although sometimes I do feel negatively, I do not often take it to chat. I also believe that my behavior is not perfect, but it is certainly an area I can improve to become a better and more friendly player, which is a big reason why I think a permanent ban is an unfair first punishment in such a long time. I wish I can get my punishment reduced, so I can continue to play on my account and reform so my peers and I can have a higher quality game experience.\n Here are the chat logs:\nGame 1\nBest Taric: teamfight= peel jinx make sure she doesnt die\nBest Taric: they dont have frontline\nBest Taric: we have 3\nBest Taric: but they area ll diving so\nBest Taric: i will peel jinx\nBest Taric: you guys focus on engaging and i will ult you guys to start\nBest Taric: eve prob not going mid so\nBest Taric: i was 79 lp p1\nBest Taric: dodged and then lost one of those throw games\nBest Taric: bot was smashing so hard\nBest Taric: lol\nBest Taric: not much of a difference is there hec\nBest Taric: i got bodied\nBest Taric: lmao\nBest Taric: bodied\nBest Taric: just\nBest Taric: wait for my flash\nBest Taric: man not playing with d4s is so much better\nBest Taric: tabi is essential\nBest Taric: i think if i put a ward\nBest Taric: vayne cant thresh lantern\nBest Taric: hec come bot pls\nBest Taric: flank through tri\nBest Taric: and knock her away from lantern\nBest Taric: ignore pink\nBest Taric: youre fast af\nBest Taric: plus he is getting shyv he will push\nBest Taric: just\nBest Taric: come to drag\nBest Taric: pls\nBest Taric: hec\nBest Taric: stop farming\nBest Taric: and gank\nBest Taric: ziggs was free af\nBest Taric: this hec playing so passive\nBest Taric: just gank the fk out of these fools\nBest Taric: we have heals they dont\nBest Taric: no ss bot\nBest Taric: holy shit man\nBest Taric: prob was\nBest Taric: bc you are a pussy on hecarim\nBest Taric: 0 map pressure\nBest Taric: why even take ghost when u never gank\nBest Taric: just take tp and farm\nBest Taric: irelia getting pushed in hec 0 ganks\nBest Taric: outganked and outfarmed by eve\nBest Taric: a jg that cant farm fast\nBest Taric: just wait for them to push\nBest Taric: good 1\nBest Taric: freeze at inner\nBest Taric: no\nBest Taric: r takes 2.5 sec to activate\nBest Taric: if i click r i die\nBest Taric: f vayne ult graves\nBest Taric: thats more worth than you dying for free for 1 kill hec\nBest Taric: ??

My goals of making diamond this season will most likely not be met, but there is always a next time. This permanent ban is definitely inconvenient for me and I believe it is a way to make me reform, but certainly I would like to fight for my account (as would anyone). On my new alt I will most definitely have rough games here and there, and my chat may not be perfect, but if I think more about other people and how they might be struggling and how my frustration should be aimed more towards myself, I can look to reform and play with better behavior.\n\nTo all readers, thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-10-06T13:51:39.763+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are incredibly rude and consistently making disparaging remarks.\nYes, you deserved it.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundCreator","date":"2016-10-06T20:17:09.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-10-06T20:17:56.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnboundCreator,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JuQn5huw,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-10-06T20:17:09.881+0000)\n>\n> you deserve to be banned for being a retard lul\n\n?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-06T16:04:24.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your last punishment wasn't a 14 day suspension I would suggest submitting a support ticket, it may have either erroneously skipped you tiers or failed to give logs that properly outlined why you were skipped tiers.
