I have spent quite a bit of money on this account only to be banned permanently because someone cant take shit over the internet.  How about you stop teaching your players its ok to get someone perma banned for no reason.  I didnt hurt anyones feelings if you look at the chat history you can see they were worse talking to me than i was the entire game.  How about you review the game before you just throw out perma bans.  I can not believe how ridiculous the system has gotten ive been playing for only 3-4 years and was never banned or chat restricted then all of a sudden within a month of playing i get a god damn perma ban.  You are a sad company riot.  I wont shit talk anymore if i can get a repeal, i troll but i dont cause losses.  The game i was banned for i was playing kench i easily could have been an actual dick and trolled but i didnt i tried.  I want a repeal only for the reason i have spent money on this account and this account only and i have had it for 4 years without ever being banned.  I come back and get reported once after a month of not being able to play and get insta perma banned.  I want someone from RIOT to respond to this as every other time i never actually got support on issues from the team itself and this is a more serious topic of me losing a lot of money because someone thinks its funny to tell both teams to report someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-15T19:21:37.232+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do not get punished based on the number of reports received, but on the behavior the review finds. If you do nothing wrong then all their reports will mean nothing and they will lose weight in their future reports.\n\nA permaban is the 4th and final step of escalating punishments. To receive one, your behavior must be either severe (such as using hate speech or telling people to kill themselves) to skip punishment tiers, or be consistently negative across many games and moving up each step of punishment one at a time.\n\nIf you want to discuss the validity of your punishment or are seeking tips on reforming your behavior, I suggest posting your reform card with the chat logs you should've received if this was from the Instant Feedback System for chat offenses. If you only wish to appeal your ban through Riot or you didn't receive any reason for your ban, you will need to submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-09-15T19:26:00.811+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity how many different resposes do you have stocked up in a text document?

That is such a flawed logic, this whole topic is giving me a headache. A lot of what you wrote is just like a child throwing a tantrum when they arent given what they want.\n\nThe fact of the matter is you broke the rules (numerous times) this wasnt an insta-permaban. Stop saying it is because thats not how this works. Let alone the fact that just because they give you one chatlogs doesnt mean its the only evidence against you. If you want more reported incidents by all means contact support. You had numerous chances to change, and yet didnt do anything till you actually lost something. By all means make a new account and show that way that you changed for the better. It wont get your account (at least not any time soon) but you can atleast prove you are true to your word.","replies":[{"poster":"Barad Dur","date":"2016-09-15T20:35:36.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do, maybe they will look at my behavior on my other account in month or two and reconsider my plea.","replies":[{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2016-09-15T20:38:46.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Barad Dur,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3WGc5REL,comment-id=00030000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-15T20:35:36.746+0000)\n>\n> Will do, maybe they will look at my behavior on my other account in month or two and reconsider my plea.\n\nDoubt it, they don't revok perma bans.
