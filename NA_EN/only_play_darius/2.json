She is in a fine spot now, even if that spot is a pseudo-tank knockup bot since they nerfed her damage to the point that there is almost no reason to build offense on her. But it&#039;s alright, each time they nerfed her damage, they buffed her mobility and knockup to solidify her as just an annoying one-trick pony of an AOE knockup, but I digress.\n\nRek&#039;Sai was designed as a carry jungler, notice that she is labeled strictly as a fighter, not fighter/tank, yet people often build pure tank on her. As much as I would like to see her rip apart teams like she did on release, it seems clear that Riot isn&#039;t going to be buffing her damage anytime soon. However, Rek&#039;Sai is in a fine spot balance wise, and I don&#039;t think she needs any changes whatsoever. If they are nerfing her base health because of all the people building {{item:3717}} + straight tank on her during MSI, then this change is unnecessary because cinderhulk just got nerfed. If they were to nerf her base health but buff her AD scalings, then it would be reasonable because they would be allowing for an alternative assassin-type playstyle and build path, but that is clearly not the case.\n\nI just don&#039;t see any reason to give her yet another nerf. She seems to be getting nerfed every other patch and some context for this particularly heavy nerf would be well appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-05-15T13:56:34.702+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really miss damage {{champion:421}}...I'd rather Rek'Face than Tank'Sai any day.","replies":[{"poster":"doubleguac","date":"2015-05-15T18:15:15.405+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot kind of painted themselves into a corner with her kit.

She was insanely hard to ward against, which made it extremely difficult for teams to predict where she would be. So Riot had to gut her damage.\n\nThe problem is...

She's popular because she has such a unique kit that gives utility to the team and decent-ish damage. She was created to be a bruiser with a Devourer Enchant, a Hydra, and then tanky items. She was meant to be a BRUISER, but her ratios outside of her E are so garbage that building anymore than a Hydra isn't noticeable enough. \n\nHer Q only gives a max of 60% of her bonus AD. Her W only does 40% of her bonus AD, and her E is not only on a long CD, but its damage is based upon its level and how much fury you have. At max, it does 120% to 240% of total AD as True Damage. When you roll a lot of AD, it can HURT. Like, you can make it do Cho'Gath Feast damage, but unlike Cho she needs about 300 bonus AD to do about 900 damage while cho only needs a RoA and a Rabadons. See the issue though? That's a tanky AP item that gives Cho 650 health on top of Cho's R's health while Rek would need Hydra, BT, and another AD item to get the 300 bonus, so even her E can't do much.\n\nHer BIGGEST offender is how her burst is set up... it involves using her E at the most fury possible and nothing actually increases her fury generation. She doesn't have the boost to generation against Champions like Ren, but she also doesn't consume Fury when she uses her E. One of the biggest fixes I could say is make her E consume fury and boost her amount of fury generated so she can actually be able to get off that E. It would also give her a choice when jungling early on. You'd either use it to heal or use it to clear.\n\nCurrently, she gains 5 fury for AA's, 15 bonus on the first AA or ability after unborrowed, and 10 for hitting with abilities while unborrowed. When she unborrows, that's 25 (the bonus also applies to abilities), then 5 from the AA, for 30, then she'd get off her Q's to total 30 more since her Q makes her AA's give 10 instead of 5, plus 2.5 for every target hit beyond the first, which isn't much. This means with a full combo, she'd have 60. If she manages to land on 2 targets with full Q's, that'd be 70 fury. 3 targets for 80, 4 targets for 90. To get full fury to press E, she has to hit ALL 5 ENEMIES during a full combo, which is incredibly uncommon. She has no way of increasing this either. \n\nIf she gained even just 5 more fury against champions, she'd be worth playing as AD again with her bases sucking since you'd be able to get off that scary E. You're already restrained by having to attack 4 times, though it's as fast as 3 since her Q is an AA reset thank god. It would also justify the constant nerfs to her tankiness since she wouldn't have to go pure tank just to be relevant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kariu Rena","date":"2015-05-15T05:26:41.127+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you know that reksai has a passive","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-05-15T05:07:28.076+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Riot is sexist.

In Solo Q she has a winrate of 50.60% while Nunu has a 55.92% win and Sej has a 56.72% and even \nAmumu has a 55.32% winrate. So if I look at the stats alone there many junglers are doing so much then she is.  Oh to make you guys happy Nid has a 48.91% winrate :)","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-05-15T21:31:39.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's only thanks to those 52%+ tank junglers Nidalee has low winrate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-05-15T16:18:53.993+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Posts like these are why I can't take Reksai nerf QQ seriously - you spew lies about how she's a weak champ when she's picked reliably in competitive play.  \n\nHonestly, I think it's just that solo queue doesn't make good enough use of her ult, but instead those players look at damage potential to declare her weak.  She SHOULD have low damage, given the fact she has a global ult and a ton of mobility (added that last point to preempt any 'bbbut Pantheon' arguments).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-05-15T16:17:31.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I only just started playing as Rek'sai and i think she probably deserves the nerfs. She has crazy mobility, dueling capabilities, ganking presence, map pressure, and tankiness at pretty much every level of the game.

She is designed as a carry jungler, but with her ratios being nerfed and her knockup/mobility being buffed, people have found that it is just best to build straight tank and use her as a knockup bot. I wish damage Rek'Sai could be viable, the way she is being played/built right now, the only thing that differentiates her from other tank junglers is her map presence.","replies":[]}]}]}
