His new passive is essentially a passive for the enemy team, and his DPS outside of the crystals is much lower. His new E is great though, he can actually gank pre-6 solid now.\r\n\r\nAnd why does no one build {{item:3057}} on him anymore?","replies":[{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2015-08-22T18:58:46.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the lategame he has a 700 health shield on a 5 seconds cooldown.
