I believe that making it possible to buy skins with IP would be an awesome idea, but it would be an outrageous amount, like 100,000 IP for a normal skin. Legacy and Ultimate skins should be a lot more than that too, to keep it balanced. I know a lot of people that look at all of their IP and have no idea what to do with it, so I think this would be a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2014-07-25T18:41:27.167+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, no. I don't see this being that good of a thing. I most certainly understand the uselessness of IP once you've unlock literally everything, but skins are probably Riot's main income-maker. I think A few more Free skins for join in in social media would be nice, and I'd love to see IP unlockable skins, but not the skins that are currently RP unlockable.\n\nI think something like what Smite does would work better. Meet certain requirements with (insert champion here) and you unlock the ability to spend IP to unlock the \"Look, I'm good at this Champion\" skin","replies":[{"poster":"Resizt","date":"2014-07-27T00:14:56.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like get 5 or 10 pentas with this champ and you can buy this exclusive skin for like 7800 IP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-07-25T17:51:31.779+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said they know we need something else to spend IP on, but this was months ago, so who knows if they're actually doing anything about it hehe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhyto","date":"2014-07-25T17:05:39.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, while it sounds ridiculous it'll certainly have players playing this game 24/7 but you also have to watch for the veterans, maybe a special limited time event would be plausible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InvalidGuest","date":"2014-07-25T17:04:09.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":" I don't think they would comply to that bc long time players who have tons of IP stocked up wouldnt really buy that much RP anymore and honestly they would make less money and who at riot wants that","replies":[]},{"poster":"yo mom is ugly","date":"2014-07-25T13:55:29.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think its a good idea but they should do that to certain skins","replies":[]},{"poster":"thatgirlsarah","date":"2014-07-25T08:30:21.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

I'd say about 8k-12k would be more realistic, and only on a few select skins, such as their 390 RP and maybe a few 520 RP skins for a few select champions. RP purchases I'd assume is Riots main income, so they wouldnt want you to be able to buy any skin you want for IP, and it'd be much easier to go find a neighbor who needs a favor and have them pay you $10 than to play long enough to aquire 100k IP. 100k is a rather insane number.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MyAccountYouGuys","date":"2014-07-25T10:15:52.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Good idea on paper, but let me ask you this-how many players out there, right now, have accrued anywhere near 100k without dropping at least 1/5 of that number in the form of RP to buy the boosts that make getting that amount feasible within what amounts to literal *months* of non-stop play? And even then, those people have probably done so over months/years, and spent the IP along the way to buy champs/runes/pages. You literally would never be able to save up the IP for even a 520 RP skin without buying boosts, by your scale. So at the end of they day, you'd be better off just buying skins...like Riot intended you to. I'm probably not going to spend money on the game, at least not in the forseeable future, but I know this idea won't work.\n\nBesides, how do you define all the champs/runes/rune pages you need? Go try something new, something fresh and creative. Experiment! Who knows, maybe you'll make the next meta.","replies":[{"poster":"BillDance","date":"2014-07-25T10:25:27.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this guy doesn't get it.. this is not for people that have played for free.. this is for people who paid a lot to get full gaming potential.. now they want to get a few skins for free with all that extra IP...

So what's the point of using IP? What difference does it make? They are meaningless numbers to you if you've got all the runes you want, so why be worried about IP in the first place? \nIP is a constraint, a limit for people who don't buy RP. I hope you realized this. By not buying RP for either straight unlocks or IP boosts, free players are limited in their choices as to what champions they can bring into ranked, what runes they have set up and how many options of runes they have available at any given time. You'd have to play twice to three times as much to get all the same things you've payed money to get access to earlier. \nSo what, you're arguing you don't have enough things to spend money, real money or fake money, on? You skipped the grind and now don't like it.

(I have played over 3000 normal games and a whole lot of rankeds and earned around 500k IP since I have started to play) I have 10 rune pages and almost all the top tier runes. It's been a long time since I have spent IP on something that I really wanted. For exemple, I had enough IP to buy 2 summoner name changes (13 900 IP each). And I'm not even among the top 25 000 players who have played to most.\n\nYou can also see a lot of streamers who have played a lot and unlocked pretty much everything that is affordable through IP and that are now stacking them to amounts as high as 60k IP. \n\nSo yeah, I think the idea is good, but maybe the approximated number is too high. Something around 20k to 30k IP for a normal skin would not hurt riot's RP sales, I think, while it would make some veterant players like me much happy to really get something off of their IP.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BillDance","date":"2014-07-25T10:23:09.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.. i've spent like 800 bucks on this game.. now i'm just obtaining ip and nothing to do with it.. a skin for a very high IP price seems fair","replies":[]}]}
