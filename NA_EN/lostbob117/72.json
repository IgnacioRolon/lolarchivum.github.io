AD so he's not too much like Anivia, and 400range so he doesn't go bot lane ADC. He'd be more of an Mid Laner or Top Laner. I'd say mid due to no mobility in his kit. It actually does the opposite of that.. You'll see. c:\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n**Passive - Ice Dragon territory**\r\nTurrets near Frosthaven shot's now slow the enemy.\r\n\r\n**Q - Ice Tornado**\r\nFrosthaven spawns a Tornado that pulls anyone in a 150radius of it and deals damage. If Frosthaven spawns the tornado directly on top of an enemy unit it will stun them and deals bonus damage. (100radius).\r\n\r\n**W - Dragon's Frozen Breath**\r\nFrosthaven shoots his minty ice breath in a straight line dealing damage to any enemy it hits. Any allies it hits gains resistance to slows. (Like how Swiftness boots work)\r\n\r\n*Passive*\r\nWhen Frosthaven is slowed, he gains bonus damage.\r\n\r\n**E - GET AWAY**\r\nFrosthaven yells \"GET AWAY FROM ME\" and spins Pushing back (So he doesn't work with Yasuo's ult) and dealing damage those he hits. If an enemy hits a wall while flying back he gets knock up for .5 seconds.\r\n\r\n**R - Ice Dragon's Domain**\r\nFrosthaven creates the entire map his domain for a duration, he slows every single unit on the field by about 15/20/25MS(Including him and his teammates) and gains vision over walls and in bushes if his vision can reach. His vision is also increased a bit.\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n**Discussion**\r\nI think he'd be best mid lane due to Mid Lane having slows and it's a shorter lane since he is immobile\r\n\r\nAlso he'd work best with teams that can afford MS lost.\r\n\r\nThoughts? :^)","replies":[]}
