LAST tree (resolve) mostly used by tanks or tanky sups.\n2. Mercs not effective? ok, Irelia needs time to do AAs her biggest dmg are her AAs, Mercs give 30% tenacity. So her 2 sec stun is only 1.333 sec long, with a 2.0 AS thats reduced to only 2 AAs from 4!!!\n3. \"Armor is bad against Irelia\" .......... Ok you have officaly no clue what you are talking about.... Her AAs are physical, her ult is physical, fevor of battle is physical. Dont believe me? Here:  http://champion.gg/champion/Irelia\n68% Physical dmg ... NoNoNo dont buy armor vs irelia, its useless...\n\nChampions that reduce AS: Malp, Nasus, Nunu, Fiora, Anivia. Or pick exhaust. But is was talking about Frozenheart and Randuins..... which can be bought, so no special champ needed.\n\nYou can still: knock up, knock back, surpress her without any reductions. And for your information, having 40% tenacity only means that any other cc is ONLY REDUCED, NOT NEGATED!!! you can still cc her. (unlike olaf for example)\n\n... I compared Irelias E and TFs W because THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME!!!!!! PointnClick Stun for 2 sec!!!!\nIm not comparing Nunu Q with Darius R or something. Im comparing Lux Q with Morgana Q... \nAnd the result is that TFs is milliontimes better then Irelias: RANGED, 6 SEC CD, NO CONDITION!!!\nBut absolutly nobody cares about that...\n\nIrelia cant dash to YOU 3 times, only to low hp minions NEAR YOU. And think about that: if her E had 600 range, then she doesnt need to be carefull not to dmg you, so she can stun you. She can just EQ to you.\nThe reason its condition AND range are low is, that she cant just Q to your ass AND stun you. She needs to comeclose to you WITHOUT Q to you.\n\nNobody is forced to buy QSS vs irelia, but as an Adc, a QSS can safe your ass and you do 0 dmg if your dead, so making a little less dmg, but staying alive to so some dmg is a good tradeoff, dont you think?\nOr you use your brain and dont misposition yourself so that irelia may not be in Flash+E range...\n\nIrelia dumps on 90% of top laners? \nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Irelia\nshe has <50% winrate at 14 out off 44 matchups(>25%). And \"dumping on s.o.\" is in my eyes a winrate ATLEAST above 52%(my personal rate would be at 54%+) which is the case in 20 matchups(<50% of all matchups) \nSo how does she \"dump\" 90% of all toplaners? And btw. winrate doesnt say too much about laningphase. Irelia loses 90% of every early laningphase, getting even earliest at lev 5, normaly at lev 7-11.\n\nYasou and Renekton normaly crush irelia in laningphase, and riven is a pure skill matchup, but irelia has a winrate above 52% against all.\nA good Ryze,Kayle,graves, olaf and tahm kench would destroy her too. But this is only looking at 1v1s and between lev 1-13. every gank could possibly destroy this balance tho.\n\nIrelia is not hard to play, but you need to know your and your enemys windows to be successfull with her.\nSo you need the same or higher skill level to beat an irelia. \n\nBanrate say nothing about a champ, only that alot dont want to face this champion, it does not imply that this champ is op by anymeans. But often it indicates that this champ could be Op or no counters to this champ. \n\nIf you dont believe me(and are on euw) we can do a 1v1 and i pick ryze(Irelia has a 64% winratio vs ryze, so i should not have a single bit of chance to win(and i only tested ryze once or twice in a custom game, so im not even a good ryze player)).","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-07-31T18:31:37.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know a guy who reached master tier out of nowhere because irelia got overbuffed.

He has also manarefund, poke, aoe slow, As steroid and an onhit dmg. Basicly hes a better global, burst irelia, without truedmg or sustain. Both abilites are theire only CC, TFs has range, lower cd, and no Condition. Heres your \"full\" comparasion.... Are you, dia 3 dude, able to see it? \nYour mentioned \"other data\" is something like TFs W range and that it has no condition etc. . I already disproved your claims about her winrate, and even explained it.\n\n Oh, so you, as an Irelia main, with, wait..., 6 games in the last 3 seasons, are a total expert about Irelia and her matchups, saying anyone lossing vs riven or yasou is a boosted animal? \nRanged champs who dont build/have sustain or hp/armor are bad against irelia.\nand what about Ryze? irelia has 64% winratio against him! so acording to your assumtion its pretty clear that you would not win vs her. But i think ryze beats irelia.\n\nFor you, the almight dia 3 guy, Let me exclusivly for you, break down the t3f changes:\nt3f lost 20% crit, gained 25% AS and 10% cdr.\nthe cdr is nice, always good to have, but not essensial on irelia/could get it from other items if needed.\n\nNow the interesting part:\n 25%AS are ~0.15 AS which means if irelia did 4 AAs, she now does 5 in the same timeframe.\nlets say she has 1.0 AS with old t3f, her w lasts 6 sec. old Irelia does 6 AAs, new Irelia does 7,5(but this gets down to 7 because we dont have 0.5 AAs) So we only gained 1 AA and 1 onhit.\nBUT old t3f has 20% crit and with 6 AAs there is statisticly 1 crit 100%, a crit is basicly a 2nd AA. So we only \"gained\" 1 onhit. But the old t3f could crit 2 or even times in this timeframe.\nRemember This is the IDEAL scenario for the truedmg onhit, she actives her w the milisecond the AA hits, and the enemy doesnt moveaway. Every other(real) scenario favors the old t3f MORE.\n\nSo: New t3f is a little better at long trades(6sec+), old was better at bursting, building more crit and if you were lucky even at long trades too.\nAnd now to the late game where you want to burst the enemy adc maybe:\nyou flash e, target is stunned for 2 sec. With 2.0 AS you do 4 AAs in these 2 sec. But if they have mercs, the stun lasts only for 1.333 so we can only do 2 AAs (after E theres a time before you can AA again.) So new t3f dont help you with the 2.15 As, but the old could crit and thus help you to burst them down.\n\nAs you see old t3f is way better then you thought, and the new t3f is even a NERF in short trades/bursts. \n\nNow to my rank: I personly hate to play ranks, i love to theorycraft stuff and test it in normals. BUT you should look a little closer at my stats: I have only played morg as i find i easier to carry my games with her then with irelia, And I have Master stats with her. \nYou, on the other side, have at your most played champs 7+ deaths. Which is ~Silver/gold level.\nI was ranked plat5 this season, droped to gold1 because i forgot to play, and climbed back up to plat3 with less then 30 wins..... Im not saying that im good or even the best, but I am certain that i would not lose to someone like you in a 1v1.\nOn a side note, ranks dont matter at all this season, way to much boosted guys everywhere, no real standings, Maybe beeing dia 1- master is still top tier. every other rank is ~ 2ranks or a hole division lower.

Sec dont write \"lol\" after every 2nd sentence.\n\nOk you want my advise on Adc vs Irelia?\n1. Dont be so stupid that she is in range for a flash+E, if she can do it, its YOUR mistake for bad positioning.\n2. No, as an adc a QSS is all you need. She cant 2 sec stun you, and you can run away afterwards too.\nNo need for other items, BUT you can buy Mercs and elixier if needed too.....\n3. Armor is not vialbe for adcs right now, But you possible can get Gauntlet on some, or a GA, or Ninja. But remeber everyone has ~70 Armor late game, just from levels, this is enough to reduce her most dmg by 40%.\n\nArmor doesnt help? https://champion.gg/champion/Irelia\nLook at the dmg distribution. 68% Physical dmg... Armor DOES help alot vs irelia.\nBut we need to consider that its Irelias Job to kill Squhsy backliners.... \nand remember you are not alone on bot, get an ali or a janna and laugh at irelia because she cant come near you. or tahm or 2 dozend others.\n\nOk lets talk about her kit: \n\nHer Q has bad scaling and low base dmg, veryhigh cd early, very short cd late, she still loses mana if she uses her Q to last hit, she cant get more mana back.\n\nHer W has NO scaling(not like olafs, fioras etc.) and a flat heal, which i consider only as a sustain and not a real heal, because she needs to constistently AA something to get hp back. And no, her heal does not depend on sheen or Q its a flat amount. It has a 15 Sec cd with an uptime of 6 sec, not reducing at higher ranks. Her flat true dmg is also AA dependend, so Irelia no AAs= irelia No dmg. And you some time for a decent amount of AAs, she cant just 100-0 you, execpt if you misposition or fed her badly, but everyone is strong if fed. And she cant proc T3f 10 times or so T3f has a 1,5 sec cd and her ult last 10 sec so she can only do 6 max. and then the timeframe would be really bad. Even an unmounted Kled could run away in that timeframe.\n\nHer E is a 2 sec stun 8 sec cd, 260 dmg, you must have higher or equal %hp then irelia to stun you, its point and click, but only melee. Looks strong, but as i said can be reduced/removed easly. \nIm comparing Tfs W with Irelias E BECAUSE THEY DO EXACTLY THE SAME!! Point n Click Stun for 2 sec, but TFS is ranged, has a 6 sec cd and NO condition. But absolutly NOBODY complains about that. I have seens more rants about Irelias E then about DQ, while beeing easly avoidable and theres a more broken version there too.\nI dont compare Morganas Q with darius R or something stupid.....\nIm not comparing their hole kits. Its like comparing Lux Q with morgana Q....\n\noh those mages can 100-0 irelia from range/poke alone. BECAUSE SHE HAS NON! \n\nTo your information, Im a theory crafter, I analyse every possible situation and try to find hidden strenghts and weaknesses. I dont lie, you only dont see whats ether CLEARLY visable or simple dont think of every scenario...\n\nIrelia has close to no Utility or \"bad\" Utility(sustain/flat nonscaling truedmg on AAs, and conditional melee stun, dash only to enemys) Lets change her dash so she can dash to allies or wards and bamn she is now safe an can escape anytime, THIS would be bad/ unheatly. But her entiry kit has so many resitictions that she simply cant abuse stuff.\n\nIrelia is the balanced champ in this game! She is designed to kill Squishys, but can be killed after that easly(not like a zed who resets back over half the map). If you cant she her weaknesses then be it. Im not expecting everyone to see clear, easy to spot, since 4 years well known weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"Lewd KaiË‡Sa","date":"2016-08-08T18:50:12.697+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol your a terrible theory crafter then. like i have pointed out multiple times all your answers to \"counter\" her abilites are terrible counters \"dont stand in a flash q range\" ok so adc are just not allowed to be in fights is what your saying cus her flash q+e range is longer than any adc auto range in the game gj. o you can remove her stun or reduce it easily just buy qss sooo by that logic we can put a 5min stun in the game cus you can just buy a qss and you cant just run away after qss cus literally every adc in the game has lower movement speed then her and then once you factor in tf movement speed and phage proc yea gl running away. you can 100% proc tf 10 times use your abilites before your ult then ult then your abilites will be off cd and use them again wow hard concept much wow. also literalyl 1 adc can buy gauntlet that is ez plus ga/ninja are terrible on adc since they offer 0 hp and low hp pools so that armor is useless.she has one of the higehst win rates in lcs atm so unless your saying the best players in the world are to dumb to see her counters then she is objectively to strong atm","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2016-08-09T12:19:30.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":".......

If not heres more:\nYes I agree that she is strong, but not even close to Op or bannworthy... Why?\nHmmm... Are Vayne, Jax, Azir, Nasus OP just because they destroy anyone in lategame?\nWhats with Panth, Rene, LB, Jhin in the early game?\nWhats with Zed, Voli, Trundle, Akali in the mid game? Are they OP just because they are stronger then anyone at that time?\nNo. \nBUT IRELIA, WITH HER SUPER WEAK EARLY AND HER CLOSE TO NONEXISTANT LATEGAME IS SUPER OP!!! WHILE SHE EVEN HAS 1000000000000 million resisctions in her kit itself!!! \nHer ONLY strength is beeing very good in the mid game and ONLY 1v1s!!! Whilie beeing single target and enemy only \"engage\", no free mobility, no steroids, no scalings, No CC or CC chains, with even conditions there and beeing removeable.\nThink about her E beeing a 2 sec targeted Knockup or surpress, think about it having NO extra conditions! THEN we have a champ/Kit that is strong,( to Strong in my eyes) not only in mid game.\nThink about her truedmg had scalings, or she would have %ls instead of just some small flat numbers... think about her dash beeing able to jump to friendlys or wards! like jax. An bamn she can be safe in lane, and doesnt need to hug a tower because shes cant escape. Those changes would make her Op! But not the state shes in right now xD\n\nBut NONONO Shes WAY to powerfull......\nIf you still think shes op after i told you this, then you are the reason why nobody on boards should ever be handling

some one who has been a top theory crafted you in 2 big mmo it s a joke that you actually consider yourself a theory crafter. \nif she flashes q she can stun you there is no rule in the ability saying \"if you flashed in the last 10s this ability cant stun\" you are literally just assuming that the adc is at 100% and near literally 0 other targets which is probably going to rarely ever happen. if they are in lane they will be most likely near a minnion in the jg their are camps and if they are in the river this is a chance for scuttle crab to be there plus if they are in river plus adc and sups should be together most the time so you can easily jsut flash q to the sup e the adc. or just maybe the adc isnt at 100% hp and you can flash q e them anyways.\n\nqss CANT save you against ire like i have pointed out multiple times almost every adc in the game has a lower movement speed than ire and that 50% movement speed is for 1 second and you dont get it until you finish scimitar which is an expensive item that isnt gold effective. also most adc their dashes/self peel are on an extreme delay or extremely ineffective against people on top of them so in the mid game an ire will kill them before they can qss the stun and get their self peel off.\n\nyes ire mostly relies on base dmg but she has high base dmg and tf. you are correct about ire falling off late game which is what kept her balance in season 5 however season 6 the average game length is down about 7mins in every elo because this season is all about the mid game. between towers being weaker tower first blood and element dragons 15-25ish mins is the most important part of the game and has been all season which is why ire has got way stronger this season. your wrong about her dmg mid game she 100% has insane amount of burst with tf she can 2 tf proc on a carry in 1.5s with high base dmg taht will burst any carry in the late game.\n\npointing out a champion can buy a useless item for them is pointless point and is just wasting breath an adc can buy zho but an adc would never by zho since they are sustain dmg dealers not burst dmg dealers like mages so being in stasis for 2.5s as a carry basically means you just lost your team the team fight andyou will die as soon as it comes otu not to mention it is a 2900gold item that gives you 0 effective stats as an adc. you telling me an adc can build zho is like me telling you o well ire can build 5 dmg items and still burst late. ok yes you CAN do that but no it would always be a bad idea.\n\nsooo you looked up 1 region and found she was doing poorly in gj. to bad you look up http://lol.gamepedia.com/2016_EU_LCS/Summer_Split/Champions_Statistics \no look at that 63% win rate look up lck and she has a 55 % win rate last time i looked and in the lpl she has 100% win rate so this again proves that you are not looking for the truth but cherry picked stats to or trying to list very specific isolated instants to justify her not being a problem champion because you like her. so yes she is over preforming in 3 of the 4 major regions justifying a nerf lol.\n\nwhy would i ban late game champions in an mid game meta that just doesnt make sense. lol on top of that 3/4 of the champions you just named have low play rates and low win rates azir has the lowest win rate in the game with a 2% play rate meanwhile ire after several nerfs is still at a 52% win rate and 8% play rate that is ban worthy lol. champions being played a decent amount should bring their win rate down but yet ire still has good win rate so yes she is ban worthy.\n\nlol ire early game is not super weak she isnt panth strong but she it isnt super weak. you know what champions have super weak early games akali vayne lol those are weak early games. and her \"early\" game doesnt even last that long as soon as you buy a sheen you get a power spike.\n\nlol she isnt only good in the mid game she has a pretty good laning phase an early power spike and she is good in mid game in both team fighting and split pushing she takes tower fast with tf and in team fights she is super distributive to the back line in team fights while being able to burst the adc in the mid game faster and more reliably than some burst mages.\n\nim not the reason the boards shouldnt be part of balancing you are she had a 20% play rate with a 54% win rate for the longest time and you trying justifying her being balanced with cherry picked facts. even after multiple nerfs she is at a 52% win rate with almost 10% play rate. lol you can sit their and try to deny reality all you want but riot clear see her as a problem which is why they have nerfed her multiple times and put her on the list to rework. so go head keep  wasting your breathe arguing something you wrong

I mean the design is intentional if you do an item that has ad crit and attack speed all in one package then first you will get less of all 3 but second more importantly the entire adc itemization would have to completely change all over again.  And i think it's clear a choice was made for game pace reasons and class reasons to keep adcs from spiking really hard with only one full item.  Still you do get a pretty nice spoke from 1.5 items and I don't really see what's wrong with that. \n\nYou just want an ie that is better for no additional cost and I'm not sure why you think that's justified. It's not like there's anything wrong with adcs other than maybe caster ad itemization","replies":[{"poster":"lostbob117","date":"2016-07-31T18:52:22.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a lot wrong with ADCs, but you don't even play them often.
