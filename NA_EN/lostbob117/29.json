The last few months more than ever.\n\nADCs are almost useless now in lane, after the repetitive nerfing of whichever one is on top instead of buffing any of the lower ones. There's really nothing an adc can do other than last hit and build up gold. The support is the true carry of bot lane right now, any time your bot lane is getting kills and a lead and carrying a game it's because your support did really well (or your enemy support outright sucked). \n\nThe difference between games with a skilled support, a competent support, and a bad support, is immediately recognizable. Before the 3 minute mark I can usually tell you whether I'm going to be getting fed as the ADC, the lane is going to be stalemated, or I'm going to get hammered - even if no kills have happened yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Professor Ward","date":"2015-09-07T01:59:29.981+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"you my friend are completely wrong\nand i could write an essay on how youre wrong but meh","replies":[{"poster":"lostbob117","date":"2015-09-07T02:01:01.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Do it then","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"General Murica","date":"2015-09-07T02:40:08.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Explorer Ezreal,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BVZyBVP7,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-09-07T01:53:42.366+0000)\n>\n> They do a lot less work than everyone else.\n\nOh look, the guy with trannie hair stuck in low elo for years (even with smurf-duo's) talking\n\n(i agree if janna tho)","replies":[{"poster":"Nyannie","date":"2015-09-07T03:20:16.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=General Murica,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BVZyBVP7,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-09-07T02:40:08.834+0000)\n>\n> Oh look, the guy with trannie hair stuck in low elo for years (even with smurf-duo's) talking\n> \n> (i agree if janna tho)\n\nI GOT PLAT ZAVIRAAAAAAAAAAA","replies":[{"poster":"Enosetc","date":"2015-09-07T03:30:28.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nyannie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BVZyBVP7,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-09-07T03:20:16.028+0000)\n>\n> I GOT PLAT ZAVIRAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nstfu you played janna","replies":[{"poster":"General Murica","date":"2015-09-07T03:47:35.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Enosense,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BVZyBVP7,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2015-09-07T03:30:28.238+0000)\n>\n> stfu you played janna\n\nthat q nerf hurts badly for aggressive players tho ~~ 850 range on a SS=( No wonder her w/l dived.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"General Murica","date":"2015-09-07T03:44:22.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nyannie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BVZyBVP7,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-09-07T03:20:16.028+0000)\n>\n> I GOT PLAT ZAVIRAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n...LL?0o","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nyannie","date":"2015-09-07T02:01:32.016+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Anyone who bothers to post in this shit thread to disagree with it is just an upvote whore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdanChristo","date":"2015-09-07T03:59:36.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stay bronze","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-07T03:49:56.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Support should get less ranked rewards than everyone else \n\nhttp://images6.fanpop.com/image/answers/3050000/3050266_1350905561051.42res_300_168.jpg http://i.ytimg.com/vi/t8yWD07H1Iw/hqdefault.jpg http://www.dramafever.com/st/news/images/Title_24.jpg\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v339/horoshanokage/GIFs/twins-laugh.gif http://pa1.narvii.com/5790/989badfcb827b45fd36d0d1710c81b6c79f809ef_hq.gif http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111210761/4486094-3954496329-giphy.gif\n\n____________\n____________\n\nhttp://img.pandawhale.com/76314-anime-thumbs-up-gif-YNSf.gif\n\nGood Job OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RossMellow","date":"2015-09-07T03:48:01.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah And the top laners too! all they do is farm all game!","replies":[{"poster":"RossMellow","date":"2015-09-07T03:48:24.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the jungler for not ganking all game!","replies":[{"poster":"RossMellow","date":"2015-09-07T03:49:08.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget the ADC for never kiting! and the Mid laner for not snowballing like theyre supposed too!","replies":[{"poster":"RossMellow","date":"2015-09-07T03:49:48.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets increase the ranked rewards to challenger only!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-09-07T03:34:49.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure.
