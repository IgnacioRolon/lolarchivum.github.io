It is impossible with an ADC with\r\n\r\nBeserkers, IE, PD, LW, BT, and Some defensive item to kill them in 2seconds\r\n\r\nLW takes off at least 100armor from the tank leaving the tank at 300armor and 3000HP.\r\n\r\nThat tanks effective health is now about 13400\r\n\r\nThe ADC deals about 750 damage on autoattack if it crits. About 300 if it does not crit. If every auto crits onto that tank it'll take 18 autos to kill that tank for the ADC. Which is impossible EVEN if you have 2.5 attack speed to pull of in 2seconds. With botrk it may be about 17, 16, or 15 autos.\r\n\r\nStop pulling shit out of your pockets. This isn't even counting the mastery for 10% reduced damage on crits and ninja tabi.","replies":[]}
