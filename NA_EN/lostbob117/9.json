I unfortunately can't find the pictures I had shopped up for it, but basically these two things:\n\n1) Slightly increase the range of his W as he puts points into it\n2) Allow it to grant temporary vision of the target area and targets hit (1.5 to 3.5 seconds, scaling up)\n\nIt's a utility increase to him that makes sense thematically as he's an explorer and he can \"explore\" brush or over walls to see jungle camps while not bringing any actual damage power into the ability, and allow him to duel some of the champions that give him problems through his sight buff like Vayne, who is not only very strong right now but also hard for Ezreal to duel due to missing skills while she's stealthing with her ultimate.\n\nSlight utility for fighting and strong lane utility through checking brush for ganks or checking over walls for things like dragons or blue buffs, and all the while AP Ezreal is pretty much the same with a slight increase in W range as they level it up; perhaps take the AP ratio on it down very slightly to compensate for the increased safety.","replies":[{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-09-05T08:53:55.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think it makes sense to give him a True Sight ability. For one, it can pretty significantly hamper champions like Akali, since he can throw a W through her invis field. Plus, Ezreal can \"scout\" bushes by throwing a Q through them and it has 1) better range 2) shorter CD 3) less mana. Overall it doesn't do a lot of benefit his dueling; Ez already is not meant to duel - they took away his AS debuff and he doesn't build Crit so he is naturally not going to be as strong of a 1v1 AD Duelist.\n\nIn addition, having all Skill Shots already makes very temporary stealth like Vayne less of an issue than other Champs. An AA-based Champ can't do much damage to a stealthed target since they can't target them. But Ezreal's E will still \"lock on\" to invisible targets, and skill shot abilities let him try to hit them if he can predict their route. I've actually hit Vaynes, Khaz, Twitch etc quite easily even as they are stealthing if I can predict their direction of travel.\n\nOverall, it doesn't do much to benefit where he is lacking (late game damage scaling, lack of real mobility)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2015-09-07T21:44:44.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K3gV8Q71,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-09-04T02:50:50.931+0000)\n>\n> The intent with the E buff is to add some more power to Ezreal's kit in a way that encourages some risk taking to take full advantage of it (using E more offensively at times, rather than almost always sitting on it as an escape). \n> \n> That does still leave AD Ezreal's W feeling pretty underwhelming, our primary focus for 5.18 though is balance (Worlds patch), rather than addressing other issues like satisfaction.\n\nYou could bring back ezreal w heal and remove attackspeed buff\n\nHe already has passive for attackspeed steroid and Attackspeed doesnt really fit him \n\nNote you could shift into heal then","replies":[]},{"poster":"ofart","date":"2015-09-07T21:09:37.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K3gV8Q71,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-09-04T02:50:50.931+0000)\n>\n> The intent with the E buff is to add some more power to Ezreal's kit in a way that encourages some risk taking to take full advantage of it (using E more offensively at times, rather than almost always sitting on it as an escape). \n> \n> That does still leave AD Ezreal's W feeling pretty underwhelming, our primary focus for 5.18 though is balance (Worlds patch), rather than addressing other issues like satisfaction.\n\nIt's really hard to make use of the E buff because it's his escape and also doesn't prioritize champions.

Currently, in Plat+, Ezreal is at 47.9% in games that go 35+ minutes. That is surprisingly above Tristana (her late game isn't that good but it still felt better than Ezreal's) yet still in the very bottom of the pack. By comparison, Vayne is at 53.7% with the highest winrate of any ADC. It would probably be a lot higher if Vayne's pick-rate wasn't so obscene.\n\nI really hate Vayne. She actually just flat out says \"nope\" to many otherwise viable ADC picks. For example, I am probably ~35% when picking Ezreal into Vayne.  Worst of all, she's so easy to play. She has only 3 skills, no skillshots, her first item is sustain and every ability is chase/peel. Even if you're bad at Vayne, you will still be pretty useful. The same cannot be said of Ezreal, Draven etc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2015-09-04T04:16:51.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I somehow 1v1d a Vayne at 37 mins once, idk how but i did. \nAnyway you don't want Q critting.

It could just scale the damage with crit. chance a little bit. That way, Ezreal could still go traditional IE PD LW without losing his Q as a meaningful source of damage.
