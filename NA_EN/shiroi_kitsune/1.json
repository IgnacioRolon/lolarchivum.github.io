However, I've been playing mostly tank junglers who just want to hit late game so they can cc and wreck the enemy team {{champion:113}} {{champion:120}} .  I'm wanting to learn how to play more aggressive junglers who can do things such as early counter-jungling, and early ganks with a high rate of success, so I was wondering which champions you guys would suggest for that, and whether you had any general tips for playing aggressive junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T03:06:30.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"J4 would be my main suggestion, simple kit, very simple ganks, very effective ganks, lots of mobility by using EQ. This will be your best bet as he gets tanky mid to late game will feel closer to home later in the game. He is also as i said very simple, something highly underrated when learning a new style of play, simple lets you focus less on mechanics than on how you need to be changing things (IE ganks here vs ganks there, if i gank what will the enemy be able to take, is it worth it for this gank to lose objective x?) all things that as a farm heavy Jg you probably haven't had to ask yourself much if at all","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroi Kitsune","date":"2015-03-01T03:12:54.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the suggestion, I might pick him up once I farm a bit more IP.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T03:38:31.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rek'Sai is also good but alot more difficult, same with Lee Sin but I would really recommend not lee as he is simply too mechanically difficult to learn while learning how to play aggressive jungler","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-03-06T21:49:06.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick up Nunu.  Do not underestimate Nunu.  He's very easy to play, but his kit still has depth.  You will more easily control objectives, you will more easily counter jungle and he is a great counter to AD heavy teams due to his Ice Blast and Ultimate.  He's one of the few hard counters Kalista.  The new jungle item coming in next patch will give him a great buff and he isn't picked very often, so you don't have to contest him in pregame and a lot of people don't know his skillset and underestimate his strength.  \n\nVi is another good option, her kit is intuitive and rewarding to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2015-03-02T18:45:39.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jarvan's early has been gutted recently.
