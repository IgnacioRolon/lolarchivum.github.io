I don't know how you play, but I assume as a jungler you know how to control objectives, but you definitely want wards around dragon any time after it spawns. This is your responsibility not the supports, same with baron.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hdgv","date":"2015-03-28T17:59:14.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people that just playing as a jungle even your teammates help you to leash and getting to level 2, but still you die because of the wolf or others , which can slow you down from le leveling up most people jungle like to use{{item:3072}} and many more so lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-03-28T11:19:37.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Micro: Farming, vision control, and pathing\nMacro: Dragon, lane manipulation, and counter-jungling\n\nMost of these should be somewhat self-explanatory, but the macro may be harder.\n\nDragon: If you're on red, bring it out of the pit. - If you're on blue, ward in the jungle area at both crossroads closest to you - Don't try to steal when you're a lower level than the enemy jungler. - Always get it when the enemy has the least chance of contesting.\nLane Manipulation: Ganking key lanes that will carry for your team. - Knowing how to relieve pressure for a behind teammate. - Pushing the lane to buy time or hurt the enemy laner.\nCounter Jungling: Constantly be aware of the enemy jungler's position. - If he's ganking, try to steal a camp on the opposite side of the map. - Be aware of when and where they might gank your team, and be ready to counter-gank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCabes","date":"2015-03-28T06:23:29.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Communication with your laners can go a long way when setting up ganks whether it's just pings or chat comments. Also having an idea of which lane to gank first  before the game start and when to gank it based off of which champions are being played can help you have a better ealry game. Keeping tabs on the other jungler can also help your whole team. You can easily do this with a few deep wards or just placing wards near the lanes. Keeping tabs on the enemy jungler's position also makes counter-ganks and counter-jungling much easier. Recognizing when you can and when you can't take objectives and communicating that with your team is also important.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-28T00:25:52.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After level 6 focus less on farming your jungle and gank a lot more. 75% ganking, then farm a camp or two when your low and about to base","replies":[]}]}
