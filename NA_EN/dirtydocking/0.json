You can do the same if you're \"not trying\" but the risk is obviously higher.\n\nI argue first pick in shared drafts is too great of a reward for doing badly, and that it outweighs any benefit to doing well, at least for the first one or two drafts. Some item combinations are way stronger than others and getting first pick allows you faster access to these combinations which can easily put you at an advantage over the players at the alleged \"top\". This is bad game design. If you're going to give welfare to losers then the benefits should not outweigh the rewards for being good.

Completing items gets easier, and you have more options for truly optimal champs to put them on.  Of course, being placement 1 early does not guarantee a win... but should it, really?  The changes in health early are so slight each round that stacking to win them probably shouldn't matter more for increasing Elo than running a consistently good strategy, on average.  Not unlike a horse race:  it is hard to say definitively whether breaking early or late is better or worse, it depends on the horse, the track, the weather, etc..\n\nWhat seems to me asa more impactful factor, and a frustrating one because it involves very little skill (only in that you have to know which items to combine to what and who to put them on) is how many items the middle PVE rounds grant.\n\nTo be clear, I have won/highPlaced just as many games with 6 nobles (2 or 3 rank 3) as with swain/gnar/shyvanna/aurelion (2 or 3 rank 2); most of the nobles games were slow played (with lots of rerolls at the lower levels), most of the shape shifter games were win streaked (transitioning into that start with a lot of gold from something else and no rerolls).

Its just that the skill, in large part, *is* profitably interacting with the RNG, which is a very different skill than in LOL.  By waiting out levels, you can consistently get tier 3 level 1 champions by midgame.  By rushing levels, you can consistently get tier 2 level 4 champions by midgame.  Which is better changes depending on which champions you get, which items you get, likewise for your opponents, and likewise with regard to what your opponents *decide* based on what they get.  But, if you are constantly evaluating your opponents maps, this should inform your decision; likewise, just as in LOL, being aware of the meta is critical, and in the case of TFT, should help motivate your decisions to interact with the RNG.

Why?\n\nPlayers obviously do not like snowball meta in the prime League game, Summoner's Rift. Rift = Doing good early generally rewards you more all game, and locks in wins. There is no balanced comeback unless someone REALLY messes up after doing good.\n\nI've accepted that if I'm #1 for the first 11 rounds of TFT, I'm going to have a drawn out match where I finish #1 or #2 or #3, simply because I gave up all the Spatulas or people counterpicked my carousels..\n\nBut here's my general tip to beat the odds of either giving an early lead away, or losing early to win late:\n\n1. Lose Early has a steep problem: You have finite HP, and if it comes online too late, you're going to be playing random trading matches between someone who has 100 HP and someone who has 20. If your chance to beat them is 52% (slightly in your favor), you'll still lose, because they are in a better position.\n\n2. You can have a little of the best of both worlds, simply by monitoring how sharply you win duels by playing a winning strategy. Round 2-4 duel wins hard? Don't buy and upgrade any more than you have to. Get to 10+ gold, and sit on it. Whether you win in 7 seconds at 15 seconds doesn't matter. Doing this might also allow you to lose one match or two, and give you a better first Carousel.\n\nIf you passively do this all game, you generally can maintain an ~80+ HP position into late game, simply by buying only as much as necessary and then hoarding.\n\nIf on the other hand you fall to the compulsion to rush a level to get another pawn on the table, you may secure 100 HP, but end up having no compatible upgrades.\n\nIf on the other hand you spend your hoard on resets, you've often neither spent them on levels nor champions, so you suffer a deficit on both ends.\n\nI've maybe only won one game of TFT where I kept the initial lead per 8 games. I've won about 3 of 8 where I play #2 or #3. I've won maybe 1 in 8 where I played a loss strategy.

Every strategy has a caveat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shinta","date":"2019-07-12T15:19:16.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do agree i lose the early game everytime just to have first item picks,, \n\nunless i end up with a t3 or 3 t2 units before lvl 4 then i go tryhard","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazymandias","date":"2019-07-12T04:48:57.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot:\n\nDo Badly: \n\n* If you're not buying champs or extra slots, you also save up enough for interest gold faster.

Indeed:  skill in TFT is principally in a players profitable interaction with the RNG.  I actually made a whole post on this, if by chance you are interested, and likewise curious about the proper way to compare the mathematical aspects of the RNG interactions with LOL.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/teamfight-tactics/HYxMA7TI-thoughts-from-a-cut-rate-mathematician-and-an-even-worse-gamer\n\nI absolutely agree, though, that intermittent loss benefits should probably not *exceed* win benefits.  But, just as the game should not be a coin flip--there should be some material and rankable concept of skill in the game--it should also not be a max squat--interacting with the RNG is integral to the game, which necessitates that the superior/prudent strategy lose to the inferior/risky strategy a nontrivial number of times.  The post talks in detail about both aspects of randomness interactions.\n\nBy the way, since the last paragraph has references to other games, let me mention something about chess.  In chess, there is absolutely an innate randomness:  whether you or your opponent will recognize each other's strategies in time to counter.  I talk about this sort of thing in my post, but problems like this are actually not tractable mathematically--they turns on something that cannot be reliably regarded as an RNG.  This is what makes the game interesting.  The same is true in TFT, the point is though that the obvious and meaningful presence of an RNG requires that people who do not roll well initially be given the chance to continue rolling--for at least a while.  Nothing of the sort is necessary in proper chess, but only because there is no obvious or meaningful RNG presence.\n\nLastly, if you think about it for a moment, then we should be able to rank certain scenarios in the order of their likelihood for gaining rank/Elo--in other words, placing in the top 3 or 4.  The best possible case is:\n1. executing a strong early game strategy then transitioning into a strong late game strategy, with good rolls early, transitionally, and late.\n\nBut which of the following 4 sorts of strategies is next best, and how to rank the other 3, is a development choice that will change with the meta:\n2. executing a combination of strong early and moderate late game strategies, with good rolls\n3. executing a combination of moderate early and strong late game strategies, with good rolls\n4. executing a strong late strategy, with good rolls\n5. executing a strong early strategy, with good rolls\n\nThe central question is:  \"where in this list do the corresponding strategies fall, with moderate rolls?\"  For the sake of argument, let's say the 5 scenarios mentioned can be statistically ranked for a given patch, and that their ranks are as above.  The question then is, where does \"executing a strong early game strategy then transitioning into a strong late game strategy, with moderate rolls\" fit on the list?  Between 1 and 2?  Between 3 and 4?  Getting this placement right is the result of properly balancing losing streak gold, where as giving too much or too little gold will result in a placement that is too high (you should not just be able to blindly go for 6 nobles with AS on vayne if the first 6 or 8 RNG rounds do not roll any nobles or any recursives!) or too low (the game shouldn't feel like a coin flip; just because you didn't roll any nobles or recursives on your first 1 or 2 RNG rounds should not mean that the strategy is absolutely off the table).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-07-11T15:45:12.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I really don't feel that way.\nMaybe till krugs, aiming for a loosing streak is fine, but past that you just drop to low and a single bad fight can be the end. It's also risky, cause if you get that 1 win in between, your econ is totally fucked, so it fully depends on beeing the only one actively tryong to loose.\nAnd it only works if you still get a decent setup+items on your bench, else you won't be able to recover in the midgame.\n\nWinstreaks give huge gold advantages on top of NOT loosing live, and haveing a winstreak usually means your setup is doing nicely already, so you can save gold for interest which in the long run gives a huge advantage. Ofc if you get an early loss in between your gold isn't that great, but still better than for interupted loosing streaks and you still have more health and most likely a better setup.\n\nAs for the shared draft, i think the main issue is item balance right now. If some items weren't as clearly overpowered(mostly the off items) with others beeing rather weak(most def items), beeing 1st pick wouldn't be as bad. and even then, i rather have the health, gold and an already working setup than getting that itemadvantage unless your lucky enough to get multiple spatulas from it.\n\nAlso, it's really the only thing that keeps your hope up on an **unintentionall **loosing streak, else you could just as well leave if you drop to 50 befor reaching\nwolfs\n\nSo far, i havent seen much loosing strats, and most of them dropped out early, cause even when their setup got to a strong point, one fight vs assasins with crit luck or some prema CC glacials and they are out...\nOn a winning streak however, if i reach wolfs as one of the top 2, i finish the game as one of the top 3 90% of the time, and the 10% are insanely bad luck with not getting ANY of the pices i want from there on.
