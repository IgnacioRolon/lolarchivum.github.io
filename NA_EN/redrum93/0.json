At the start it's around 40 ms but during the game it goes up to 500 ms or even 1000 ms and then I get disconnected. I have to go afk almost every time I play because of this. \r\nI've run the internet speed test and the ping was good so I guess the problem is with League. Has this happened to anyone else here? What should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T17:17:47.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be suffering from packet loss or some connection problem that's failing keep strong comms with the game server.
