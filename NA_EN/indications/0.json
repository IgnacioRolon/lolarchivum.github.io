I told them not to worry, we will win because I am a plat smurf. Ashe decides to suddenly bash me saying \"Plat is easy to get to, I just started and will get to plat in 3 months.\"\n\nI told him no you won't, it took me 4 years because I am not good and improving. He then continues to say how I have a sad life playing 4 years of league. His 3 friends just started laughing and trolling me. I told them my life is not sad at all because I go to a good school, and have plenty of wealth in my family, I am certainly living quite well.\n\nThey keep taunting me, so I started using a sarcastic tone calling Ashe \"diamond\" because he thinks plat is trash.\n\nAfterwards, all 4 of them reported me and I immediately got banned. This is my FIRST offense ever and I never even got chat-restricted or even warnings.\n\nRiot sent me this log in my email. I've seen other ppl get banned with logs like \"go fucking die, youre r%%%%%ed, noob trash\" etc. If you look at mine, I've never said anything offensive. In fact it was them who kept flaming me about my life, so I was just arguing with them.\n\nThis is definitely not 14 DAYS BAN WORTHY.\n\nRiot you don't have to unban me, I just want you to acknowledge that this time your AUTOMATED CHAT SCAN SYSTEM IS FLAWED. Back in the tribunal days there would be no way I can get banned for something like this.\n\nEDIT: From this the only lesson I learned is to next time bring 3 friends along, and bash the random, and when he tries to defend himself, we will all report him. The automated system will flag his account, scan the things he says, and gets him a 14 day ban. It's quite a perfect plan actually.","replies":[{"poster":"BlazinHot6","date":"2015-07-20T18:39:14.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you said nothing ban worthy; I dont understand why you talk so much.

Suggesting otherwise is just a shallow/misinformed analysis of the situation. Punishments are rarely the result of 1 game.
