One part of it is her tornado can be used in conjunction with condemn for a stun lock, as well as allowing both of them to get away (peeling) if they get aggro.\n\nThe other part, and the most important, is {{champion:40}} shield.  At maximum rank it provides 50 AD (same as BF Sword) when it is on {{champion:67}} .  Since {{champion:67}} starts with an AS item usually {{item:3153}} and has bonus to AS from her tumble, the {{champion:40}} shield AD value has greatly increased gold efficiency.  Add in {{champion:67}} ultimate and you're looking at near 100 AD bonus at level 6 which is a practically guaranteed kill.  Also the AD bonus helps for wrecking down the tower and dragon in the early game.\n\nLater in the game, the combos still work but {{champion:40}} ultimate can be used to disengage or push targets near a wall.  {{champion:67}} likes walls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wwwdots","date":"2015-08-16T19:15:42.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nami/jana/lulu","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-08-16T19:00:22.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh I prefer a support that gets the enemy off my adc when it's tristana or vayne, because laning phase I'd rather we farm until late game .
