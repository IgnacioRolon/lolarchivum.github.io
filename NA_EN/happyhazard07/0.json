So I re-open the client and made another purchase of 20 dollars worth of rp. I then look at the amount of rp I have to see that I have received 2800 rp twice, meaning the first purchase did go through. I'm going to send in a support ticket but I wanted rioter advice on this matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T03:25:13.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making a support ticket for an issue like this is the best course of action. It seems your PC experienced a connection hiccup when making your purchase, which caused your issue. In the future, if this happens again, I recommend checking your bank account to see if it went through, or you can try to buy anything on the store (without buying it) and your RP balance should update.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions,","replies":[]}]}
