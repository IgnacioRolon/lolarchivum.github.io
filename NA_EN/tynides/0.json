Thanks for listening to my rant!\n\n\nThis is a typical silver game.\nNothing to see here.\nYou need to destroy your lane opponent at level 1 and make sure you tilt the ENEMY team before your team starts feeding.  1st bloods and level 1 deaths tilt everyone.  That's part of the way to climb out of silver (besides warding, proper lane control, don't miss uncontested minions, don't overpush a lane if the enemy jungler is probably around you, learn when to push and then roam to help another lane if you feel you can get them ahead.  Don't fall behind on CS.  Kill towers and dragons and buy pink wards.  Don't chase enemies through an unwarded jungle.  Don't overstay in a lane after taking a turret.\n\nThis will get you to plat easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-09-23T20:46:08.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatleZzz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=yaEbRKsR,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-09-23T20:15:32.027+0000)\n>\n> This is a typical silver game.\n> Nothing to see here.\n> You need to destroy your lane opponent at level 1 and make sure you tilt the ENEMY team before your team starts feeding.  1st bloods and level 1 deaths tilt everyone.

Yes it's usually the jungler that is the most toxic person in games, so targeting him is a great way to tilt the entire enemy team, assuming YOUR laners aren't all losing lane solo.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-09-23T21:02:22.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick graves->Fight him at scuttle/2nd buff -> profit\nAll it needs from team is 1 ward really because 90% of time you just know what buff they are starting\nAnd you really think lanes collapse in silver at 1st clear? xD","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-09-23T19:57:07.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can feel frustrated, but that doesn't mean you get to lash out.","replies":[{"poster":"Tynides","date":"2018-09-23T20:04:23.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if they lashed out at you because you were still trying to play the game while they just stand around?","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-09-23T20:13:27.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute them and play on.
