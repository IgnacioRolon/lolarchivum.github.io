I really enjoyed it, but having 100 fps drop all the way to 30 fps is no enjoyable. Please someone fix this. I think is when my screen tries to load the new graphics (turrets) or something like that.\r\n\r\nI play on a Macbook Pro Late 2012, Mac osx El Capitan\r\n8GB RAM, INTEL HD GRAPHICS 4000.\r\n(For everyone that comments about playing on a mac or intel graphics, i get 100 fps on normals, so it isn't normal to have this kind of fps drop.)","replies":[{"poster":"cadecranda","date":"2016-07-17T19:25:55.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/OpgP2Yvn-imac-significant-fps-drops-in-nexus-siege-gamemode?comment=0003","replies":[{"poster":"Wragdan","date":"2016-07-17T23:02:54.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already saw that post and repaired files, no solution...

SR is fine, though.\n\nI usually play the game on Mid graphics with no problems, for these modes I have to set it to lowest and I still experience frame drops.
