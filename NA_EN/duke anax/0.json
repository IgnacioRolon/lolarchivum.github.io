Good to have the option for solo/jungling if you do not have an ally around. I have a question though:\n\nDo you feel like he has too much defense scaling? I notice that he has a lot of health and armor scaling, which makes armor and health much more efficient on him compared to most champions. Did you ever consider transferring some of the power into his AP scaling? (They look a tad low, probably because of the strength of the defense scaling I just mentioned)\n\nI realize it is important to keep abilities like heals relevant when building mostly support, but putting armor scaling damage on abilities like passive and stun can create a character that deals a lot of damage while offering a huge amount of tank and utility.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2016-04-05T23:52:05.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The heal had a health scaling before and the shield scales on target health.\n\nHe always had a lot of armor scaling too, they didn't really increase that.\n\nThey did however more than double the AP ratio on Dazzle and made it AoE to.\n\nAs far as I can tell all of his basic abbilities got a little boost, \n\nThe ult is hard to quantify as it is vastly different.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-06T00:20:56.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And before the rework he could 1v1 any ad champ late game, which is questionable considering that riot wants adcs to be able to kill tanks 1v1.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2016-04-06T08:49:55.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC can kill most tanks, but Taric, Rammus and Malphite have always been a counter to that.\n\nEvery champ has something unique to them, fo some of them that means compenstaing the general weakness of their class.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2016-04-05T21:14:50.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will self casting also double the effectiveness of his other abbilities?\n\nObviously not the area but how about the damage an heal values?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2016-04-05T21:32:52.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meanwhile Mordekaiser","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2016-04-06T00:23:15.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Way to ruin my main. \nYou completely changed his play-style. \nThis update is a disappointment.\n\nComing from A REAL TARIC MAIN.\nYou ruined a great champion. \nMaybe just stick to visuals in the future!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jolg","date":"2016-04-05T23:08:46.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Bastion act like {{champion:429}} 's passive where if you walk back in range it reactivates or do you have to reactivate it on a champion after being out of tether range?","replies":[{"poster":"Zorae42","date":"2016-04-05T23:10:51.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Act's like {{champion:429}} passive for tether range mechanics\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}
