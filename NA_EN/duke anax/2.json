Maximises Mana while still getting a lot of AP (and health).","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-04-29T20:37:04.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He never stacked mana to out damage AP. \n\nHe stacked it because he could get damage while building tanky. Such as Frozen heart. Which is now a bad buy because of the wasted CDR. He'd be better off getting IBG. \n\nBut I do agree. He is currently better built as AP with AP/mana items only. He'll be better off with {{item:3157}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3003}}  {{item:3111}} {{item:3135}} as a main build now.
