Improve a bit on that claw of a hand and you really have a great taric skin that can compete with the other three. (not saying that my edits are that much of an improvement, but I think if the original artist made these changes it would make it perfect)\n\nEdit.

Your version is too red. The warmth is far too much. This gives off the wrong vibe. The theme becomes more of Fire than that of blood. Taric ends up looking sweaty. Look at Bloodstone Lyssandra and again we can see the artist used a fair amount of pinks/purples in the colors. This is because its not \"Firestone\" but instead \"boodlstone\". \n\n2. Its too simple. The edited version is like saying \"oh well blood is red so lets drop some red paint on it and call it a day\". It ignores a sense of color depth. Its like saying Nocturnes splash is not black enough because he has shades of blue and other colors.\n\n3. The original used better contrast. The best \"dark\" imagery in art have a great sense of contrast but only when its done right. The saying is true \"the brighter the light, the deeper the shadow\" and i think thats what the artist was going for. \n\n4.  The original conveys exactly the artists own interpretation. You can look at any piece of art and say \"oh.. i think it should be blah blah blah\" all you want. Sometimes it might come off better to the audience as a whole but it still comes down to personal taste. In this case, I think any changes to it just makes it look tacky. The artist went with a vampire-like theme due to the .. vampire-like theme, \"Bloodstone\".\n\nBasically I almost always gravitate towards the artists original look XD","replies":[{"poster":"Ludovico","date":"2016-04-09T09:21:22.258+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I´ma be honest here.
