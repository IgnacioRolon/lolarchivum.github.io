This is an eternity if you didnt 100-0 your target (which is probably why Diana is the only one that can do that anymore). This makes her very feed or fed as she either has the gold to get enough AP to 100-0 or cant secure a kill until the opponent has been worn down. This is exceptionally a problem in the early game.\n\n**Mana**\n> Diana has the 2nd smallest mana pool in the game. For a heavily AP champion this is awkward. This is even more confounded when Riot has stated that her shield, the most mana hungry ability she has, is suppose to be used to counter poke while in the laning phase. This makes it so Diana&#039;s MUST build mana first thing or get drained while trying to off set poke from ranged champs in the early game. By 6, if a DIana has built mana to survive, she still isn&#039;t a threat to the other laner because she has no damage to secure a kill. At this too, a Diana cant roam (in efforts to get assists/kills to bolster gold) because clearing a wave quickly ins&#039;t something she can do quickly without expending most of her mana, leaving her unable to help in a gank even if she wanted too. They even buffed her Q to be 55 at all ranks to help.\n\n**Ability Power**\n> No doubt Diana&#039;s Q is amazing once you have some AP behind it. Due to the prior problems I&#039;ve brought up though, it is unlikely a Diana has built enough AP to make a difference until very late game. And at that, full AP just makes Diana a suicide bomb as she, unlike most assassin, has no way out of a fight and further dictating mandatory items to even have a chance to survive.\n\n**Attack Speed**\n> This is a thing a Diana shouldn&#039;t even need yet, to make her passive useful at all, this is required. But I&#039;ll go into this further in her kit\n\n\nFrom her Kit\n\n**Passive**\n> Diana&#039;s passive was one of the coolest things when she came out, in fact unless memory fails me she was the second champ to have this (Vayne being the first). Unfortunately, for a caster primary kit, it has little combat application as, unless you built AS, you may get this off once a fight. Quick math, at .864 AS at 18 she can apply her passive once every 2.5 seconds, 5 seconds for twice. But by then your abilities are back up... if you lived that long. It just isn&#039;t useful outside of unharrassed wave clear. Even Ekko&#039;s 3 hit is easier to proc than this.\n\n**Q**\n> Diana&#039;s bread and butter, her greatest strength and weakness. ~~Undoubtedly the uncontested most powerful non-ult/non-triggered ability in the game... which is a problem~~. You miss her Q, you are out of a fight for 5 seconds at least. You land it, you win. For so much power to be on a basic ability no wonder the CD is so high. On top of that, it has drawn a lot of power from the rest of her kit.\n\n**W**\n> Nice mix of damage and defense but is fairly under powered until you get quite a bit of AP, which I explained isn&#039;t going to happen till late mid to late game. Also, it&#039;s mana cost ramps up dramatically between rank 1 to 5 (40-100, 100 usually being the cost of an ult or use to be the standard at least). Compounding the issue of mana cost in her kit.\n\n**E**\n> At the time this was very powerful (and even longer range), but has been nerfed in radius and does no damage. For a non-support that cant fight for 5 seconds after a full rotation, this ability is literally only good for running away during the laning phase (which is ironic because it pulls people to her before slowing them). Mid-late game it is alright to allow allies to catch up on someone you caught, given the rest of their team isnt close enough for them to turn on and kill you. And finally, at 70 mana it is a heavy draw to your pool and only truly good for grouping an enemy team of someone else&#039;s ult.\n\n**R**\n> Decent range (at release it was ridiculous I&#039;ll even admit), but no way out after committing and a decent CD if done without marking them with Q first. This creates a problem in that its damage is so weak in general, has a long CD for that damage, and, as I just said, commits you to any engagement used in. For an ult that is laughably comparable to a basic ability, it really is a weak ult with little use. This is probably due in part to her Q being over loaded. Primarily only useful to apply W damage as, if used right, you have already Q&#039;d them.\n\n\nI love playing Diana, even still do with a decent win rate (but I do play her HP tank/AP which usually causes the other team to over exert to kill me if they even do), but she is heavily under powered when it comes to champ choices. Specifically, Ekko is a better Diana (I refuse to play him because he has an overloaded kit and think him unbalanced). Though the similar passive, Ekko stacks his much more easily thanks to his Q being able to apply 2 stacks, on top of allow granting a MS boost when triggered. His Q not only having decent range but can hit twice, slows, and, as stated, can stack his passive per hit. His W, like Diana&#039;s E, is a mass CC which, though yes is a little more telegraphed, is ranged, slows enemies inside, and if Ekko enters it applies a decent stun and a massive shield, all on top of granting passive extra damage to basic attacks. His E is essentially a flash that can allow him to &quot;flash&quot; again if into a target doing an auto attack, stacking his passive, and applying extra damage on the hit. And then, if that wasn&#039;t enough for his kit, his ult heals (increasing with damage taken recently), teleports him to where he was 4 seconds ago, and can nuke anyone in the location he lands.\n\n-Takes a breath-\n\nDiana needs a straight buff or rebalancing, especially when you compare her to Ekko (her closest kit relation in the game besides Riven)","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-11-16T05:14:26.444+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":">Undoubtedly the uncontested most powerful non-ult/non-triggered ability in the game\n\n...Diana Q?

It doesn't apply AoE CC like Cho'Gath's Q, despite taking nearly as long to hit the desired target location. Gragas Q has an almost comparable cooldown, slows, deals more damage, and can be set up as zone denial. Diana Q is, honestly, nothing special.

She is also the core example of why in the current state of the game, such a design just doesn't work, and won't, without significant systemic changes to how large core game mechanics function.\n\nDiana can't function as a bruiser style champion. Why? Because she needs AP. But then, why build just a bit of AP to get you *some* power, when you could build more, and have one-shot power? So what if you're a suicide bomber, you get the job done. But then that creates a toxic play pattern to go against, where she can near point and click delete squishies from the game. So Riot has to nerf her ratios, make it so that she doesn't get as much from building AP. But then, her kit just doesn't support being a tanky engager (unless you have like a fed Yasuo to combo with your E), so she falls out of the game almost completely, which leads to Riot needing to buff her.

Why not have a Darius go straight AD. Most champs that dash in are assassins, so this aspect gives the wrong impression of how to play her too.\n\nAlso, there arent a lot of AS/AP items. So there isn't an incentive for her to go fighter either.\n\nEdit: I just start thinking chaining thoughts here on out XD\n\nThere is also the issue of Base vs Scaling damage in the game. Too much Base, just go tank. Too much Scaling just go damage. It's why Malphite can nuke people and the only reason it isn't optimal to build him that way is do to long CD's to do it (his ult mainly). So what Diana needs is her kit to be more optimal to fight rather than nuke.\n\nSo lower the damage and CD on Q, so it is more spam-able but can no longer 1/2 hp a carry. Allow all of her abilities to reset R so she can dash around like Irellia or Fiora but also incentives not face mashing all the abilities at once.\n\nAlso, improving her story game play to. Have her going through phases that alter how her attacks work.\n\nP Full - 360 but 1/2 damage\nP Wane/Wax - as is\nP New - single target but 2x damage\n\n(With damage reduction and CD reduction (probably mana reduction too))\nQ Fullmoon - 2 cresents (she gets a seconds cresent)\nQ Wane/Wax - normal, as is (side the cresent in on changes with which phase)\nQ New - AOE on herself\n\nW Full - Only shields but 2x the amount\nW Wane/Wax - as is\nW New - Dark orbs, only damage but 2x the amount\n\nE Full - Pushes away\nE Wane/Wax - Pulls from cursor to opposite side (like gnars ult but opposite)\nE New - as is (pulled to the darkness)\n\nR Full - Shields only\nR Wane/Wax - as is\nR New - Extra Damage?\n\nThis would also encourage combo start points. Opponents who learn the Diana's favorites get tells when she might attack. Good Diana's will know to have several they can start from.\n\nAny who. Based on what you said, having loaded the Q with so much damage is one of the main instigators. But over all, lower CD's and less damage is the solution. Spread the damage out over multiple casts rather than alot in one hit. It isnt the ratios, it was the approach.\n...\nYeah... I believe that's right based on what you said. Too much front loaded damage. The down time even incentives to get it done in one hit. And remember, if she isn't meant to have a lot of AP (building fighter) then there is no need for the down time, a good player will be weaving the spells between autos.\n\nIf this helps the Champ Dev teams I would be ecstatic.

If Riot really wanted to make her a true Juggernaut they could also add something for this phase that makes it so any MR pen or other effects that ignore some of the enemy’s MR makes Diana’s abilities/auto attacks deal LESS damage. That way she can’t still build full AP assassin and absolutely nuke anybody with the 2x damage and the amount of pen she can buy.

A lot of other comments have actually given good feedback and if a Dev sees it we might actually get a Diana that can toe to toe with Irelia.\n\nParticularly, the fact that her abilities are too front loaded for the idea of a Fighter champ. So the solution would be to weaken the abilities but have them CD quicker too. This way, instead of face mashing the keyboard to do all the damages in 1 second, you would actively engage like say a Darius or Irelia to do that same damage over 5 seconds.
