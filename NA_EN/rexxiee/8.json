Most you can ask for is a counter gank or to avoid shoving him in for best odds. \n\nIf a jungle camps the lane, thats at the fault of you and your jungler. If your jungler isn't counter ganking or influencing the opposite side of the map then that's not benefitting from theirs wasting time top. If you're not warding or overextending repeatedly rather then freezing, then thats to be expected as an easy target.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-19T03:22:20.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tormentula,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wBb7EULq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-03-19T03:18:40.820+0000)\n>\n> This isn&#x27;t nowadays, this has always been the case tbh. \n> \n> The problem is right now it doesn&#x27;t matter what happens up there, you have to rely on bot lane to carry the game.\n\nTop lane is an island - S6","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-03-19T03:11:34.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the OP meant better vision control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Odysseus263","date":"2018-03-19T03:07:55.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ask hashinshin what is the best top laner. he is the top lane itself at this point.","replies":[]}]}
