Make her targetable under towers, hell give her the middle portion to stealth in too if it meant reducing its total smoke screen size for all I care, I just don't want zoned off by akali because I can't hit her and she can hit me.\n\n..and she needs a new Q, I fucking hate her Q in lane. You can sidestep zed and ekko's range, or trigger minion aggro with kassadin and LB, but Akali's Q doesn't trigger aggro, has a wide hitbox, the only thing it lacks is range but considering how threatening she is, you can't really fight her for walking up and she has so many tools to disengage/continue zoning for a melee. You could just walk up, Q, shroud and just camp the opponent's side of the shroud (which extends way too fucking far) to prevent continue poking them with no punishment, considering its low CD and shroud for some reason gives energy, she can chunk you in lane for free pretty much.. the only option is blind guessing where is in the shroud as a mage and landing skillshots, again, easier said then done due to vision advantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Î—uawei","date":"2018-12-04T03:03:29.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Very unfun to play against, low winrate.\n\nhmm... i see a correlation there.\n\nSo Yasuo's windwall is more fun to play against?\nAnd don't get me started on Zoe's spell bubble that is so fun to play against","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-12-04T03:11:02.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"i'd rather play against the new kit than the old","replies":[]}]}
