Okay, fair, requires good timing.\n{{champion:39}} : Press R, Lasts for 2-3.5 Seconds, only disarms opponents who try to run away. Okay, Fair, a champion who's a good Duelist requires you to fight her by using a long CD ultimate and if you run your punished for .75 seconds, cool.\n{{champion:84}} : Press W, become Tue Stealthed, you can be revealed but cannot be auto attacked or targeted by single target abilities at all, this includes tower's, you reveal yourself when you attack as normal and if your under tower you will always be revealed but still won't be able to be targeted by single target abilities or auto attacks. Okay, relatively unfair but definitely could be balanced. \n\nI really don't see a problem with champions countering a certain thing, that just means that if a team/champion is too strong or is full of a certain type of thing you can give yourself an edge by picking them. I understand yasuo because of the sheer lack of skill it takes to block something, but the overall power the ability has as a whole, like sure Fiora can block everything, but the key here is \"Can\" she has the ability to but it require's some skill to do so and it's also on a long cooldown, doesn't last near as long and locks her in an animation for twice the amount of the actual immunity. Akali i kind of understand too but there are cruxes here and there that allow for you to fight back, even if she dives you her cooldowns are way to long for her to sit under your turret and unleash more than one spell rotation, the same amount everyone else gets when they dive someone early, though some can definitely unload more.","replies":[{"poster":"Naymliss","date":"2018-07-17T13:07:44.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me the issue with {{champion:39}} is it gives her another Trinity proc, which means unless you're a tank you're getting one shot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-07-16T22:16:36.875+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"But will it break the banrate record held by Zac?\n\n######why the fuck am I downvoted\n","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-07-17T09:47:29.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wut?
