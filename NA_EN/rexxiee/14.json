Karth has been strong for 1 patch. ONE. Calm down, they have not even had the opportunity to nerf him yet. And he is only strong cuz DH is strong on him. And they have already hotfixed it and have more nerfs  planned for next patch. So no reason to nerf Karthus until they see the result. Stop acting like Riot doesnt care because a champ got strong for a patch.","replies":[]}]}
