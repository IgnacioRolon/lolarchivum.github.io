We, Ahri mains, had stereotypes about it and had no clue that it would make her strong. I personally wanted more damage into her W. Now that  i think of it, Ahri would just go back to Gunblade Lich meta again.\nBack to the buff. The buff was far stronger than what any Ahri main would  have expected.  Her wr got higher, and she was in top 5 mids very soon.\nSo all those things show that the buff was really good and it made Ahri S tier, which she hasn`t been since then in S8. So, what should i say and what is my opinion?\n- The buff was huge. What most players don`t realize is that she even got a mana buff, which didn`t do anything at all. Yes, from then on you can throw 2 charms except 1 till 6th level and Lost Chapter, but the mana wasnt problem really after Lost Chapter.\n- The buff shows how strong CC is. `Just` 40% made her S tier from B, and her banrate was higher  a lot, too.\n- What should be done with Ahri now and is the nerf going in the  right direction?\n Completely yes! They are nerfing Ahri the way she should be nerfed - her safety. What makes Ahri strong ( not broken!) is her ability to do well even if you mess up because her safety is really high. This nerf will delay your ult by 20 seconds, which is huge for Ahri counters ( LB, Vlad, Fizz). It will make her hard matchups harder, and make them require more skill which is what i really love. \n- Now, what else should be done to Ahri?\nBring back her dash-stopping mechanic, but make her E cooldown higher by 3-4 seconds. Why? SKILLED Ahri players will save their charms for the critical moment, while unskilled ones will most likely miss it or use to combo. This would make even more difference between a good Ahri and a bad one. Also, this is the  direction they wanted to go in. `Make her highs higher and lows lower` \n\n-Ahri mains will say Ahri is weak(most of them). No she isnt. She is strong and S tier atm, but nowhere near broken. Is the nerf deserved? Yes? Should there be more? No\n\nTo conclude, this nerf is a nice one but there`s more work to be done. I hope i didnt confuse people because im really tired.
