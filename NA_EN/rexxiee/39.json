OK, so Mages & Assassins are supposed to be good at BURST, (ie. kill you in one shot) whereas ADCs are supposed to be good at DoT.  This means in 0.1 second, a mage/assassin can potentially do 1000 dmg to a single target, but then needs 30 secs to do it again.  OTOH, an ADC can do 1000 dmg in say 5 secs and keep doing that until someone stops them.\n\nHere's why it is bad if the ADC and Burst take towers at equal rates.  As an adc, I SHOULD lose to Burst in a 1v1.  If the Burst can then take down a tower in about the same amount of time as me WHY WOULD YOU EVER PLAY ADC?!?  The point of my sustained damage, is that you can't leave me alone to \"free fire\" on that tower because I'll tear it down, but I'm not safe just fighting you by myself.  That's how these classes even out.  ADCs were in a bad place with overpowered Crit because ADCs HAD lots of early Burst, but now the pendulum has swung in the opposite BAD direction.\n\nWas it WRONG that ADCs could burst mages in 1 sec?  YES.  Is it EQUALLY wrong that mages can burn towers? Also YES.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-07-08T09:38:06.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mages aren't supposed to be able to take towers quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-08T17:34:53.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are people seeing teams of 5 bruisers?
