Of course slowing junglers down early is going to make the role feel worse, it is worse because you lowered the power they bring to the table early game. By having less of an early game impact in a meta where the game is decided by jungle influence in the early game you have less of a say over how games turn out. Correct me if i'm wrong here but that was the goal of the nerfs, to let laners have more of an impact on the outcome of the game. Of course they would be received in that way by the junglers. Nerfs should generally have this kind of impact, and if you're dedicated to nerfing the role then you kind of have to commit to that as a result.

Junglers should be able to attempt early ganks, but missing them should cost them. They should also be able to safe farm the jungle and doing so should put a jungler ahead if their opponent fails a gank.

The high reward/long respawn camps of the current game lead to many junglers never actually having to farm and simply taking camps between ganks while still getting far too high of a share of the resources out of the jungle.\n\nThis wasn't an issue in earlier seasons, it used to be that ganks had serious costs because in the time you ganked some of your camps would be coming up so you'd lose out on at least a bit of EXP and gold efficiency if you failed. Now it's too easy to knock down camps at convenience and the timers are so high with the rewards per single camp so great that you really don't lose much ever.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-03-17T23:18:16.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also was to hard for a jungler when you got counter jungled.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MorganFreemanBot","date":"2018-03-17T15:30:21.498+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ohAYH9uw,comment-id=000100010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-17T06:30:24.359+0000)\n>\n> Yep, I&#x27;d agree that&#x27;s part of the problem.

This makes ganks come at a cost if failed; you're giving up real gold for a chance at a bigger spike, and if you're counter jungled this hurts more.\n\n2: Adjust jungle camp xp, the goal being that you have to go 2 buffs + 2 camps to get 3. This delays the 'critical' first gank by 15-30 seconds depending on jungler and skill order.\n\n3: Scale down the deadliness of raptors early game. There are some junglers who CANNOT clear 2 camps + 2 buffs before backing without standing around awhile, and others who are dangerously low. This is needed to not force them out of the jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-03-17T20:04:13.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 3: Scale down the deadliness of raptors early game.

A big part of current jungler strength comes from the ambiguity of the wolf camp and how even the weakest early game jungler can clear it with relatively little backlash. This means that junglers who would heavily suffer from a two buff + two camp clear can still emerge from the jungle, relatively hale and hearty, to show up for the level 3 toplane fight.\n\nOff the top of my head, junglers such as Zac, Nautilus, Malphite, Nocturne (I haven't played him since his buff, so this may have changed) are noticeably wounded upon completion of their current jungle circuit. Enough so that the top lane gang bang is very risky for them, and any competent counter jungler can easily march into their jungle and shove them out.\n\nTransitioning to a two + two clear, in order to hit 3, would make this even worse. A champion like WW really isn't going to give a fuck whether he clears one or two small camps to hit 3, he's absolutely fine either way. All this change would do is shift the level 3 top gank to an invade; MU's which involve a strong meta jungler vs something else would end with the meta pick marching into the enemy jungle and picking up an extra set of buffs + first blood for free. We've seen this meta, it's not fun.\n\nThe reason for scaling back raptors specifically is because two fold.\n\n#1: A lot of junglers who would be negatively effected are even worse against gromp than they are raptors. This is pretty self explanatory.\n\n#2: Raptors has the most bizarre punishment curve in the jungle. Most of the other camps are pretty linear, dealing moderate damage which descends at a steady rate. Raptors deals potentially fatal damage which is extremely out of whack with every other early game camp, but once you hit the point where you can clear them quickly, they suddenly become the fastest, least dangerous, and most rewarding camp. An adjustment which hits their deadliness early game would be a concession to avoid forcing off-meta picks / and non top-tier jungler champions out of the role.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Altonius Amakiir","date":"2018-03-17T06:57:17.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels like that if you're jungling and can't get a gank off right now (you fell behind) that the only way to get back into viability is to keep trying to gank.

This goes along with the whole reward for jungling, it just doesn't give enough gold on it's own to compare to laner's cs or a gank heavy jungling strategy. That and the catchup xp also makes it very hard for counter-junglers to have a meaningful impact, stealing camps doesn't hurt much for the enemy jungler.

It can be highly irritating to play against, especially as a level 2 laner against a level 3 jungler with doubles. I think electrocute is really, really strong early and its high damage at low levels combined with things like sudden impact giving 10 lethality at level 1 make for really, really painful level 3 ganks from champs that are already very good early game. I think the domination tree is at the root of a lot of the reason people feel like early game junglers are absurd.\n\nExcept Electrocute is hardly the problem because most junglers either run Aftershock or Press the Attack.","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-03-17T20:15:24.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lovesick,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ohAYH9uw,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-03-17T08:00:26.507+0000)\n>\n> Except Electrocute is hardly the problem because most junglers either run Aftershock or Press the Attack.\n\n{{champion:121}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:59}}{{champion:56}} {{champion:28}}{{champion:60}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:107}}    Electrocute\n\n{{champion:35}} {{champion:104}} - Electrocute or Dark Harvest are both used.\n\n{{champion:11}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:203}}  - PTA\n\nElectrocute is clearly the dominant jungle keystone.","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-03-18T04:49:10.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Antenora,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ohAYH9uw,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2018-03-17T20:15:24.817+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:121}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:59}}{{champion:56}} {{champion:28}}{{champion:60}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:107}}    Electrocute\n> \n> {{champion:35}} {{champion:104}} - Electrocute or Dark Harvest are both used.\n> \n> {{champion:11}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:203}}  - PTA\n> \n> Electrocute is clearly the dominant jungle keystone.\n\nLee, Kayn, Nocturne, Rengar, Diana are sub-optimal. \n\nShaco and Graves are niche.

It is jungle changes after all they might not even know how to do it yet either. Jg aren't meant to win you the lane that's for sure so having them camp a lane isn't healthy however it should still be a viable aggressive ganking role if the jungler is just going to spend too much resources on PbE then they're not really participating in the whole team aspect not to mention that champions that clear faster or counter jg better will be at the utmost advantage if the monster hurt more or have more exp.

Objectives ( How rewarding can they be, should the jg be able to solo some of them when there's too much heat in a lane? should they always require help? )\n4. and the most important the champs that roam in it, who's cut out to be in there and what will happen to those that don't make the cut to survive the changes? \n\nThe jg imo is probably the hardest role to balance as it has too many things to consider and going on at the same time.
