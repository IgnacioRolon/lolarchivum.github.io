Getting free hits on tower because she's at a safe range while you're still trying to CS is a side effect of the traps, not the job of them, and if it is a seiging tool, its a toxic playstyle that shouldn't be preserved just as various parts of champion kits have been gutted out for the sake of proper counterplay.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-07-08T19:54:24.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"hit both. and then hit her in the face.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-08T19:48:13.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"high-range champ will always be at least decent in lane tho","replies":[]}]}
