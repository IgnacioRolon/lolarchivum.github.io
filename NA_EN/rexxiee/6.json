That being said, that's the reason why it feels so fun to use. The problem is if you nerf the keystone, it ruins it for everyone, and if you nerf Ez, he becomes that much more reliant on this keystone to make up for whatever the nerf did to him.\n\n I have a couple ideas, though I'm not actually sure what is causing Ez to be so prevalent when using Kleptomancy; the gold, or the consumables? The ideas here are to keep the satisfaction you get while using kleptomancy, without making it weak to the point where nobody wants to take it. Kleptomancy as far as I'm concerned is pretty decent on supports for their income, so I avoided nerfing income\n\n >Idea 1.\n\n>- Increase the rate of gold drops, but decrease the gold earned for every drop\n>- Decrease the rate of random consumable drops to compensate for the increase gold drops\n\nThis would keep the satisfaction you get from using this keystone in tact; it would just shift the power gained from the various potions / elixirs you get into more frequent gold drops, however the gold they grant would be toned down to match the higher frequency of drops. If gold is causing the problem on Ez, this wouldn't fix it; but I feel like the consumables are the real problem here with the amount of power they give at the frequency he can proc it.\n\n >Idea 2.\n\n>- Reduce the rate of overall drops\n\n\n\nThe problem with this idea is the fact that it hurts everyone, and is extremely unsatisfying to use at this point. The reason so many people like this keystone is because of the thrill you get when you receive a random consumable just from trading with your enemy, regardless what it ends up being.\n\n >Idea 3.\n\n>- Add an internal timer to prevent overuse\n\nPerhaps one of the most straightforward; short, simple, and to the point. It would be exactly the same; people would still be satisfied to use it, and it wouldn't change the rate of drops for 90% of champions (since some champions (EZREAL) can proc it -really- often). It would just tone down the few champions that are abusing it.\n\n>Idea 4.\n\n>- Add a per champion cooldown to it. \n\nThis is sort of like idea 3, however it's changed to a cooldown thats sort of like Braum's passive on enemy champions, or Yasuo's dash on minions. This means that there are moments that you can still proc it multiple times in rapid succession, but it would tone down spam overall; or at the very least encourage you to change your focus to a different target if your goal is procing the keystone. I think this would feel more consistant than idea 3, since you can still proc it multiple times in a matter of a few seconds, but the change would still restrict you from procing it every 2 seconds.\n\n>Idea 5.\n\n>- Remove Ezreal's ability to proc kleptomancy fully on Q\n\nI'm not suggesting we remove his ability to proc on hit things; just remove the interaction between his Q and kleptomancy. Let his Q count as the spellcast, but still require him to actually go in and auto attack, forcing him to risk being traded with in lieu of a chance to receive gold / consumables. Everything else would be the same. I don't believe the problem is the frequency at which he gets things, as much as it is the frequency he gets things **while being completely safe**. There's no risk involved in Ezreal using this keystone like their should be, which I think is a big contributing factor to why he's able to abuse kleptomancy so well.\n\nIf you've read through all of this, I applaud your patience. Let me know what you think, or if you have any ideas.

Not to say certain people wouldn't take it, but a big reason why it's so popular is because it's so thrilling when you do get a random consumable in lane just for doing your job and trading with the enemy. Making things available in the shop feels lackluster, and turns into a money drain, where your gold could be spent on something else; and at that point, it becomes pointless to take the keystone just for a little extra gold. \n\nThe goal is to keep the high satisfaction of the keystone while tuning it so certain champions can't abuse it here. When someone chooses to go the kleptomancy route, they're sacrificing a lot of raw power, but the consumables are what make up for the sacrifice. It's basically trading damage for lanestay, with the occasional elixir to help just a bit to even things out. Removing consumable drops directly to the champion would be a pretty big mistake imo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-11-13T05:00:37.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The keystone is the problem because prior to it's release, Ezreal wasn't destroying everything. Ezreal getting massive access to mana potions (fixes his mana issues) and excess gold (because ADCs LOVE GOLD) is the problem with Kleptomancy, because it's dropping Ezreal's down time significantly, plus he can proc the keystone with too much ease. The fact that some of his spells actually double as extended autoattacks is very core to his kit, so they can't touch that without brutalizing him. They need to fix the keystone here, and not Ezreal, because he's not a problem until the keystone is involved.","replies":[{"poster":"Håppy","date":"2017-11-13T06:10:38.824+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ezreal has broken almost every interesting, unique addition League has received and instead of looking at the champion, it's always been the item/keystone that gets nerfed.
