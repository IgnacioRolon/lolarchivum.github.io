Bone Plate Designer and balance designer who handled the top lane changes this past patch. I hear where you're coming from, and I also hate stone-walled lanes. I'm a top lane player primarily, and I play agressive champions like Fiora, Kled, and Renekton. I'm with you that playing into uninteractive farm lanes sucks, whether it be against ranged-waveclear or unkillable tanks. So... I hope you believe me when I say we thought about this stuff extensively when designing Bone Plating. Here's some context on the design conversations around it:\n\nNon-tank champions lacked options in Resolve for mitigating 'all-in' opponents like Riven or Tryndamere, since the existing minor runes weren't strong in lane for them. As a result, they turned to Inspiration for early durability/sustain options (like Celestial Body, Perfect Timing, and the potion style bonus). We wanted Resolve to be able to fill that need for non-tanks and landed on Bone Plating - good on tanks, but also appeals to squishies. It's good against burst, but bad against poke since opponents can 'poke it off' (damage of the hit that procs Bone Plating isn't actually reduced), then take advantage of the huge cooldown.\n\nWith that design trending well, we wanted to make sure we weren't increasing the overall amount of defensive power in the early game, particularly the full-tank Resolve+Inspo build. So we removed Celestial Body, nerfed Perfect timing, moved the potion style bonus to a new rune that you have to give up a slot for, and, most importantly, shuffled Resolve runes around. Resolve users can no longer take the mega-early-game defense package of Iron Skin/Mirror Shell + Second Wind. They CAN go Bone Plating + Iron Skin, or Bone Plating + Second Wind, but that package is not strictly tankier since Bone Plating does nothing for 45 seconds after it falls off. (Combined, The full-tank inspo+resolve build is worse off.)\n\nOverall, I believe these adjustments will help the 'stonewall' problem, not make it worse.

Glad you enjoyed it. \n\nAs for Bone Plating, it's hard to read how it will affect 'overall' durability. It will likely add to early game durability in _some_ matchups, but will be worse than other options (like Celestial Body) in other matchups. As for the late game, if your team has any amount of ranged poke, you effectively can deny the enemy's Bone Plating at a low cost. \n\nThe point I really want to push on here is that unlike flat defensive stats like HP or Armor, you can actually play around Bone Plating. It does not reduce the damage on the attack that procs it, it only lasts a few seconds, and then it has a longgg CD. The other aspect of it (which didn't make it into the tooltip, my bad!) is that it only blocks damage from the person that triggers it. So if your Soraka Qs the enemy ADC and triggers Bone Plating, the assassin who then dives on that ADC does not suffer any reduced damage.\n\nSooooo! With all that considered, it's really hard to evaluate exactly what this will do to 'overall' durability. But it is easy to talk about what it will do in specific matchups, since it was designed to be good in some and bad in others :D","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-02-24T00:01:18.683+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Stashu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GiABzJ6V,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2018-02-23T23:50:33.926+0000)The other aspect of it (which didn&#x27;t make it into the tooltip, my bad!) is that it only blocks damage from the person that triggers it.

I think bone plating was a good addition to the resolve tree over all, because it leaves a window of opportunity to have kill pressure, which is healthy for the game, I feel like the biggest issue right now is -> Second Wind <-. The amount of sustain with Dorans Shield and the free cookies from the Inspiration tree is a massive issue. It's somewhat pointless to do short trades right now because people are literally sustaining to full health instantly. It was a massive issue in season 3, if I recall the time frame, where you nerfed a lot of base health regeneration on for example Riven, but buffed her shield slightly - which in turn made it more skill based where you actually have to dodge damage, and not just trade and heal to full by sitting around in lane. \n\nExample; you short trade properly over and over until you actually can dive or have kill pressure (which makes the lane more interactive)\n\nExample two: In the current state of the game you can't really do that, and the only hope of having kill pressure in lane is going for an all in. Which is heavily negated by Ninja Tabi/bone plating. \n\nI don't mind tanks having ways to survive all ins against bruisers, but on top of all of the tools they already have they also have permanent sustain. That's the reason all bruisers run Resolve now as well, the runes and sustain you get is way too over the top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2018-02-24T10:30:19.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bone Plating on a much, much lower cooldown would be great as a Diver passive. \n\nShameless advertising: I made a concept for it as a Wukong passive [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/g6RuLJyY-stone-skin-update-suggestion-for-wukong).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rexxiee","date":"2018-02-24T02:02:14.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Stashu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GiABzJ6V,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-02-23T22:41:46.447+0000)\n>\n> Hello!
