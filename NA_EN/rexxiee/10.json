A world where everyone is allowed to CS perfectly.\n\nThat doesn't exist. This is why Junglers like Shyvana and Kayn can have more gold with no kills or assists than their mid or top laners. The tendency for your lane opponent to try to kill you, harass you, or zone you is much much much greater than the tendency of the enemy jungler to try to take your camps because of factors such as not knowing the timers of the small camps, not knowing if the buffs are actually there, worrying about being collapsed on, or being killed by the enemy jungler. If you're a powerfarming jungler, there basically is no chance for the enemy to steal your camps either, because you're always doing them quickly.\n\nTLDR: Your scenario already takes what I said into account when it comes to clearing the jungle 3 times by 10 minutes. That is easy and happens often.

Did you ever stop to consider the fact that for my claim that one can clear the jungle 3 times in 10 minutes the jungler would have to instantly clear all the camps the moment they spawn after the first time?\n\nThat and they must never gank either, to ensure that they don't waste any time or having to recall.\n\n\nSo do tell me, between a laner missing only 10 CS until 10 minutes and a jungler perfectly clearing all the camps when they spawn with no downtime and still managing to react to enemy jungle, which is more unrealistic?\n\n\nI myself find it kinda difficult to believe that a jungler could manage to not only perfectly clear their jungle with almost no downtime twice in a row after the first time and still somehow maintain map pressure and keep enemy jungle under watch.","replies":[{"poster":"Telosen","date":"2018-02-11T23:49:03.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever watched Shyvana, Udyr, or Kayn? They quite literally do what you just said. Shyvana in particular can clear camps in less than 4 seconds after she starts to buy some items, and with an item and a half she literally does camps in 2 seconds or less. They've nerfed her damage to monsters a few times these past two years for this reason. She can clear camps repeatedly without having to back either. Shyvana is also not that great of a ganker before level 6, which is why she tends to powerfarm her jungle and the enemy jungle camps when possible. There is a reason shyvana has the highest average jungle cs of all junglers in the game while being below average for kills and assists across junglers.\n\nI described a scenario in which a farm jungler is not ganking when I mentioned that they don't have kills or assists. A farm jungler by definition prefers to farm, they tend NOT to gank, and they often get flamed by teammates for not applying pressure. They avoid combat in an effort to out-level everyone in the game for a power spike later.

You'd be better off saying alistar and some adc. \n\nAnyways solo laners can carry. I've done it myself plenty of times. You just have to spread your advantage to the rest of your team. You know, like a team game. And you can do protect the dps mage comp, but good luck getting your team to roll with it. An example of this is azir, who is fairly popular nowadays.\n\nYou're saying you lose 1v1 vs junglers when you already have less health than them? How is this a bad thing? You should have to outplay people when you are lower health, not just auto win just because of your roles. Yes junglers used to be weaker and years ago they were just glorified supports. I'm glad its still not like that. Jungling was boring af back then.\n\nAnd there we go, top and mid can't carry unless they actually play with their team. Big surprise. I bet you'd rather just run it down your lane and fight the enemy as they try to stop you, disregarding your team entirely. How about you learn about roles and realize that you win games by getting your carries fed? Not just adc, but mid laners also. Even top laners if they get fed. Its all about playing around whoever is strongest on your team at any given point. This might be your riven because she stomped lane. It might mean your fed yi jungle. It might even mean your (surprise!) shitty adc after they've gotten some items and can fight back.\n\nBut in the end it matters is how good your team is. Sometimes you'll get a bad jungler that doesn't know how to prioritize his ganks. But you'll just have to get over it and maybe do the ganking yourself. There's nothing wrong with being carried.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EssenceOfPoo","date":"2018-02-10T22:41:35.659+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"OP, probably:\n\nhttps://i.imgflip.com/24c6ra.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2018-02-10T20:54:04.789+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"If the enemy jungler destroys all lanes he deserves to win.

Many people see junglers as taking over the game because they don't think about all the time good junglers lose games. If you play jungle you will realize how reliant on your laners you actually are.  The real issue in your scenario is that you and your bot lane are not securing river vision. When mid and bot are ahead and they secure bottomside river there is nothing a jungler can do. He can't gank mid or bot without exposing himself in the river and it is usually too risky for him to go for drag. On the other hand, your team has control of drag and can easily move from one lane to another. Also, if mid and bot towers are down, the enemy jungler will usually have to forfeit up his entire botside jungle. The only thing a jungler can do from that point is to play around his top side/top laner, and top is arguably the lane that has the least effect on the game (this patch). Also mid and bot scale harder than junglers most of the time so even if you can't shut down their jungler, if you don't lose your lead he will become irrelevant. \n              \n                       Ultimately though you see it as being the jungler, it's usually the game state that is out of control. Instead of blaming the jungler use your advantage to gain vision control then the enemy jungler will have no opportunity to gank you, and if you can't control vision, because your jungle and botlane are useless, then there is nothing you can do, league is a team game and the enemy jungle had the better team, it's unfortunate but unavoidable. \n\nP.S. the only reason people think junglers have control of the game is because the junglers don't have waves or towers to protect. So when a jungle gets fed he can move around freely and influence all the lanes. but in reality, a fed mid top supp or adc can do the same thing after they take tower, with the added bonus of having more gold and xp from lane farm. That's why when an enemy botlane gets fed it is so oppressive because you know have two laners that can roam. If your having trouble winning games, eventhough you are stomping your lane, you should learn better macro and stop blaming the jungler {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2018-02-11T04:15:47.395+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Jungle isn't the problem, never has been.

Literally the most boring shit every single game, where shyvana just gets blood razor and out tempos everyone in the game, taking dragons at 4 minutes. \n\nIn competitive, the only viable junglers are super tanks (sejuani, gragas, jarvan, sometimes even skarner, zac) and picking anything else is to near throw a game, unless it's something like Kha, who is so fucking ridiculous right now that we aren't even going to talk about him. \n\nI disagree with anyone saying lee sin is broken. Right now lee sin is probably the most balanced hes been for the past 2 years. He was a little more powerful with the ability to take stopwatch+magical footware, but since that has been nerfed, he's fallen into a pretty good spot. Of course he's going to have a 20% pick rate in high elo. He always is, because he's one of the most fun champions to play in the game, and when mastered can be powerful. \n\nMeanwhile midlane, the same shit is picked every game. It's either malzahar, azir, zoe, ryze every single fucking game. So fun to see the enemy laner get ccd and 100-0d every time the midlaner's ult is up. Literally the most degenerate meta we've seen in quite some time mid. \n\nThe only answer to the mega tanks in the jungle right now are super tank shredders like varus and kog. So of course those 2 are pick ban every game. Kog has been nerfed, but he will still be inevitably good in competitive at some point. \n\nTop is vlad gp gnar every game.
