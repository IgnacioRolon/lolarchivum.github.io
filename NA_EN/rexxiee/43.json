Even when a talon falls short and goes 0/3 because your jungler camped him, he can still 1v1 you easily. Her AOE is strong but she's very prone to death without resets.

Almost everything you say doesn’t relate to the topic we’re discussing. It’s about other assassins that are stronger when behind compared to Kat. Not her level of difficulty when playing her. Also, you’ve probably never played against a good Aatrox. He’s a strong lane bully, just like Leblanc, Talon, Zed etc. They can harass freely without any commitment. Kat scales real well though which is why she’s able to deal with them if the game drags out to that point if she hasn’t snowballed yet. Also the new Kat takes more skills mechanically but she’s still the same champ. You need reaction, timing, knowing when to hop in and hop out. People in high elo knew how to shut her down easily. She was easier to play but that was it. Only the less skilled players couldn’t handle her.

If you actually payed attention to the game instead of just not thinking and pressing buttons you would do better in laning phase.\n\nAatrox cant hit Q if you have more than half a brain as kat. Leblanc W and E can be dodged if you pay attention, they are not instant effects. Talon has 1 dodgeable ability. zed also has 1 dodgeable ability. Guess what they are all well too easy to predict and you have E and W which gives a little speed burst. Yes sometimes they will get you with a good shot but if you consistently get hit with that. you might just not be  a good kat player. hard to admit but its true. I rarely have trouble against them. Laning phase is not a problem for people who ACTUALLY TRY to actively dodge.... Problem is at level 10 you run through the jungle even with wards and u get oneshot from 1 dark spot...

You have no intelligence when it come's to a debate. You can't analyze and process what you're reading. I assume English isn't your first language so I won't get only on you for that. Never have I ever said Kat was bad once again. I just stated that the other assassins are stronger than her currently in every aspect in terms of trade, damage, and being safe. Ahri, Zed, Talon, LB etc have strong laning phases and can harass constantly. I'm a good Kat player. I've been playing her well consistently for 7 years. Way before you even probably picked up the game. When I said she feels the same to me, I wasn't stating that she was bad, I was stating that she still requires the same skills as she did previously. Reaction, timing, matchup knowledge etc is needed for Kat and I have all of that which is why I performed well with the old Kat and new. Boast all you want about being good with Kat nobody really cares. I know my champ and I never downplay her in the slightest. None of your arguments make sense in the slightest and you sound like a dumbass. \"Talon has 1 dodgeable ability, Zed has 1 dodgeable ability\" Talon's rake is unreactable with the speed it goes out on. The only way to avoid it is to play very safe. Same with Zed when he uses his W+E+Q combo and procs electrocute. It goes out very fast and he can harass from a distance. Only way to avoid it is to play back as well and lose minion gold or CS. Like I said once again because I have to repeat it since you're a dumbass. Kat struggles in laning phase against other assassins because they can out trade and play safe. After laning phase it's all skill level and that's where you dominate most players.

Talon is seeing ubiquitous play at all levels in all regions and is permanent ban/pick in pro play in all regions at the moment. The Rek and Elise data samples are skewed by the relatively few dedicated mains of those champs that still play them with success in niche situations and aren't seeing pro play even IN those niche situations.

If they balance only on highest elo and that alone, talon will just enter the Azir/Ryze group of champs. He isnt that over the top anywhere else, its legit just in D+.
