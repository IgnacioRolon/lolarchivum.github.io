The only OTHER solution is to put it on Blaze itself, but that is arguably too universal and could have other problems associated with it. Regardless my point still stands that as long as Brand's overall kit remains the same he isn't leaving bot lane.

It is entirely his passive, blaze, which is the issue, as we can see almost every thread that complains about brand doing to much damage, focusing on this specific aspect of brands kit, which was recently buffed to deal double the damage.

He can't do that at level 1, and seeing as how he has to LAND abilities, I don't see how that is for free. Each ability burns for 4% that can stack up to three times meaning he would have to hit three spells. A Brand is never going to start with their point and click ability, it is also one of the last things they level and if they just hard cast it first, they are heavily hampering their damage. They have to land their skillshot pillar, then skillshot sear before landing their point and click to actually and actively do the most damage possible.\n\n> Now of course, other champions have %hp damage, but they usually have it because it doesn&#x27;t scale, and it&#x27;s on a champion who doesn&#x27;t build damage. \n\nAatrox, Eve, Fiora, Jayce, Kog Maw, Mordekaiser, Pantheon, Shyvana, Urgot, Varus, Vayne, Vi, Warwick and Zed all have scaling damage AND build damage, and this is only the list of champions that build damage.\n\n> When it does scale, and to a very high degree like brand, it&#x27;s usually single target, not AoE, and probably has another condition, like being in melee range for Elises venomous bite, or having to build crit to maximise/get the full potential output of kindreds mounting dread.\n\nIndeed, and in turn, said champions such as Elise also have mobility and escapes, or utility to provide to the team like in the case of Kindred.\n\n> Take a look at this: (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Health) and scroll down to the list of &quot;Scaling from enemy health&quot;, and one thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it&#x27;s very rare for a champion to have %hp damage like brands passive. The only other abilities comparable to brands passive are Gnars &quot;Hyper&quot; passive and Kalistas &quot;Sentinal&quot; passive, both of which are in no way even close to the level or potential of damage from brands &quot;blaze&quot;, and have pretty reasonable constraints tied to them.\n\nAnd unlike them, Brand has no escapes, no mobility, and subpar amounts of utility compared the things they do have. You can't compare JUST passives, that isn't how champion balance works, you have to look at everything, HELL, that post you linked above was talking about that. If you break this game into just numbers you will see some really stupid things that don't make any sense at all until you compare more then just the numbers.\n\n>It is entirely his passive, blaze, which is the issue, as we can see almost every thread that complains about brand doing to much damage, focusing on this specific aspect of brands kit, which was recently buffed to deal double the damage. (2% max hp to 4% max hp)\n> \n> Brand is super viable early, and scales really well, while having great teamfighting ability: the buff to his innate passive, while it had good intentions, really makes for an unbalanced amount of damage.\n> \n> Am I here to suggest what happens once he receives a nerf? Clearly not. But I believe it&#x27;s pretty clear that he is in need of a nerf.\n\nNo, it isn't really clear, it isn't clear why a mage whose only thing is just damage, not team utility like Orianna or A Sol, a squishy mage without mobility, sustain, tankiness or escapes should lose the only niche he has. HELL, he still doesn't even see play mid STILL, and is still considered a bot laner.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-06-27T12:40:55.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mr Meat,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MAgijO9p,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-27T12:16:19.010+0000)\n>\n> 1. making something viable is not justification for it being unbalanced\n\nHis own viability didn't change, ADCs just got nerfed.\n\n\n> 3.

Yes, on a cut and dry comparison like that, yeah, he gets way too much damage, but there is more to consider then that. He is a great damage dealing teamfighter not just because of his passive, but because of just how much AoE damage he has, but loses SO many tools because of it that other champions do have.\n\n> 4.

Again that&#x27;s me not typing correctly. I&#x27;m meant to say: Now of course, other champions have &gt;max&lt; %hp damage, but they usually have it because it doesn&#x27;t scale, OR it&#x27;s on a champion who doesn&#x27;t build lots of damage.&quot;\n> Now of course there are exceptions to what I have stated: Fiora, Jayce, Urgot if you build him for damage, zed, vayne, Rhaast, Vi and aatrox. \n> But even then none of the base damages for the % max hp abilities are as high as brands base damage on his passive. Which is what I&#x27;m trying to point out here. It is a really high base damage ability, let alone a passive ability.\n\nBecause they have other tools in their kit to make it so that if they also had that amount of damage, it would be broken. Unlike Fiora, Brand gets no sustain and no mobility, unlike Jayce, he gets no mobility and has less range, unlike Urgot, he gets no protection and no mobility, the list goes on. Their damage is LESS because they instead have more elsewhere in their kit.\n\n> 7. Ok so im going to say this now, and im not going to repeat it. I think Brand should have a revert of his passive back to 2%, but I think he should have some work done to put him back into solo laning, whatever that may be. \n> I understand that &quot;Oh but damage is all he has!&quot; but that&#x27;s exactly the issue. He has too much of it, and too much of it in his passive instead of his other abilities, and he has too little of anything else. But _we can&#x27;t give him anything else before we give him a nerf, otherwise he&#x27;s just going to be crazy powerful_. So give him a nerf, **take away from his passive, and give back to the rest of his kit**, thus giving back his laning potential.\n\nThen say that, no one else in this post is saying that, people are just saying \"oh his damage is too high.\" without considering WHY his damage gets to be so high, what he is losing to have such high damage. I'm fine with his passive getting nerfed, but if they do, they HAVE to compensate him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teriyaki Bukkake","date":"2018-06-27T12:16:19.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. making something viable is not justification for it being unbalanced\n\n2.
