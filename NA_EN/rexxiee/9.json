Tanks will have a harder time against bruisers perhaps, but then that makes tanks less relevant for frontlining against an ADC and CC locking them. \n\nAssassin's aren't really affected much. The strongest auto attack assassins are kha'zix and rengar.. so that's buffing them when they're already doing well (too well) is just going to break them uncontrollable.. they're already on thin ice for nerfs (maybe not rengar, idk) and that would just make them get nerfed starting the cycle over again... or it would make no difference at all because kha'zix one shots through tabi as it is now and I'm pretty sure max stacked rengar can do the same. Maybe talon or nocturne will get an indirect buff back into the meta idk, but that doesn't solve the issue either. \n\nWhile yes I hate tabi ADCs, them not building it doesn't really make them weaker, tabi adcs are more of a crutch especially when playing vs. other ADCs, ironically, nerfing it would make ADCs even more snowbally and stronger because their only defensive item just disappears, assuming its nerfed enough for them not to take it ever. So if you thought coming back through bot lane was hard already, get ready.
