Last time i heard about him is when there was info about upcoming Fiora rework.\n\nAnd on the point of Ghostcrawler being the lead game designer. You know, i just randomly read a game design post of HOTS yesterday. They were talking about balance of supports in the current meta... And you know, i actually felt like they designing a game as a whole. I think i might try ranked hots one day, just because there seems to be people who actually look after a game as a whole? What we have been having since Ghostcrawler joined? Class updates? Rune update? Jungle updates? Haven't seen a single patch trying to balance game as a whole, and i think ghostcrawler just can't do it. He can't see game as a whole, he can just continue to rework small things step by step, constatly throwing game into trashier state. Yes, i think he might be good as designer, maybe chmpion designer or rune designer, but he just can't take big projects.","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-01-07T05:17:20.721+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"IIRC he's on R&D for a non league game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-01-07T09:23:37.219+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"You should try hots.

You simply make sure that rules that are in place and have been already setup to be balanced in order to keep the game FAIR are adhered to by both teams.  The horrible thing about games like baseball/softball is the ump's personal take on strike zones which is about as subjective as it gets...but at least that's all you have power over.  All the other rules are pretty much set in stone albeit the very uncommon ones that rarely influence games.\n\nIn relation, Ghostcrawler's 'strike zones' are MASSIVE for certain champs and MICROSCOPIC for others.  That is a blatant issue that hasn't been resolved for 3 seasons now and is GETTING WORSE.  The same thing happened in WoW where everyone ran this guy out because of how he used a magic 8-ball to balance the game rather than his skill as a designer/umpire whatever you want to call it.\n\nIt is bad when what Ghostcrawler would do WAS PREDICTED before he even had an impact on LoL.  Now, we are all paying for this mess:  Stale metas, turrets that can be dove under at levels 1-3.  Bot lane domination of teamfights.  The ridiculous snowballing.  Everyone has assassin burst.  The cry for surrenders because there is no thick skin in 80% of the player base. \nBasic UNFUN gameplay in normals/ranked.  Little to No tug of war aspect or challenge which is what MOBAs actually were orginally designed to be.

It used to be that tank supports had to pick their engages and/or fight through more than one cc rotation to win. Now we have a situation where Leona or Ali land one CC and their target vaporizes, or an enchanter gets one shield off and the adc kills the threat without kiting in seconds. The problems with supports are a manifestation of the volatile state of the game itself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-01-07T14:54:52.636+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Blitz being nerfed before {{champion:12}} {{champion:89}} ?\n\nWhat a joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D4M2X0","date":"2018-01-07T13:49:26.579+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"just cause youve qualified for a job doesnt mean ur fit for it and they are proving it. i laughed when i saw they added blitz at the end of the nerf list and not even mentioning leona/alistar. they aint at risk of losing their job nor does league have a game that competes with it thats why the balance team can do random shit.\n\nto qualify for the balance team you should actualy be an active league player and maining champs that arent disgusting by design, but apparently you dont have to play league to balance it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2018-01-07T20:05:40.242+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":">you dont need to play the game to design it\n\nWell show me an Airplane Design company where every employee is a pilot and then I _might_ consider this a valid argument.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2018-01-07T18:42:06.846+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I will comment that Ghostcrawler technically is correct.  You don't _need_ to play a game to design it.  You absolutely need to understand it however, and it quite often feels like the developers don't understand it.\n\nAs far as Meddler's opinion on Blitz, I would actually agree with that for the vast majority of the player base.  Keep in mind that 80% of players are not at  or above the level where Alistair and Leona are seen as a pick or ban every game.  Blitz has:\n\n* Insane pick ability against people who aren't good at dodging skillshots.\n* Reasonably high safety because he doesn't have to go in to make a pick.\n* Mediocre peel.\n* Mediocre survivability solo.\n\nIn contrast, Leona has:\n\n* Good pick ability against anyone.\n* Great peel.\n* Very good damage for a support focused tank.\n* Somewhat insane solo survivability.\n* Very high risk, as she pretty much has to go in to make a pick.\n\nAnd Alistair has:\n\n* Insane pick ability against people who are severely out of position.\n* Insane peel.\n* Built in healing.\n* Very good solo survivability.\n* Reasonably high risk because he has to put himself out of position to pick targets.\n\nIn short, Blitz is a low risk, high reward character at low tier play where people can't really dodge worth crap and don't do a very good job of focusing down specific targets, but ends up being a liability at high tier play where people are good at dodging and very much tend to focus specific targets (most notably the Blitz).  Such champs end up being a serious pain in the arse for most players, and quite often terrorize alternate game modes (Seriously, Blitz is a top priority ban on Legend of the Poro King at all tiers of play because it's hard as hell to dodge reliably on such a narrow map).\n\nIn contrast, Leona and Alistair are high risk, high reward characters at all tiers who both bring a lot of utility to a team.  Champs like that are really popular at top-tier play (See Lee Sin for another example), but generally aren't a significant issue for most players regardless of what level of play they are at (provided they aren't being played by smurfs).  They tend to be banned a lot in high-level play just as much to screw up one-trick ponies as they are to avoid having to deal with them.\n\nNote that I'm not saying Leona and Alistair aren't an issue right now (anything on the level of 100% pick/ban is an issue), just that 'fixing' Blitzcrank is going to make a lot more people happy than dealing with Leona or Alistar will.","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2018-01-07T22:17:44.532+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"The game should not be balanced around bad people.
