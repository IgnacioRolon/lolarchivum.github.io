She just has waay too much mobility to roam and to dodge skill shots to engage that just makes her quite impossible to deal with. \n\nGo in range, she uses e auto, if not dead, blind u with q and finish u with her next empowered auto. \n\nBut if she isnt in range to auto, she can easily dodge all spells and go into range to auto. It is not even an outplay since anybody can dodge it in that kind of ms. \n\nShe needs to have a weaker lategame.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2018-07-25T19:24:03.076+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's because of {{item:3147}} + {{item:3095}} \n\nThis shit is what's allowing her to kill anything she can use her E on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"princeblumpkin","date":"2018-07-25T16:03:44.654+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's unpopular, and unpopular champs are allowed to be OP as long as they do so while staying under the radar.
