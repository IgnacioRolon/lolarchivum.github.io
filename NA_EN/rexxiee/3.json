We lowered the disenchant rate on shards, and we're giving out more shards.\n\n\nI believe the OP refers to this from the quite you linked. Actually I also left with the impression we'd get more shards. I wouldn't argue if it is a god change or not, though maybe it would be a good idea to give us some sort of schedule on these events, when they will happen and the approximate value we would get from them.\n\nEdit: Brought the whole paragraph.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2017-12-05T21:00:54.417+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":54,"body":"Yeah it's true that you get skin shards from events like Overcharge now. But that's a lot different than what OP is saying. Here's what OP said:\n\n> So far i havent seen those \"more skin shards\" in boxes, 0 skin shards from leveling up too.\n\nI mean, help me out, guys. All of you know for a fact by now that we never said you'd get skin shards from leveling up. That's not what the system is for. And we also didn't change the rate that skin shards drop in boxes (we never said we would). You guys on the boards are some of the most engaged players who read everything we put out—I really need community members to call out stuff that's just straight up misinformation like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-12-05T21:20:02.433+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I mean, help me out, guys. All of you know for a fact by now that we never said you'd get skin shards from leveling up. That's not what the system is for.\n\nYes, his point probably was that the leveling up system does not contribute to it in any way, while it could have as it was coincidentally released with the changes, he listed it just so that someone doesn't go \"Maybe we'll get some OE from the leveling up evetually\". It's one short subsentence you focus too much on and call it disinformation, when he says he didn't get any skin shards from boxes either, which is much more crucial problem you ignore. That RNG that somehow gives ya'll hard-on. The fact someone may not mind your change because they get legendary from every box while someone else is fucked over because they got champ shard, again. And the fact champ shard can drop is still gambling problem with bought chests despite the bad luck protection.\n\nPeople would bitch less if there wasn't RNG in nearly every reward now. I got the minimum 810 BE from either majority or quite a lot of my leveling up capsules. It makes me ignore your statistics on how small chance that it and makes me just think the system sucks, since someone might've gotten even less essence than me or double the essence than me despite the fact we put in the same performance to level up. Boxes the same thing. Majority of my boxes this year, which were defo more than 10, had champ shards... So like... Thanks I guess but I don't understand why my S+ grade was worth less than someone else.\n\nThis creates the reason people hate the leveling capsules. Because some people don't want to wait out 30 level-ups to make sure majority of their capsules won't be the 810 BE and that big fancy maximum bumber is there just to pretend the system is more rewarding. And because some people don't have enough luck to grind 1000 legendaries to be able to redeem that one legendary. Seriously I think the ratio is currently cca 4 or 3 disenchanted legendaries to redeem one legendary. That's a lot of luck one needs to unlock something so all that one can do is that Skin Shards as nice decorations in inventory and ignore them due to the new OE ratio.\n\nThis entire season seems like I will have to quite ignore the honor system, the level-up system, the lootbox system and the mastery system because neither gives guarantee of reward for the performance given good enough for me to care. If that protects your revenue okay, but now when I get skin shard I know it's very likely going to eat dust in inventory, when I get capsule I am ready for another measly 810 BE, when I get Mastery token I know it's waste to redeem it when I get Honor Capsule it's going to shit out some low-value shard and 30th key for me.\n\nThe skin shards thing may yet to change based on how bad luck protection will work for me when the lootbox-per-season resets, in case Overcharge wasn't example of the \"more OE from events\" maybe I'll grind some from future events over year, but the rest makes me feel very... uninterested. With honor I don't care much, the system is kinda broken, I am not honorful enough for that high tier and one should not be honorful for rewards, but the Mastery prices, which are staying the same for way too long and the frequency of the minimum value capsules hurts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2017-12-06T01:19:17.310+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Cactopus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5vUJflhE,comment-id=001e00040000,timestamp=2017-12-05T21:00:54.417+0000)\n>\n You guys on the boards are some of the most engaged players who read everything we put out—I really need community members to call out stuff that&#x27;s just straight up misinformation like this.\n\nMEANWHILE in another topic riot is saying the boards aren't worth reading because we only just bitch and we're  too full of salt\n\nXD","replies":[{"poster":"The Great Divide","date":"2017-12-06T08:20:41.539+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot Cactopus is just digging holes in a bunch of places.
