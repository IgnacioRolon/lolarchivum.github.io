Like Riot stated (and probably everybody knows), stealth is a pretty strong mechanic in SoloQ and his ult gives him a frame in which he can be a great AoE teamfighter just like Jinx.

Like, if we look at the differences between Ezreal last season in regards to items and damage, frankly, very little has changed. +9ish base damage and +5 base damage to his E at all ranks, that’s it.\n\nWhen asked to look at this from a balance perspective, I personally try to look at as many angles as possible. Like, how much has changed on the champ themselves? What has changed in the system itself? Do they have new ratios or utility in their kit? What about item changes? Are there new items that simply benefit this champ more than others? Are there other similar case studies? Is it a new play style that people simply need more time to learn to play against (I.E. Jungle Ezreal)?\n\nOR\n\nIs it changing the way that champion played in an unhealthy way over the long term? Has this problem still persisted despite adjusting other problem areas (I.E.
