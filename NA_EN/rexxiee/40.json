However, there is one thing that is an issue, which I think needs fixing in general. Bounty gold. I played this int strat. Enemy Jayce was on a 15 kill streak (from me) but I had pushed all the way down top lane to inhib turret. Thing is, despite the gold increasing slightly after X CS (not sure what the exact numbers are), he was essentially earning a cannon minion from me each time while racking up the kills.\n\nThen come midgame, he gets caught out by our roaming 4 man squad. Yasuo instantly became rich and carried the game. Despite the obscene kill numbers that Jayce had, it was mostly worthless while our Yasuo had about 4 solid kills and some assists, which is probably only slightly behind the Jayce's (if you consider how much I was worth that time). Give that shutdown gold, and suddenly Yas became ahead of that Jayce. It happened twice, and the Jayce ended the game with nearly 30 kills with 23 of them being from me. Spoiler Alert: we won BECAUSE of the Yas carry.\n\nThat said, this strat only worked for me because we had a carry who wasn't behind. If you feed your top laner, and your other lanes are also not doing too well, they won't be able to deal with that +3 level/+2 item raid boss that will be coming after them after he's done with you. I don't think it's a broken strategy overall, because it has its win conditions that have to be fulfilled before it can be relied on as a strat.","replies":[{"poster":"sinZsoul","date":"2018-10-07T16:19:57.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add there's champs that have good enough waveclear/dueling to prevent sion from doing this. On the dueling champs rush a tiamat and repeatedly clear the minions and he won't be able to shove near as fast. \n\nThis is not to say your concerns are invalid, but the more people counter him the more he'll lose and the less people play him and he becomes a lot less of a problem. I think honestly the bigger issue with Sion is more that he's overtuned compared to other tops.","replies":[]}]}]}
