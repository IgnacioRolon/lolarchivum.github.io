Despite what people say, supports right now might be the strongest and most impactful role. It&#x27;s just that their power is always hidden since it shows in the carries of a game and not the supports themselves.\n\nTwitch has been over powered for a while, and has been better than Caitlyn even before her first set of nerfs. Although Riot prioritizes nerfs on popularity for either the pro scene or non-pro scene. Less popular dominant champions aren't really nerfed as often even when they deserve to be.\n\nIf you compare Twitch and Caitlyn's stats you'll see Twitch is better in every way, he's simply picked less often.

And once those are out of the way, Twitch will be the top ADC, with no one to keep him down in the laning phase. So then he will certainly need nerfs too.\n\nBut eh, if all that happens, then someone else (probably MF, Tristana, and Kog'Maw) will just take their place. And relative to other points in recent League history, the current ADC balance is actually pretty decent. Cait, Draven, and Twitch may be clear front runners, but 10 bans makes them managable, and below them there are like 10 other viable ADCs. The only truly unviable ADCs are Corki and Ezreal (and people still play plenty of Ezreal).\n\nSo overall, I think I can wait for ADC nerfs.
