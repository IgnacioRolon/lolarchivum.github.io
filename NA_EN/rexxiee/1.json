Just by posting here, you've put an official stamp next to the thread that everyone on the front page of Gameplay will see, which will cause players to come here thinking that some Riot answer was given on the state of laning in top lane (this is, at any rate, what made me take a look here). It is disappointing to see a red response on the Gameplay Boards that doesn't say anything about the game or Riot's plans, but the fact that this response only tries to slap some random player on the wrist for poor typing form adds insult to injury.\n\nI don't want this to come across as trying to discourage you from posting on the Boards, because I don't want that, but I do feel Gameplay should be a place for solid, gameplay-related discussion, and other sub-Boards exists for other topics (e.g. M&G or GD for non-serious discussion, Discuss the Boards/Player Behavior for player or Boards problems).

It isn't hard to ping when your Lane opponent places a ward and your jungler can come by 1min15sec later guaranteed to be unseen.\n\nRed side top Lane has two distinct gank paths, River and tribush. You can only ward one. It isn't that hard for the faster jungler to walk around Rift Herald and come from that side, especially if your Lane opponent pings that you deep warded River.\n\nTower dives DO happen at levels 2-3. They may not be often, but they do happen. It's as OP pointed out, the tower dive can happen if he sits back and lets his opponent push in a big wave. Normally it's the Lane bully pushing in that wave, and the Lane bully isn't typically tanky enough to do an early dive. If you're a high damage Lane bully without lots of tankiness getting pushed in by a tank because you're respecting the obvious enemy jungle gank, you're ready to be dove by a maokai or Sion etc... \n\nAnd as you specifically referred to Eedat's comment: I don't believe there's any inconsistency in what top Lane wants. The claim that 50% want a 1 on 1 Island while 50% want more interactivity with the team is simply false. 100% of people who play champions that have a decent Laning phase want the opportunity to win 1v1 before the jungler can decide the Lane. The ask has never been to have an island all game, it's to have 5 minutes or so to actually establish a lead before the jungler can camp you and make getting a lead impossible. If you're a Lane bully and can't get a lead by 5 min after minions spawned you probably didn't play great. If you're a Lane bully and didn't get a lead by 2:30 (the second wave of minions arrived in Lane) your opponent just didn't int. So obviously the people that play champions with weak Lane and strong scaling like it, that's no different than saying some people like yasuo buffs (people that would play yasuo) and some people don't (pretty much everyone else). \n\nMost top Lane players want agency and interactivity, but they also want an opportunity to actually showcase individual skill. Jungle has had too much threat to allow top Lane to have any agency whatsoever for more than a full season now. If junglers came on board a few minutes later, top Lane would get that full benefit of time to start getting a lead and transition it to the map. The lack of map presence isn't contradictory to wanting 1v1 early, it's actually complimentary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Huang Shaotian","date":"2018-02-28T09:35:10.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going to have disagree pretty hard here.
