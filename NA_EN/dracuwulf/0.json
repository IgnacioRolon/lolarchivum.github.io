If you're playing a melee yourself you need to be able to trade with her and outsustain her in the lane.  Dorans Shield with a Dorans blade into a sunfire (if tank) or your main offensive item should give you the early game strength to fight her.\n\nOne common mistake people make is rushing Tier 2 boots to \"avoid\" her.  By doing this you've effectively spent 1,000g (or more) for minimal gains in a prolonged fight.  Tabi only give 25 armor and a 10% reduction on her auto-attack damage.  For 1,000g you could have a Chain Vest (40 armor - 750 g) and be 250g closer to your offensive core.\n\nBoots are best purchased when you need to start roaming, the lane needs the mobility (skill shots) or you've finished your initial core.  They're also great if you have a significant lead, since they let you keep it easier by avoiding ganks or chasing down your lane opponent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-03-19T15:45:26.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anytime she is Q'ing towards you go into a 90 degree as she'll want to continue the forward motion, use the minion wave to cause minion collision, and continue circling around her.  If she pops her Ult, wait till her third hop then Flash behind her.  That way you'll nullify the bulk of her damage.  \n\nThat's how I counter her as melee, as ranged, she should never be ahead enough to be able to sufficiently aggro, Liss, Vayne, Quinn top lanes have enough disengages that you just avoid the combo and then burn her down.","replies":[{"poster":"Ser Garland","date":"2015-03-19T15:50:25.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Did you...

The real trick to Riven is to not let her snowball.  Just try to safely CS and let her push you. This is so she has less room to maneuver between the minions and your tower and will be open to ganks from your jungler/mid.\n\nRiven requires a snowball to remain relevant once past 30 mins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-03-19T16:29:04.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven will all-in you early and often because she can and that's how 90% of her playerbase plays her.  Keep at a range so she has to use at least one or two of her dashes to get to you and doing so puts her far behind you minion line.  There are very few champs who can beat her in a 1v1 fight early, so don't try unless you're someone like {{champion:122}} , {{champion:86}}  or maybe {{champion:80}}  or {{champion:58}} .  \n\nHer sustain is terribad early on, though that will change as her first item is almost ALWAYS lifesteal.  Despite this, poking Riven and avoiding her all-ins can be very effective.  She'll have to get into the minions to lifesteal up, putting her close enough to poke more.   One she's low, she probably will have to bail lane... or at the very least she won't risk an all-in.  You're playing to beat Riven in the game, not the lane.  Just keeping a decent CS score and not dying to her will do that.  \n\nJust remember that Riven is the queen of mashing her face on the keyboard to turn around a fight at low health.  Her combo + execute is devastating so assume that unless proven otherwise, Riven CAN kill you if you dive on her.  Riven badly punishes the yolotards of the world who want to fight all the time and play too aggressively.  (Also her player is very likely one of these people as well)  You don't need to get 5 kills on Riven in lane to beat her in lane.  You just have to keep her from snowballing so she dies easily if she tries to enter teamfights.  One mid to late game rolls around an unfed Riven will struggle to hurt anyone but squishies, and her dashes shouldn't be enough to reach said squishies if they're positioned well and your team has wards covering flanks.  \n\nPlenty of champs can handle her in lane.  You didn't ask, but here's my suggestions for that.\n\n{{champion:122}}  and {{champion:86}}  can usually just handle her in lane.  They do respectable damage while building tanky and will likely survive her trades.  She's more mobile than both though, so don't assume picking them is an auto win.  You still need to be smarter than her.\n\n{{champion:80}}  is my go-to anti-Riven pick.  But he's my main top so I got a bit of bias.  If she roams mid you can ult to follow her easily.  In lane, you harass her with spears and avoid any attempts she makes to all-in until she's at at least half her health or lower.  Then you can probably W, Q, E, Ignite, Q her if she gets too close or cocky.  Just watch out for the execute on her ult.  If you're ever BOTH low on health, assume she's won and bail.  Only pick fights with her when you have a lot more health than she does.  Only try this match up if you're comfortable with Panth, since it's risky, and you have to build pretty heavy damage yourself to keep up with her, leaving you very vulnerable if you position poorly or she catches you with her full combo.\n\n{{champion:57}}  can just sit in lane all week tossing saplings at her and being a big, fat roadblock.  You probably won't kill her but she'll likely not kill you either.  If you can bait her into going aggressive while your jungler is near you might be able to set her behind, but beware her roaming to kill your midlaner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScreamPaste","date":"2015-03-19T16:07:14.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really not all that hard, though how you deal with her varies depending on which champion you're playing. General tips are:\n\nBait her abilities. She has to waste her Q to close the gap on you, if you avoid it she's a sitting duck. Beat her up.\n\nRush a sunfire cap, nothing makes Riven sadder early game than a sunfire cap. It immediately means she can't kill you ever again until she gets her last whisper, or even win trades because of AoE magic damage.\n\nIf you have poke, poke her at level 1 to find out if she started shield or Q. If she started shield she's harmless, poke her as much as possible, as counter intuitive as that is. If she started Q, poke her whenever she wastes one or goes for a CS, making sure you can stay back.\n\nIf you're melee, stand in your own minion wave, her Q does base damage of 10, lol, so she has to use her passive to trade, which aggroes minions. You immediately win if you remember to trade back on her, if you have minion help. Especially if you manage to juke her third Q, which isn't hard since she locks in the direction she was facing if you mash the button, which most people do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Kaozi","date":"2015-03-19T15:34:51.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to keep track of which q she is on since the last one knocks up.
