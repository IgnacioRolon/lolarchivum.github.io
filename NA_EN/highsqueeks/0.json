I placed in soloq in bronze 1, played 41 games (24-17) and have been sitting in silver 4.  No problem right?\r\n\r\nWell once I reached silver 4 (s3 last year) I decided to play some flexq, figuring the path to silver would be just as easy.\r\n\r\nI placed in flexq in bronze 2, I have played 124 games (mostly mid/top/jng) and am now 53-71, nearly falling into bronze 4.  I have honestly not changed my macro or micro game, have not flamed teammates, picked team oriented champs, not trolled, forced objectives etc etc.\r\n\r\nProof:  https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=HIGHSQUEEKS\r\n\r\nNow &hellip;this is not a complaint thread or a request for tips thread--- but a factual observation that I am making from my experiences:\r\n1.\t Playing as a solo player in flex queue is like beating your head against the wall because unless you are playing hard carry champs or are tiers above your competition, it is not easy to overcome a premade team who cannot spell objective or teamwork.\r\n2.\tPlaying a strategy of CS / gold / winning your lane is often irrelevant in bronze if your premade bottom lane is 0/12/1 after the first 15 minutes.  Game over.\r\n3.\tI have yet to see a support Lux that was good.  Or build a sightstone. I cringe when I see the support hover Lux.\r\n4.\tI witnessed a plat border EZ die 19 times in a bronze 3 game.\r\n5.\tPlayed with a Veigar main that builds tear every game, and consistently died 15+ times a game.\r\n6.\tMy teammates often do the exact opposite that I expect them to (push objectives, fight as 5, split push,  etc)\r\n7.\t I sometimes see duos and trios that have combined KDAs for all champions below 1.0 for the entire season.\r\n8.\t2 Games that I played yesterday :  I did more damage to champions than my entire team combined (of course 2 losses), how is this even possible!\r\n\r\nI am not looking for tips or to be told how to improve.. I admit that I am now having some fun with this (playing different champs, different roles), while still trying to win.  This has become the challenge of all challenges, the solo flex challenge.  My hopes are so low for my teammates that if I actually get a good premade it is like a blessing from the RITO god that I will cherish for a few minutes&hellip; until I queue up for the next game of premade potatoes.  \r\n \r\nI will get to flexq silver 5 before I am done, or not.. maybe I should just play soloq again (go for gold) and cut my losses/ save my hair.  \r\n\r\nEither way, RITO &ndash; your FLEXQ solo player experience is really annoying, requires a good sense of humor, lots of patience, and is terribly unbalanced.  The best premade wins frequently.  The solo player(s) are stuck with this harsh reality, and I wonder why any solo player in low ELO who cares about winning would subject themselves to this punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2017-02-13T21:00:00.185+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to think that solo players had to experience this literally all of last year : ^ ) \n\nAlso I have had the same experience, the only reason I started climbing in flex is for I started playing with some buddies who are pretty good at the game, so we simply pub stomp all the shitters.\n\nFlex Q is always a pub stomp, you either get stomped for you made the horrid mistake to solo, or you do the stomping for you invited your most talented friends, and decided to play \"lets fuck up the bronzies in all lanes\" \n\n(ex gold who was hitting plat mmr last year, friends with people around that skill range) \n\nBut yeah, Flex Q is much better today, since we have a choice if we want to take part in it or not, but fact was Riot made us endure it for a whole year and pretended nothing was wrong with it. Which is quite frankly sickening.","replies":[{"poster":"NiuLogic","date":"2017-02-13T21:11:22.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah flex Q made a really big improvment to play with rankeds with friends\n\nSolo Q feels still like : if you already play a lane pls know what you have to do in your lane . \n\nfor example Fb on top lane at lvl 4  i mean cmon top laner if you are already in gold why do you dont even know that around lvl 4 you get ganked the most time ?","replies":[{"poster":"HIGHSQUEEKS","date":"2017-02-13T23:08:56.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have lots of friends its a blast..  drink some beers play some stupid shit and laugh your ass off.","replies":[{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2017-02-14T07:06:15.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

So far it looks like that's holding true.\n\nJust won those promos, resulting in skipping Gold 2 all together and going straight to Gold 1 Flex. It's to the point where I'm being challenged enough that I'm very aware of my shortcomings at the game and can see what I actually need to work on, which is a good place to be for improving. \n\nDon't know if I'll keep pushing in Flex to see how high I can climb or if I'll try to raise my Solo Queue to the same point. So far I haven't been impressed with Solo Queue, nor do I have as much fun with it, but I want all the rewards I can get for end of season...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"swanny1","date":"2017-02-14T04:15:03.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear you half the time in low elo's u get a afk or someome who goes 0/7/0 before their lv 6, how do u rank up when this is what ur stuck with  everygame","replies":[]},{"poster":"SNSD Sunnny","date":"2017-02-13T21:11:02.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk i soloed a decent amount of games in flex and it seems fine.\n\nThe only thing is that you MUST have a good jungler otherwise you instantly lose, which is why i duo with somebody who can jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"HIGHSQUEEKS","date":"2017-02-13T23:05:57.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well sometimes but if all lanes feed before your first clear good luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NiuLogic","date":"2017-02-13T21:13:19.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good jungler doesnt make the game   i have already seen enought good and bad jungler who made this and those mistakes like objectives even when you call out for them \n\nIf THE Team Refuses to HELP you on important objectives then you cant win the game anyways","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2017-02-13T21:11:39.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only SoloQ and this is my experience as well but also in non-Flex.\n\nFor every game I get a team that has a brain I get 3-4 games of total shight","replies":[{"poster":"HIGHSQUEEKS","date":"2017-02-13T23:05:22.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its much worse, the brains are few and far between in low bronze flex.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Swarmer","date":"2017-02-13T21:15:19.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In flex q the matchmaking is terrible.
