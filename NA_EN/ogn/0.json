After my game that gave me enough IP I went to the store to buy her, which was working before I joined a game. I click on store, yet it doesn't pop up. I've looked at other complaints about store, yet none look like they've experienced mine. There is a gray tint to it though, so I'm not sure what it is. Any help would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Exedora","date":"2016-12-01T12:24:29.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me yesterday, and today it was working but now i have the \"Not enough IP\" bug.
