Why has there been so many more crashes for NO apparent reason as of late? More importantly, WHY DURING CHAMP SELECT. I have lost so much LP{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}  because of 'dodging', when the client has crashed. This happens no matter what state my overly-competant computer is doing.\r\n\r\nI know we are getting a new client, but PLEASE INITIATE A RECONNECT BUTTON FOR CHAMP SELECT. It literally takes seconds to restart the client, but without a \"reconnect\" (you know, like the one in-game) you get a loss, at the hands of Riot software. Fair right?\r\n\r\nAtleast SOME thought from Riot staff on the topic would be appreciated. I know you cant remove LP loss for dodges, people would abuse it, but atleast have a reconnect for those legitimately try-harding it. Really rewarding to support and fill (same thing right?) to have the client crash.{{champion:89}} {{champion:201}}  {{champion:40}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-16T00:15:33.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This certainly sounds frustrating, and I'd like to help!  Issues like this in champion select are most commonly caused by third party programs.  If you have any running at all like play.tv or replays, remove them all.  If the issue continues, let me know if you are getting any error messages and what they say.  I'll be around!","replies":[]}]}
