Back to the ideas in my head, I remember seeing Ekko on skates which I really liked and thought would fit well on a skin for him. The aim being toward a jet set radio feel in my head something urban/Rebellious youth like. Especially because Ekko&#039;s mobile/speedy assassin feel could really work well with skates concept and visual wise.  Ideas are always welcomed Is till need to flesh out a design but it&#039;s just a idea. I feel Ekko could use a skin that actually drives people to use it academy and sandstorm don&#039;t really poke out well. {{champion:245}} Hope this baits @KateyLKhaos.\n\n\nArcade and Project are concepts I feel would work well with him as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-04-07T16:59:30.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jetset, or possibly cyberpunk could work well for a skin on Ekko. he does need a detailed/high price skin, and i feel something like that could work for him!","replies":[{"poster":"Jaéji","date":"2016-04-07T17:03:06.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sarutobi,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=dGOOJ644,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-07T16:59:30.071+0000)\n>\n> Jetset, or possibly cyberpunk could work well for a skin on Ekko. he does need a detailed/high price skin, and i feel something like that could work for him!\n\nI'm glad you agree with me, Always good to see people with the same views!","replies":[{"poster":"MeilinII","date":"2016-04-27T22:25:32.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jet set radio is so Ekko I can't believe I never thought of it.

Though if you'd like to give it a try you could probably make it a spray can of some sort? and his sword could be a bat maybe? But yeah I still think you could get away with just changing them slightly if not at all. the pros would out weight the cons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cinomenapplebae","date":"2016-04-27T22:25:46.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=dGOOJ644,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-04-27T22:04:07.917+0000)\n>\n> *(I had to look up Jet Set radio because I forgot this was a thing.)*\n> \n> Looking at the characters, I think he&#x27;s got some sweet similarities to Beat.

Dance could be either the same or change to fit the theme. and his W could be the same. as mentioned his walking and passive moved to skating motions. And yeah I like the bat concept or maybe a paintbrush or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jaéji","date":"2016-04-08T16:44:52.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@KateyKhaos I also wanted to ask if you had any personal themes you think would look good on Ekko, Just to open my mind up to the possibility of what could work with him.  {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaéji","date":"2016-04-07T16:56:51.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://maxwellrandomly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Jet_Set_Radio_Future.jpg\n\nJet set is also one of my favorite games and I feel it could fit so well with him.","replies":[]}]}
