I tried reinstalling it, except it wouldn't install at all since to finish the installation it opens the patcher kernal and that still crashed immediately. My computer runs windows 10 and has the necessary specs to run league (can play overwatch witch is much more intensive) so I'm not sure what is causing the problem. Tried installing on both my C and D drives, was wondering if there was any info known on an issue such as this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T22:22:07.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kernel error can be caused by security settings preventing th patcher from opening.  You'll want to use the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to get this fixed up and get in game.
