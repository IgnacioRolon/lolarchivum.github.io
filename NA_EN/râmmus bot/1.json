However we were being so badly destroyed i didnt believe they were bots. so i took a screen shot of the message and proof that their names were bots. http://imgur.com/UyUvBBX (i couldnt get all of their things in the screen shot but our team consisted of, vlad galio, jhin, vel, and talon. Their team was malphite, karma, warwick, pantheon and Ziggs. \n\nAfter losing horribly after game their names changed to actual names and they started talking in end game chat \nhttp://imgur.com/Pk6hxro\n\nUPDATE: After looking up karma and malphites profiles they dont even show as having played that game. And karmas showed she hasnt played since 2016. WW and Pantheon have played games together and have a actual profile\n\nUPDATE: Ziggs is a ranked feeder who goes 1/10 in every ranked game. I can provide a username if asked by a riot member\n\nUpdate: it looks like its riot aprils fool joke but even so ziggs is a ranked feeder, karma and malphite dont have real profiles.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-01T20:45:14.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, rito may have done too good of a job with advanced bots if they're actually coming up with their own names.  The mode is still in testing, so we'll have to go back and rein things in with this sentient business.  Thanks for testing Advanced Bots out!","replies":[{"poster":"Râmmus Bot","date":"2017-04-04T19:32:04.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you missed the part where i said i found a big ranked feeder.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-04T20:02:54.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes players just have a bad game or they may have just been enjoying the advanced bot modes, but I'm sorry if they caused you a negative experience.  :/  If you feel that someone was intentionally trying to feed or grief your game, make sure to use the reporting tool after the game.  The [Instant Feedback System ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-)works towards thwarting that behavior.

I dont think you understand where im coming from. I checked one of our players profiles. All across his board he is 1/10 in ranked. He is a int feeder. Not just a bad game. He literally has all losses except a few wins (still going 0 and 15)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
