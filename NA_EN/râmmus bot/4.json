I made a post about this awhile ago and got no responses to it. And no its not a issue with my computer or internet. Im on a fresh copy of windows (yes this was happening before i reinstalled windows) and its definitly not a issue with my connection because im in voice calls and using the internet just like normal when this happens.\n\nedit: its not just me either. It happens to my friends too.\nedit 2: btw my record was 6 bug splats and 14 disconnected errors on attempting to reconnect in just one game.\n\nr9 380\ni-5 4460\n8GB ram\n100 download\n10 up","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-27T22:25:05.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though you were still in a voice call and your internet was working fine, it doesn't rule out the possibility that your network simply couldn't get a strong connection to our game servers for some reason. \n\nYou may just need to update some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure all the correct ports are open, but also be sure to go through the rest of the steps to cover all your bases.
