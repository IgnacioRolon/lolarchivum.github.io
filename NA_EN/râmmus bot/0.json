If i'm correctly reading how tokens are earned i should have gotten one. I'm working towards mastery 7 so S- wont get me one but S will. I also do not understand the  \"champ mastery-enabled queue\" means. There is nothing saying twisted tree line won't give tokens. In fact it seems to be the same as summoners rift. Or is there only a chance of getting a token when you get S or S+? If so that is extremely silly.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-12T17:01:34.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zombiemaster has provided some helpful information here.
