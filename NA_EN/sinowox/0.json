Second game i understand mostly because i have gotten tilted midway through when the heca started blaming me for losing the game, i won lane perfectly fine, got towers and roamed, i was low then when they were taking baron and didnt help and thats when he started flaming me aswell, and to be quite frank, if anything, i didnt ruin his league experience, he ruined mine, i honestly have to admit that its hard to ban all people who do wrong, but my fucking lord have i had so many people who shouldve gotten a fucking ban, you know, i reported an ahri like a few days ago for hard inting and then afking, she literally ran it down after 30 seconds into the game, no one flamed her/did anything, she just ran it down, tpd mid, flashed and then continously fed the enemy, on top, mid, bot and then after going 0/6 she went afk, but hey let me guess, she only got a SLIGHT suspension for going afk amirite, shit system.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-15T11:51:50.007+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're not toxic, but you're very negative.
