Let's take Marauder Ashe for example - this skin was always intended to be part of the 750 RP tier. As such, they specifically chose a thematic they felt did not require particle changes so as to better fit this skin into the scope for which it's intended. With that in mind, when a host of people come back and demand new particles, the skins team can't do much with that kind of feedback besides say \"sorry, but that's not really the goal of this particular skin\". The next response predictably comes as \"well then make it a 975 RP skin\". Again, this isn't helpful because they designed it specifically as a cheaper skin for players who want to spend less. Thus, we're left with a situation where it looks like Riot isn't listening, but it's largely because the feedback they're getting isn't constructive or aimed at producing the best possible skin within the scope of the project.\n\n\nBy contrast, the Lunar Wraith Morgana skin was universally panned as being overpriced. Riot took this info, re-evaluated the skin and the scope they intended for the project, and determined that it had not be allocated enough resources to be worthy of the 1350 RP (i'm assuming here). So they reduced it to better fit with player expectations. That is a pretty clear example of Riot taking _actionable feedback_ and making a necessary change.__ They did a similar thing with Debonair Galio, where they took him back into the shop and gave him another couple of passes (personally I thought he needed more work, but the point still stands). \n\n\nPlaces where Riot could be better would be in areas where certain more simple cosmetic changes could improve a skin without widening its scope. For example - a lot of people felt that PROJECT: Leona needed a little more color on her outfit. I saw a post on the boards about improving the colors on the new Frozen Shen model. Stuff like this are things that they could probably get a bit better about at least exploring.\n\nSimply saying \"this skins is a mess\" doesn't really give them much to work with. Likewise, \"re-do it completely\" isn't feedback that is likely to improve the model much. The best way to get Riot to respond to criticism and feedback more is to give more specific feedback that falls within the stated scope goals for the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-19T18:47:19.707+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya GwingMaster - \n\nThanks for taking the time to share your thoughts on this. \n\n> To be fair to Katey and the skins team, a lot of the feedback they get isn't really actionable feedback. \n\nWhile not all feedback is actionable, like changing Marauder Ashe's particles, the feedback is used as a learning experience. For example, players really weren't a fan of Queen of Diamonds Syndra because her particles didn't change. We took that feedback and re-evaluated how we were doing 750s - which champions worked because of base particles, and which skins we should move to a 975 RP tier to give them particles to make a better skin overall. We also began doing Quality of Life (QoL) particle changes for some champions (Prehistoric Cho'Gath, Warden Nautilus), which kept the skin at 750 RP, but were minor changes we could accommodate to make the skin feel better.\n\n> By contrast, the Lunar Wraith Morgana skin was universally panned as being overpriced.

It has a fully animated visor, a unique ultimate particle and not just a recolor, also her traps look like they took a lot more work to make compared to these traps on LWC. Lunar Wraith Caitlyn has no animated hair, yet the pin on her hair is animated which gives me the feeling you guys had to cut half way through her production (why would you animate her pin thingy but not her hair?) No unique voice filter (you saw how cool she feels in her recall with a changed voice) and the potential of a great snake cog for her ultimate (bullet looks really nice tho).\n\nI'm just bummed as Cait is my favourite champ and I feel like if her textures were as bad as Morg and people complained, she too would of gotten better particles and a texture to match her loading splash as well as a price reduction. Kind of embarrassing comparing Radiant Wukong to Lunar Wraith Caitlyn. Oh she also shares her splash art with Morg!!\n\nSorry if I sound rude, but Caitlyn is my most played champion, I really wanted a dark skin for her and I loved the idea of this theme. But it just feels like she got near no love compared to Morg and Wukong and by the time Caitlyn gets another skin is going to be a long time. Not to mention a dark theme, one that gives a different feel to her.\n\nAlso the fact that you guys changed the ways sale works makes all of this worse. I wouldn't of cared if she got released last year  as she would have been discounted to 975 for a day or two, I would wait for a 50% discount but I guess since she is a Legacy skin I'll have to purchase her in a bundle?

That said, we took this as a learning experience and re-evaluated the champions we selected in terms of 750 RP skins that wouldn't receive new particles. We also decided upon Quality of Life particles in some situations - Warden Nautilus' shield, for example, where we could keep the skin at a 750 RP price, but also match the models a bit better. Wild Card Shaco was another good example of this, as we changed his Shivs, Hallucinate model and Jack in the Box, as they were all models. \n\n> It just feels like a question you are posing without any sincerity considering the PBE's track record for making changes or holding skins to make changes.\n\nWhile I can't speak for all teams, I can speak on behalf of skins.\n\nWe grab all the feedback from PBE, live boards, Reddit, etc. and compile it into an email that's sent to the team working on that particular skin.

Now, is Lunar Wraith Morgana on par with those skins can this skin kinda stand its ground compared to those? The answer is: defenetly not. Can she stand as a 975 RP skin? I can see that happening  but personaly, hardly. Ghost Bride knocks Lunar Wraith out of the park and keep in mind that Ghost Bride costs 975 RP, and that you guys were gonna price Lunar Wraith at 1350, when its easy too see the diferences in the skins, such as theme, model, effects changes, colors... The colors of Lunar aren't apealing and she needs more shine and polish, i don't know if you got what i meant by that but still. Adding a litle more effects. In my opinion, if there was a price tag between 750 and 975 RP, Lunar Wraith Morgana would fit in that category perfectly, there are some 750 skins that I consier better such as Sea Hunter Aatrox, Cutthroat Graves and Academy Ekko. They may have taken less work to produce but the final product is better than the current Lunar Wraith Morgana.

Particularly between 975 skins and 1350 skins, since it's only the older 1820 skins that have the value problems and ultimate skins don't really have a problem, except for the Ezreal skin that looks rather dated. The skins that are 750 and below are only model modification worthy skins, anything above that is just extra value for money.\n\nBut getting on topic, 975 skins should have recoloured VFX **as a bare minimum** across their abilities. Morgana's abilities were all recolours apart from her Q, which isn't worthy of a 1350 price mark. Since 1350 skins need to have more than just recolours across all their abilities. Not only that, her only new animation was her recall and she had no modifications to her voice. Overall, it felt like a 975 skin with a  fancier Q.\n\nOverall, I think in the future, the line between 975 skins and 1350 skins should have a much more distinct difference. So based on that, the new Morgana skin was naturally going to repel people away from it's price.\n\nBut what I would personally like to see more of, are more updated splash arts across some of the older skins, since they're not necessarily \"bad\", the splash art just doesn't represent it well enough. Lollipoppy for me is a classic example of this, because if the splash art for that wasn't touched, nobody would of even picked up the skin upon her updated release. It's like a fashion magazine in a way: Nobody is going to be interested in an outfit that's poorly put together or presented in a bad way. Just like how a skin isn't going to be bought if it isn't put together properly or if it's presented in a bad way.\n\nI understand that this is probably in the works already. But I would much rather see an array of updated splash arts with one new skin, than an array of different skins that I might cause the same problem which Morgana had/has. I think if it's done like this, then skins in future production will have a much clearer way of understanding the price brackets, whilst also being fair. Presenting the skins that might have been forgotten for a while might do better when their splash art is updated, because I know for certain that people are put off from purchasing something if it's not presented right.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-19T19:29:52.890+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jakra, \n\nWe purposefully don't have a list of rules for tiers because each champion needs to be taken as a case by case basis. \n\nFor example, I'd mentioned in other posts in this thread that we have what we call Quality of Life particles changes (QoL), and that's something we'll change but still keep a skin a 750 RP - Wild Card Shaco, Warden Nautilus to name a few. \n\nIn other cases, a skin does need new particles, and that's where we'd move into a 975 RP territory.

Of course, we can't accommodate all changes, but it's awesome when players bring up cool things like adding a jade dragon tattoo to Firecracker Jinx and we can totally do it! \n\nIt's cool to hear you haven't lost faith.

Look at the victorious skin for her, those particles are wonderful. But the skin itself looks worse because they have to apply it to the outdated rig of Morgana; whose dress looks like a tent. So I reason that skins that don't have new animations won't look as good on her as newer champs.\n\nI mean, look at Udyr. The SG skin looks fantastic because it transforms this brown lump with basic animations into a visually exciting and eye pleasing champion. If Udyr had at least some of those animations to begin with, the SG skin probably wouldn't have seemed like as good an investment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2016-01-14T22:32:33.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's...1350?\n\nNo matter, regardless of the price point, the skin looks...Eh, it looks like a messy mesh of colors, you're better of buying Ghost bride Morgana or something like that.
