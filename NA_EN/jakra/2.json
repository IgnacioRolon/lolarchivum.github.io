That's even ignoring the fact that his basic attacks and Q deal reduced crit damage.\n\nIn addition, Yasuo's base stats are honestly rather bad compared to many characters.

Because of this, rather than making it the case that you need to build a whole team around Yasuo by balancing his late game power curve with a midgame ADC, it seems to be that CertainlyT prioritized making Yasuo a flexible pick in any standard team comp by artificially forcing his power curve to spike in the early to midgame and fall off late.

His kit gives him survivability, mobility, and the damage to be useful as a melee ADC, and overall synergizes pretty good. His shield allows him to survive, his windwall also does this, his e allows him to be mobile and also maneuver around threats, his q allows for some utility, his ult allows for a gap closer and cc for your ally team to move in, and his passive works good with his dps and survivability since building life steal will do a good job at keeping him a live.

Generally speaking you should barely have 1 major item finished by the time lanning phase ends, and Tri-Force is tied for being the most expensive item in the game.\n\nAlso: nothing enherantly wrong with crit chance being consistant.\nUltimatly critical strikes serve as a DPS boost just like AD and AS for their purpose, and most would argue critical strikes increasing %DPS as they do with Ashe's current kit would be healthier for the game.\n\n> Even Tryndamere needs to go a minimum of 3 crit items AND ramp up his passive to get the same ammount of crit that Yasuo get's just from two sole items.\n\nSo? Tryndamere doesn't really want 100% crit. Tryndamere just wants the highest DPS possible, which means a mix of offensive stats rather than capping any particular one.\n\nEven in the case of Yasou: crit is simply an AA DPS booster. Getting nothing but crit over getting a mix of AD, AS, Crit, and Armor pen results in the same situation as 1 x 19 = 19 vs. 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 625.\n\nLoL heavily favors mixing relevant stats in roughly equal amounts: leaving nothing particularly game-breaking or magical by maximizing crit chance. This is also pretty much the TLDR of why Tri-Force offers such a massive power spike despite offering really unimpressive bonuses to a wide range of stats.\n\nAlso, because of how math works with stat interactions: Tryndamere's joint crit and AD steroids allow Tryndamere to unleash higher auto-attack DPS than Yasou at pretty much every stage of the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"masc dom top","date":"2016-03-22T05:57:54.289+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:157}} without crit would be like {{champion:238}} without shadows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phenyxs","date":"2016-03-21T20:25:15.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Why ask why and just play the game.

Critical chance is an inherently unstable stat, particularly when it came in much smaller amounts prior to the marksman update, and Yasuo was designed to have relatively stable damage output, with each of his attacks not having to depend as much on a coin flip in order to deal satisfying damage. The issue, though, is that it's currently making his laning relatively unstable and snowbally, and might not even be all that relevant now that standard marksman-type builds feature high enough amounts of crit to be reliable in the late-game.\n\nPersonally, I hate the \"chance\" part of critical strike chance, and I'd much rather have crit depend on non-random factors, whichever they might be. There is no real gameplay to this kind of RNG (pseudo-RNG, technically), and I think that's especially bad when crit-dependent builds tend to be lacking in overt interaction between the user (generally marksmen, also light fighters) and their targets, beyond leaving their range or bursting them down. There's also a problem of autoattack-dependent builds lacking in high moments, and crit ends up acting as a flat multiplier to basic attack damage when it should be providing those instances of concentrated power. Trouble is, it's not really possible to tie pronounced highs and lows into a mechanic that's more or less out of the player's control without them feeling unfair and unnecessarily swingy, which is why I think crit needs to change into something completely different, and preferably non-random.","replies":[]},{"poster":"charcharmunro","date":"2016-03-21T23:21:52.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every melee carry has some inherent bullshit to balance out the fact they're melee.

This is especially true for melee champions, which draw a fine line between bruiser and carry.\n\n If yasuo did not have a steroid, he would have no incentive to build like an adc, and would instead become a bruiser. the passive shield and wind wall are very strong defensive abilities, along with his cc, so he would bring a good amount of defense and disruption while being relatively tanky. In fact, he would probably just amuse the metagolem build and would still be gross to play against.\n\nThis goes against the fantasy that riot wanted to create, which was to create a melee adc other than someone like Trynd. \n\nIf anything, his mobility through minion waves should be nerfed, as it inflates the power of his laning phase while still being a strong late game champ (with huge power spikes after buying stattik and again after IE).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-03-21T20:57:36.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because all melee ADC's have overcompensated damage kits to make up for their lack of range.
