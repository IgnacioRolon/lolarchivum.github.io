My no vote didn't mean anything, when I rejoined the game. This has happened for a week or so now, usually as a part of my first game of the day. I'm getting fed up with being unnecessarily punished for it. SO I must ask, is it possible to take this thing away? It's only ever been happening in this patch and the patch before.\r\n\r\nI don't care about the LP loss, though it sucks that my efforts is being thrown away because of this tomfoolery.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-13T21:54:05.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks to hear about all these leaves.  :(  Even though you aren't intended to leave games, [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) is going to treat them all equally regardless of intent, because it still causes others a bad experience.  We cannot remove your LPQ, but I would like to help you troubleshoot the issue.  Give me more details on what's happening, when, or any errors.  I'm happy to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Jakra","date":"2017-10-14T14:55:09.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for hearing me out, though I don't know what else I can tell you.\n\nAs I said, it happens almost exclusively on the first game of the day, occasionally the second but never the third. Getting into a match isn't a problem, neither is choosing the pick intent, ban intent or locking in a champion. It's what happens in between the game loading and the client launching the game itself.\n\nThe client will get that the game is in progress, or something along those lines, but the game window never actually opens, but when it does, it either closes to show it's been remade on the client or I came into the game a few minutes late. One time the game never did load and I was just shown to the end of game lobby.\n\nThis is a pretty new problem, it's been happening since the last patch, but it's only within my first leaverbuster that the problem has become a nuisance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-14T15:07:33.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info here, it adds a lot of context.  It sounds like your network is going dormant after champion select, and failing to transition you over to the game server.  In this case, our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide usually gives the fix.  \n\nThe frustrating part is that you won't know for sure if it's only happening on your first game of the day.  Before you queue up for a game, try it out in a custom first to make sure you're able to make it through.  That way you can test it without worry of leaverbuster penalties.\n\nAlso, download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to auto configure your firewall settings in case it might be playing a part in this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
