As well he should! I am working on Warwick's relaunch and part of that is \"how do we deal with GW on a tank that derives his tankiness from self-heal?\" As you may expect, I have some thoughts.\r\n\r\nI posted a long and ranty post on that old thread and then realized that no one was going to look at a week old thread, so instead I'm reposting my original answer as the first post in this thread.\r\n\r\nMy argument is this: I don't think our game needs GW. The things GW \"fixes\" can be fixed on their own. I may be wrong--hell, I expect I'm wrong since that's where disagreeing with FeralPony usually gets me, but let's have a conversation! I'll repost my rant and then open the floor for all of you: how do you feel about GW? How do you feel about the ITEMS that currently provide GW? (And let's not forget the skills, such as there are--Tristana E, Varus W, Fizz W, Miss Fortune W and Katarina R) Is it okay that I can counterpick your Volibear/Swain with a Tristana?","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-04-08T08:45:56.316+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yup, that thought indeed came out of the Warwick discussion. Basically, IMO there's roughly three use cases in which people might theoretically be considering grievous wounds (and I'm not sold that 3) is actually a thing)\n\n1) High burst sustain self-heal champions. This is the likes of Mundo, Swain, Warwick, Volibear etc. There is usually a single, expensive (i.e. non-spammable) event where you want to apply GW: Mundo/Swain using ult, Warwick jumping in with ult and trying to spam Qs after (something he can't do constantly as Q is STUPID expensive on live), Volibear's passive proccing etc. I believe the reason people want GW in these situations is because the effects themselves may either be overtuned or feel like there's no counterplay once the champion gets ahead. Introducing a special item to \"fix\" this feels like a design crutch to me. It's taking away those champions' high moments.\n\n2) Strong in-combat sustain healing. I don't know if this really is a thing anymore, but imagine having a support soraka, a top-lane nidalee and a mid kayle on the enemy team, and something like a jungle Xin who jumps into your team and starts being a man. In those cases it feels like you require GW to counter the enemy's setup, because the usual counterplay to Xin jumping into your team (burst him down) isn't available. Again, I don't think GW is the answer here. The problem is that there are strong offensive champions who get a big heal for free by itemizing in the most aggressive way possible (Nid, Kayle). As for support healing, whenever we push our supports away from in-combat healing, we make out-of-combat sustain (\"top up\" healing in between interactions) the stronger choice, and I think we generally find that to be the less healthy pattern (hence Soraka's armor buff on her heal, Taric's big CD chunk on basic attacks, Nami's bounce heal/hurt spell--all of these mechanics are meant to push the optimal use case of the spell to in combat rather than out of combat. I don't think they work, but the intention is there.)\n\nIMO, if the enemy wants to build a team that enables a strong deep diver to live much longer than normally, they should be paying for it in some other way. If there is a legit setup with such tradeoffs that manages to get to the point where Xin can dive and wreak havoc, cool! Your entire enemy team coordinated to do a cool thing, they should get rewarded for it. I don't think it's fair to offset coordination through the pick phase, the laning phase and inside teamfights by simply buying one item and saying \"hah! You're screwed now!\"\n\n3) End game ADC lifesteal sustain. So a lot of designers throw this one around as the reason for GW, but call me doubtful. End game ADCs, no matter what reddit and the forums say, are still absolutely insane in our game. There is no role that scales anywhere near as massively as dudes who right click you. They have access to more multiplicative stats than any other role (AD, AS, crit chance, crit dmg, procs, armor penetration) combined with the single most powerful innate tool in our game (range) and some of the sweetest deals in terms of itemization. The theory here is that if they mix in lifesteal in their build (which they can do easily enough; both BT and BotRK are great items even WITHOUT the LS on them) they can feel unkillable and as such, GW should give you a window to try and solo kill an ADC in the late game. I cannot argue with this intellectually; it makes perfect sense.\n\nThe problem is: I've never in my 1000+ games of League actually seen anyone use GW in such a way. I've never seen it on a stream, never seen it in a competitive game, I've not seen it in Silver II ranked, I've not seen it in normals--I'd love to be proven wrong here, but I don't think it's a thing!\n\nSo to back off and reassess the problem space at hand: sustain is a thing in our game, and in many cases it's totally fine to have. However, there's a handful of cases where sustain can feel so overwhelming that players want a \"NOPE\" button to turn off the enemy's sustain. That NOPE button should be GW.","replies":[{"poster":"Xelnath","date":"2014-04-08T08:57:34.795+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Since we're making this a public discussion, let's get to it. \n\n* I agree that the super power abilities are reduced slightly by the existence of grievous wounds. \n* I agree that it is pretty much only the existence of ignite's heal debuff that keeps Mundo in check\n* I agree its possible to reduce the effectiveness of those abilites\n\nHowever, it is the worst-case stacking of these abilities that is the most frustration game experience in league.

I think that drain tanks are actually a good thing for the game. Look at the situation right now, especially in high level games. The average competitive team comp can easily burst for amazing damage, and tend to have great AoE damage output, but without the marksman, they other four champions would be lucky to pull out 700 raw dps on a single target. Drain tanks are around to counter team comps like that. Separate the marksmen from the average competative team from the team, and then throw something like a Locket/FoN/Visage Udyr right in the middle of the remaining four. Not only is he able to survive their burst, but he is easily able to outlast their damage output afterword.\n\nShield/regen-focused tanks are around to force teams to think about having DPS on their teams for more than just 'that guy that pushes the towers'. Right now, there aren't really any options that support these regen tanks, so there is no risk attached to low dps picks, which is why we see so much focus on assassin mids, assassin-esque junglers, and even assassin-esque supports. Ever since the removal of FoN, which was essentially THE regen-tank item, at the end of S2, we've never seen assassin mids fall off of the FOTM, and the exact reason why is because without a champion that requires high DPS to be killed, DPS is simply not a valuable stat.","replies":[{"poster":"ThaddeusMike","date":"2014-04-08T20:07:40.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 champion in isolation should never counter 4 other champions in a group unless the 1 champion is massively ahead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nilous7","date":"2014-04-09T13:37:24.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be too late to the party on this topic but, I'd like to try to offer my own opinion:\n\nI feel some efforts that could be done to improve Grievous wounds is to make it less of an ALL or NOTHING kind of effect.  It should be able to stack in intensity from different sources, so a single grievous wounds isn't going to completely undo someone focused on draining, but will hamper it.  As well, I feel the amount on an ADC should be looked at for how easy it is for an adc to run off into the jungle, hit one camp and come back at full health.  Life steal should only be applied off the damage the target suffers, not the damage dealt.  Thus an ADC who hits for 300 damage on a minion with 50 health left, should only heal off that 50 health.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salganos","date":"2014-04-09T02:48:45.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's worth noting that while ranged ADCs certainly can't effectively drain tank due to fragility, a trend arises in ARAM where certain melee ADCs, mostly Fiora, can become unstoppable just by having a Ravenous Hydra, even if they started out quite behind.

Granted, ARAM is ARAM, but it also comes with built-in healing reduction (which seems to do nothing).  Akali does essentially the same thing, as can Swain, but my main point is that lifesteal *can* produce this drain-tank effect on melee champions.

You can sort of handwave away the problem when you break it down into the individual situations, but given that three distinct situations exist adds value in and of itself, IMO. \n\nI also disagree on point 3 to an extent. Back when {{item:3123}} wasn't terrible in S2 or whenever, I'd buy it on a lot of top lane champions, {{champion:41}} in particular. Now, I didn't buy it specifically to counter the ADC late game, I bought it early game to compete in lane, knowing that the stat still would benefit me once I got to late game. That's a subtle distinction. When the item had early game value as a laning component, but still gave value late game, it made up for it's general weak stats. With GW items, it's the same thing as if you're itemizing for anything. If the only magic damage on their team is Vlad, I'm probably not rushing a spirit visage as Renekton. I'll just get blown up by their ADC. I agree that ADCs are still extremely powerful, and the 'threat' of going up against an ADC late game is/should always be a factor, even when buying early items. \n\nI mentioned this in one of the FeralPony threads: GW isn't the problem. {{summoner:14}} is.\n\nIf Grievous Wounds were gated like any other reactive aspect in our game, through expending gold and an item slot, or by choosing a specific champion, GW would be an interesting decision. As it is, any champion can get GW essentially for free with an otherwise useful early-game combat summoner.\n\nI would love GW to be limited to items like {{item:3165}}, {{item:3123}}, and certain champions (though I wish there were more champion options). As it stands, GW is bad and lacking counterplay because every team will always have 1/2 sources of GW regardless of champion choices or in-game decisions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hashinshin","date":"2014-04-08T18:20:31.302+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"So I was with you until the end and uhm...\n\nIn your 1000+ games of League, all your watching of streams, all your watching in competitive games, your ranked, your normals...\n\nYou've never seen a top laner ignite an ADC when they start to fight to deny the lifesteal?

It should be doable to nerf these abilities and GW at the same time.\n\nOut-of-combat sustain (Nidalee, Kayle, etc) is in my experience currently the worst kind of sustain, since they completely invalidate your poke unless your poke is extremely bursty or extremely frequent, and there is no way to actually consistently apply GW on them to counter this.

I mean there's only 2 items with grievous wounds and one of them has crit chance??? why? I think you did this for duels between adcs but honestly the best way to counter LS is having LS yourself :S\n\nApplying grievous wounds is something the support or the tank should do, in order to neutralize the enemy healing there SHOULD be a team effort, not just clicking a skill if you've got it.\n\nFor example: Kat, yeah she can apply it by herself, but in order to do so she must sit at the verge of danger. Trist's is ok since she's single target so you gotta make a decision (Do I target mundo or their adc?). Varus is restricted to an area. Fizz is melee. Miss fortune is... wrong she can apply it in quick succession (AS steroid) from a safe point, I'd shift that around in her kit to her Q since you wanna hit the most 2 important targets but in order to do so you must break your head with geometry.\n\n\nNow there's something that could work as GW, and that's DoTs, a strong enough DoT can deter healing enough as to make it not count or at least not count as much... there are GW paired with DoTs already in the game, Trist's and Fizz', these GW are more effective since it doesn't just cut healing, but hurts you at the same time, this is something Exec calling tries to achieve but fails by sheer numbers. That being said an item that could be considered \"defensive\" GW is thornmail, it won't negate healing, but it neutralizes it a bit.\n\nI think drain tanks are healthy for the game since it's not a conceived thing but something that was born out of pure mechanics and logic, therefore the counter to that is just more logic around mechanics.\n\nWhat I'd like to see though is more champions with GW, a support, a tank, a ranged mage, a jungler, a fighter... as it is right now only melee mages and adc has got them and building a team to counter uber healing is almost impossible (yes, uber healing is a thing) of course, not just point and click GW but intrincate ways of applying it (Soraka's Q with morello's is pretty stupid...) and since GW seems to be such a good valuable stat, items with it need to have low offensive/defensive stats, so I'd opt out for removing them and adding GW to new champs plus adding scaling effects on the skills that already have GW, for example:\n\n**Explosive shot:** \n\nActive: Trist fires a bullet that applies grievous wounds that reduces healing by 10/20/30/40/50%\n\nMiss fortune on the other hand would need less scaling, never hitting 50% reduced healing since she can apply it more effectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xzandrate","date":"2014-04-08T15:03:08.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that with the current lifesteal numbers, GW is very much needed.  Like others have said, unless we are looking at a LS change as well, GW should stay.\n\nHere's what I see as the major issues with GW as it stands right now.  GW is frontloaded to the early game, which makes it imbalanced early, but generally lacking when we need it late game, primarily because of poor itemization.\n\nSo I think GW needs 2 major points.\n\n1) It needs to scale.  Either in duration or effectiveness.  The quick fix would be a duration scaling based on level, 2/3.5/5s at 5/10/15 for example. I'd love to see a more complex mechanic that increases the effectiveness based upon the strength of the heal, but I think it would be too difficult to determine the strength of a flat heal unless you looked at the % of health, which then punishes the squishier characters.  Maybe make it more effective versus self heals?\n\n2) It needs to be a late game team fight ability in effectiveness and itemization.  Early/mid game laning is not when you want to completely shut down healing with GW, where we commonly see it now.  Whereas when you start making it to the mid/late game teamfights, the current items don't have enough growth or stats to make them effective all around items, most players don't see the trade being worthwhile to counter a single champ. \n\nI'm forced to wonder, is GW a stacking % like slow currently? Could we make it more like slows, more ubiquitous ability across a higher number of items/abilities that provided smaller percentages that could be stacked more effectively?\n\nLikely, the biggest take away that will come from this discussion is the general displeasure with the current LifeSteal mechanic over GW.  As has been echoed already, ADCs can too easily completely reset after a close fight off only a few creeps; which means it is required to 100-0 an ADC, whereas you can leave any other role to run through a jungle and clean up afterwards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limakoko808","date":"2014-04-08T08:58:07.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i would have to agree that GW isnt all that needed. The only time we really see it is with ignite, and innate GW on abilities, and those abilities are rarely used solely for the GW.\n\nThe reason why GW feels like a must in the first situation is because of how strong these champions heals are, and Spirit visage's passive. \n\nAnd for combat healing vs out of combat healing, yes there are much better benefits to healing in combat, but if you really think about it, you lose nothing if you heal out of combat(besides maybe nami w). \n\nAnd GW affecting making late game adcs killable is laughable at best. Adc will always be the best scaling champions in the game, but they always hold the same difficulty and paper thin durability. An adc cant just face roll and get a pentakill late game. In fact with the amount off cc and burst damage any given team will have, if the adc player messes up even a tiny bit he is dead. Its so nerve racking playing adc at times because you know how easy any enemy can kill you. I hold in my farts in a teamfight as adc, thats how serious it is.\n\nHowever taking away grievous wound would necessitate changes to champions like mundo and swain. Obviouly their healing would have to be nerfed, but to a level where it still feels important. Perhaps changing some healing effects to kind of like irelias passive? More enemies=more healing. Or we could reserve that for spirit visages passive?\n\nIdk im not a game designer. But you are right, GW isnt necessary for the game, however removing it would need significant balance changes.

Zenon already eluded to this in that you have ignite and items that apply GW and then there are champion abilities that apply GW.\n\nTristana in particular comes to my mind. She is the one Marksman/ADC that does not have a regular \"poke\" skill. Because of that I feel grievous wounds is alright on her E as it makes the damage impact-full and not simply washed away with sustain. I also feel that it is an interesting element to have on Varus's E as well since it is truly temporary and in a fixed location giving it strategic value. Miss fortunes W on the other hand is not the same, it has no real strategic value because it is tacked onto her auto attacks which means it just gets reapplied over and over again. The counter argument is that this only occurs by activating her W and for a limited time. While this may be true, when it is on she is able to apply it to multiple targets. In my mind this defeats the purpose of it being there. The same can be said for Fizz and his W. As for Katarinas R I could take it or leave it.\n\nIf there was a way to add limitations to drain tanks I do feel that GW on ignite and on items would no longer be necessary. I would still keep it on champion specific skills as it adds additional flavor to the game and increases strategy. Except when it is simply being applied by auto attacks by activating an ability.\n\nPS: thanks for calling my threads wonderful xD","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-04-08T10:10:32.375+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's a very interesting point you raise about Tristana there. I think we're looking at the problem from the wrong side again. The problem here isn't so much that Tristana has no poke (and I'd argue that passive procs from E can somewhat fill that role, but that's a different conversation), but it's that everyone in bot lane goes hard into LS and as such no poke really sticks unless you can keep applying it over and over. \n\nTo say \"here is a skill that stops you from healing up after an engagement\" is dangerous, because that skill necessarily needs to be long duration (and Tristana is already at the longer end of what I feel we can do). We do hate on sustain heal a lot, but I'm somewhat in Xypherous's camp of \"heal is a viable fantasy we should find a way to support\". If there was a healthy heal champ, it wouldn't be pickable against a Tristana with an E that effectively functions like that, and one of the design pillars of League of Legends is that no game is ever decided in champion select (what you do with your champ, even in a disadvantageous lane matchup, should always matter). \n\nSo here's how I'm going about adding gating to WW as a drain tank:\n\n1) De-coupling of offensive and defensive branches. If you invest into more healing, you do less damage. If you buy offensive items, you heal less. Current WW can theoretically build a chunk of AP and get both offensive and defensive advantages. If my WW opts into lifesteal, that means he opts OUT OF damage. It's true tank itemization.\n\n2) Add gameplay to the drain. Most drain tanks run into the problem that they're very \"stat checky\" -- do I have more of the stat I need to succeed than you or not? This is where triple BT Master Yi or massive spell vamp Akali come in. Aside from locking away offensive itemization from drainy WW, I also moved more than half of his drain budget into the stack gameplay. TLDR is WW needs to build stacks by attacking things to access his full healing power. These stacks fall off quickly if you kite him / CC him at all. \n\n3) I curb excessive in-lane sustain (immovable object type of problem) by halving healing against minions.\n\nDo you think those approaches would go some way to alleviating your concerns?","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-04-08T20:03:55.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we are still on a different page with regard to Tristana. I am looking at her E ability when used in combat, be it duel skirmish or team fight, not after combat has ceased. Poke was also not the proper word I should have used but rather burst, and for Tristana i would go even further to say \"safe\" burst outside of her ult.\n\nFor a Tristana to wait to use E until after a trade is a waste and to me would be poor decision making. I do see your point however if it were used in that way. I don't feel picking her in champ select because of a healer support invalidates the other pick though. There is a great deal of strategy in champion selection alone, even more so in the competitive scene. If I want to take a healing champ I should take into consideration if they might pick Tristana, or even worse Miss Fortune, and plan accordingly. Tristana's E has a limited duration and cannot be cast in rapid succession which means there are times before and after that full heals can be applied. Miss Fortune on the other hand has the exact opposite effect, her GW application, although short in duration, is reapplied with each auto attack for the duration of the W active, making the GW duration more like 8 seconds. (Reducing tristana's GW duration to 4 seconds wouldn't be terrible either).\n\nWarwick's drain tanking ability has never really been a huge offender to me beacause of how gated his mana is. However I do like the ideas you have proposed and they would definitely make how he heals feel far more rewarding for the WW player and much more fair for his opponents. The real drain/sustain tanks that I feel are offenders are Swain and Mundo. I am not out to hate against them as I have considered both a main at one point in time or another myself, so I would say it is quite the opposite in that I am actually rather attached to them. Be that as it may I still recognize that they pose a strain on the games health when they activate their ults. So long as Swain has mana and Mundos ult lasts (Volibear feels similar in this way as well during his passive) they feel unkillable on your own without the aid of others or ignite (Aatrox is even starting to feel this way now with feral flare).\n\nThere is something that could be tested though to see if it would be possible to remove GW from items and ignite. Since they are there to be a resource to combat the Insane sustain champions, altering how those champions sustain is where more focus should be placed. I had some interesting Ideas as I was writing this reply that I think merit a bit of testing internally.\n\n1)Mundo: Currently Mundos ult gives him a constant stream of regeneration over its duration. If this was changed so that he regenerates a great amount at the beginning of the ult (3-4 seconds) that quickly starts to drops off at an exponential rate over the remaining duration. You still regenerate the same amount of health over the 12 seconds but creates better ways to combat him during it. (same approach could be done with Volibears passive)\n\n2)Swain: This time take the reverse approach. When swain first activates his ult he deals extra damage (eg 50% more) but heals far less (eg 50% less) for the first 3 seconds which then begins to decrease/increase respectively over the next 3 seconds and would then hit their individual caps which I feel should be slightly lower than live damage and slightly higher healing than live. For Swains that build to deal more damage and carry they might want to stop using ravenous flock to refresh it in order to deal the increased damage again. Players that are out to soak in damage and tank would want to stay in ravenous flock for as long as possible to maintain the increased healing effect. I would probably not have the mana cost begin to increase until after the first 2.5-3 seconds though. Not only would this pattern create a better opening for opponents to try and focus down Swain and eliminate him before he can simply out heal everything, it would also effect his ability to simply sit in lane once he turns 6.","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-04-08T20:20:49.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ran out of room for my last little point. when it comes to life steal in lane What if the amount you stole from minions was reduced (not neutral monsters).

If there was a healthy heal champ, it wouldn't be pickable against a Tristana with an E that effectively functions like that, and one of the design pillars of League of Legends is that no game is ever decided in champion select (what you do with your champ, even in a disadvantageous lane matchup, should always matter). \n\nUmm, you'd never intentionally pick a soraka support going into a tristana lane.  You'd only do that because you need to silence a channeled ult in a team fight.\n\nI've played that lane before and it's unpleasant as soraka because you basically can't sustain your ADC in a fight.  You giving him a short term armor buff early on in a trade and that's it.  Also because you are a support champ, your ability to use your Q in that situation is also handicapped by the fact your ADC needs creeps more and not everyone is happy when you push the lane.\n\nSo you've basically got no escape, no heal, limited bully, and bananas that take forever to reach their target.

So i like to build items like {{item:3165}} on supp champs like nami or instead of {{item:3174}} on mid champs when i know champions like mundo and swain are starting to roll or become a problem since healing is a big part of their kit. Other than that these GW items aren't really useful for their stats alone.

Now this would in itself be a huge change for ignite, but would this at all change the way ignite is used and maybe make GW more situational and not so easily obtained. This way maybe GW wouldn't have to be removed, but instead just slightly boost it since it would be on its own. This way it would be more strategic to use it and it would work at any time its activated for X amount of seconds. Make it a 60% reduction for about 6 secs we say. This way its use more widely against more than just the {{champion:36}}, {{champion:50}}, and {{champion:19}}. \n\nWith this you would in turn take it off of {{item:3165}} and {{item:3123}} and itemize them differently for other things.

Mundo not only heals 60% of max HP, but builds stupidly high resistances.\n\nMundo is a problem.\n\nI can build 40% lifesteal on an ADC and still get gibbed in 2s by an assassin.\n\nADC sustain is not a problem.\n\nSo, I have a very simple solution: **Have lifesteal and heal effects heal you for that amount of effective HP.**\n\nSay you have 200 armour and 100 MR: That means you take 33% of any incoming physical damage and 50% of any magical damage. You're a I dunno, shen, and on 300 of 2000 hp. Now, Your total effective HP is 6000 vs physical, and 4000 vs magical, for an average of 5000.\n\nNow, your soraka Wishes back 500 HP. You have an effective HP-> Hp ratio of 2.5 You only heal for 200 real HP.\n\nYour ADC teammate who has exactly zero mr and armour due to {reasons} heals for the full 500.\n\nBoom. Now, we have healing is inherently less effective on tankier targets. This means that when you apply a heal of X, damage of X will exactly negate it.\n\nIn order to keep some champions balanced (mundo, garen) we change their passives to heal a percent of their effective max HP per second. \n\nSo, lets see what we've got for GW now. Well, tough champions inherently heal worse than fragile ones, so we can just redamage them rather than having our only option be GW away the heal. As for squishy champions, we can burst them.\n\nThere we go, we have no reason to have GW any more.\n\nLets look at the three main classes of healers: ADC's and fragile drain tanks (fid, swain). You can burst these champions 100->0. Or, you can grind them down. Basically, the fight will go as normal, but at the end of it, these champions will quickly hit 100% Hp again. No GW needed.\n\nNext are tough drain tanks. Shyv, Xin, Trundle: Through lifesteal or other reasons, these champions no longer exploit healing more effectively than more fragile champions, since healing for X is wiped out with X damage. There's no need to inhibit their healing now.\n\nFinally, there are champions with heal casts: These are now automatically less effective when cast on a tough teammate, meaning that you can't just top up a shen or something with some cheap heal requiring a massive damage spike to deal with. These heals can be tuned for use on ADC's / Mages, because even at full HP those champions can be spiked.\n\nThere you go Zenon.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-04-09T10:27:39.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really would be a bad idea...it essentially would cripple the scaling of heals, rendering them useless later on vs already outscaling dmg from carries.And you cannot compare sth. like Mundo to an adcarry. Mundos only way to enter a fight is to run in, he cannot avoid to get a frontload of dmg into his face - so if he isn´t able to survive a good amount of burst he simply can do nothing at all in a teamfight.\n\nI´d agree though that he really could need some kit changes, as Mundo really is just a ball of stats running around mostly.\n\nBut getting Rid of GW/tuning it down to a more balanceable lvl surely doesn´t mean there wouldn´t have to be some real big changes to heal-reliant champions to rebalance them. It might very well be a project of a scale that can only be made work out during preseason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"pandaleon","date":"2014-04-09T05:29:35.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grievous wounds : Healers and Regen/Drain Tanks ::  \nDefense Penatration : Armor/Magic Resist Tanks \n \n\nGrievous Wound should provides a passive counter play to and from strong healing champions. If I apply GW before heal I have reduced the heal efficiency of the spell and denies health that other wise would have to be dealt with by damaging the opponent. (note it doesn't completely negated the heal as that would make it toxic to the healer and the patient). On the FlipSide A healer that notices the debuff and hold the ability till after the debuff fades or is quick to heal before its applied is rewarded by successfully delivering the health to their ally/self and wasting the spell application of GW.\n\nIt makes me think of the waves of an ocean. back and forth till one side gets a better wave and wins.\n\nThe thing that I think GW abilities have to be careful with is the duration of the GW uptime vs the Time Frame it can be applied again. if there is no to little window to recover/heal then it becomes a poor mechanic.\n\n**Healthy examples** are: {{champion:18}} 's Explosive Shot 5 second duration GW vs a 16-9.6 sec cooldown. \n\n This leaves a 11-4.6 second window open to heal and recover. considering the possibility of full CDR.\n\n{{champion:21}}  Also have fair time for recovery while the spell is on cool down. \n\nOne simply has to walk out of walk out of \n\n{{champion:110}} hail of arrows to stop the GW.\n\n{{summoner:14}} with a 5 second GW vs 210-189 second cooldown.\n\nIn addition to the availability to any summoner and the Heavy True Damage, this spell can be chained with an existing GW spells in a champions kit. Which is why it warrants such a long cooldown.\n\n**A Near Unhealthy** example only because (condition must be met properly) is:\n\n{{champion:105}}  's Seastone Trident with a 5 second attack application buff + 3 second application time for 3-8 seconds of GW Vs 10-6second spell downtime.\n\nBest case is dodging/avoiding his auto attacks and making fizz wait 10 till he can try again.\n\nWorst case Fizz manages to hits his Melee Auto at the start and the end of active duration and has 20%CDR.

Sure, drop ignite on that Vayne.

Having a new type of damage instance \"wounds\" would remove the need for that additional condition because the damage doesn't \"stick\". You either make use of it or it disappears in a few seconds.\n\nThat means burst mages that are actual burst mages can have wounds based gameplay and those that aren't won't (and would sport some other strenghts instead).\n\nThe cost of such an implementation is a slight increase in complexity. I think its worth it if it allows you to implement burst mages and healers in a game healty way. The real question that follows is \"Ok, if we implemented this system, HOW EXACTLY can we gate the burst of burst mages and the heals of healers, in a way that promotes gameplay?\"\n\nAnd the answer to that lies in the fact that the damage is TEMPORARY. That means it is naturally transient-- usually the condition will be elapsed time. It could be positioning or some other gameplay oriented condition however.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-04-08T21:57:32.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of grievous wounds, because as Xelnath said that and {{summoner:14}} is the only thing keeping this guy {{champion:36}} (and to a lesser extent this guy {{champion:86}}) in check.

I feel that if we could get grevious wounds to scale with total health, they'd be much more balanced.  After all, tanks are natural damage sponges anyways, why have them heal away what little damage they took in 10 seconds?  Having grievous wounds scale with health would also make adcs have more favorable trades against another opponent who is just building damage and lifesteal.","replies":[]}]}
