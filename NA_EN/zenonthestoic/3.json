Having looked at a stupid amount of games myself, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that I was wrong about the W. **Here&#039;s the TL;DR: we&#039;re switching the W to a vector cast*, removing the spell lockout before eruption, and nerfing the E to go along with those changes. **\n\n(* vector casting is the casting paradigm that Viktor's Death Laser and Rumble's Equalizer use)\n\nIf you&#039;re still with me, let&#039;s talk about why we&#039;re making these changes, what I learned from the W, and what this means for the future of Taliyah.\n\nFirst of all, why are we making these changes? It comes down to one very simple thing: using the spell with the constraints I put on it in the interest of game health proved too frustrating for too many people. I made a bet that most players would be able to accept these constraints (particularly the lock-out delay), and I was wrong. So we&#039;re changing it!\n\nLet&#039;s talk for a second about what the lock-out delay was, why it was in there to begin with, and then loop around to double-cast vs vector cast.\n\nRight now on Taliyah as of patch 6.13, after you cast W you cannot cast further spells until after the W delay is over; this is what I mean by lock-out. The thinking was that the W-E combo would have been too strong if we allowed you to get it off whenever you hit the W. The difference here is that on live in order to toss people into your minefield, you have to cast the minefield *first*, committing more resources and putting the enemy on notice. There&#039;s no question this is healthier for the game as a whole as it provides the enemy with more of a chance to dodge, and it also allowed me to make the impact of landing a E-W combo much higher. (The math here is simple: the more infrequently an effect occurs, the stronger the effect gets to be, up to a limit). \n\nFeeling locked out of spells that should be available to you (because they&#039;re not on cooldown and you have the mana for them) just feels awful. Players have told us loud and clear, so after much discussion with other designers I made the call to remove this lock-out and look for ways to nerf the W-E combo. Before I talk about those nerfs, let&#039;s touch on vector cast real quick.\n\nOther than being fairer to the enemy, the W lock-out allowed me to design a version of vector cast that didn&#039;t put as much pressure on the player to chain their inputs together as quickly as possible. By saying &quot;don&#039;t worry when in the delay you decide which direction you want to throw people to, you&#039;ve got time&quot; I wanted to give players something more learnable. It&#039;s hard to track this, but anecdotally the W seemed very easy to pick up and use. It&#039;s only when you start trying to optimize around it by chaining other spells into it that you run into the frustration of the lock-out. This new cast type of &quot;press the button twice, but the delay starts after your first button press&quot; was useful only in a world where there was no external time pressure on the player to execute quickly. Now that we&#039;re dropping the delay, it becomes the optimal play to input W as quickly as possible so that you can chain E and Q into it (you can cancel the E&#039;s animation with your Q). This means the double cast type becomes a hindrance, not a boon, to the player, so we&#039;re removing it in favour of vector casting.\n\nIn this new world, a Taliyah who can hit her W can spike an enemy HARD. She can chain the E into it, getting the initial cast damage plus the combo damage out of it, and she can instantly start pelting the enemy with her Q. That&#039;s a LOT of burst damage for a character who shouldn&#039;t be mostly about burst damage (as a disruptor Taliyah should deny the enemy certain zones and bring a constant stream of damage). This means we had to nerf something.\n\nWhat we landed on for now is nerfing the maximum damage you can get out of a perfectly played WE combo. The way we&#039;re doing this is by introducing falloff damage to the E. Your first hit of the E will do the same damage as currently on live (so if you&#039;re just casting it on the backline of the minions to push the wave, nothing&#039;s different), but every further hit will do 10% less damage. So if you hit a unit with the initial cast of the E, then drag them through the maximum of 4 mines, each mine will do successively less and less damage. This works out to about a 150 damage nerf in the best case, but do keep in mind the best case situation of the rank 5 E has 720 base damage.\n\nWe're hoping to ship these changes with 6.14.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-02T19:14:14.576+0000","up_votes":124,"down_votes":14,"body":">  I've come to the conclusion that I was wrong\n\nhttp://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/10/tim-and-eric-mind-blown.gif\n\nI don't even play her but I love it.

It's long because I love this champion. Taliyah's winrate after 30 games is 58% ([Source](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/1bunGEHs-taliyah-changes-for-614?comment=000300010001)\\). She is already tenuously balanced and this change will make her completely imbalanced. This change does not simply make Taliyah's combo easier. It completely changes her playstyle and in many cases will **increase** her damage output. Any dedicated Taliyah player will quickly realize this whereas people who've only used her a handful of times think this is just a \"QoL\" change. This change will set Taliyah up for failure, and here's why.\n\nThis is going to be an unpopular opinion because Taliyah is an unpopular champion, but I believe most dedicated Taliyah players will be on the same page here. This change completely changes the way Taliyah plays. Right now she requires careful positioning to poke with Q. You drop an E to zone and/or setup for a kill combo. If they don't run, you W them into the boulders and make them regret it. After this change, Taliyah will just stand somewhere without Worked Ground and focus on landing a single Seismic Shove to get the rest of her kit for free. Most of the intricate strategy involved in using Taliyah has gone out the window. Her kit currently does insane damage. What happens when this insane damage is easily accessible? This innocent change is going to needlessly turn Taliyah into a nightmare because the fact that she has to place an obvious wall of boulders before exploding you is, while inconvenient, really the only thing keeping her damage remotely balanced.  \n\nThis small change actually turns her skill rotation into a trivial one that requires minimal effort for the sake of making her less \"clunky\" in the hands of players who immediately gave up on her. The damage falloff on E isn't nearly enough to compensate for Taliyah's insane burst. To put this into perspective, Taliyah's current rotation will do about 1280 + 320% AP damage at max level. Diana's rotation has about 1100 + 270% AP power. This is factoring in two uses of her ult (meaning she landed Q first) and her passive. Lux's entire kit will do about 1308 + 245% AP assuming two passive procs (1 AA + ult). Now imagine getting hit with a single Nami bubble and taking damage equivalent to the entirely of Diana/Lux's kit with little to no counterplay. The previous E > W restriction should make more sense now.  \n\nWhile the boulders make her combo \"clunky\", they also serve as vital information required to dodge the skill in the first place. Reducing the knockthrough boulder damage by about 15% total isn't nearly enough to compensate for this change. It would be akin to removing the opponent's ability to see what cards TF is picking (granted, this change has a positive effect unlike that example). The damage is still too high when you consider how much easier the combo is to land now, and it will absolutely be nerfed further. It's even more ridiculous when you consider how this actually INCREASES Taliyah's burst in many cases. Right now Taliyah must place E pre-emptively. This will not always hit. With W > E in the cases where you aren't quite in range to land E but can reach with W, you will actually be doing more damage after this change because the first hit is now guaranteed to land.  \n\nWith this said, I'm not against removing the lockout from W. Instead, I believe that E > W combo should retain its current damage while the W > E combo will do a flat percentage less, around 50% damage reduction on any boulders they are batted through. This will decrease the total potential damage by about a third (or 40% if you don't count the explosion damage at the end). This can be coded as a status effect that reduces knockthrough boulder damage by half when W is used without E placed. Though this makes Taliyah more complicated, it allows a meaningful distinction between the two attack patterns. You can either blindside them with less damage or you can place an obvious zone for more potential damage (which is what Taliyah was designed to do in the first place). Without distinguishing the two cases it's going to be incredibly difficult to find a fair amount of damage for Taliyah's E. It's also needlessly harming Taliyah's ability to zone dashes with E, even if that is unrelated to the Seimic Shove combo.  \n\nI'm really, really worried for Taliyah if this change makes it through. Support for this change comes from people who do not play Taliyah or realize her current potential. I'm not against making her kit fluid, but this change simply pushes her over the edge and the only way to balance it out is going to be nerf after nerf after nerf once people catch on. **Please, please, please separate W > E from E > W and E. The easy burst combo should be meaningfully weaker while the old choreographed combo should remain the same.** Don't blindly support the suggested change just because you tried Taliyah once and found her unwieldy. She is already usable. Making her more usable for more people is wonderful, but this change will be so bad for the game. You are going to step into a Taliyah mid lane, immediately die, then start crying for nerfs. I've already beaten the point to death, but please don't allow this champion to be broken just because you gave up on her.  \n\n**tl;dr Please do not let this change go through unchecked. This completely changes Taliyah into a simplistic burst-mage and actually increases her total burst in many cases. Taliyah will become more popular and inevitably get nerfed because her damage is already bonkers. A 10% reduction per boulder isn't nearly enough to compensate for how much easier W > E is to land compared to E > W, and in some cases her damage is actually increased by the change. With E > W you would often throw down E even when it wasn't in range, making you miss out on 1 of 6 damage instances. With W > E you will always get the first hit, thus increasing your damage in cases where E would have otherwise missed. This change will break Taliyah because the huge wall of rocks that typically warns Taliyah's opponent will no longer be there. A more sensible solution is to allow W > E but make W reduce the boulder passthrough damage if you use it before E. With this, E > W (or just E) will retain the same damage while W > E will provide an easier but weaker alternative. This allows Taliyah to retain her heavy zoning playstyle rather than forcing her into becoming the burst mage that everyone who tossed her aside expects her to be.**","replies":[{"poster":"ØmegÆ","date":"2016-07-04T07:08:25.229+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zenon, please read what he wrote... This is COMPLETELY true!! Any players that really tried the champ love the way she is, please do not give in for an easier play style making her incredibly op leaving an inevitable series of nerfs, crushing her into the ground. The E-W combo is necessary in order to give the enemy a chance to evade the incredible bursts that it provides, an instant W cast is completely bonkers.... I really really love how the champ works right now- making her a big threat for those highly mobile champions. The thought of turning her into that simpleton burst mage like so many others really scares me. It would only destroy her unique play style revolving around unexpected bursts and her Q's dps. Whats more is the incredible feeling of accomplishment after landing a successful clutch W under a dash cutting it short... This move really revolves around your ability to predict the enemies movements and so punishing them heavily, making her W almost instant would remove the skill cap that was required prior to the incoming changes making it way easier, removing that incredible feeling of outplay... i get it you want more players to try and love your champion but the thing is making her easy to play with the amount of damage she puts on the table only seems like a terrible idea.. it would desolate me to get one of my favorite champ destroyed over a community that doesn't give her the chance she needs. Like any other player I love seeing one of my mains getting buffs but please, Zenon, that is REALLY NOT THE WAY TO DO IT!!!!!!!!\n\n\n*edited: I thought about it all night, and my point of view doesn't change one single bit. LoL is loosing its appeal little by little by being way too repetitive (I left the game at least 4 times since season 1)... The only way to save the game is to introduce new ideas such as bard, taliyah, kalista, azir... you get what i mean- these unique concepts really make the game shine. Lately I have been very impressed with the new champions with the exception of Aurelion Sol and Ekko (the rotating stars are sick but his kit really isn't centered around it, Ekko's chronobreak and his AOE stun are genius but as the same for aurelion he gives me an unsatisfied taste in mouth). Removing how Taliyah's W works is like taking a huge step back making her one of the bunch of those ap midlaners making her loose her originality. Sure LoL has a ton of champions to pick but most of them are suuuuuuuuper similar (poke+cc/jump/defense+dmg+ the ult is usually the trademark of each champion, with a little bit of difference here and there, but it's not enough- at least i don't think s). I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHAMPIONS REWORKS but they do take quite some time :C. The game gets really repetitive after a while, i think you noticed a drop in the community- sure the accounts remain but it doesn't mean they are being played on or way less than before... unique ideas like taliyah is what keeping me as a player and transforming her as that generic mid laner (with the exception of assassins :D --- btw i despise these guys lel this is a happy sad face ;_; )  really would disappoint me. Everybody hated on bard when he came out, but look at him now ( he's one of the favorites now, look at him go :'), and personally as a bard main, i really don't believe he needed the buffs he got but wtv that's another story). Just leave her the time she needs, leave her the time to be played in the lcs and then everybody will realize that she really isn't that bad and that she is worth playing. Whats more is that I am sure that you must be disappointed to see your champion not given the chance she needed, PLEASE GIVE EHR SOME MORE TIME.\n\nThx for reading !_!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-07-02T19:17:29.054+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"Finally.\n\nThank you for being able to change your mind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-07-02T19:20:22.842+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":7,"body":"You're probably going to have to end up nerfing her more anyways.\n\nShe was already looking just a little teensy way too goddamn strong after people got used to playing her (seriously, she's got a 63-64% winrate for the more experienced players mid lane, and her early-mid game is alllll the way out of line), and now you're giving her a full burst combo to optimize as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-07-02T19:34:38.030+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SaltyKracka,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1bunGEHs,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-07-02T19:20:22.842+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re probably going to have to end up nerfing her more anyways.\n> \n> She was already looking just a little teensy way too goddamn strong after people got used to playing her (seriously, she&#x27;s got a 63-64% winrate for the more experienced players mid lane, and her early-mid game is alllll the way out of line), and now you&#x27;re giving her a full burst combo to optimize as well.\n\nWhat are you reading?

I am going to join their ranks and hope that you read this response. \n\nI urge you not to change the W. \n\nThe ensuing burst potential will have to get nerfed repeatedly and tweaked repeatedly in order to find a balance between the fluidity of the combo and how much damage it can output. On top of this, as many others have said, it changes her play style completely. Right now Taliyah is a blast to play because of the thought that goes into your play. Using E _followed_ by W is like a game of chess with your opposing laner. The whole of the game is like a game of chess and micro-managing your kit effectively from not putting too much worked ground in your lane to using W at just the right moment when a siege on your tower is occurring. These changes turn her into an extremely simple-combo burst mage. Sure she might be played by a few more players this way, but people who play her will hardly, if at all, be thinking about W cooldown or worked ground in lane and the E as a zoning tool. They will only look at the kit as \"Can I W + E + Q right now?\" \n\nWhile the potential to be a disruptor is still there, it will most certainly be ignored by most who play her. \n\nNow, in your parent comment I have bolded something that concerns me greatly, and it is the focus of the last half of this post. I want to discourage you and the design team of thinking on future nerfs already. Taliyah has a relatively low play rate (I believe it is floating between 2-3%). She has only been out for a short while. She is only largely seeing success by people who give her the time of day and play her repeatedly. All of this leads me to my main point discouraging thought of future nerfs, and also the initial change to W now that I think about it; Other players simply do not understand how to play around her yet, and that is okay! \n\nShe is not represented at large enough numbers for those who have not played multiple games as her to understand what to do against her just yet. I urge you to save the current change and future changes in mind off for a few more patches. As someone who has played almost exclusively Taliyah since I got her, I can say she can very easily be played around, but not enough people are looking at her when they play against her to understand that. She is in need of no changes because in the coming weeks as more people become aware of her cooldowns and handicaps they will better understand how to play around her. \n\nA few notable ways she can be countered in lane: \n\nA. Her W has a relatively long cooldown that it seems people are just unaware of. After she places an E down all one simply has to do is bait the W, or step out of its range as she places it, and she is unable to do a W+E+Q combo on that person for 10+ seconds throughout most of the game. This gives that individual ample time to retaliate with poke, or if they are an assassin go in on her for some combo damage of their own. \n\nB. Trade pokes often. As more people play against her in coming weeks they will understand exactly how handicapping the worked ground can be. If the opposing laner pokes often from across the minion wave or, as in point A, when W is down then Taliyah is forced to either take that pressure or retaliate with a full Q barage. One single rock from a Q on worked ground is hardly a healthy trade for say an Ori AA+Q+AA or Ori Q+W+AA. As the worked ground consumes the lane and her mana bank runs dry Taliyah finds herself in more and more of a handicapped position. \n\nC. Call over the jungler. If Taliyah is ever pushed up into the midway point of the lane she becomes a very easy target to gank. If the opposing laner has been doing a good job of trading poke or combos on her then the lane will be littered with worked ground and her mana will be low meaning retaliation for the 2v1 will be low. All the opposing laner has to do is bait the W or E and then Taliyah can be collapsed on by what is presumably a high-mobility CC carrying jungler.\n\nOnce again, I urge you to hold off on any changes for now. It took me only one game against a Taliyah to understand these handicaps because I studied her play closely, and as a Taliyah I have had these issues myself. Her own kit does a healthy job of working against her, and if the enemy laner uses their kit and her own against her then she can at best hope to have an even lane with the individual. \n\nMaking her receive more play at the cost of future nerfs and a changed playstyle is not worth the loss of unique play she currently brings to the table. Please take my voice and the voice of other Taliyah players into consideration with any potential changes. We love the champion you have made. Changing who she is as a champion is not worth a 2% increase in play, or if these changes become a problem it is certainly not worth a 15% increase in play that results in her being immensely nerfed and a loss of the unique style she currently holds. \n\nPlease feel free to respond to me on this matter as I am open to discussion on Taliyah, but I have the stance I do for a reason. She has become my favorite champion, and I am a Jayce main, and Jayce mains are _obsessed_ with Jayce.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-07-02T19:45:36.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"http://imgur.com/3x4O6qU","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2016-07-02T19:52:01.606+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note that champion.gg's data becomes *very* spotty above 50 games played.

Taliyah was a bit of a chore to play because of her own kit working so hard against her, so at least we have this to make things smoother. However,   I don't understand this aversion to burst on a Midlaner, because quite frankly, her zoning is pretty minimal outside of her ult. I understand you're trying to avoid a broken on release champ like Kalista or Yasuo, but Taliyah honestly just feels like her kit was designed to hinder her almost as much it helps her.","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2016-07-02T19:57:40.621+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"Burst is great on some midlaners! Let's make sure we're speaking the same language, though. We recently identified a clearer breakdown of what roles exist in league of legends.

I believe Taliyah is a Disruptor and so shouldn't have the burst profile of Annie, for instance.\n\nHere's my analysis of why I think she's a Disruptor:\n\nHer Q is a moving no-go zone: a rectangle extending out from her current position defines a zone in which you'll take a bunch of damage. You have to side step it, meaning she's denying you that zone.\n\nHer W has a noticeable delay (nearly a second) during which you must get out of the circle / can't step into the circle. Again, she's forcing positioning on you.\n\nHer E finally is the most classic zoning spell on her kit. It's a large area where you're slowed (reason #1 not to be in it), where you can be tossed into mines for further damage (reason #2 not to be in it), and finally the zone explodes after 4s dealing damage again (reason #3 not to be in it). \n\nYou've already mentioned that her R is a great zoning tool (by literally not allowing you to walk across it).\n\nDoes all that make sense?","replies":[{"poster":"Very Cash Money","date":"2016-07-02T20:58:48.196+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main problem is that her goal with all her spells still seem like bursting a target more than zoning anything, both currently and with these changes.\n\nSurely both Q W E and E got the potential to zone off, but considering you would rather simply hit a W->E combo and follow with Q you never really zoned off anyone, you dealt damage to them. You would rarely feel like it was optimal to plop a E just to zone off the enemy from somewhere since your whole damage part of the combo was now gone. Until super late her uptime on spells versus damage output simply felt like using the spell with purely zoning intention would be a waste.\n\nIt felt like she blew all of her resources on that single E. Where other champs with similar goal seems much more versatile in their zoning ways. Anivia can Zone purely with her W and still be an effective threat, she can triple down on this zone by adding Q and R. Her E makes both hitting Q and R dangerous for the enemy. Her W allow(ed) her to force enemies into Q and R also having threat after controlling. \n\nOriannas sole threat is her ability to destroy everything around her ball, yet the low cooldown on the ball at almost all stages of the game allow her to create dynamic zones that the enemy must play around. If she blows her threat however, the ult, these zones lose effect.\n\nI feel like Taliyah is a bit like Orianna, but she blows her threat WHILE creating zones. Unlike many other champs her Zone is her threat, where the other control champs zone is the POTENTIAL threat that it brings. Anivias R is not that scary, but the potential to E makes it avoid worthy however unlike Talyah if the enemy dodges her R she still has more tools, Taliyah feels empty once her E is used. \n\nMight have lost my point somewhere in the ramble, but in essence I feel like most Zone champs create a win/win situation where they either zone and keep their threat, or unleash their threat. Whereas Taliyah feels more all in, either she zone and loses her potential threat, or she unleashes her threat. The only zone tool Taliyah has that does not remove her threat potential is her R and I think that is why many feels like that is her only real zoning tool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-07-02T20:03:33.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZenonTheStoic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1bunGEHs,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-02T19:57:40.621+0000)\n>\n> Burst is great on some midlaners!

Changes are scary, and I'm just one voice, but here's what I have to think about the changes.\n\nThe W was clunky.  REALLY clunky.  In a unique way.  Fluidity in champion kits is good game design, but so is champion identity.  I'm not certain allowing vector cast on her W will allow her to keep that same identity.  Even if you nerf her damage fairly substantially, I'm fairly confident that you'll take her away from a high sustained damage disruption mage and into a long range, chain-casting assassin.  \n\nTaliyah's burst from a EWQ combo was really good already, and the combo wasn't that hard to land, but the visual cue of throwing out an E first usually led to most opponents just walking away from the burst.  That's counter play.  \n\nIf you set the vector cast on her W and allow W->E combo rather than forcing a E->W combo, you not only limit an opponent's ability to react, but drastically increase her threat range.\n\nThink about Cho for a second.  A Cho who gets ahead in lane can Rupture from 3/4ths of a screen away and then just walk up to an opponent and Scream->Nom them while they're slowed.  Now imagine that same situation on a champion with nothing but ranged abilities and a kit that synergizes incredibly with Rylais.  \n\nI guarantee, even if you nerf the combos damage, you will also have to nerf her Ws range.  If you even cut the damage as strongly as 30% (which I'm sure you know is an obscene number that won't come to pass), you'll create a very frustrating play pattern of land max range W directly back into you so that your E->Q combo fully hits, which, when combod with Rylais, allow for very VERY easy kills with little to no ally assistance due primarily to Rylais's slow.\n\nCalling it now, this change, even coupled with damage nerfs, will either lead to either a W range nerf or significant mana/cooldown nerfs for W and E.\n\nFor the time being, the combo is hard to land, but rewards a player with more than just a visceral damage combo, since a proper combo takes a fair amount of positioning and patience to pull off.\n\nI can't count the number of times I've been chilling in a random brush with a pink ward only to WEQ someone from full.

Yes it locks you out and makes you have to throw out your E first but honestly I don't see what's so wrong about that. It gives your opponent time to counter play if they see the e they're able to recognize maybe the w is coming and prepare to dodge. It also forces the player using taliyah (speaking from experience here\" to time when they want to use the E-W combo, for example against champions with dashes, force the dash or bait it then lay down the combo making sure they're not able to dodge AS EASILY.

We lose damage but the combo is \"easier\" to hit.\n\nIt just seems a bit backwards in my eyes. Reward players who do not take time to learn a champ and punish the ones who put the effort in to do so. \n\nWhen I started I was not used to the second cast part of her W when choosing the direction however after a few games I got the hang of it and was then slowly able to implement it into her combos. \n\nIf nerfs are coming her way there's two things I can think off, LOWERING the initial cast damage of the E or the slow amount on it or making each exploding mine deal subsequently less damage if that makes sense. (Sometimes I picture things in my head but can't find the right words for them)  \n\nI think the combos should remain \"hard\" to hit so it forces people to play her more and learn her than just pleasing the people who don't want to put the effort in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corporate Golfer","date":"2016-07-03T05:28:26.507+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't understand the logic behind this change.
