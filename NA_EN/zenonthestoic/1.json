UnknownMartian most recently posted a Youtube video to reddit that lays out the problem clearly:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgdmjXMs7tI\r\n\r\nTLDR: When assigning soldiers positions for Conquering Sands (Q), Azir would historically grab all soldiers on the map in random order (most often this would happen to be in order of creation, but not always). As demonstrated in the video, in the three soldier case this sometimes leads to an unfortunate situation where the nearest soldier is assigned one of the side positions, 240 units off your mouse cursor.\r\n\r\nI took some time tonight to rewrite how Q works and cleaned up some bugs surrounding the 2/4 soldier cases as well (4 soldiers is technically possible, but very, very rare). Here's the breakdown, with pictures!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XxWuN12.png\r\n**One soldier**\r\nPretty straightforward. Goes where you click. Your click position is a 75 radius green circle, the calculated soldier position is a 100 radius red circle. In this case they're identical\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FTF77t1.png\r\n**Two soldiers**\r\nThe soldiers align themselves around your target position, equidistant to the left and right of it. The nearest soldier always goes to the left position, viewed from Azir's perspective along the axis of your cast direction.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/S8XhAyT.png\r\n**Three soldiers**\r\nThis is the situation from Unknown Martian's video. I fixed this so the nearest soldier will always go to the MIDDLE, which is the position that you clicked on. The second closest will go to the left and the farthest will go to the right.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vTkJXGD.png\r\n**Four soldiers**\r\nThis is very rare and hard to achieve. Hint: both Q and AA extend soldier lifetime by a fractional amount in certain situations. Not something I expect players will be able to exploit in real games, but just in case. As you can see, the first row of soldiers places itself slightly nearer to you than where you clicked, with the nearest soldier going to the center. This is only a difference of 120 units, and Q overshoots by 50 units, so this difference shouldn't make you miss (we do check forward an additional 100 units at the end of a Q to see if we can find someone to hit anyway, so it's a moot point).\r\n\r\nNone of this has been QA checked yet so details may change or the rollout of these changes may be delayed. They will also not be in the next patch; at the earliest, they will be in the patch after that.\r\n\r\nQuestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Swippinfrafes","date":"2015-01-07T13:49:38.445+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"What can we look forward to in terms of Azir in U.R.F.

Since it doesn't change numbers as written and I \"think\" the cap were above or higher than you'd usually see in a classic game. But you're completely right that they'll very probably cap him in some way. But if it's at 5-6 soldiers, it won't affect classic!Azir at all.\n\nadded : is there still a cap on box/shroom?

But those are not unit/integration tests. Those are user experience tests. \n\nAs someone who does code, those kind of kink look like \"lazy\" coding. The programmer/scripter made it to work as it was supposed to work in the simplest way for *him*. He didn't fully think about every way a player might use the skill. The skill seems to be used as either repositioning for AA or soldier-poke in lane. The former works as intended and the later works as long as you have 1 soldier or that the soldiers are coming from the same spot.\n\nThat kink wouldn't have been discovered untill people played azir long enough to chase an enemy with soldiers currently in the field, then drop a new one, then Q him (like the video showed). Then the first few times, the player will think it was his mistake. Then he'll start to realize it happens a lot and will try to understand why. Chances are the playtesters never got far enough to notice there was some weird behavior.\n They were probably in the \"oh I made a mistake\" part. Or they made their setup knowing that the new soldier would need an AA.
