Please see Statikk&#039;s post on Mordekaiser for more context on what these design reviews are.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll paste the actual review in this first post, but I&#039;ll also have a much more in-depth and verbose explainer posted as the first comment on this thread.

At this stage, we typically do a internal follow-up where we sit down and talk about what did and what didn’t work, guided by our original pre-release goals. We’re making that player-facing. Before we dive in (heh), let me just say we’re very much aware that a lot of you feel Tahm is very frustrating to play against. We hear you and none of the things I’m about to say should take away from the validity of what you’re feeling. We may disagree on the why and the what to do about it, but your feelings are valid and we’ve heard you.\n\nAlright, enough touchy-feely stuff. Let’s talk video games.\n\nWhen we set out to make Tahm Kench, we wanted to make a “tank’s tank”; someone who can become ridiculously hard to kill while having a strongly felt effect on the game (internally we call these “outputs”: how does the game change for everyone else because Tahm is in it?) We also decided in the very beginning of production that his outputs should fall outside the usual tank outputs of “AOE CC an entire teamfight” or “lock down / pull in one guy and enable your team to kill them”. \n\nHalfway through development we pivoted a little from wanting Tahm to be exclusively a gold-taking solo lane tank to embracing his support identity, but we liked the thought that we could deliver a champion who succeeds in different roles. We hadn’t made one of those in a while (Bard, Rek’Sai, Kalista, and Azir are all very strongly role-bound, and Gnar’s jungling is at best a super niche build) and we thought it’d be neat to enable player experimentation. \n\nSome things we obviously nailed: Tahm is tanky as all get-out and cannot be ignored. His output is a uniquely powerful ally saving move; not only is it strong, it is also super cool. Saving that low health squishy with a flash W creates a strong “holy shit Tahm, you just saved my life” moment for your ally.\n\nHere’s what didn’t work out: we expected that ally devour would be somewhat frustrating for the enemy, but we failed to predict just how bad it would be. We’ve clearly heard your feedback that the champion is frustrating to play against, but we also have other data points to back this up. When supports enter the top 3 of most banned champions, something tends to be off. Soraka’s recent rise in bans due to our changes to Grievous Wounds and the addition of the Windspeaker’s Blessing mastery is one good example of this. Clearly enough of you are so frustrated playing against Tahm that you’re happy to spend one of your three bans on him.\n\nSo let’s talk about this. We have always known that uniquely strong safety moves will create frustration. Some amount of frustration is absolutely a necessary part of the game. Frustration at your plans not working out or the enemy outplaying you is an essential low moment in a PvP game like League, which buys us the high moments when things do work out. So frustration per se is not a bad thing. It’s when a moment feels unfair or like there was nothing else you could have done that we have a problem.\n\nPart of this was a last minute decision to give Tahm MS away from the enemy with an ally in his stomach. This came out of lane testing, particularly when Tahm and his ally lost their lane. It felt like there was absolutely nothing Tahm could bring to the table once the lane started to go against him. Particularly when the enemy kept ganking to drive the advantage home, Devour never seemed to help. We may have overreacted to feedback here. \n\nDevour should feel like a sacrificial move. The Tahm player should feel like he saved an important ally’s life at the cost of his own or of at least a good chunk of his health. The 20% movement speed away from enemies means that not only does Tahm save a friend, he thereby also buys himself more safety. Stripping this mechanic was a no brainer; expect to see this change for 5.24.\n\nThere are two more contributing factors to the feeling of frustration I want to talk about real quick. One is that he just seems unkillable, and the other is that he outputs a buttload of damage.\n\nTahm’s E is a necessary tool for a tank champion, but the exact tuning may be off. The active should be the button that allows him to wade into the thick of things and pick up an ally in need, and the passive should make it so he doesn’t just straight-up lose to any amount of poke. Our current feeling is that both the amount of time over which the shield decays might be too long (turning the shield from an anti-burst tool to a “lol I got two health bars” tool over the duration of a typical teamfight) and the delay before grey health turns back into health might be too long, making it too easy for Tahm to get to full shield. We’ve not made up our minds about this yet, but it’s on our radar.\n\nFinally, damage. Tahm has the potential to do an exceptional amount of damage for a tank. Abyssal Voyage’s passive is tuned to be very strong. On any champion who has the tools to get to you and stick to you easily this would almost certainly be problematic. But we cannot look at a mechanic in a vacuum (the poor guy would suffocate). Against most of our roster, Tahm does not have the tools to get to an enemy and stick to them. Nearly every ADC should be able to kite him, anyone with a mobility tool should be able to opt out of fighting him, and so on. We believe that as long as Tahm’s stickiness and catch potential remain as low as they are, it is okay for him to have the damage he does.\n\nThere are edge cases that may need looking at here. For one, if you go into a 2v2 trade that turns into a 1v1 and you’re now in melee range of a Tahm who already has 3 stacks on you, you will likely not be able to get away from him without a kiting / mobility tool. Yes, there are certain champions that don’t have any of these tools and they just never can 1v1 Tahm, which feels bad against a support. So the TL;DR on his damage is: yes it’s very high, but the problem is that certain champs can’t opt out of fighting him when they should be able to. If anything, we’d look at that.\n\nWe have some thoughts about the cooperative use of Tahm’s ultimate as well, but I’ve been going on for too long already. How do you feel about Tahm’s current state? Do you disagree strongly with any of the above?","replies":[{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-12-04T21:30:24.054+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":6,"body":"Tongue Lash's slow scales up pretty crazily, from 30% to 70%. For a guy whose contribution isn't supposed to be catching people out, Tongue Lash is a pretty good fight starter. I find against more immobile carries (Ashe, Varus, Jinx) once my Q gets to a certain rank I can basically hit them from brush, walk up and auto to land the other 2 stacks for a devour and easy kill/flash. IIRC on the PBE before his release, his Q slow was significantly lower, then got buffed up. If you're worried that some champs are unable to escape him, you should probably look at his Q again.","replies":[{"poster":"ICantNameMe","date":"2015-12-05T00:51:46.878+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I completely agree that 70% slow for 2s is just too strong on a champion with as much damage as Tahm.

This would probably be one of the first things to look at if we do decide to attack his stickiness. That said, here's the reason why he has such a strong offensive skill on his kit: without a strong offensive option at a range, Tahm's optimal play would be to always just sit next to his ADC and wait for trouble so he can instantly eat them. That still is the best play most of the time, but not all of the time. This push and pull on the player is essential to creating a set of meaningful decisions. It's not entirely clear to Tahm if he should just sit on his Kog'Maw or try to fish for a Tongue Lash into devour on the enemy frontline when the enemy may not be ready to fight.\n\nIn lane you're right that there's a lot of power to it, and again if this is something we feel we need to address, the slow amount is an easy thing to adjust. However, all three ADCs you mentioned should have ways of keeping you at a distance. Jinx can Zap / Chomper you, Ashe can slow you in a hundred ways, Varus can use his slow zone. Theoretically, Tongue Lash should be tuned such that you can almost, but not quite, get to an enemy who's paying attention to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2015-12-06T22:20:15.644+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why not just put a decay on the slow like many other massive slows in the game have?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Garrotte","date":"2015-12-04T22:52:20.972+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"I really disagree on your methodology on how you're viewing Tahm's support laning phase. What I feel is oppressive about playing against him is that he isn't forced into a dichotomy between leveling  two different abilities. Practically every other support has to sacrifice the power of one ability for another. Tahm, however, isn't gated by ranks into his W and E. There is not a significant case where Tahm gets pressured into putting additional points into E or W instead of Q. This gives Tahm the feeling of having high sticking power, because he is never forced into an alternative. \n\nI'd rather see the base values of W or E shrunk, but increase the scaling per level as a method of allowing opposing laners to force Tahm into needing an extra point into W's duration or E's regeneration in order to survive the laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-12-05T03:01:04.079+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"So you want them to do something similar to morg where they hit say his e at early ranks, so that if a lane is going poorly he wants to level that instead of his aggressive spell. That actually seems like a pretty solid idea, but we need to see where he shakes out after these changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2015-12-06T22:22:35.023+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's a good point! I feel there's a lot that's good about a clear rank-up path (I really like it when my champs tell you \"90% of the time, you can just max Q first and you'll be alright\"), but his may be too straightforward. W gains a lot from rankups, but not a lot that you could be forced to need, as you point out. The E health restore also grows meaningfully with level, but chances are you don't need to use it quite as much in lane. \n\nAgain, these observations are great and useful if we do decide that it is his sticking power that's a problem. A Tahm with absolutely no offensive threat onto the enemy will become a devour bot, sitting near his most important ally, finger hovering over the W button. That doesn't sound super exciting to me. \n\nWhen we look at how much damage Tahm can do and how easily he can stick on people, we should also not forget that the enemy has tools. Enemy supports should generally bring a toolset that stops Tahm from just running up to the ADC even after he lands a Q; ADC tend to have soft self-peeling abilities (even immobile ADCs like Kog'Maw or Jinx have tools like Void Ooze or Zap! / Flame Chompers! They're not the category of enemy I worry about. If they die to Tahm it's often because they allowed him to walk up, thinking they deserve to just win by outdamaging him. I'm okay with Tahm saying \"nope\" to that line of thinking. \n\nI base these observations both on my own games in Silver ELO and on watching a lot of high Masters/Challenger games with Tahm in them. When people die to Tahm at my level it is because they pretended like he wasn't a factor; when they die to Tahm in high ELO games in lane it's mostly because what had looked like a favourable 2v2 turned against them and Tahm cleaned up after. If his stickiness+damage was such a problem, I'd expect him to index much higher on kills and damage dealt to champions. Looking at champion.gg's data (http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.totalDamageDealtToChampions&order=descend) I find that support Tahm's kills and damage done to champions are very similar to Bard (slightly higher on kills, slightly lower on damage to champions). This is consistent with the damage profile I was aiming at and, on top of pattern level analysis and anecdotal observational data suggests strongly that his damage profile is not what makes him so frustrating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ekanselttar","date":"2015-12-05T00:49:02.691+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"My feeling on Tahm is generally that he just exceeds his power budget and that knocking down any of his skills could bring him into a bearable position.\n\nIf his Q didn't have such a strong slow on it, he wouldn't be able to reliably Devour ranged champs off of one hit, and if it didn't have such a low mana cost/cooldown it wouldn't feel so much like the sword (or tongue, I guess) is constantly dangling over your throat.\n\nIf his W didn't have such high damage on it, it wouldn't feel completely futile to try fighting him as a melee champion, and if it didn't have such a low cooldown, it wouldn't feel like he gives up absolutely nothing to eat an ally.\n\nIf his E didn't heal so much, poking him wouldn't feel so futile, and if the duration or quantity of the shield was lower, then it wouldn't feel like you have to kill him completely twice over.\n\nAnd if his ult didn't have such high damage on the passive, he wouldn't go from decently strong to unkillable 1v1 with a single hp item.\n\nI'll bring up Swain as a champion that Tahm should emulate more in feel. It might seem a little strange, but hear me out. Swain's main laning pattern - spam E with occasional Q and maybe fish for Ws - is not all that interactive. If he had fewer low points, he would feel absolutely awful to play against. But he does have those lows, and so he's not. You aren't thinking, \"Well, I can't poke him out, but I can... not do anything else either.\" You're thinking, \"I can't poke him out, BUT I can shove him in and make him miss farm.\" Or \"I can't win short trades, BUT I can bait his W and all-in him.\" Or even, \"I can't win fights against him normally, BUT I have a window whenever my Ignite comes up where I can.\"\n\n_Right now, it feels like the ball is always in Tahm's court._ It's not satisfying to try poking him or all-inning him and he erases his own mistakes while punishing yours _extremely_ hard. There is no \"BUT\" moment while fighting him. If you're playing a ranged champion, it's, \"His Q poke does a lot of damage AND allows him to reliably eat me AND it's hard to poke him down AND he does tons of damage when he reaches me\" and not \"His Q poke does a lot of damage and he wins all-ins, BUT I can poke him down and kite him unless I really mess up.\"\n\nThat said, I will emphasize one aspect of his kit that could potentially cut right to the quick in regards to negative feelings when the toad is loaded: his W provides a high point in the same magnitude as a Blitz hook, but its cooldown doesn't reflect this. It wouldn't be frustrating if his big move in the fight was simply eating a carry in danger. As it stands, with Devour on a 6-second CD with 40% CDR, he can use his W to save an ally and then turn around and chunk an enemy with it. There is no strategic choice for Tahm. No give and take. Just take take take. Or, put it this way: Ally Devour is very much analogous to Zhonya's active in effect and power. If you Zhonya a Thresh hook, that's clutch. If you could Zhonya a Thresh hook and then Zhonya a Syndra ult in the same fight, that wouldn't be clutch, it would just be bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2015-12-06T22:37:59.106+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":11,"body":"Let's talk about power vs frustration for a moment! \n\nYou start out your post by saying that Tahm is over his power budget and then listing a number of ways that his spells do too much (and you're onto something for most of these, actually; they're all tuned very strongly). \n\nIn this thread I'm looking at frustration much more than power. Power is easy to measure; frustration isn't. Power-wise, Tahm is actually in a good spot (pre-season may have given him a slight bump, but he was very weak before). \n\nPower is measured by win rate. Obviously you then have a bunch of conditionals to that winrate (what ELO are we looking at? How does this behave over time? How does the winrate change with game length? What positions are we looking at?), but in the end of the day, power is knowable.\n\nInternal tools show Tahm Kench at a 47-48% winrate in the last three weeks across all regions and game lengths, in Normal 5v5s, Ranked Solo 5v5s, and Teambuilder 5v5s at ELOs of 1500+. If we expand to all ELOs, I see him at 49%, but at a slight downward trend (suggesting that at lower ELOs people are doing a worse job playing against Tahm, but are learning). Pre-season bumped him up by about 2%, so he was at 45-46% before in high ELO. \n\nSo again, if you're arguing that his power is too high, I will politely disagree, which is why I phrased this thread not in terms of power, but in terms of frustration. Frustration can come from power, but I don't think that's the case here. Janna has had 53/54% winrates literally for years now, and I never hear people talk about Janna as a highly frustrating character to play against (although [Gosu may disagree with me here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKVUGfOXX80)). Is Janna powerful? Absolutely. That E alone is ridiculous, and she is the queen of disengage. But is she frustrating to play around?

I'm generally of the opinion that mobility should always be what gets shaved off of Tahm when he gets too big for his britches (or two coats, in this case), and while losing the getaway movespeed is certainly going to hurt, it may be appropriate to allow him to keep his durability and threat generation--on top of making its aggressive movespeed that much more attractive for getting your friendly Olaf or Darius into the fight. \n\nI do worry, though, that the loss of getaway speed may end up turning an ally W into a death wish for both parties, since Tahm is already pretty slow and landing CC on him is essentially a 2-for-1 deal. (Can't say if this is bad balance-wise or not, but it may lead to Tahm accidentally killing his teammates when using the ability that is supposed to save them--maybe increased spit distance may be a solution here, so it's more of Tahm sacrificing himself and less of both of them getting away for free).\n\nAlso, considering the frustration of Tahm's ally-saving ability--which requires heavy commitment from him, on top of proximity to an ally on a low-mobility character, on top of sacrificing an offensive option and so on--does this mean that Thresh may be looked at in the near future? While he certainly excels when it comes to picking out enemies, it seems a bit overkill to allow him to save an ally without really having to sacrifice anything.
