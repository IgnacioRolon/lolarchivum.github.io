Thanks for all the questions!**\n\nFriends of Shurima! With Azir being turned on soon[tm], we thought this was a great time to let you ask us pretty much whatever you want about his gameplay and balance.\n\nAzir is an interesting champion that breaks a few \"rules\" of what a mid laner is supposed to do. One of the bigger ones is the fact that to access the majority of his damage, Azir has to right click pretty much like an AD carry. This looks deceptively simple, but if you've had a chance to check him out on the PBE you'll know it's much harder than it looks. Between his soldiers, resurrecting lane turrets, and making a truly uncrossable* wall, Azir brings a lot of novel concepts to the game, and I'm sure you'll have a bunch of questions.\n\nJoining me in this thread is Squad5, who is responsible for Azir's balance and gameplay health. We did a lot of work to make sure we can actually release these crazy ideas without breaking the game, and Squad5 was central to identifying the trade-offs, appropriate strengths and weaknesses, and overall balanceability (as opposed to balance--we're okay with getting balance wrong, as long as there is a path to improvement) of the champion. \n\n*Unless you're Malphite, I guess. Or Vi. Or Maokai. Or Fizz. Or Nocturne. Or Vladimir. Damn you, untargetability!\n\nHere are some other things you might want to check out:\n[Azir Reveal](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/champion-reveal/azir-emperor-of-the-sands)\n[Shurima: What Lies Beneath the Sands?](http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html)\n\nCheck out the other Azir Q&A sessions here:\n[Azir Creative Q&A](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/qRqERevn-azir-qa-creative)\n[Azir Art & Sound Q&A](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/9f9inmau-azir-qa-art-sound)","replies":[{"poster":"Frostguard","date":"2014-09-10T19:55:54.596+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":5,"body":"What was the reason to not make the soldiers make use of {{item:3060}} Banner of Command?

If the shield hit a certain number, Azir ascended, gaining a massive chunk of spell vamp, AP, a doubled shield, and crazy move speed.\n\nThis is probably the most disgustingly overloaded and overcomplicated skill I ever designed.

We have more than 120 champions in the game now, many of whom fulfill the \"I want to be a midlane mage and burst/aoe people down\" fantasy perfectly well. We don't need another one of those.\n\nSo for Azir, we sat down in the beginning of this current kit's lifetime with champion team and split into 4-5 smaller teams, sometimes just two dudes, jamming on different takes on Azir. The kit I worked on had a sand resource that you had to gather, made a triangle of obelisks for the ultimate fight arena, and spammed sand missiles from sources of sand, for instance. GypsyLord made a kit with a sandstorm ultimate that literally covered the entire map and slowed all enemies in the game. We're talking that level of crazy prototyping. \n\nOne thing that all the kits had in common were soldiers; the kit I worked on had a skill that summoned three targetable guards that moved in formation in front of you, blocking skill shots, until you reactivated the ability to send all surviving soldiers forward as skill shots. Another kit summoned two walls of soldiers that immediately charged forward, knocking enemies back (sound familiar?) Squad5 made that ability and it obviously strongly inspired my ultimate. CertainlyT's kit had a spawn soldier mechanic where you could order soldiers to turn into skill shots by attacking enemies: all soldiers in range of an auto attack target would charge toward that target. This clearly turned into my Q (and the idea of ordering soldiers with your basic attack). \n\nThis was a really, really cool exercise (we called it AZIRDOME -- THE SHURIMARING, named after the THUNDERDOME code jam we do two-three times a year here at Riot) and it quickly taught us a lot of things that were cool about Azir, first and foremost being soldiers and controlling them. I don't think I could have come up with a kit this unique without the help of the entire team.

Do Azir's soldiers deal damage in the time of his normal ranged projectile attack (with a delay), or does it feel more like a melee attack where you click and go?\n2. I noticed Azir takes out a lot of damage potential during the time it takes to cast a second or third soldier because Azir cannot auto attack when he presses W for a really long time it seems. Is there any plan to fix that and make things feel less clunky by enabling basic attacks and other soldier attacks during that time?\n3. Do Azir's soldier attacks extend and  hit units outside of the solders like Lucian's Piercing Light?\n4. Since soldiers do not exactly auto attack, Azir has no method of ward clearing if his soldiers are in range of the ward he is attempting to clear, is that planned, can you make it so that Azir uses normal attacks against wards or soldiers deal damage to them etc?\n5. From where does Emperor's divide start to push out, in front of Azir, middle, or behind so can he push them to target direction if they are directly on top Azir or even behind him?\n6. Will his soldiers attack the attack move thing where simply pressing A (or whatever hotkey applied) button will make the champion auto attack the nearest target?\nBTW, ZenonTheStoic, you have yet again made an amazing champion, I love playing Lucian. Last question, why does Azir have no face?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bsul","date":"2014-09-10T21:48:00.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would Rilays, CDR or MP work on him?\nWould rilays make his soldiers attacks slow on hit? if not would frozen mallet do so?\n\nWould CDR  make his autoattack faster?, If i have 2 soldiers  lined 400 yards from each other. Can it be possible to command them to strike at the same champ that is walking in that direction with 2 attacks within 1 second? as soldier a) hits first, then he reachers attack range of soldier B and soldier B hits.\n\nU said there is a formula for his dmg reduction on multiple soldiers. Would that affect so as well?\n\nIs there a range indicator for the soldiers?\n\nWhy does heim get autoattacks on turrets but my soldiers are lazy as fak?","replies":[]}]}
