So far it only seems to affect the **Dunkmaster Darius** skin, and I haven&#039;t yet tried with his Classic skin. The bug is simply that the game refuses to register attack commands of any sort, and I&#039;ve tried it with A, auto attack on click and attack move. It doesn&#039;t always happen, but it seems to occur most often after **using an ability**, especially his W (Crippling Strike), and it often prevents any form of basic attack **against enemy champions** until the W time limit runs out. It doesn&#039;t seem to affect enemy minions or inhibitors, but it does affect at least **turrets** and champions. It doesn&#039;t affect abilities, activated items or summoner spells (fortunately), but Darius is dependent on using his basic attacks with his spells so I feel this is a major issue that **needs resolving ASAP**.\r\n\r\nBoth times I&#039;ve had the bug, about halfway through the match, my **ping skyrockets** to over 400 (usually I&#039;m at about 30 - 40) for several seconds and I repeatedly get the &quot;attempting to reconnect&quot; box onscreen while this is happening, with the first time it happened completely disconnecting me for at least five seconds. Afterwards, the bug seems to resolve itself (or at least not happen as often) and my ping returns to normal. The issue is that this bug has lasted for **at least ten minutes** on both instances and made my first match practically unplayable (second was an ARAM so I could rely on other abilities and items to play).","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-29T22:27:20.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ClockworkPenguin,\n\nThanks for the report! Sorry for the late delay in posting, we've been working on a solid repro for this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Fishyhat","date":"2015-06-12T02:40:13.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found something very similar, but there was no ping problems involved, I just sometimes can't target people with autoattacks. I just kinda had to stand near whatever I wanted to smack, and call it good. Bigger minions didnt seem to be a problem, I could click gromp and golems okay, but lane creeps and champions I couldn't.","replies":[]}]}]}
