When I asked on the official discord they told me being ranked in 3v3 should count like it says in the announcement (Youâ€™ve completed ranked placement matches for at least one ranked queue).\r\nDo I lack any other requirement or am I correct and is this going to be changed before the beginning of the tournament or do I have to finish my placements in an other queue?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T16:56:20.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, you may want to send this feedback over to the devs at the [Clash Discord](https://discord.gg/CV5tpb6).
