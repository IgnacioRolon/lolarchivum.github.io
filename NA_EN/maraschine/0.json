I have received the \"Wild Magic\" (two feathers) icon but not the one of the actual champions together (and as far as I know, neither has he). \r\n\r\nWas wondering if there was a reason for this? I kinda pressured him into it just because of how cute the icon was... would suck if we ended up actually doing something wrong. Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T21:07:27.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cute overload, it's always why I try ti get my hands on Poro icons.  :P  It looks like you already received your icon earlier this afternoon.  If anyone here still hasn't received it, double check as we rolled out more today!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraschine","date":"2017-05-12T03:24:18.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, thank you! I just logged in and saw it waiting for me. :) I was starting to get concerned because of how many people were commenting that they hadn't received it yet.

Maybe those that bought it with RP haven't been handed out yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tunamanwhale","date":"2017-05-10T01:39:38.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't received that icon either after gifting one of my friends Xayah with RP","replies":[]}]}
