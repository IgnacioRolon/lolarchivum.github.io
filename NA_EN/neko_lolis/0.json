Get enough elemental power to be able to choose a second form.\n2. Choose the same form again (Which should not be possible) \n\n\nI have tried this in 3 diffrent games 2 on live servers and one in the practice tool. When i chose the same form again in normals i got the same form for the whole game. When i did it in the practice tool i became the nature form instead when i chose the fire form again as i did in the video. \n\nIt looks like i edited the video but it was the same game.
