I seem to remember sneaky playing lategame carries every game like he always does. I'm also having a hard time equating veigar to the earlygame, as it is his weakest point.\n\nYou can think whatever you like but the fact remains that NA lacks the confidence to beat Korea. the reason people play lategame champs that scale really well is that they don't have the confidence to close games sooner, in reality the lack of confidence is the problem.\n\nFastpush strat with veigar and kogmaw? yeah no wonder they didn't make quarterfinals.\n\nMaybe next time they can go malphite yasuo amumu and then splitpush!","replies":[{"poster":"Axis the Dragon","date":"2015-10-15T03:55:17.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you really didn't watch the games, then. xD\n\nAll 3 of C9's games in the first week involved Tristana or Azir in some way, shape or form, in a fast-push strategy that involved taking towers down as quick as possible, which netted them a clean 3-0. Second week, though, most teams banned out Azir, making their fast push not as effective, which really killed their momentum (ending the week 0-4). They tried a Yasuo+Malphite comp in their tiebreakers but AHQ counterpicked them pretty hard.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ElegantDoge","date":"2015-10-14T15:25:00.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zebekn,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=XnE1uALW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-14T14:50:39.913+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, I don't really support any of the NA teams to begin with.

You be like but they lost, I be like yes team wise C9 and TSM were still better even that they made it first in NA. CLG is in a prefect place to grow what they have right now. But just like TSM an C9 they were not worth looking at as a contender in this worlds. They won NA in the weakest NA year that ever existed(or least competitive).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PoisonedTea","date":"2015-10-16T10:20:33.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I support Fnatic.
