None of them are really bullied by literally every other champion that shows in their lane in the same way that Kayle is.

It's also a major cause of frustration for the team as well, because I cannot tell you how badly I've seen people tilt off the face of the planet because a Kayle is unable to keep their lane under control because of her inability to apply any kind of pressure whatsoever.\n\nAnd also, I specifically stated her kit needs rebalancing to improve her early and reduce her late.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-03-29T15:53:28.940+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"Kayle is the only hyper carry done correctly in that regard.
