A Rioter also mentioned in a thread from about a year ago that Riven still represents \"the best of what Noxus is and could be\". https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/6JWHilrN-rivens-faction-should-be-ionia-now?comment=0003\r\nAs far as I know, Noxus always had this \"might makes right\" mentality, it's why they have been trying to expand their borders since the inception of their empire and even noxian society itself follows social darwinist and meritocratic principles. Anyone who is strong and skilled enough can simply work their way up. Riven today however seems to have an entirely different set of values, with quotes like \"So much death.\", \"A necessary strike.\" and \"Violence to end violence.\" implying that her ultimate goal is peace rather than the vision of might and glory that Noxus represents. Her quote \"My hands are stained.\" also implies that she regrets her service to Noxus rather than \"just\" disapproving of the chemical warfare they employed (which was NOT her fault and therefore couldn't have \"stained\" her hands).\r\nSo does this change in her lore imply that there is no \"pure noxian vision\" that she would support and that she severed her connection to the ideals of Noxus? And if not, what kind of \"noxian vision\" would she support?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-08-12T19:27:34.415+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riven discovered Noxus wasn't really a meritocracy.

A few questions that immediately arise from looking at the faction:\n\n1. Swain claims the empire is a melting pot of cultures where diversity is cherished -  yet Noxus doesn't really _look_ like a functioning multicultural society. The enormous capital in particular has only one aesthetic, that is the uniform triangular machismo we are used to associating with Swain and Darius. If all these creeds and culture coexist, why aren't they allowed to express it in the city's architecture and presentation?\n\n2. Speaking of the Trifarix, Noxus takes immense pride in weaponizing magic, and yet **there is no mage scholar on the Trifarix **- indeed, there are no mage scholars in power anywhere in Noxus. (Swain has no academic knowledge of magic, Darius, well... and Faceless might be a puppet on strings as far as the people who do the heavy arcane lifting are concerned). Are mages oppressed in Noxus too? The lack of political representation certainly points that way.\n\n3. Women on the Trifarix/Occupying important positions of power? Even Putin's Russia has more women in important roles.\n\nIt kind of looks like Swain is making some big promises and not working very hard to keep them. The slogan-y, propaganda-y manner of speaking and presentation on his side, combined with the obvious Surveillance Ravens speaks to the possibility that the Demon of Secrets might be keeping a bit too many...","replies":[{"poster":"SeizureStorm","date":"2019-08-14T00:06:01.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Noxus isn't a real country and their politics shouldn't be anything close to ours.

Not because they genocided their own troops.\n\nI'm not sure why Riven's voiceover is completely contradictory to the lore she was originally written with and I haven't read any lore since the Jinx story that came out around Universe's launch so if her modern lore fits her VO better, then I stand corrected.

Proving ones skill and strength through hard work and determination was her way of life, and what she tried to share with her men.  However the chemical bombing that Swain authorized Singed to perform on the battlefield was a total opposite of what she held as her core beliefs.  Hence why she regrets her actions, in her new perspective the true honor and Noxian way is lost to a Noxus under Swain.  A Noxus that sacrifices both her men and the enemy forces through chemical warfare is cowardly and vile to her.  Consider that as well she lost all of her unit before her eyes, as well most likely in quite the ugly fashion and then you have the makings of some serious self hating and regret. \n\nI wouldn't say she regrets her service to Noxus, she clearly still loves her homeland, but at the same time she has some misgivings about it's current leadership and the part she unknowingly played into their power struggles.   As well she's been living integrated with the Ionans for a while and has learned other ways to view life in her self imposed exile.
