I queued and got a team and 3 of them were in a party. so starts out normally and basically they just let me die and dont ever help. so i ask why they dont help me and blah blah blah, basically they reported me for hate speech for swearing. they said that swearing is not allowed. and after being reported that last time by those people i got a chat restriction and i dont want to have tier one punishment for something i didn't do. if i got reported 1 more time for actually BEING toxic then i would accept but i got pushed over the edge by false reported.","replies":[{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-11-06T23:53:03.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot check your chat logs, and if they come across a variety of \"words\" which trigger it's system then it will punish you.\n\nYou can talk to Support in a ticket about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Who Fed Dep","date":"2017-11-07T02:04:56.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats not how the system works. it is the tribune system, a spike in reports = punishment. it doesnt check logs at all.
