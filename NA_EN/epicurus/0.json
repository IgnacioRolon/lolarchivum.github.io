This has happened every time I choose them, across several different game modes.\r\nNotably, these are the champs who have been updated since I installed League. Older ones like Sion and Tristana play the correct quotes.\r\nClearly, its not a game-breaking issue, but it&#039;s still irritating.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-07T18:58:45.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Epicurus - thanks for taking the time to report this! :) Lemme take a look and see what's going on here.","replies":[]}]}
