Weird right? I'd have to dig through some files in lolrecorder to find it, but I'll get a picture of me with the skin, or the file itself. It will take a bit to find, but I'm not sure why I no longer have it.\nHelp?\nEdit:\nI couldn't find anything in my files, is there anything to go far back and track your purchase history from a while ago to prove you bought it?","replies":[{"poster":"The V Sorrow","date":"2017-02-01T15:29:48.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can look in the store at purchase history/refunds page to see skins purchased and gifted.","replies":[{"poster":"GameyRouge38","date":"2017-02-01T16:46:46.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't go back far enough","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-01T04:40:03.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this happening in the Beta Client or the Legacy Client?
