Champ-select works just fine but when everybody picked the countdown freeze at 0 seconds. After a while it says that all my teammates has left the room and it just stays like that. If I restart the client to reconnect I can&#039;t reopen the client until I restarted my computer and it still won&#039;t let me join. I tried a full repair but it still stays the same. \r\n\r\nI can see in my match-history that I got &quot;Left&quot; games so the games are being played, it just doesn&#039;t let me join. Have any one else experienced anything similar or have any idea as to how I fix this. I can also add that I am using the &quot;Low Spec Mode&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"Azmodius","date":"2017-05-08T22:47:59.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya!
