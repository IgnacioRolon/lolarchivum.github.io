The boy who stole it gave literally no evidence, yet somehow managed to get the password and email changed.\r\n\r\nNow my husband is caught up in the long, stressful process of trying to get his account back. However, he's unable to provide some of the information you guys require. Such as the date he first purchased RP, first credit card number, etcetc. The reason why is because this account is over 5/6 years old. Unless you had a photographic memory, I mean, who WOULD remember that kind of stuff? He is however able to give very detailed and descriptive information on the things he does remember about the account, and even has a few pictures on social media and the likes of his account before name changes and such.\r\n\r\nWe've also found a site which had numerous leaked usernames and passwords of league accounts and provided this to Riot in the ticket, yet they keep on closing his tickets saying he's unable to provide enough details. (The only reason they say this, is because he's unable to answer those few questions as credit card numbers, refunds, purchases, dates etc from 5+ years ago.)\r\n\r\nAfter numerous tickets being sent, with as much information, pictures and details as he can possibly give, they just keep on closing the ticket. I find it a  bit absurd, since they change the account details for this hacker so easily, yet they're making it near impossible for my husband to get his account back.\r\n\r\nAny help or tips would be appreciated, this has been going on for three months now, he's given up. He's sent lengthy emails to the whoever is handling his case, about how he can't give the information, and can merely give guesses and such, but they're always ignored, and the tickets always end up closed for 'lack of evidence', despite every field except maybe three? being filled.\r\n\r\nHelp?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-20T03:35:34.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our account recovery agents are unable to recover an account until we've been provided with enough information to verify the account creator. Some information can certainly be hard to recall, but until we can ensure we're recovering the account to the right person, we cannot release the account.\n\nUltimately, you'll have to have your husband reach back out in a new [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) after reviewing the required information in order to attempt recovery again. Since your husband posted League content and screenshots on social media, it may be beneficial to go through that data in order to verify he's providing the most accurate details to our recovery specialists.\n\nIf you have any other questions about the account, feel free to submit another ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Śmøl ßirb","date":"2017-02-20T08:33:46.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, Targon.\n\nIs it not enough to provide a screenshot of the email and point out the mistakes that Riot made? The biggest one being - The hacker claims his account was hacked, and the email was changed on him. Yet the Signup email (which the hacker claims to have access to) and at the time, was the linked email to the account in question, was the email the hacker was claiming had been changed?\n\nIt seems like a really big blooper on Riot's part, and to go through all this rigmarole and hassle is just stressing, especially when Riot Support won't acknowledge that they are in fact at fault for this mishap :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kitty x God","date":"2017-02-19T22:51:13.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened yesterday to me too, 6 year old account, diamond, got hacked and banned for no reason, whithout even getting an explanatory email by Riot. I've spent thousands of dollars in this account and I'm very annoyed. If they were able to hack and change emails/passwords without even sending me an email with the required passcode then this security problem is on THEM, not me. Also, everytime I send a ticket to Riot support I get an email with something in portuguese that I don't understand even though I picked NA server. They also changed my account name to \"MYQQ\" and some numbers I don't remember, I wonder if this happened to you too. I'm so upset about this, and specially at Riot's poor customer service. This is unbelievable.","replies":[{"poster":"Śmøl ßirb","date":"2017-02-19T23:45:21.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree. They have strict protocols for getting back accounts, so why isn't this applied when people say \"Help my account was hacked this is the wrong email.\" Riot, please. You need some better staff on your support tickets.\n\nI mean this dude literally went \"Help my account is hacked, this is the wrong email.\" Ok what's the signup email? \"Oh the same email here I have access to it.\"\nWtf? If your account was 'hacked' you wouldn't have access to the 'hacked' email. ","replies":[]}]}]}
