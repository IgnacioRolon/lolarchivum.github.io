A minute later, \"Attempting to Reconnect\" error message. after reconnecting to my internet multiple times to remedy the problem, it happens again. I reconnect manually to the game. Same problem. Note: League is the only game to which I lag out to this extent. My ISP is Charter Spectrum. But it seems that no matter what application I use (Haste, WTFast, etc.) I still lag out, despite my internet connection being fine.
