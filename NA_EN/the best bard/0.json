The idea of this came from the frustration I see a lot of people get after trading with a Darius and they die from a tick they can&#039;t control.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-10T21:22:13.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this would sound like a good idea, it leaves the opponent feeling cheated.  If they move, they're going to take a lot of damage (damage would have to be buffed a little to compensate for the small nerf), but if they stay still, he's going to keep beating their face in.\n\nIt would actually make Darius even more snowball reliant as well.  If enemies don't have to run from/kite him, he'll lose out on a lot of damage.  Overall, while it sounds fun/interesting on paper, it just wouldn't work so well in-game.","replies":[{"poster":"The Best Bard","date":"2016-07-11T09:34:43.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea was to give the player affected by the bleed a choice, either they run and take damage or face him without the bleed. Also, the whole I idea came from the frustration of being under your own tower after a fair trade only to die to the tiniest tick of bleed. Why does that have to be in the game? The bleed still works in combat but it doesn't give that cheese feel.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-07-10T20:57:29.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see where you're going with this, but I'm not too sure. Remember that Darius has a pretty low base AD, so it would sort of screw up the whole straight up brute force damage identity that juggernauts are meant to have. He'd lose straight up duels most likely  :O","replies":[]}]}
