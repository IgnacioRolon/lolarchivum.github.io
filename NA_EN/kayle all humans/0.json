My main account has its email and password changed all of a sudden. It happened before even though my computer seemed completely secure, but still kept happening to the point where i was warned Riot wouldn't help again. I asked them to lock my account if the email was changed so at least there is that. I had logged into it no problem 3 hours ago, used a $25 gamecard, and logged off. Now I can't and I don't know what to do with it anymore. Already posted a ticket to Riot but I doubt anything can come of it since I was warned. I came here to see if anyone had any idea if this is a bug or if i'm just hacked and unable to get it back.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T20:28:08.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't say for sure what could be causing your account to be accessed by an unauthorized user, but I suggest going over our [account protection](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) guide for some important safety practices.
