The way i think he could be nerfed was make it so his w is changed to where he dosn't dash to a target. It would be aoe and cause 1 - 2 near bye champions to share half of the shield that lee sin gains. He can cast it again to give himself life steal but not any of the champions that received the shield. I don't do this that often so i'll prob get a ton of hate and people telling me its dumb but it think this is a good idea myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-12-20T04:41:39.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, do you mean nerf or buff? I'm honestly trying to put what you said in a different way, but the only thing I can get is that you want to make it free target instead of target based. This would be a HUGE buff, since he could dash around without even having to set up wards.","replies":[{"poster":"speedboy","date":"2014-12-20T04:51:58.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No i think he means remove the dash and replace it with an aoe shield.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-12-20T04:54:14.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, that makes much more sense. But then it doesn't really work. Lee is all about the mobility. Thats the one thing he's known for. If anything, hit his base damage but increase his scaling to compensate. So he'll have to actually build damage to do damage.","replies":[{"poster":"speedboy","date":"2014-12-20T04:57:35.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*read top comment*\n\n\nalso, I completely agree, same with {{champion:5}}, am I right?","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-12-20T05:01:24.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, {{champion:5}} 's in a good place. Reason being, as strong as he is, he's incredibly predictable. He can't juke or dash around.

Give him more Ratios and lower his base damage. Lee uses his mobility and early game to negate the face he has no late game. Make players have to make much better choices early game and make him scale better. They need to stop trying to make him an early game champ with his kit. They don't need to change his kit, just rework how it works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neidox","date":"2014-12-20T06:20:34.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the solution, remove the %damage on his Q. His Q Alone has 3 damage procs. The initial cast, the recast, and then the %damage which goes up due to the first 2 casts.","replies":[{"poster":"Keon Kamori","date":"2014-12-20T14:13:23.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. The biggest problem with Lee Sin, and the reason why he bullies out most other picks, is his unmatched early dueling potential. Overall he is too versatile as a champion and that needs to be changed. Its alright for a champion to effectively play two roles but this champ can play almost all of them with relative effectiveness.\n\nHowever if Riot wants to keep Lee Sin as he is they will need to nerf a lot more than just his q. His ult scales 200% bonus AD, needs nerf. Safeguard needs to not reduce the cooldown by half when used to dash to allies. Tempest needs to deal physical damage or scale with AP, or if it does scale with AD not another 100% bonus AD ratio. If that doesn't happen then Lee Sin will need a rework to some degree.\n\nIn short Lee Sin is broken that we all agree about. However it will be a while before Riot can come up with a fix that will balance him without making him unpick. There is a lot wrong with him balance wise both in numbers and in utility of his kit. The combination of high damage, and high utility, and high mobility, and an execute is hard to balance. If it were as easy as removing the execute from his Q it would have been done already.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2014-12-20T05:00:25.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an idea, but I think that's one of the parts of Lee they should keep. I'd rather get rid of his stealth detection and put more of his power in scaling so he needs to buy some damage.","replies":[{"poster":"speedboy","date":"2014-12-20T05:01:36.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"speedboy","date":"2014-12-20T04:55:10.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell me if you disagree, and since so many people hate lee sin this will get a lot of downvotes, but I personally think that lee sin was created to have incredible mobility. But I also think that he may have to much, and there I agree that he needs a nerf. Also, if Rito doesn't nerf his mobility for said reason above, I think they  should nerf his ridiculous damage. The amazing mobility + really high damage is REALLY broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wirius","date":"2014-12-20T04:45:09.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the OP meant you remove the dash entirely.
