On the 17th, you'll be able to purchase all of the 1350 RP skins for 975 RP each (PROJECT: Yi will remain full price because he's legendary), however you won't receive the border. \n\nNone of the PROJECT skins are legacy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jobais","date":"2015-09-11T21:31:22.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jobais","date":"2015-09-11T20:48:40.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so will i get the unique loading screen card if i buy the project skins that are in the limited tab thing?","replies":[{"poster":"KingWanahakalugi","date":"2015-09-11T21:08:10.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Si","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-09-11T20:36:04.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only the \"First Strike\" skins with the unique loading screen card are Limited. They will be on sale until the... 15th? I believe and then they'll be out of the shop until the 17th (so that they can be distributed properly) before the \"regular\" version of the PROJECT skins go for sale. They will then have a discounted price for a short time (discount but no special loading border) before going to normal price.\n\nAs far as I understand it, the regular skins will be regularly available and will not be going away.","replies":[]}]}
