After this run the game and log in, if you get security credentials it means its working and just keep pressing yes the chat service should work at this time. Then log out and change date back to the correct on and log in again. \nHope it works {{champion:17}} {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackMoonSlayer","date":"2016-10-05T23:03:57.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same thing happening.
