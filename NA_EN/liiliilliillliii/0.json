Try to be patient and wait for the ticket reply.\n\nMy guess is that the notification was an error and you've been permabanned. I've seen this before, where a player gets the notification for a 14 day but the ban doesn't lift after that, so when they ask Riot they are told it was a permaban and the message was mistaken.\n\nDon't just assume that's the case, though. Take a break from League and enjoy something else in the meantime.","replies":[{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-02-05T01:33:22.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"or get used to never enjoy league again rip perma bann :D","replies":[]}]}]}
