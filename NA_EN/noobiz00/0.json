I found this thread interesting, as i have the same problem. A few days ago, i upgraded to Windows 10 in my PC; and I checked it outand its quite cool xD. Point is, as i opened LOl to play, (as always), i found that i was getting fine ping (according to my region), but halved FPS. Logically, the game lags and stutters all. So i was searching for a little help around the boards. Thanks beforehand.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T15:33:43.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Friend,\n\nFPS issues can be caused by a number of factors, but after an OS upgrade, the most likely causes are bad graphics drivers or missing/corrupt files in your League installation.

Still 30 FPS:( \nAnd in top of that, it now freezes and stutters.\nPlease i need some help :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T15:37:23.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see you put in a ticket, so with your patience, a tech specialist will get back to you soon.","replies":[{"poster":"zarakisempai","date":"2016-09-05T20:14:07.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=IT6WO197,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-07T15:37:23.834+0000)\n>\n> I see you put in a ticket, so with your patience, a tech specialist will get back to you soon.\n\nHi Targons Blade, i rolled back to WIN7 and the issue seems to have followed me. I sent a ticket and everything, but i dont know, i dont know what else to think. Any ideas, or a possible fix for this?\n(Issue is: in every single game, my stable 70+FPS goes to 0-1 and i cant move, or control anything. I just hear the annoying slow and stuttered sound of the game in a super \"slow motion mode\".\nIt happens with almost every champion i can use. It happens from custom games to normal 5v5 and ARAMs. It happens at the start, or sometimes at 20 min of game, or sometimes just randomly. Other times, like 1 out of 10, it doesnt happens.\nIts super annoying. PLS Help.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-06T16:53:04.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at the ticket you have open with one of our tech specialists.
