An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n* Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nFrom [Understanding Getting Permabanned](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054013-Understanding-Getting-Permabanned): \n\n>**WHY DID I GET PERMABANNED?**\nYou got permabanned because you continued your disruptive behavior. Usually by the time you have reached being permabanned, you have already been banned before. During each of these bans, you have been given your chat logs or other kinds of evidence that have led to the bans to help you learn and improve your own actions.\n\n>**I DON’T DESERVE THE BAN! ANOTHER PLAYER DESERVES IT.**\nWe can not discuss other players’ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in-game. Regardless of how others act, there is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words.\n\n>**WHAT I SAID IN GAME DIDN’T DESERVE A BAN.**\nWe work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. Again, **this is not the first time you have been told your actions were inappropriate.** We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nFrom [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nThese kinds of rules aren't exclusive to League either as they apply to real life as well. Most businesses will have no problems throwing out people fighting with each other and disrupting business regardless of who started it. The \"they started it/were worse\" excuse didn't work in school and it doesn't work here.\n\nP.S. Us forum mods don't work for Riot and are simply volunteers and thus have no bearing on who receives game account punishments or not. At this point you've been given all the info you need, so you can either accept the facts and move on or continue to act like you are always right and get nowhere in the future, you're choice.\n\nP.S.S Incorrect punishments are overturned, such as if it was overly harsh or overly lenient, but punishments not given in error are not overturned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBrothersGrymm","date":"2019-07-22T05:59:46.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"they spend more money","replies":[]},{"poster":"SanZero","date":"2019-07-22T17:53:52.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't know if it about \"bully side\", but sure they will not be on yours \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]}
