Their attacks are different, their looks are different, their blessings are different. Logically they all thrive in different environments: deserts/volcanic regions, underwater/swampy, mountainous, or suuuuuper high up. \r\n\r\nThis being said, they should all sound distinctly different. In the same way that the elder dragon sounds different from the normal dragons. That is thematically, yahoo!\r\n\r\nSo what should a fire/earth/water/air dragon sound like? Infernal, Mountain, Ocean, and Cloud for the nitpickers.\r\n\r\nInfernal - Sounds basically how the dragon sounds now. Fire is always the base magic being spit from a dragon&#039;s mouth.\r\nMountain - I imagine more of a bellowing roar, much deeper, less pitchy than the one in place now. Heavy vibrations that could literally shake the mountains.\r\nOcean - Something throaty. It likely breathes underwater, spends a lot of time there, so it has little need for it&#039;s actual vocal chords. It would sound strained, something that could echo through water, but need to be forced above sea level. Maybe add some bubbles too for effect.\r\nCloud - Something high pitch and screechy.\r\n\r\nHelp me out guys! Wouldn&#039;t this be much better? Thematically speaking? :O","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2016-08-05T19:41:41.944+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with ya bud!
