As one of the least picked marksmen (for obvious reasons), she needs to just get deleted from the game. Nobody is gonna touch her after they get used to the visuals. They&#039;ll be like, oh. Eh. She still does nothing. \r\n\r\nShe needs an entirely new kit. Stripped down. This bounty hunter couldn&#039;t catch a damn squirrel, let alone kill it. Her W is weak, designed for extended trading, which she has no way to secure because her move speed can be interrupted and her slow is now 2 seconds, instead of 3. Her attack speed on her W active is only slightly better than buying a dagger at the first level, which we all know might help get one more auto off in trades (a wopping 3 extra magic dmg, scaling off ad). She has no cc for herself, nor mobility, and most viable marksmen actually have one or the other.. or both.... Kalista.\r\n\r\nShe doesn&#039;t stand a chance against any of the marksman now, let alone int he future if Riot continues this &quot;A new champion can now do TWELVE things with 4 abilities! Miss Fortune is completely obsolete and this leads to boring gameplay, unrewarding gameplay, and just suck ass games. I used to love MF. Thought she was a goddess. Then they changed everything to this AD equals magic damage and AP equals physical damage. Rest in peace that shitty ult which can barely clear a minion wave. Her AP Mage Fortune is extremely strong, but how in the hell does that even make sense? She is a marksman! This is total crap! \r\n\r\nWhy Riot. WHY. She is the weakest. THE WEAKEST. And you take away a buff that might actually make her worthy!","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-07-11T04:21:24.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">  Her AP Mage Fortune is extremely strong, but how in the hell does that even make sense?

This exactly. If the MF rework launches in it's current state, it just goes to show you that the balance team literally have no idea what the fuck they're doing.
