Hows does one go about doing so?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I been trying new champs and roles, and notices that its hard to improve as games are so different, some games you will not get any ganks from enemy jungle and are or very easy, other games you can finally get a challenge and other lane will feed then your lane gets over run by 4 players.\r\n\r\nWhat i trying to get at is, how do you know if what you are doing when games are so different, some super easy you can win with a dps soraka, others you need to be real serious to even stay alive.\r\nI just wish there was a way to practice so you can tell you are getting better or doing the right things.  Some kind of practice mode maybe is in order for this game?  Make scripted scenarios?  I not really sure. \r\nWhat do you guys do too improve?","replies":[{"poster":"Paladin 0f Life","date":"2016-11-03T05:50:01.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most pros play upwards to 1200 games a season at least. Me i play like 400. One of the differences is game time, a lot like wrestling. You do better the more you play around and test stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-11-03T03:18:00.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch streams and just play more in general. It also helps if you have a curious streak, because you can learn lots of things when you step out of your comfort zone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-11-03T03:01:13.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Focus on matchups, then focus on how to beat them, then focus on how to win lane, then focus on how to roam, then focus on what to do midgame and how to group, then focus on objectives/lategame.....\n\n\nidk but decision making is one of the most important things. Maybe taking a supporty champ that fights and peels for people would help such as {{champion:34}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:26}} so it forces you to pay more attention to teamfights and learning to know waste cc or when/how to peel ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sintama","date":"2016-11-03T03:00:20.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You play until you learn something. You can watch High-ELOs, but you won't get anything because low ELO is extremely different. The only true way to learn is to get shit on consistently by High-ELOs and then try and figure out what you did wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-03T02:47:39.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what endless said, also learning all 5 roles will help you understand the synergy between them","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-11-03T02:34:50.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend watching high-ELO players, observing what they do and trying to understand their reasoning behind it.\n\nI tend to learn through osmosis, so that tends to give me a solid baselines for a champion/role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verns","date":"2016-11-03T02:34:41.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok nise{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}
