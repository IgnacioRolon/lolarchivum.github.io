And because of how powerful he is the enemy team usually has to send at least 2 people to stop me from pushing lane, as not much can solo a tanky champ that has really good DPS.\nPoint being I really do not think a champ should be able to melt towers that quick.","replies":[{"poster":"Akenero","date":"2016-10-23T21:29:36.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of champs can push as fast as nasus, like tristana, jinx, Jax, Olaf, tryndamere(try building Hydra on him instead of Bork), and propably more that I'm not thinking of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I hate my ADC","date":"2016-10-23T19:14:59.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do we really have to explain you why you shouldn't make assumptions out of one game played with a champion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-23T19:19:25.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is currently very weak and almost never played.\n\nRemember the rule of ELOW: Everything is OP when people suck, especially tanks. Nasus snowballs incredibly hard, and bad players tend to not understand that you have to prevent him quietly farming in some corner of the map for the first 20 minutes of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-10-23T19:08:03.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering he has been underperforming all season and Riot just buffed him, I highly doubt they are going to nerf him.\n\nRiot has outright stated that pushing towers is one of Nasus' intended strengths, so I doubt they will have any issues with him fulfilling his intended role.","replies":[]}]}
