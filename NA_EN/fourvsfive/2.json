As support gold items will not gain lee any gold in jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-02-13T21:07:58.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"extra wards, free cs when he ganks with relic, can build other jungle item instead of {{item:3711}} idk weirder things have happened","replies":[{"poster":"FourVsFive","date":"2017-02-13T22:17:05.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Toshiai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=P9sdWEJ2,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-02-13T21:07:58.690+0000)\n>\n> extra wards, free cs when he ganks with relic, can build other jungle item instead of {{item:3711}} idk weirder things have happened\n\nIf you think its worth it then sure, but I do not think spending 1,150 gold for 2 slot items or combined for 2,200 gold is gonna be that OP of a strat that it would matter much. I sure people would rather save that slot for a more useful item, with more dmg or tank ability.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-02-13T21:07:21.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Dude why can't my champion who's balanced around not needing gold to function get free gold?!?!\"\n\n\"Dude why can't I play a burst-mage bot and be as deadly as the mages mid who have to actually farm to get their items????????\"\n\nYou want gold?
