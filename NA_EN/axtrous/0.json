Where can Xayah drop tower aggro more than once in a single sitting? Where can Zed drop tower aggro more than once in a single sitting?\n\nThey don't, they all have something in common: It's a once use thing, meaning that they either commit fully, or they disengage completely. Akali's new W is different, where she can place it, walk in it, walk out of it, and get her stealth back again, dropping turret aggro multiple times.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-07-16T22:30:23.000+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"and unlike them, everytime she drops the aggro SHE TAKES FULL DAMAGE OF THE TOWER SHOT \n\nthis boards is fucking unreal","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2018-07-17T02:43:01.523+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hope you're joking with this thread\n\n{{champion:432}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:141}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3157}}  {{item:2419}}","replies":[{"poster":"Darkneslso","date":"2018-07-17T15:02:53.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PopcornBunni,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VZruFEW5,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-07-17T02:43:01.523+0000)\n>\n> I really hope you&#x27;re joking with this thread\n> \n> {{champion:432}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:141}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3157}}  {{item:2419}}\n\nYeah but they're either dropping turret agro by ult or when they do drop turret agro they cant drop it again less than a second later, nor can they stay under turret for 5+ seconds without taking agro.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-07-16T22:07:53.597+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, it isn't like ***half of assassins can drop aggro anyways*** or anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-07-17T15:22:16.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Classic Forum though process: Do not like a part of a kit based off of how it sounds?\n\nCheck if CertianlyT was a part of the development:\nif Yes, say its his fault\nIf, No just complain about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-07-16T22:49:42.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I have seen, she is revealed under towers, but cant be autoed.
