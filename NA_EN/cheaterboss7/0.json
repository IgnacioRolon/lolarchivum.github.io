Today I have been permanently banned but I really don't know why because, Only one person reported me and it was a player who was insulting me and to be honest I got very offended... I know I didn't do the right thing but I did not insult him as you can see in the messages below. (If you can go and check the whole chat log, as I did not insult anyone) I simply believe that I got falsely banned as before I was banned because I was maybe a little toxic but now I really tried to change and I still got banned. Frankly I don't know why I was really trying to not directly hate on any player in particular so I am quite suprised... anyway\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\ncheaterboss7: go mid\r\ncheaterboss7: yoooo\r\ncheaterboss7: relax please..\r\ncheaterboss7: you were too far in their tower\r\ncheaterboss7: relax and farm\r\ncheaterboss7: and we will win\r\ncheaterboss7: the top laner isn't that good I think\r\ncheaterboss7: so If you don't feed it's ok :)9\r\ncheaterboss7: WHY DIDN'T YOU PING KAYN WAS THERE KHA ZIX\r\ncheaterboss7: omg\r\ncheaterboss7: nbm it's ok\r\ncheaterboss7: really again??\r\ncheaterboss7: bot..\r\ncheaterboss7: well top it's bad situation\r\ncheaterboss7: sdon't int please..\r\ncheaterboss7: understand that they are now fed and you CAN'T 1v1 them\r\ncheaterboss7: so just stay back and sotp trying to\r\ncheaterboss7: $I got ganked again top\r\ncheaterboss7: wp..\r\ncheaterboss7: brand stop doing that\r\ncheaterboss7: you can't kill him\r\ncheaterboss7: ffs\r\ncheaterboss7: trust me we will win if you play safe\r\ncheaterboss7: :)\r\ncheaterboss7: I go defend top\r\ncheaterboss7: STOp\r\ncheaterboss7: BOT OMGF\r\ncheaterboss7: HOW THE HELL??\r\ncheaterboss7: so much damage'??\r\ncheaterboss7: you got 1 kill xD RIOT GAMES\r\ncheaterboss7: true you have a pont\r\ncheaterboss7: oof\r\ncheaterboss7: close one\r\ncheaterboss7: drake??\r\ncheaterboss7: what ezreal?\r\ncheaterboss7: xD\r\ncheaterboss7: you're 0/6 your problem is int\r\ncheaterboss7: lol\r\ncheaterboss7: 2v111\r\ncheaterboss7: ez don't feed Let me carry\r\ncheaterboss7: 0/7 rlyyy\r\ncheaterboss7: ;(\r\ncheaterboss7: WP\r\ncheaterboss7: gg carry\r\ncheaterboss7: DUDE YOU ARE 0/7\r\ncheaterboss7: stop it xD\r\ncheaterboss7: xDDD\r\ncheaterboss7: XDDDD\r\ncheaterboss7: sure\r\ncheaterboss7: ik it's funny\r\ncheaterboss7: xD\r\ncheaterboss7: stop inting please\r\ncheaterboss7: report ezreal for inting\r\ncheaterboss7: do you understand that we will report you and you will get banned soon?\r\ncheaterboss7: like really?\r\ncheaterboss7: so just play safe please\r\ncheaterboss7: LOOK\r\ncheaterboss7: he is actually inting\r\ncheaterboss7: reported noob\r\ncheaterboss7: gj\r\ncheaterboss7: coming mid\r\ncheaterboss7: careful pls\r\ncheaterboss7: dude you are the only one inting\r\ncheaterboss7: so stop flaming\r\ncheaterboss7: idc im reporting you anyway dude\r\ncheaterboss7: gj guys\r\ncheaterboss7: noo\r\ncheaterboss7: wp ezreal\r\ncheaterboss7: ok\r\ncheaterboss7: idk why I came back lol\r\ncheaterboss7: ofc ezreal is still there\r\ncheaterboss7: 0/10\r\ncheaterboss7: wow\r\ncheaterboss7: yep\r\ncheaterboss7: ik\r\ncheaterboss7: report him\r\ncheaterboss7: lol\r\ncheaterboss7: I can't when you're 0/10 dude\r\ncheaterboss7: you're giving them gold lmao\r\ncheaterboss7: report him\r\ncheaterboss7: thx\r\ncheaterboss7: well sorry I can't do anything\r\ncheaterboss7: lol ezreal I hope you get banned\r\ncheaterboss7: wait for me\r\ncheaterboss7: HELP\r\ncheaterboss7: PLEASE\r\ncheaterboss7: THEY ARE BOTH LIKE 100 HP\r\ncheaterboss7: gj kha zix\r\ncheaterboss7: ezreal reported idiot\r\ncheaterboss7: woops\r\ncheaterboss7: didn't know they were there\r\ncheaterboss7: we lost gg\r\ncheaterboss7: 0/13\r\ncheaterboss7: just stfu\r\ncheaterboss7: report ezreal for inting and flame plase\r\ncheaterboss7: thx\r\ncheaterboss7: lol\r\ncheaterboss7: you can clearly see he's inting lmao\r\ncheaterboss7: report him pls\r\ncheaterboss7: oh ok sorry\r\ncheaterboss7: xD\r\ncheaterboss7: all he's doing is inting and flaming\r\ncheaterboss7: if he was in your team we would have a thousand kills by now lol\r\ncheaterboss7: yeye ezreal ofc\r\ncheaterboss7: noob\r\ncheaterboss7: now he's afk lol\r\ncheaterboss7: no mf he's just inting garbage\r\ncheaterboss7: and he's flaming he deserves to get banned\r\ncheaterboss7: well yea actually\r\ncheaterboss7: stfu\r\ncheaterboss7: well idk flaming isn't because you play bad\r\ncheaterboss7: he's literally running it down and flaming xD\r\ncheaterboss7: wtf\r\ncheaterboss7: gg","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2020-02-29T22:03:10.803+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"This behavior seems bad enough for a punishment. You're responsible for your own behavior regardless of how other people are acting. What punishment you get often is dependent on what your previous punishment was (if any), how long ago it was, and your behavior during that time.\n\nIf you were recently off a 14-day ban I can certainly see this handing you a perma. After a 14-day ban you're on thin ice. Judging by your match history you have an exact 14-day gap of playtime ending 9 games ago. 9 Games is not nearly enough time by a long shot to lower you down the punishment ladder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-03-01T00:28:23.726+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=cheaterboss7,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bcgVJ3ox,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-02-29T21:54:49.013+0000)\n>\n> I have been permanently banned but I really don't know why\n> \n> cheaterboss7: what ezreal?\n> cheaterboss7: you're 0/6 your problem is int\n> cheaterboss7: ez don't feed Let me carry\n> cheaterboss7: 0/7 rlyyy\n> cheaterboss7: DUDE YOU ARE 0/7\n> cheaterboss7: stop it xD\n> cheaterboss7: xDDD\n> cheaterboss7: XDDDD\n> cheaterboss7: sure\n> cheaterboss7: ik it's funny\n> cheaterboss7: xD\n> cheaterboss7: stop inting please\n> cheaterboss7: report ezreal for inting\n> cheaterboss7: do you understand that we will report you and you will get banned soon?\n> cheaterboss7: like really?\n> cheaterboss7: LOOK\n> cheaterboss7: he is actually inting\n> cheaterboss7: reported noob\n> cheaterboss7: dude you are the only one inting\n> cheaterboss7: so stop flaming\n> cheaterboss7: idc im reporting you anyway dude\n> cheaterboss7: ofc ezreal is still there\n> cheaterboss7: 0/10\n> cheaterboss7: report him\n> cheaterboss7: I can't when you're 0/10 dude\n> cheaterboss7: you're giving them gold lmao\n> cheaterboss7: report him\n> cheaterboss7: lol ezreal I hope you get banned\n> cheaterboss7: ezreal reported idiot\n> cheaterboss7: we lost gg\n> cheaterboss7: 0/13\n> cheaterboss7: just stfu\n> cheaterboss7: report ezreal for inting and flame plase\n> cheaterboss7: you can clearly see he's inting lmao\n> cheaterboss7: report him pls\n> cheaterboss7: all he's doing is inting and flaming\n> cheaterboss7: if he was in your team we would have a thousand kills by now lol\n> cheaterboss7: yeye ezreal ofc\n> cheaterboss7: noob\n> cheaterboss7: now he's afk lol\n> cheaterboss7: no mf he's just inting garbage\n> cheaterboss7: and he's flaming he deserves to get banned\n> cheaterboss7: stfu\n> cheaterboss7: well idk flaming isn't because you play bad\n> cheaterboss7: he's literally running it down and flaming xD\n\nhttps://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/475/Screen_Shot_2018-10-25_at_11.02.15_AM.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"PekiCodex","date":"2020-02-29T22:16:21.667+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">I know I didn't do the right thing but I did not insult him as you can see in the messages below\n\n>cheaterboss7: reported noob\ncheaterboss7: ezreal reported idiot\ncheaterboss7: if he was in your team we would have a thousand kills by now lol\ncheaterboss7: yeye ezreal ofc\ncheaterboss7: noob\n\n>Firstly I understand why I was banned previously but now I really tried to change and understood that I should not insult/be toxic.\n\nYep, you most definitely learned your lesson last time.\nLook man, after a ban you need to understand you're being heavily watched on what you say.
