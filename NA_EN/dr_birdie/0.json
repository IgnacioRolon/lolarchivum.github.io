I've been suggesting we do them since I joined Riot and the Skins Team did an amazing job. Coincidentally some of the other concept artists on my team main Varus, Braum and Garen so I'm looking forward to playing jungle Gragas with them using the skins >xD","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Birdie","date":"2015-11-11T18:38:30.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I think about it, it _is_ weird that it took so long to get RPG-esque skins going. \n\nThat Ryze skin has been an obvious one from the start, going hand in hand with Veigar Greybeard.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-11-11T07:31:35.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will Diana get a Dark Sun Gwyndolin skin ????!!!!
