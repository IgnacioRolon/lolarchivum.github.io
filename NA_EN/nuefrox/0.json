In the FAQ they discussed how league summoner names are harder and harder to get original names, so they’ve implemented Riot ID’s for their new games and so that anyone can have any name essentially. I think that this is a bad idea. The best part of league (in my humble opinion) is making a name for yourself, but how are you supposed to do that if 10,000 other people can have your exact name? Its just not as fun and having unique summoner names is, well, unique! A lot of people like it that way.\n\nHere are some solutions I’ve thought of that could help out this “issue” of new players having to make more and more unoriginal names for themselves.\n\nIn League, if you don’t play for awhile your name is set to a timer of sorts, giving it about 900 days (if you’re above level 30 or something) to decay or expire before another player can pick it up. The issue with this in my opinion is that 912 days is a little outrageous. I would lower the days to maybe ~2yrs AND change it so when a name does decay or expire, new players can pick that up on their fresh level 1 accounts, because at the moment it costs either 1300 RP or 13900 Blue Essence to claim a name that has expired, which I think is a little unlogical showing that this leaves TONS of names that ex-players had open, but only available through a name change.\n\nAnother point a friend of mine made is that you can’t just ask someone for their League name to add them, but instead their name and #. That all just seems a little excessive when we could just keep it close to how it is now.\n\nI believe that keeping unique summoner names per region is lovely! Personally, its what makes League of Legends, frankly, League to me (and tons of other people!).\n\n\n\n(P.S. I know they've made login usernames unique across all regions, but they want to change the in-game name/client name to be like discord names)","replies":[]}
