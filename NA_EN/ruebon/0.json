I have transferred an account before from EUW to NA and it was near enough instant. I have tried logging into the account on EUW where Its coming up with an error saying that my account transfer is in progress. I've tried logging into NA but its just not having it! Can anybody help me with this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T04:36:16.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still encountering issues with your transfer being in limbo?
