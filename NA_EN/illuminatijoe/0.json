It also slows down opponents, not allowing them to escape your grip. Helps with farming and great for 1v1s and 2v1s. It's possible to cancel channels with the active. Gives sustain in the battle and scales well with health. It would work excellently on {{champion:39}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:83}}","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-03T20:25:00.613+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change one of the passive names to \"Spellblade\" so it can't be stacked with other Sheen items without losing a little effectiveness.\n\nAs for balance, I'm a mage guy, so I can't really say how strong this would be (though the tenacity and healing increase seems a bit excessive).","replies":[{"poster":"IlluminatiJoe","date":"2018-01-04T06:58:29.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still stacks with other Sheen items, because it has a different name for the passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-05T11:04:33.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You want it to stack?
