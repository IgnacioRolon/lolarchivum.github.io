I did in fact rage but at no particular player. I quote &quot;fuck this %%%%%% tank meta&quot; and was permanently banned for saying so. I don&#039;t understand why it&#039;s okay to ban my account worth over $500 for saying words. And feeders cheaters and all around quitters are scott free with leaver buster warning up the wazoo. If you feel I need a time out, then so be it suspend my account, but taking my money for saying cuss words on a game that is meant for a &quot;_mature_&quot; audience is just ridiculous. I have never cheated or went afk in any game out of the over 8k games I have played. Honestly riot I respect your decisions on most things but banning me permanently for a problem easily fixable by muting me or turning profanity filter on is just savage.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-01-24T22:18:26.392+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to post your chat logs if you'd like to have a discussion about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Epic Chaos Sage","date":"2016-01-24T22:23:13.320+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"why is it that certain players receive a response from riot and others dont?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-01-24T22:28:48.419+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you mean.
