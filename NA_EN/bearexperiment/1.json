Sure he looks kinda cool, like Shredder from TMNT, but the real reason everybody mains him is because he is incredibly easy to use. Everything is point and click, and his 1 skill shot is fast moving, huge, and is mostly used from point blank range when you point and click ULT onto someone, right click them, and then teleport to safety. \n\nHere is a description of how assassins are supposed to fit in LoL: Assassins specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put them themselves into **dangerous positions** in order to execute their targets. What is dangerous about Invulnerably teleporting up to a target (without aiming anything), nuking them, and then immediately teleporting to safety?\n\nBut Bear, what about the elite plays with all the shadows? Gimmick, totally unnecessary for bursting down high priority targets. I would love to see emphasis on rewarding Zed players who are skilled with using their shadows offensively, but sadly it's just not important. Can be a useful skill once in a blue moon, but hardly essential for becoming an effective nuking machine.\n\nI think we can all finally admit why everyone is a Zed main.\n\n[](https://i.imgur.com/F8IWkA1.jpg)\n\n(https://i.imgur.com/F8IWkA1.jpg)\n\n(https://i.imgur.com/wqzAntH.jpg)\n\n(https://i.imgur.com/o45wrqT.gif)\n","replies":[{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-09-08T05:17:41.112+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":4,"body":"Being good at Zed can require a high skill level, but being bad at Zed still allows for easy exits out of bad plays while still offering him a high amount of dps without hard to hit skill shots.\n\nEdit: unless your team has a lot of CC, but good CC doesn't start happening until you get in high ranks. \n\nEdit again: this thread about Zed can actually be applied to most high mobile assassins.

If getting so many free lanes against so many other champs wasn't enough he also is a high scaling snow balling champion for 30 minutes of a game. He doesnteven really fall off late game either, his enemies just finally catch up, scaled some armor, and have a bunch of shit to actually be able to deal with his existence.\n\nHis passive makes csing very easy so even if you push him under turret it doesn't matter, he also wont mindcause then the jg will see an easy kill because zed. You aren't  that much safer under your own turret of course so what ever. \nHE STARTS LONG SWORD!!! is there another champion that does this??? Most need some on hit to minions and a little sustain for either hp or resources but not zed no. No zed is gonna do just fine with a long sword and three potions giving him effectively a 2.5 wave gold advantage towards getting his first item which will be all he needs to 100 to 0 you. Its because of this if you aren't using the champs that counter him by just being able to survive you will build zonyas like so many champs don't want to do effectively putting 1 of the teams carries behind in mid game. \nNot only do his abilities have short animations but he can cast them at the same time. So if you have a delay on the one you were hoping would save you or an ally well fuck you.\n\nMy complaints aside, has anyone ever honestly been that impressed seeing a Zed go 20/5/4 or something like that in a long game? Has anyone seen a zed do poorly and thought \"oh well zed is a skill champ so I cant judge too hard\". No you expect most azirs to do poorly, you expect most zeds to come to your lane to steal the kill you have been poking down then proceed to combo away all your cs. \n\nEVEN though Zeds max potential has a bit of mastering and reflexes involved he DOESNT require it in 90% of the situations he kills someone in 3-5 seconds. He will always be harder to play against then to play as well. Wanna say get better well he even has high ban rates in high elos. Even if you ignore that fact also consider if a champion really takes the skill of the best players to fight him with the way his kit is that isn't an argument he is reasonable to play against, in fact its exactly the opposite.","replies":[{"poster":"BearExperiment","date":"2018-09-08T06:06:22.633+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you for your honesty.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P4ppino","date":"2018-09-08T05:24:28.160+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":29,"body":"Zed is one of the few champions who's kit allows the player to be better with each game, but never truly master the champion.

Fun...\n\nCurrently, where the game is at assassins are low risk, high reward. They just get some early kills on the weakest link on your team and snowball out of control. Even worse is the fact they can still 100 to 0 you in seconds without a kill, and escape easily with their absurd mobility...\n\nEnough ranting, here is my main point:\nAssassins are anti-fun for everyone except the player playing the assassin.\nDoes it feel good getting one shot? Of course it doesn’t. I play mainly mages, and I shouldn’t be required to buy a {{item:3157}} Zhonyas in order to survive, and even then the assassin will usually wait until I am out of stasis and kill me anyway (Zhonyas only really works well under tower or in a team fight for me, though it works different for every champion/player).\nTo all Assassin mains out there, does it feel good, knowing the players on the other side are suffering? It is very unsatisfying to die instantly, and it is downright frustrating.\n\nI think overall assassins fundamentally break the game and make it not fun for the players on the receiving end. Most assassins have a low skill floor (like Zed) and a high cap to reward experienced players (I still don’t like Zed though, coming from a mage player the skill shot is very easy and the free last hit is not necessary). Though experience can mean little. A new assassin is no fun to fight, while an experienced one is torture.\nTo conclude, burst should be definitely toned down in the next season (which looks good so far), I should be able to react and try to save myself before my death. Also generally playing assassins shouldn’t result in an easy lane.\n\nSorry for the long post, hopefully I wasn’t dragging on too much, and apologies to assassin mains.

Every 20 sec the Dark Shadow will update its position.\nZed's 2nd basic attack against champions he's hit with an ability within 8 sec while within their Dark Shadow below 25 / 35 / 50%(scaling with lv) maximum health deal 6 / 8 / 10% of target's maximum health as bonus magic damage.\n\nShadowed Contempt for the Weak can only affect the same target once every few seconds.\n\nQ - the dmg is nerfed a little\n\nW - Living Shadow\tTARGET RANGE: 475 EFFECT RADIUS: 700 SPEED: 1600 \nCOST: 40 / 35 / 30 / 25 / 20 ENERGY COOLDOWN: 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 ENERGY RESTORED: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50\nLiving Shadow\t\nFIRST CAST: Zed's Shadow dashes forward, remaining in place for 5 seconds and being able to mimic Razor Shuriken and Shadow Slash. Zed restores energy whenever a Shadow lands a mimicked ability on the same target he does. This may only happen once per cast ability. Casting at the same time as Razor Shuriken grants 175 bonus range.\n\nSECOND CAST - SHADOW SWAP: Zed and his Shadow blink to their respective locations, swapping places after a 1 sec delay. The range is increased to 1300 If Zed's Shadow is within a Dark Shadow.\n\nE - Shadow Slash:\tEFFECT RADIUS: 290 ANGLE: 40 \nPHYSICAL DAMAGE:\n35 / 47 / 60 / 70 / 85 (+ 40% bonus AD)\nCONE BONUS DAMAGE\n(50% + 40% bonus AD)\nACTIVE: Zed and his Shadows slash, dealing physical damage to surrounding enemies dealing bonus damage in a cone in the direction Zed is facing. This does not interrupt Zed's previous orders.\nEnemies hit a Shadow's Shadow Slash Cone are slowed for 1.5 seconds. Enemies hit by multiple slash cones take no additional damage but instead are slowed by a 50% stronger slow.\nSLOW:»\n20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40%\nEach enemy champion hit by Zed's slash cone reduces Living Shadow's Cooldown by 2 seconds. Only the enemies hit by the cone restore energy. \n\n\nR - Death Mark\tTARGET RANGE: 625 EFFECT RADIUS: 300 COOLDOWN: 120 / 90 / 60\t\nFIRST CAST: Zed targets an area on the ground and vanishes for 0.75 seconds during which he goes through the target area if an enemy champion is within. If he passes through them, he marks them, becomes ghosted for 3 seconds, and spawns a Shadow at the cast location which lasts for 6 seconds. After 1 second of his reappearance he can activate Death Mark Shadow.\n\nFor the next 3 seconds, the mark stores a percentage of all pre-mitigation physical and magic damage Zed deals to the target, reduced if Death Mark is recast, detonating at the end of the duration to deal physical damage.\n\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE:\n100% AD (+ 25 / 40 / 55% of damage dealt, reduced by 15% if Recast)\nSECOND CAST - DEATH MARK SHADOW: Zed and the Death Mark Shadow blink to their respective locations, swapping places.\n\nthe purpose of these changes are to introduce a bit a of delay, positioning and targeting difficulty into Zed's kit.","replies":[{"poster":"BearExperiment","date":"2018-09-15T05:37:25.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this for real, or are you suggesting this?","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-09-15T06:10:02.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BearExperiment,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KHlp7UjX,comment-id=005e0000,timestamp=2018-09-15T05:37:25.477+0000)\n>\n> Is this for real, or are you suggesting this?\n\noh we all wish it was real dont we all.

Zed has a small delay until he can teleport back to his shadow and the ONLY ability that is point and click is his ult. If Zed is so easy to play, why don't you first time him in ranked and get to challenger?\n\nIf Zed is so OP and easy to play why is his winrate 49.34% and he is ranked at #97?","replies":[{"poster":"PsychoWhite","date":"2018-09-08T17:17:39.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Zed is also played by low elo players who die a lot and have no idea how to play.

Out of all those players, bad, good, me, doesn't matter, his winrate doesn't drop. Because even  a silver, even me can just pick him up and win a game by themselves, in my first Zed game I had no problem getting free kills as long as I was 1v1ing someone and didn't have his team near him. While there are other champions that if you pick for the first time you can't have such a positive impact in game. My way of judging what champion is easy and what not I always just play for myself and see how much effort I must put in in order to be effective, to be a positive aspect in a match. like when I play Yasuo once a month, I never have to try to win my lane, I just win automatically and if the enemy makes a mistake I punish it. With Zed is the same, if I'm playing Zed and I just farm and roam at a jungle fight and kill my enemy midlaner or jungler by pressing R and smashing my buttons then I see how much less effort I had to put into affect the game positively than if I was playing Azir, Xerath, or a champion that I actually had to be careful when farming, having to watch for ganks and stuff, because when I play Yasuo or Zed I never worry about ganks or resources spend because I can easily escape them(if I blow flash I will be careful).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
