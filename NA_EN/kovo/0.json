We&rsquo;ll continue to listen to feedback as these go to PBE and make changes accordingly.**\r\n\r\nFirst off... wow! We received an incredible amount of feedback and reaction yesterday after we [announced we are bringing emotes permanently to League](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/08/dev-introducing-emotes/). This feedback is what helps us deliver a better experience, so we sincerely appreciate hearing your concerns upfront. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the reasons we&rsquo;re gonna keep emotes on PBE for so long: So we can continue to make changes based on your feedback as you try them out.\r\n\r\nWe understand the clear concern about emotes potentially causing toxicity/BM. We also know that this product won&rsquo;t be for everybody, so we can see why frictionless opting-out has been a major thread so far. \r\n\r\nThis is why we tied emotes to chat mutes. This type of muting is intended to punish people who are misusing the system, rather than blocking everybody right off the bat. In our tests, emotes have led to some really memorable moments when used in earnest, and we want to give those a chance. \r\n\r\n**Still, we&rsquo;re ready to explore broader mute options like a &ldquo;mute all enemy emotes&rdquo; button, a &ldquo;mute emotes&rdquo; button for each teammate (similar to the ping muting button), or both.**\r\n\r\nThere are systems that we already have in place, too, that we can adjust during testing. One  that&rsquo;s in place is an &ldquo;ammo&rdquo; system, which limits the ability to spam emotes (similar to how pings currently work). We have a lot of leeway to make this system as strict as it needs to be. We can adjust how frequently emotes can be used before a timeout period, how long that timeout period is, how frequently emotes can be used at all, etc. \r\n\r\nEmotes will be in testing on PBE until we are ready to do a staged rollout starting with a small number of regions. If you have a PBE account, we would really appreciate you giving them a try and leaving feedback as soon as you&rsquo;ve had a chance to play with them. \r\n\r\nThank you again&mdash;really. We know there&rsquo;s work to do, and we&rsquo;re excited to start iterating based on these conversations.","replies":[{"poster":"Gator Raid","date":"2017-08-09T23:09:14.415+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please add a permanent opt-out button in the client to permanently disable emotes. \n\nI don't mind you guys putting them in the game, and other players can buy and use them if they want, that's their choice.

(Just as I _will_ use my blinding dart to deny Nasus his stacks.) And I am pretty sure I am far from being alone with that. Honestly, I would rather like to have this \"strategic privilege\" of emotes removed somehow. Obviously, emotes being hid by minions would look terrible, and I really don't have a valid idea that could solve this while retaining the current form of emotes, but still... I'd rather have this thing not be in the game, instead of randomly getting on the advantageous or disadvantageous side from champ select. Even if the influence doesn't seem that terrible, it's still there...\nOne idea though (that doesn't retain the current form of emotes): What if they appeared on the ground under the champion? They wouldn't ever deny vision then from anything. Sure, a small bit of their visibility would be _potentially _cut off (champion placement just makes that tradeoff nonexistent for 90% of the time) but a large player concern (and with it, a small unfair disadvantage) would be removed.\n\n(PS: I'm sorry for the overwhelming negativity regarding this feature, hope you and the team don't get dragged down by it.
