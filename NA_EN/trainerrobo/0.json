Obviously, the Chem-Barons hate him because hes out to kill them, but do normal zaunite citizens even know about him? If they do, do they see him as a savior or a villain?

Urgot doesn't seem like a guy to let a random passerby walk away without testing their will to survive. \n\nAnd it's not like their lives haven't been stressful before: Zaun is a place of horrible chemical accidents, kidnappings, mutated rats, Mundos, cults and a place, in which you can get mauled after getting a papercut in case {{champion:19}} was nearby. I guess Urgot is something new to them because he doesn't want money, he doesn't want the chem tech resources, he doesn't want to be the knew kingpin of Zaun, he just comes out and causes carnage.   \n\nYet, he keeps Chem Barons twitchy and distracted, so this is something citizens of Zaun can appreciate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Provengreil","date":"2018-07-14T13:52:48.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just imagine him as the great hope of all arthritis patients.
