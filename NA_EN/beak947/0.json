Its definitely a bug, and maybe has been silently fixed? I dunno. Guess they don't want to return the capsules or admit the mistake actively, since its either too much hassle, or its another way to make players pay money.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T05:35:42.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just still being looked into is all.
