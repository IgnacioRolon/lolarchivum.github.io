But the next few days I experience a sudden FPS drop>freeze>black screen>repeat in-game and it's kind of irritating and I wonder why it happens to me only and not my friends. I tried to lower the quality and that didn't improve my FPS, I also tried to \"Repair\" corrupted files if there were any and it still didn't work for me. Is it because I have to update my graphics driver to the latest? It tells me that in my notification center exactly \"Application League of Legends has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware.\" and I don't know if there is a latest graphics driver. Someone help me please.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T22:38:57.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS problems can be caused by a lot of different factors, but I think your description, specifically the last part, really points out where the issue may lie.

If you' like, you can try uninstalling those updates or rolling back to before you installed them to see if anything changes. As for the video sample, you can toss it on any video hosting site and send me a link here if you'd like.","replies":[{"poster":"Kyû","date":"2016-08-09T00:30:02.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going back to previous update before I installed it was actually a great idea and it worked out really well.

Turn your Router/Modem off for 20-30 seconds than reboot it back up and test if the ping is better in a custom game.\n\n2. Try contacting your ISP about your internet service plan you're paying for. If you had lower ms normally and recently have been getting very high ms, it may be on there end. You will have to see what's going on with the download/upload speed plan.\n\n3.
