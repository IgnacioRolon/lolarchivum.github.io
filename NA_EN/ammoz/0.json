So naturally , you would be matched with higher ranked opponents. Those who are not in the group of friends have to deal with stronger opponents in lanes which might cause them to lose it. Then the flame from that group of friends is hurled right at you. Also, what is this matchmaking riot? I have multiple games where I had 4 golds and 1 plat vs 3 low plats, plat 1s and a gold. Shouldn&#039;t you consider their solo q rank when matching in flex?I think that riot should have a queue for just 5v5","replies":[]}
