This issue started immediately after the 7.6 patch which had installed perfectly fine.\r\n\r\n**The Symptoms:**\r\n1. During champion select, somebody may hover over a champion and ban/lock in, except my end never registers the ban or lock in. The counter still goes until it gets to zero, with the champion still being hovered, and nothing happens. When this happens, the client may suddenly get connection again and reaches to the present bans and picks and everything goes back to normal for a while, or when it's my turn to ban/pick I'm forced to dodge because my client refuses to connect and let me pick, then I'm automatically given a penalty.\r\n2. When I do get through champion select, the game loads perfectly fine. It takes no extra time to get me connected, which is one reason that lets me know this issue isn't internet related. However, during the game I will start to experience major lag spikes that are a little difficult to identify and explain. I don't know if there is an official name for it so I'm going to call it registry lag. Basically what happens is the game on my end stops registering anything that is happening in real time. I can still walk around, although it's more like buggy jumping and teleporting every couple of units. The minions, even after their health bars have disappeared, are still smacking and shooting each other and are occasionally jumping forward or backward. Sometimes I can see that I've taken damage from another champion, but there is never any animation or noise for it. Eventually everything will freeze and I will get the good ol' \"ATTEMPTING TO RECONNECT\" rectangle. When I do manage to reconnect, either my game is continuing with the registry lag or it miraculously *actually* reconnects to the match in real time. That never lasts.\r\n3. Around mid-game, I will get more registry lag, and then my game crashes. This has happened three times. The first two times, the client itself has crashed. There is no error message but a troubleshoot window has opened. Unfortunately, I am unable to access it because my computer still thinks that the game I was in is still open. It shows a black screen with the league of legends cursor and I cannot open up or click on any windows in front of it, even after doing alt-tab. The second time it crashed, the client opened up and let me reconnect. When I loaded back in and reconnected, surprise! More registry lag. I never got to see the end of the game because my team forfeited while I was lagging and my game was trying to reconnect indefinitely. I had to manually close out of the game.\r\n\r\n**I've already:**\r\n1. Restarted and updated my computer\r\n2. Gone into the launcher and repaired the client\r\n3. Restarted my router\r\n4. Tried to make league run on windows 7\r\n5. Run as administrator\r\n6. Uninstalled and reinstalled\r\n7. Scanned the client for viruses\r\n8. Searched the forums for solutions (see note)\r\n \r\nMy computer runs on Windows 8.\r\n\r\n**Special Note:**\r\nI wanted to make a thread about this solely to catch Riot's attention. I've seen many other people encounter this problem across multiple time frames and I've never once seen a Riot employee offer to help. I've seen people say that when they contacted Riot, Riot told them to post their issues in the forums, and when they do, there is no solution. If its patrons cannot find a viable solution to this problem, then it's time for Riot to actually look into the issue and figure out a way to fix it. My first guess would be there might be a problem with compatibility.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention, I would really appreciate it if a Riot official could offer me a solution or at least acknowledge that they've read this thread and are aware of the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"impulsive egg","date":"2017-03-28T21:59:34.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/228648563402473473/296398180130619403/packet_loss_1.png) is the second to last game that I played, which is one that crashed back to the client.

It doesn't look right at all. This looks like the game just erased the data of the network log after it crashed. The file was 9KB.\n\n[This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/228648563402473473/296398233788481538/packet_loss_3.png) is the first game I played last night, which also crashed to inaccessible troubleshoot. The file was 15KB.\n\nI also uploaded a [game log](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/228648563402473473/296400514399207437/no_packet_loss.png) from a couple of weeks ago to see what it should look like during a regular game. (I can't remember which one I used and what the size was but looking at the logs they're usually 10-15KB.\n\nBefore seeing this, I tried to play again today and before the game even started (I was loaded 100%) I got a message that said something about losing connection. It told me to check my internet connection and try again. I pressed ok and the black screen disappeared and the client made as if it were going to load like it does after a game but I never got to any screen. I just closed league and came on here. The thing is, I was on discord with my friends during this time and I was still talking to them perfectly fine, so I was and still am connected to the internet.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-30T21:08:42.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After looking over what the log reader told you, it does seem like packet loss would be the culprit for your 'registry lag'. The cause of that packet loss could be coming from somewhere on your network or even somewhere along it's way to our servers. \n\nIt'd be best for us to troubleshoot this one on one since there are a number of different issues that can cause packet loss.

Essentially what happens is this: somewhere along the stream of data going between your network and our servers, some of that data got lost along the way.

I never get the attempting to reconnect thing. But I still get major packet loss, it's all in real time but the animations or spells sometimes wont even show then everything jumps in at once. I have videos of it. Have talked to \"support\" through a ticket, still no help. All I get is \"Well we can try this to figure out the source of your high ping\" But, my ping isn't high, at all. Ever. I have videos of the packet loss and my ping is at a constant 45, I don't know what to do, it makes the game almost unplayable and not fun for me. Some games it will be normal and ill only get like one or no spikes but sometimes it gets REALLY bad.","replies":[]}]}
