It should serve as a warning to those posting when emotional.\n\n\nROLL BACK THE NEW CLIENT TO LEGACY*** OR CONTINUE LOSING PLAYERS\n\nI am unable to even access the page to launch my legacy client anymore. The size for the initial splash screen is incorrect, and I'm only able to see the top left 60% of the splash screen. No launch button is visible. \n\nLike many others, I have had nothing but problems with your client changes. Roll back to legacy client as default or continue to lose players. That's not a threat as much as it is an accurate description of the situation. It strikes me as an obvious, simple and hard rule that one shouldn't release UNFINISHED UPDATES.\n\nI feel strongarmed by Riot to use this new, pretty garbage. That's a terrible feeling to have as a paying customer.","replies":[{"poster":"tehhexxor","date":"2016-12-07T22:05:31.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologize for the attitude I displayed in my above post.

I hope you see this, i'v been having trouble even running the alpha client, sometimes i can be a whole minute behind in champ select just because the animations are taking so long to load.\n\nI think that you guys have too many animations running in the back ground of the client so people with non-gaming expensive computer's often have trouble running it.\n\nAnd yes i do have animation turned off but it doesn't seem to do a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T21:35:27.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Optimization is a huge priority for our New Client Team.
