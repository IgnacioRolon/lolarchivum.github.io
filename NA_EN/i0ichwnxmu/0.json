I tried to fix it, but nothing happened. Exactly when the match ended, my game when back to normal. Afterwards i was punished for it with the whole 5 minute thing. I exited the game and check my internet connection, it was perfect. So, once i got back on, the game wouldn't pull up. Only until today, it would finally work! But now i have to wait 10 minutes. I'm starting to not enjoy the game anymore... please fix it!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T23:21:11.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your connection may be in tip top shape outside of League, it's not impossible for it to become unstable every now and then.
