Void Gate's splitpushing power is broken.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/12/122-pbe-update.html\n\nVoid Gate, an item that will revolutionize splitpushing in a terrible way. According to the video, every voidling spawns every 4 seconds and takes a huge chunk out of towers. Hell, it looks like they'll take down a tower in just 2-3 hits, and they are capable of two-shotting caster minions.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthhMQAqqNk#t=39\n\nAt least Banner of Command has some risk run when buying it, even in it's slightly buffed state. It's actually balanced in my opinion despite it's amazing active. Why? Several reasons:\n\n1. It's cost-inefficient the way it is now, functioning as a situational, lategame, support-only item. It does not have enough stats to be worthy to tanks, not enough power to build it on DPS mage champions, it really only works on certain supports who can still benefit from it's small stat gains. It's a mixed bag of stats, which other classes do not appreciate. Not to mention that it builds from Aegis of the Legion while keeping it's passive, which is advantageous to build on supports most of the time. \n2. With Banner of Command's active, Promote, supports gain the exclusive ability to split-push without even being present in the lane. This means that they're free to assist their teams in teamfights as they should be doing, while still providing the pressure needed to force the enemy to multitask. \n3. Promote can only give steroids to one minion every 120 seconds, with that minion being slightly weaker than a super minion. If the active is used on a lane being shoved against them, it balances it out. If it's used on an even lane or a lane shoving for them, it'll take a tower/inhibitor if left unchecked. Even still, it takes time, and the promoted minion is still relatively slow at doing it's job. Towers don't go down easily against a promoted unit and it's wave, and sometimes the promoted can fail at taking down the tower. \n4. A promoted unit does **not** ignore champions, meaning that it's relatively easy and quick to deal with them and the huge wave that's sure to accompany them.\n5. A promoted minion has a solid DPS, but the actual damage per hit is still pretty small. While they can earn gold back for you, other minions will likely steal most of the minions from your promoted minion. \n\nHere is why Void Gate will make Banner of Command as unviable as Atma's Impaler once again:\n\n1. Void Gate costs 2630 gold as opposed to BoC's 3000, 120 gold less than a Guardian's Angel. Also, because of how voidlings can deal a lot of damage in a single hit, they'll earn much more gold back for the user than Banner of Command can.\n2. It has nearly the same stats as GA with a new HP regen passive. Do you know what this means? Combined with it's cheap cost, somewhat decent stats that it gives, and completely broken active, ***every tank will build this.***\n3. As I mentioned, this thing brings down minions and towers incredibly fast while prioritizing towers, unlike promoted minions. The voidlings can take down minions faster than super minions, and while that wave of your minions is distracting the tower, the tower will fall in seconds because ***the voidlings are faster than Nasus at taking down minions and towers.***\n4. This wouldn't be a problem if the Void Gate only spawned one voidling every 60 seconds or so, but no. It's one voidling every four seconds for 150 seconds. That's  ***37 voidlings total.***\n5. It lasts 150 seconds and has a 150 second CD. You can have one of these up ***all the time*** at just about ***any location.***\n\nBasically, the Void Gate is able to do it's job fast. Ridiculously fast. Banner of Command can only take down about one-two towers because a full-HP tower prioritizes and destroys the promoted minion, while destroying much of the wave in the process. Not to mention that the promoted unit often fails at even taking one tower. On the other hand, Void Gate can take down a tower in mere seconds, and the tower will not prioritize the voidlings. Because of this, the wave snowballs, and forces an enemy champion to hunt down and destroy the Void Gate. If the Void Gate cannot be found, that lane must be camped or you're guaranteed to lose your tower. You can have a voidling up every four seconds, all the time. Multiple champions can buy this item. \n\nI knew that this was going to be the season of splitpushing, but hell, no one will be able to focus on teamfights anymore because Void Gate has already taken your Nexus.","replies":[]}
