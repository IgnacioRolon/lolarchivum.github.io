I&#039;ve played Shen around 5 times in ranked the past few days, and I&#039;ve done very well every time, even getting 13/0/33 in one of the games. Not to mention, playing Shen gives me better map awareness, since it&#039;s my job and all. :P\n\nVery fun to play, will abuse.\n\nWho&#039;s your most recent main, and why are you maining them?","replies":[]}
