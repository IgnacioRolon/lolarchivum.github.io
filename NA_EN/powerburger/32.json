(Some advice for you all!)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly feels really nice, like a huge weight off my shoulders. Also, the Shiny Charm will serve me well in ally-chaining, that&#039;s for sure. \n\nHere&#039;s some advice for Pokedex completionists:\n\nFirst things first: Make sure you have a decent-enough collection. I'd try and fill at least 40% of the Dex first before focusing on the harder 'mons. \n\nSecond, get a spare Ditto or two. They're pretty easy to find. For some reason, they often have nice value on the GTS, and can net you a nice trade every now and then.\n\nThird, and most importantly, get your hands on one (or multiple) of the following Pokemon. It makes your life on the GTS much easier:\n\nPorygon 2\nPorygon-Z\nWeavile\nScizor\nMilotic\nHonchkrow\nSlowking\nPolitoed\nMagmortar\nElectivire\nFroslass\nNinetales\nSandslash\nWhimscott\nLilligant\nVanilluxe (Or Vanillite/Vanillish)\nLucario (Or Riolu)\nLanturn (Or Chinchou)\n\n\n_Generally speaking, the ones toward the top tend to be harder to get, but that's just from my experience. If you want to waste your own trade/evolution items to get them, be my guest. However, on the off chance you actually want to use a competitive Weavile, I'd hold onto that Razor Claw._\n\nMost of these are more valuable than legendary Pokemon, as it&#039;s a pain getting multiples of the necessary rarer trade/stone items. Others such as Vanillite, Feebas, Chinchou, and Riolu are just stupidly rare for some reason. If you have any of those, make sure you have their entire line before trading them (duh). Feebas is the exception, as it's rare AND requires a Prism Scale. \n\nI&#039;d also advise getting duplicates of some legendary Pokemon, as they essentially become near-universal wild cards for your trading needs. While the Ultra Beasts tend to be worth less than the others, I'd still go for them whenever the opportunity presents itself. Type: Null in particular seems to have the highest value on the GTS out of the legendaries/mythical Pokemon. Just search and cycle through them, particularly the more valuable ones, as stupidly easy trades happen all the time (such as Solgaleo for a Ditto.)\n\nAfter you get a duplicate or two that you don&#039;t need, start cycling through the list above on the GTS. Eventually you&#039;ll get an easy trade, and in some cases, it won&#039;t even require a legendary. I once saw a Honchkrow be placed up for a Lurantis, and I barely missed it. \n\n_If you see an easy trade, pounce on it as quickly as possible, as hundreds of people are likely going for the same thing. Who knows, you might get it!_\n\nOnce you've gotten one of the ones I mentioned, getting the rest becomes much easier, as many Pokemon on that list are interchangable with one another in terms of rarity. I&#039;d personally take care of the Porygon line whenever possible, as they&#039;ve been the most tedious to trade for from my experience. If you aren&#039;t seeing any good trades, try depositing a rare Pokemon for one of them and come back to it in a few minutes.\n\n_Also, use the hot springs in Poke Pelago early so friendship-based evolutions become easier later. The Jigglypuff,  Chansey, and Clefairy line are especially annoying if not taken care of early on._\n\nIf all else fails, mooch off a friend. 25% of my Dex was completed thanks to a generous pal, and it saved me a ton of time.\n\nSo, out of curiosity, how&#039;s your Pokedex coming along? What was particularly difficult for you to get?\n\n_Good gosh I edited this thing like 20 times. If you were to refresh once a minute you would have gotten a good laugh. Anyway, goodnight for now!_","replies":[]}
