Most assassins really do counter him because his early game is legitimately weak. If you're actually having trouble dodging the stun, buy these and never worry about it again: {{item:3140}} {{item:3139}} \n\nThe only buff that put him a bit over the edge was the delay reduction on his W. It really wasn&#039;t needed on an ability that has a 1.0 AP ratio and was already easy to land if you land the stun.\n\nHis ult does a lot of damage, but so many things block/avoid it: {{champion:157}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:35}}{{champion:15}} \n\nA few of those are assassins that can shut down Veigar&#039;s early game and win before he can catch up. Yasuo in particular utterly demolishes Veigar, that wall is too good against him.\n\nIt&#039;s like complaining about Nasus, guys. Think about it.\n\nEdit: Fixed some mistakes. QSS does *not* block his ult, silly me.","replies":[]}
