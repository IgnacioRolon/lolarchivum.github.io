Unfortunately, the most optimal way to win is to reliably shut down as many of the opponent&#039;s options as possible, and so long as it&#039;s within the game&#039;s rules, it&#039;s fair. In card games, this often means giving the opponent as least counterplay as possible, making top tier decks frustrating to fight against. \r\n\r\nHere&#039;s the issues with some classes/cards that needs to be looked at, as they&#039;re simply not fun to see:\r\n\r\n**Ice Block**\r\nIt&#039;s way too good. So long as Ice Block is up, the Mage never has to worry about lethal, and can therefore set up their burst without any fear of counterplay. Fatigue aside, the only ways to bypass Ice Block are Curse of Rafaam and Secret Eater, and it&#039;s bad game design when you have to negatively affect your deck to counter a top tier one. \r\n\r\nI mean, you could always play Warrior (or Priest lol), but Warrior&#039;s ridiculous anyway. \r\n\r\n**Warrior**\r\nBetween Armor and the sheer amount of control options it has, I personally consider Warrior to be my personal demon. Warrior essentially punishes counterplay, and it&#039;s a class that always seems to have the advantage. Unless you&#039;re reliably doing 4 damage on average per turn to the Warrior, provided Justicar dropped, the Warrior is winning. Essentially, you HAVE to have a few minions out most of the time, and consequently force yourself into a Brawl. Then there&#039;s Armor, which should honestly have a limit of 20-30. Once the Warrior starts hitting 40+, you&#039;re probably done for. \r\n\r\n**Arcane Giant**\r\nToo easy to get out. Free 8/8 that rewards non-interactive gameplay. Why. Make it 15 mana please.\r\n\r\n**Anyfin Can Happen**\r\nAllows for a 30-0 unstoppable burst combo, and it allows Paladin to shove as many different control/sustain options as they can into their deck while still pressuring the opponent. There&#039;s actually two ways to balance this card:\r\n\r\n1. Make it a Legendary spell.\r\n2. The Murlocs it revives don&#039;t count as &quot;Murlocs that died this game&quot;.\r\n\r\n**Malygos**\r\nAllows for another 30-0 unstoppable burst combo if Emperor Thaurrisan was played beforehand. Should be 10 mana, as Warrior&#039;s currently the only class that can survive it. \r\n\r\nThose are the major ones off the top of my head. I&#039;m just sick of fighting these decks. &gt;.&gt;","replies":[]}
