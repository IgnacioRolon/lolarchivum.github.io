Also, I&#039;m curious as to which elements you look for when searching for an RPG to play. Not elements such as Fire or Water, but elements that make up an RPG. Do you love immersive stories the most? Will amazing characters reel you in? Is it the setting or atmosphere that grips you? Are you searching for the right gameplay? Will a challenging game satisfy you?\n\nThose kinds of things. By all means, please leave your responses and let me know! :P","replies":[]}
