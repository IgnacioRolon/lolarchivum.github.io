[Spoilers obviously]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"*I got carried away. This thread is long. Like, really long. I&#039;m just warning you now. xD*\n\nBeing on spring break helps a ton, otherwise it would have taken me much longer. The finest of wishes for whoever came up with that idea. \n\nAnyway, I finally got bored of it this morning and put it down. As a newly converted Tales fan, I&#039;d like to share my thoughts. Keep in mind that I went into this with very high expectations, and the game impressed me right off the bat. They&#039;re also my opinions only, heh. \n\nSo... yeah, I&#039;m likely going to make this thread long like I usually do. Analyzing games I&#039;ve fallen in love with is fun. =P\n\nhttp://puu.sh/vksl1/1be636ba98.jpg\n\n**- Gameplay -**\n\nThe first thing I&#039;d like to discuss is the thing that got me addicted yet pushed me away at the same time: The battle system. Good lord do I love the battle system, and yet at the same time it gets very redundant once you&#039;re finally skilled with it. I feel that it&#039;s mostly the AI&#039;s fault, however. Enemies more or less have the same fundamental AI throughout the game, including bosses, making every enemy simple to defeat once you&#039;re familiar with their attacks. My experience playing the game went from nearly magical to just above average once I realized this. \n\nIt&#039;s still an excellent take on an action RPG though, don&#039;t get me wrong on that!\n\nDungeon crawling though... is painfully average and typical of your average RPG. The dungeons are well-decorated at times, but aside from the nice cutscene from time to time, that&#039;s all they have going for them. The caves were especially boring. My favorite dungeon though? Vortigern. It felt more original than most, and had such a fantastic theme to go along with it. \n\nI&#039;m not going to go into anything minor like equipment management, else I&#039;d be here all day. (It was pretty nifty though.)\n\n**- Music -**\n\nHonestly... the majority of the themes in this game aren&#039;t anything special. It&#039;s just a handful of tracks that are truly incredible, while the rest are more or less forgettable. The memorable pieces really are memorable though, and some are definitely going on my playlist. \n\n**- Characters -**\n\nBeen meaning to get to this part. I miiiiight have rushed the Music section, lol.\n\nI love the main cast. _All of them_. Picking a favorite character was _much_ more difficult than I had anticipated. They&#039;re all well-writted, well-VA&#039;d, and I can easily relate to all of them. I&#039;ve finally compiled a list though, and I&#039;ll cover the top six from bottom to top.\n\n** 6. Eleanor. **\n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, I love Eleanor. I just have to compare her to everyone else is all. xD\n\nEleanor was my second favorite for a while, next to my current favorite. She came off as incredibly strong in personality, and has a well-justified reason for being the turncoat character. After a while, however, she became predictable and stagnated a bit in character. \n\n ** 5. Velvet. **\n\nVelvet&#039;s an edgy character done right.\n\nAt first I didn&#039;t find her too enjoyable. Until she was fleshed out, she was a ball of angst that only knew how to say two things: &quot;I will use/devour anything if necessary!&quot; and &quot;I will kill Artorius!&quot;\n\nShe became fleshed out over time though, and I grew to love her character. She&#039;d be a spot or two higher on the list if it wasn&#039;t for her perpetually sexualized design. While it isn&#039;t a bad design, I just don&#039;t like the intention behind it. (Especially with a kid, a boy no less, that&#039;s always close to her.)\n\n** 4. Rokurou. **\n\nThis is a character that exists to bounce off other characters. Surprisingly, it works rather well in his favor.\n\nRokurou was actually my least favorite until I saw his comedy skit, which immediately bumped him up to this slot. I love how cool and blunt he is, even if I tend to find &quot;traditional&quot; characters like samurai rather unamusing. \n\n(Also the Shigure fight was hands-down my favorite in the game. Just saying.)\n\n** 3. Magilou. **\n\nHoo boy... Magilou...\n\nMoving on.\n\n** 2. Eizen. **\n\nThis guy has passion. He&#039;s cultured. He has a fantastic drive and memorable quotes. He&#039;s intimidating as heck. He absolutely tries and fails at comedy. He&#039;s probably the most fun to play out of the bunch. He&#039;s Eizen. I love Eizen.\n\n&quot;No. I&#039;ll be the dumb one.&quot; Saying that with the most straight face sealed him as one of my favorites of all time. \n\n** 1. Laphicet. **\n\nOkay... I have a lot to say here. \n\nFirst off, his design immediately appealed to me for one reason only: He looks like a male version of Rhyme, my long-time favorite character. \n\nFor reference: \n\nhttp://puu.sh/vkuTx/5a45c34992.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/vkuXN/50943e5777.jpg\n\nHere&#039;s the thing a few of my League friends know about me: I played Lulu support for almost three years straight. I&#039;m a sucker for support characters, and when I saw what Laphicet&#039;s playstyle was like, I put in effort to learn the little guy in and out. I learned how to play everyone else (except Rokurou) eventually, but learning Laphicet in Vortigern was the most fun I&#039;ve had playing this game. \n\nOh, and he&#039;s adorable in every sense of the word. Vei knows just how much I adore my adorbs. ^-^\n\nIn terms of side characters, I enjoyed most of them. There&#039;s just two that I didn&#039;t enjoy: Bienfu and... Kamoana. \n\nBienfu&#039;s tolerable after a while at least, but... Kamoana. \n\n_Good lord, Kamoana..._\n\n...\n\nBut, uh... oh that note, I feel like now&#039;s a good time to stop!\n\nThose are my thoughts on Berseria. I&#039;m definitely buying the next Tales game for sure!\n\nNext on my list to play would be Bayonetta 1 &amp; 2 that I bought off a friend for $25. Fairly worth it I&#039;d say. =P","replies":[]}
