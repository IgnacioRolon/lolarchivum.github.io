It's an amazing anime.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"The first episodes weren't too special, with the first episode being among the weakest this anime has, however it just shoots up from there. It gets to the point where the Wizard Games arc is absolutely phenomenal in almost everything it does, bringing back old characters as well as seamlessly multitasking it's many focus points. The sheer size of the arc takes up about a fourth of the Fairy Tail episode list, with there being over 200 current episodes as of this moment, and actually stretches into the second season.\n\nHowever, there isn't a bad arc in Fairy Tail from what I've experienced. Almost every character is memorable and has a distinct personality. Sure, the focus is on Natsu and Lucy, however almost everyone gets their fair share of screen time. It's actually quite similar to Bleach in regard to character focus. No one character actually pissed me off, and everyone has their unique charm. Lucy herself can be very annoying at first, and then becomes a strong character on her own over time. \n\nSpeaking of Lucy, any fan of Fairy Tail knows of the Lucy boob-growing thing she's got going on there. For those of you who aren't completely angelic, pay attention to her breasts as the series progresses. It gets ridiculous, and there's points where it seems like they're twice the size of her head as they take up half of the screen.\n\nThe best part of Fairy Tail? Fillers are almost nonexistent. The very few episodes that could be counted as filler tie in to the main plot later in some form or another. I mean true, the invisible Lucy one is 99% filler with a filler-like ending, however even that situation was used as reference in a later episode. \n\nAnd yes, I just praised Fairy Tail with rainbows flying from my anus. Go watch this anime if you haven't already. It isn't epic like AoT, nor redundant like SAO. It's an anime where the strength definitely lies in the characters more than the plot, and while they are very silly at times, the characters are more than reason enough to watch it alone. When you do get far enough into the series though... prepare yourself for the Jiggle-Butt episode...","replies":[]}
