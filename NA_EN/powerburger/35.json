Once you do, you still need to apply your three stacks to actually take someone out of the fight. You have your E to effectively multiply your health by 1.5x, so it&#039;s a terrible idea to focus you anyway. Tahm is much more suited to protecting carries, which he can do very well. It&#039;s still all too easy to mess up though: If you eat your ADC too early, you may just end up costing your team everything. \n\nDuring lane, what he lacks in initiation and damage he makes up for sustain. It&#039;s very hard to force his blubber out of lane, although it&#039;s tough for him as well to force his opponents out. He really is a wall that just waits until his opponents misplay, or until a gank arrives. \n\nIn top lane, his damage is actually pretty good for a tank, allowing his health to be utilized into his level 6&#039;s passive as damage. This does make his build path somewhat limited, especially with his lack of initiation for a tank, however I don&#039;t think full AD Tahm was ever meant to be a thing anyway. :P\n\nI haven&#039;t seen a release like this since Vel&#039;Koz, where a champion is, or is just short of, balanced on the first try. Good job, Riot!","replies":[]}
