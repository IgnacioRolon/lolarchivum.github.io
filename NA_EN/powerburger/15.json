I joined at the end of it's prime, back when it was fun to scroll down and look at the creativity. Nowadays, it's full of unwanted moderation and constant complaining, isn't it?\n\nYes, third-party mods can be ridiculous at times, however it isn&#039;t intolerable to the point that you&#039;ve left yet. If you&#039;re still here and you&#039;re reading this, you obviously felt compelled to.\n\nI&#039;m not going to say something cheesy like, &quot;If we all work hard enough, we can bring GD back!&quot; It won&#039;t happen. Old GD is gone forever. Everyone quits eventually. \n\nWhat I am saying is that we can improve this place if we really try. What we all miss are the creative, quality threads. Guess what? We're all capable of those. If you&#039;re an old, lurking GD&#039;er who never posts, you&#039;re a part of the problem. Why complain that no one posts quality content if you don&#039;t post quality content yourself? Even shitposts can be great if they're quality shitposts.\n\nThat&#039;s all I have to say about this. I&#039;ll be making creative efforts myself to improve the place, but I&#039;m only one person. If you want to see this place turn out for the better once again, you know what to do.","replies":[]}
