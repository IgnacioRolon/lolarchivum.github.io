Please keep that in mind.**\n\nBasically, a good boss design is a boss that not only challenges the player's skills, but is also satisfying to engage and defeat. The environment, music, and presentation are important, however I'm looking at designs from a core level. I especially love bosses that require the player to take advantage of everything that they're given in order to defeat it. For that reason, I don't consider most Zelda bosses and rushdown bosses to be great designs. \n\nFor example, I love Xord from Xenoblade Chronicles. It's where I felt the difficulty spiked, and for good reason. Between visions, managing teammates, the other enemies, and focusing on your own positioning, your goal is to successfully Chain Attack Xord before he kills your entire team. Which he can do very, very easily. It isn't a long boss fight, however it forced you to take a different approach as opposed to just rushing him down. The followup fight was the icing on the cake.\n\nI'm taking notes on good boss designs myself to potentially take inspiration from in the future. If possible, please provide an example or two of your own.","replies":[]}
