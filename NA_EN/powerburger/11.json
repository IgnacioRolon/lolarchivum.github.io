I still get my rewards. I don&#039;t, however, like the idea of just sitting here and giving up. Being demoted sucks, and almost always makes me want to rip my hair out. *Great! Now I have to win 5 games in a row just to get back to where I was!*\n\nI believe the worst that&#039;s happened to me was being demoted all the way from Bronze 1 to Bronze 4. I have the S3 Bronze toilet trophy to account for that.\n\nHow much do demotions bother you?","replies":[]}
