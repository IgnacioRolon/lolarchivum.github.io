Currently, it&#039;s Beat and Rhyme. For me, it&#039;s simply because Rhyme&#039;s my favorite character in The World Ends With You, and Beat comes in 3rd. I don&#039;t even have to mention who my close 2nd is, several avatars of him exist here already.\n\nRhyme has a personality I wish I had. She&#039;s very innocent and sweet, yet very witty and intelligent. She improves the mood of those around her with a nice, if not cheesey at times, quote whenever necessary. It really is a shame she isn&#039;t explored further. Heck, one of my MCs in a book I&#039;m writing is completely based off of her.\n\nAnd for all of the hate Beat gets, for how forced he seems at times, I think he&#039;s perfect as Rhyme&#039;s partner. You have to experience the game&#039;s plot to really understand why. It&#039;s just a shame that he got much more development. The biggest flaw about him is that you&#039;re constantly reminded that he was written by paid SE employees, and it really shows at times. However, despite that, his cringe-worthy deliveries at times are why I love him.\n\nThat&#039;s my FEK. What about yours?","replies":[]}
