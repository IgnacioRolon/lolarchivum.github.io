However, if the closing prompt hadn't defaulted to yes, I would've been fine. That's my complaint here.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI pressed the Home button to pause. It&#039;s a nifty feature of modern consoles that I appreciate. Then, when grabbing the controller, my thumb hit X on the launched application: Xenoblade 2. \n\nNote: Xenoblade 2 does NOT have an autosave feature, unless you&#039;re opening core crystals. The area of the game that I was grinding in doesn&#039;t allow saving unless you leave. \n\nIt prompts me to close to close the game, and when moving my hand to the B button to close the prompt, I accidentally hit the A button. \n\n...\n\nCan someone please tell me why the default option is to close the software? Why is that a thing?\n\nI&#039;m not even upset. Just... empty. That mistake took me back to before I finished Xenobia&#039;s affinity. All that down the drain, just like that. \n\nI was going to NG+, but now I&#039;ll just wait for Torna: The Golden Country. I got more games to play anyway.","replies":[]}
