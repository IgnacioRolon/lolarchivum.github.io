DW guys, I'm crying in a corner as we speak.\n\nSo, I've been reading the notes, and I've been mentally nodding so far.\n\nThen I come across the Skirmisher's Sabre.\n\n> PASSIVE - CHALLENGING SMITE Smite can be cast on enemy champions, marking them for 6 seconds. While marked, you deal 18-69 bonus true damage to them on hit, have vision of them, and reduce their damage to you by 20%.\n\nSo, let me get this straight. A 1000(at level 18) true damage spell that's on a CD of 40 seconds can be cast on enemy champions now? \n\nSomeone please tell me I have this wrong. Otherwise there will be no excuse not to have this item on pretty much everyone, and Smite will be taken alongside Flash every game. It's just that ridiculously overpowered. \n\nRito pls","replies":[]}
