Being afraid to catch someone&#039;s cold does not necessarily mean you have mysophobia, although using hand sanitizer every 5 minutes may indicate so.\n\nPersonally, I do not consider myself germaphobic any longer, although I&#039;m still iffy with foreign human saliva. It low-key feels disgusting to me.\n\nBecause I&#039;m bored and curious, I&#039;ll ask some hypothetical questions here, and I&#039;d like you guys to answer them honestly. I&#039;ll give you a rating from 1 to 10, with 8 or higher being germaphobe status, and I might throw in a comment or two. These are strictly my opinions only, and I have no professional medical experience whatsoever. Treat it as a game, if you will. =P\n\n1. Do you believe you&#039;re germaphobic?\n\n2. Do you keep hand sanitizer in your room?\n\n3. Do you adhere to the five second rule?\n\n4. Do handshakes make you anxious?\n\n5. Does it bother you when you have to touch the ground with your bare hands?\n\n6. Do you willingly share water bottles with family? With friends?\n\n7. How much would it bother you to go four days without showering?\n\n8. Would you rather be sneezed on by a stranger or given a wet willy by a friend?\n\n9. Your pet (dog or cat) takes a bite out of the steak you&#039;re eating. Would you still finish it?\n\n10. Your friend sits directly where you place your head to sleep, pillow and everything. How do you react?\n\n11. You&#039;re playing a game at a friend&#039;s house, and they hand you the controller. Their hands are noticeably very sweaty and you have your own controller in your bag. Will you take theirs or politely decline and use your own?\n\n12. You get something in your eye that needs to come out right away. Your shirt is filthy and you&#039;ve just finished dusting. What do you do?\n\n13. Someone&#039;s cute dog approaches you excitedly. Do you let it lick your hands? Your face?\n\n14. The same dog was seen licking your friend&#039;s bare feet a few moments ago. Does this affect your previous answer?\n\n15. Your mother/father is down with the flu and wants you to spoon-feed soup to them. This obviously requires close proximity. Will you do it?\n\n16. You see an injured bird on the road and you&#039;ve decided you&#039;re going to care for it. How do you pick it up?\n\n17. Finally, just how compulsive are you from day-to-day life?\n\nQuite a few questions here, not gonna lie. You don&#039;t have to answer them if you don&#039;t want to. I&#039;ll start responding when I wake up. =P\n\nEdit: Or if you just prefer sharing your thoughts, that's fine too.","replies":[]}
