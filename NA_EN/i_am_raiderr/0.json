Being a man short means your team was significantly lacking in the ability to create pressure compared to the enemy team. So what happens in games where the 4 man team is ahead is that it gets extremely difficult to end the game. You basically end up killing them over and over again without being able to end off it. A sufficiently skilled team can end quickly while being a man short but those players were unranked and Bronze players. They would not know how to adjust their macro play to account for the significant lack of pressure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebel 986","date":"2019-10-02T10:20:34.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best was in aram with talon 3 pentas and around 40 some kills.
