NA has been lagging for TWO WEEKS.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 weeks of having horrible lag spikes every single match with no exception. Almost every time an enemy appears in my vision range, there's a lag spike, but they're mostly random. They happen any day, at any time, on EVERY match. I'm from South America and my ISP is Telef√≥nica.\r\n\r\nI'm not the only one with this issue. Lots of people I've met on my matches have had lag too. They're mostly from Canada and Asia, but I don't see a pattern. In my last match, everyone was lagging. EVERYONE. I don't understand how this issue hasn't been addressed by anybody at Riot. Please do something, it's impossible to play like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-10T21:48:38.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your physical distance from where you are in relation to the NA server is very far, so there may be some connection issues regardless of any troubleshooting done.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up the strength of your PC, but keep in mind that this strength cannot exceed that physical distance present.

But only these 2 weeks have I been getting these huge lag spikes.
