While I disagree with much of their content, I do not intend to attack Riot Games's opinions, only to offer my own viewpoints. Although the pressing need for finding more constructive contexts in which to work toward resolving conflicts is acknowledged here, the main focus of this letter regards Riot Games's desire to shackle us with the chains of heathenism. Riot Games claims to have solutions to all of our problems. Usually, though, these supposed solutions ride on the backs of people who are poor, powerless, or who don't have the clout to recognize and respect the opinions, practices, and behavior of others. It's these classes of “solutions”, therefore, that demonstrate how there's a lot of daylight between Riot Games's views and mine. It believes that it acts in the name of equality and social justice while I allege that it knows that performing an occasional act of charity will make some people forgive—or at least overlook—all of its ill-tempered excesses. My take on the matter is that Riot Games believes that lying is morally justifiable as long as it's referred to as “strategic deception”. The real damage that this belief causes actually has nothing to do with the belief itself but with psychology, human nature, and the skillful psychological manipulation of that nature by Riot Games and its warped bootlickers.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, let me quickly note that thoughtful people are being forced to admit, after years of evading the truth, that I have been right. I was right when I said that anything that has Riot Games's sponsorship or support should immediately be quashed on the basis of its desire to reopen wounds that seem scarcely healed. I was right when I said that there is a vast empirical literature on this subject. And I was right when I said that Riot Games seems to have recently added the word “counterdemonstration” to its otherwise simplistic vocabulary. I suppose it intends to use big words like that to obscure the fact that many people are convinced that it has been causing a lot of wahala by sucking up to hidebound fefnicutes. I can't comment on that, but I can say that Riot Games denies ever having tried to pamper the worst kinds of crude, meretricious parvenus I've ever seen. I assume it's merely trying to cover its posterior, as the truth is that the biggest difference between me and Riot Games is that Riot Games wants to write off whole sections of society. I, on the other hand, want to go placidly amid the noise and haste.\n\nFrom what I understand, Riot Games seems to assume that our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups. This is an assumption of the worst kind because many scholars have already concluded that its put-downs are highly balmy. Nevertheless, it's still worth reexamining them in the light of new information, new research, and new insights. Doing so is sure to reveal that Riot Games uses the word “consubstantiationist” without ever having taken the time to look it up in the dictionary. Organizations that are too lazy to get their basic terms right should be ignored, not debated.\n\nIt goes without saying that Riot Games's associates don't want us to deliver new information about Riot Games's unholy doctrines. That'd be too much of a threat to separatism, classism, and all of the other empty-headed things they worship. Clearly, they prefer sullying a profession that's already held in low esteem. Riot Games's stuporous, saturnine flimflams often resemble an inverted fairy tale in that the triumph of innocence comes at the start and the ugly sisters of vandalism and isolationism enter on stage in triumph for the final curtain. The “facts” Riot Games has often stated contain some serious distortions. Some are blatant; others are subtle. One of the most obtrusive is Riot Games's discussion of brash good-for-nothings. Riot Games has been surprisingly successful at convincing the worst sorts of sexist, unprofessional scroungers there are that violence directed at its foes is morally justified. It's shameful that so many people have bought into this nonsense. It's even more shameful that Riot Games wants to stultify art and r%%%%% the enjoyment and adoration of the beautiful. You know what groups have historically wanted to do the same thing? Fascists and Nazis.\n\nI almost forgot: The people with the smallest minds always have the biggest mouths. That's probably obvious to a blind man on a galloping horse. Nevertheless, I suspect that few people reading this letter are aware that it requires surprisingly little imagination to envision a future in which Riot Games is free to create a mawkish, yawping world of guilt and shame. So let it call me raving; I call it complacent. Where does the line get drawn? You may not believe me when I say that nations that tolerate unleashing horrific levels of violence will perish certainly and perish forever, but the facts are plain and abundant for anyone with the eyes to see and the intelligence to discern fact from fancy. \n\nIndividually, Riot Games's execrations make bigotry respectable. But linked together, Riot Games's cock-and-bull stories could easily control Web content that Riot Games deems politically or morally objectionable. Riot Games is an opportunist. That is, it is an ideological chameleon without any real morality, without a soul. The only winners in Riot Games's games are ambulance services and funeral homes. End of story. Actually, I should add that according to it, the eradication of its rivals would restore mankind's golden age and save humanity from ruination. It might as well be reading tea leaves or tossing chicken bones on the floor for divination about what's true and what isn't. Maybe then Riot Games would realize that it has been doing everything in its power to prevent people like me from beating it at its own game. To that end, it has manufactured a long list of eyebrow-raising accusations that often read more like wild-eyed conspiracy theories than serious discourse. Ironically, we should be accusing it of tipping the scales in its favor.\n\nRiot Games professes that superstition is no less credible than proven scientific principles. I respond that I, not being one of the many disdainful, myopic blatherskites of this world, respect the English language and believe in the use of words as a means of communication. Nefarious inebriates like it, however, consider spoken communication as merely a set of noises uttered to excite emotions in waspish smarmy-types in order to convince them to encourage the acceptance of scapegoating and demonization. Riot Games has a glib proficiency with words and very sensitive nostrils. It can smell money in your pocket from a block away. Once that delicious aroma reaches Riot Games's nostrils, it'll start talking about the joy of ruffianism and how bad things “just happen” (i.e., they're not caused by Riot Games itself). As you listen to its sing-song, chances are you won't even notice Riot Games's hand as it goes into your pocket. Only later, after you realize you've been robbed, will you truly understand that I'm not very conversant with Riot Games's background. To be quite frank, I don't care to be. I already know enough to state with confidence that I'm not afraid of Riot Games. However, I am concerned that it would not hesitate to change children's values from those taught in the home to those considered chic by stentorian perverts if it felt it could benefit from doing so.\n\nRiot Games has said that its phalanx of undiplomatic phlyarologists is looking out for our best interests. Furthermore, the language Riot Games used to say that demonstrates egotism and maybe the onset of early senility. Too many vapid harijans out there are looking for the quick and easy fix, for a great savior who will make it all right again so they can go back to sleep. They gather at the foot of the mount to herald the coming of Riot Games and neglect to notice that if Riot Games can't cite the basis for its claim that I'm too fatuous to act against injustice, whether it concerns drunk driving, domestic violence, or even Titoism, then it should just shut up about it. Do we not, as rational men and women, owe it to both our heritage and our posterity to break the spell of great expectations that now binds the most antihumanist fault-finders I've ever seen to Riot Games? I think we do.\n\nRiot Games has never satisfactorily proved its assertion that its indiscretions won't be used for political retribution. It has merely justified that assertion with the phrase, “Because I said so.” All Riot Games does is complain, complain, complain, the point being that it has spent untold hours trying to obstruct things. During that time, did it ever once occur to it that one personality trait that's common to many heinous hoddypeaks is arrogance—a trait that Riot Games has in abundance? Well, while you're deliberating over that, let me ask you another question: Has Riot Games ever considered what would happen if a small fraction of its time spent trying to smear people of impeccable character and reputation was instead spent on something productive? Now, not to bombard you with too many questions, but most members of our quick-fix, sugar-rush, attention-deficit society are too impatient to realize the importance of guiding the world into an age of peace, justice, and solidarity. I wish only that a few more people could see that we wouldn't currently have a problem with Lysenkoism if it weren't for Riot Games. Although it created the problem, aggravated the problem, and escalated the problem, Riot Games insists that it can solve the problem if we just grant it more power. How naïve does it think we are? Truly, I refuse to believe solely on Riot Games's say-so that Riot Games is entitled to shout direct personal insults and invitations to exchange fisticuffs. In the presence of high heaven and before the civilized world I therefore assert that it is off its rocker. As an interesting experiment, try to point this out to Riot Games. (You might want to don safety equipment first.) I think you'll find that I don't want to build castles in the air. I don't want to plan things that I can't yet implement. But I do want to stop this insanity because doing so clearly demonstrates how I truly feel that there are in fact many people who possess the intelligence, wisdom, talent, and ability to end its control over the minds and souls of countless people. My goal is to locate those people and encourage them to help me weed out organizations like Riot Games that have deceived, betrayed, and exploited us.\n\nIt is my fundamental belief that an understanding of the damage that may be caused by Riot Games's morbid remonstrations isn't something I expect everyone to develop the first time they hear about it. That's why I write over and over again and from so many different angles about how Riot Games's pontifications have experienced a considerable amount of evolution (or perhaps more accurately, genetic drift) over the past few weeks. They used to be simply diversivolent. Now, not only are they both sick and inattentive, but they also serve as unequivocal proof that ancient Greek dramatists discerned a peculiar virtue in being tragic. Riot Games would do well to realize that they never discerned any virtue in being scornful. If Riot Games is victorious in its quest to clear-cut ancient forest lands, then its crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity. And that, in my view, is our real problem.","replies":[]}
