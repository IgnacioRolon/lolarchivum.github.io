Reconnecting and waiting does nothing.\n\nHowever if you ctrl alt delete and close league (click on reconnect first) it will bring you back to the regular client screen with a reconnect button. Reconnecting this way works 100% of the time for me, but its still annoying to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T03:00:24.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's one way to do it. An easier way is to hit the *cancel* button and **then** hit the new *Reconnect* button inside the client (rather than the loading screen), as mentioned on the [**Service Status Page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na).","replies":[{"poster":"And A Real Hiero","date":"2016-12-12T18:45:56.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot!","replies":[]}]}]}
