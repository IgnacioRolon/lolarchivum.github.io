For Twin Fang 1-3 Old Cassio did more damage, however, new Cassio is about to get off 6 Es in the same time old Cass got out 3, this caused her top end damage to be significantly higher at every point of the game.  The bottom line is Old Cassio did more damage with less Es, but as long as New Cassio can get at least 4 Es she will out damage the Old Cassio in every 1v1 scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow having said and done all of this I hope to turn this discussion away from the myths that \"New Cassio does no damage\" and focus it more on issues of her theme, IE losing her poison mage feel, and also how riot could make some adjustments to her current kit that could enable her to regain that feeling and perhaps make her kit more open to all players.  My person opinion right now would be to make the following change to her passive...\r\n\r\nAspect of the Serpent\r\nCassiopeia gains a stack of Aspect of the Serpent for each second that an enemy champion is poisoned, for each poisoned unit that she kills and 1 stack when she hits an enemy with Twin Fang **per poison effecting her target** up to a max of 400.\r\n\r\nThis would allow her to gain additional stacks when a target is effected by bother her Q+W but also give her team synergy with Teemo/Singed/Twitch, so for example say a target is effected by Noxious Blast, Miasma, and Twitch's passive Cassio would gain 3 stacks total per E she hits that target with.  It's a small change but I feel it could make a big difference in opening up the champion to those who are currently having issues achieving the 400 stacks and it furthers her interactions with poisons, albeit not necessarily in a straight damage/debuff sense that others may be looking for.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2014-10-29T07:39:27.497+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Theoretical mumbo jumbo that doesn't actually occur, all based on your imaginary world.

If you were spacing properly you would always be in range for those 3 Twin Fangs. If the opponent backed off you'd move up with the MS boost from Q to get the last one in. If the opponent moved up to all in then maybe you'd get 4. The amount of Twin Fangs you would get off was dependent on the spacing between you and the enemy because of how the reset mechanic worked. The only time you would fail to get 3 Twin Fangs is if the enemy was playing EXTREMELY far back (in which case you're honestly better off maxing Q but that isn't the point of this thread. This thread is comparing single target DPS in common combos) or you were forced to play safe due to jungle pressure.\n\nThe reworked Cassiopeia's Twin Fang reset mechanic changed. Since it resets on cast, it is no longer dependent on the spacing between you and the enemy meaning that if you are in range you should EASILY get all 6 Twin Fangs. With the grace period of the reset now being rather large, it's surprisingly easy to get 5-6 in a realistic scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2014-10-29T16:27:31.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Realistically, the numbers do not mean anything.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is trying to prove new cass does more damage.\n\nWhat is not being factored in is the fact you simply cannot do that type of damage which everyone has been pointing out but which I'll tell you now is because after a rotation of her spells she will have burned all of her mana.\n\nThe new passive is the root cause of all the problems.\n\nIts no different then Urgot, after a rotation of your combo you're OOM.

Quas and Voyboy are especially finding success in her. \n\nLet me see if I can reword what I find her problem to be for a lot of people. Be aware this is just what I'm observing and I can be TOTALLY wrong.  In my past posts I only suggested that her stacks be lowered or mana costs adjusted - they are rather simple changes that make her laning easier and her late game more attainable. However, I THINK the problem might be something else as well. \n\nGetting the most out of the new Cass requires rather advanced mechanics - proper minion wave control (to maximize mana efficiency it's usually good to look for trades when you have somewhat low health minion to immediately recoup the mana spent after said trade), spacing in lane, map awareness, enemy spell CD awareness, positioning in lane, map awareness, proper vision control, etc. \n\nWith old Cass you could casually poke with Q and not care TOO much about any of those things. Thus, people at all ELOs could play her and find relative success with her. Since new Cass needs to max Twin Fang and thus get a bit closer and put herself in more danger, these mechanics become much more important. \n\nUnfortunately, you really only start to find players who truly understand how to utilize ALL of these ideas when you get into very high elo (D1 and above). Thus, high elo Cass mains like myself, Diabound (he changed his name to something else but he's like the #2 Cass in NA), and RIP Cassio are still finding success on Cassiopeia and people like Quas and Voyboy are doing great with her as well.\n\n\nWhat this culminates to is that we're able to work make it through laning phase and reach that late game scaling. For a vast majority of players, they're unable to consider ALL of these things and thus getting to that late game carry stage in a reasonable amount of time is a lot more difficult. This is compounded by the fact that Cassi's new playstyle is a bit different than her old one if you used to max Q (which doesn't work anymore). Old habits are hard to break.\n\nMaybe you can simplify this and just said \"well that means she's just weak in lane if you have to think about all those things to do decent \". I guess this is true. But what I'm getting at is that if Riot just straight up buffs her without careful consideration as to what they are buffing she can easily become overpowered because her laning ALREADY has the potential to be pretty decent for a late game hypercarry.\n\nI'm not a design expert, but I can see why Riot is taking their time in ensuring that they bring back her poison-y identity (which I'm all for!) AND fine tuning her. The nature of Cassio's kit makes balancing her a very tricky thing. They have to find a way to make her laning phase decent for all players while ensuring that it isn't too good if you really know what you are doing. She already can become an immovable laning machine - not in a bullying sense but in a sustaining sense (think of how frustrating it is when Nasus hits that point where you just can't make him back off anymore because his sustain becomes ridiculous - Cassio, when played optimally basically hits this when she gets those 75 stacks and starts being able to life vamp with Twin Fangs).

If you compare her old mana costs vs her new ones new Cassio has much more forgiving mana costs...\n\nOld Cassio Q Mana Cost\n\n35 / 45 / 55 / 65 / 75\n\nNew Cassio Q Mana Cost\n\n40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60\n\nOld Cassio W Mana Cost\n\n70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 120\n\nNew Cassio W Mana Cost\n\n40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80\n\nOld Cassio E Mana Costs\n\n50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90\n\nNew Cassio E Mana Costs\n\n30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90\n\nR Mana Cost remains unchanged.\n\n\nExcept for Q ranks 1 and 2, and her E rank 5 Cassio has lower mana costs across the board.  The thing people are seeing, but not paying attention to, is that you are not building mana for your laning phase, her mana isn't near as tight at that point as people want to believe, but instead you are building mana for the team fight phase when you won't have a number of minions to regen off of via your E.  \n\nThe team fight phase is really the only point in which her old passive had a great deal of effect.  In small skirmishes they wouldn't last long enough that you to stack it and then benefit from the full 50% mana cost reduction, and in lane you might W+Q to clear wave but you wouldn't spam your spells to clear minions to the point of gaining 5 stacks.  The point that Deadly Cadence mattered was the full all out team fights but by the time this is happening you should have Tear/RoA on new Cass and it should be irrelevant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2014-10-30T02:33:29.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one agrees, last time you told me it was unlikely that I was regularly landing 4 without being right up into the enemy's face.
