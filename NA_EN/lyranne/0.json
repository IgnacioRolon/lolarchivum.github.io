Wondering if anyone else has this problem, and if there's a fix. Thanks~\n\nEdit: To clarify, league doesn't show up as active on the dock after I exit out of it normally, or even in the force quit menu. It's only by going to the Activity Monitor that I can see it's still running.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-08T04:50:24.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be caused by a background application preventing League from properly closing out.
