Since the start of the new season I frequently experienced ~1 s delay on every command, from moving, attacking, ping, even chat also. Needless to say I couldn't play. The game was not lag. I could see every thing just fine. I could move the screen around the map with no problem. Only my commands were delayed. I had never experienced such thing since I started to play from season 6. I had thought that the new season required higher system, and my laptop couldn't handle it so I dropped the game until now. Just yesterday I reinstalled LoL on another PC with higher spec and a different internet line too and I could played a few matches all fine, so I thought the issue was done. But today it happened again, in 2 consecutive matches. What causes this? Does anyone has the same issue? I thought that I could get back to the game but if this continues then I will drop the game for good. I hope someone gives me an explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T17:21:35.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can be caused by packet loss, which can happen and suddenly even if your ping looks stable.  To really know for sure, though, grab a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) of the impacted games.

Ping stayed at straight line under 200 ms and 0 packet loss.\nMy internet is totally fine. I can load youtube video at fast speed. The issue just seems to appear out of nowhere.","replies":[]}]}]}
