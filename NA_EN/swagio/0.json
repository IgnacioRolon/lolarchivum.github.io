I would be sure to switch to ethernet and update your DNS settings to see if a smoother connection routing would help first!

Let me know how those steps go and if they're able to help or not, always good to cover the basics to see exactly what's going wrong. \n\nIf those don't help, be sure to send your network logs over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more of a deep dive, but they will likely have you try these steps or a few others first. \n\nI'd also like to suggest testing this troubleshooting in a custom or practice game, instead of repeatedly queueing up for ranked which could effect you if you keep losing your connection in those lobbies.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
