{"poster":"Kitty Pix","date":"2017-05-24T18:13:11.279+0000","title":"An Open Letter to Rakan's team","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"I&#039;m bad at this writing thing, so I&#039;m not sure how to start this off or even how to finish it, OR how to get it even seen by who I want to see it..\nbut I just wanted to say thank you so so much to the team that worked on and put so much care and love into {{champion:497}} as a champion, for so so many reasons that I really wanted to share with everyone!! \n\nHe has quickly become my favorite champion to play (despite his few glaring counter I refuse to pick into *cough*{{champion:111}}{{champion:412}}*cough*) for reasons I have never been able to say about another character in ANYTHING before, really. I was even able to get Mastery 7 in about a week and a half after people stopped banning or taking him from me.\n\nFrom his lore, to his VO, to his animations, to his VFX, I find Rakan to be absolutely perfect for me. The main reason being, he has without a doubt, no arguments needed, cannot convince be otherwise: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), just like I do! \n\nThe way it was portrayed in his color text was unlike anything I&#039;ve ever seen articulated before from the ADHD mind, and it meant *so much* more to me than you could ever imagine, being able to see myself represented in that personal of a way in something like that, you have no idea. Even some of his in-game lines:\n-How free flowing he is with things. (&quot;I&#039;ll just put that there. That&#039;s a good place!.. I hope&quot; &quot;Crap. I totally forgot why I&#039;m here.&quot; &quot;This looks like another dangerous situation. Thankfully, I can improvise.&quot; &quot;I can&#039;t wait to get in there. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to do, but I am going to *get in there*!&quot;)\n\n-How purely DISTRACTED he can be just by how beautiful the world is around him. (&quot;Man, have you seen that forest over there?&quot; &quot;I feel like my allies aren&#039;t recognizing how amazing my cloak is, I mean seriously! Rude!&quot; &quot;Woo! I am so into this! What is this?&quot; \n{{champion:497}} &quot;What&#039;re those things humans wear on their feet?&quot; {{champion:498}} &quot;Shoes.&quot; {{champion:497}} &quot;I need shoes, red ones! I need them *so bad*.&quot;)\n\n-How unabashedly passionate he is about the things that he loves and believes in, including just having fun. ({{champion:498}}  &quot;Are you having fun over there?&quot; {{champion:497}} &quot;I can&#039;t hear you over all the fun I&#039;m having!&quot; &quot;The only way to understand magic is to plunge into it, move with it, dance and dance!&quot; &quot;I got freedom, I got a lady, I got a cause I&#039;d die for. That&#039;s who I am.&quot; &quot;They&#039;re scared of darkness, they&#039;re scared of magic. They are scared of where I&#039;m from.&quot; &quot;Magic is in the heart. Magic is in the rhythm.&quot;)\n\n-This isn&#039;t so much something that relates to being ADHD, but something I just really appreciate about Rakan&#039;s character and that&#039;s his specific breed of optimism. It honestly makes my heart swell. I&#039;d call this his passion for life, I guess, the shit he&#039;d say if he was a life coach or something. (&quot;Magic is supposed to be scary. Love is supposed to hurt. Ecstasy needs a little fear.&quot; &quot;If you aren&#039;t a little frightened, you ain&#039;t alive.&quot;  &quot;When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.&quot;)\n\n-And just to touch on that VFX part, he&#039;s the only champion I play right now that I would willingly play his base skin AND his release skin (which I of course own). I love the way his Q works/looks, with the touch vs. charge, it looks beautiful on his release skin especially. The feather on his Q for both skins is so cute looking and fluid and even more so with the range buff, the ground indicator for his W on both skins too are just beautiful honestly (I like that base looks like he kicks up some dust and feathers), and colors on his base shield are a perfect blend of pink and yellow with happens to be one of my favorite color combos. His passive regen animation is also super cool to hear and look at. Not much on the R, but I do like how the release skin was fixed here to look less dark and more like a shooting star, super cool.\n\n-Special thanks for that one interaction they have where he pulls the accent. Whoever came up with that: brilliant. I laugh every time. ({{champion:497}} &quot;I am R-r-r-akan!&quot; {{champion:498}} &quot;Ugh, what&#039;s with the accent?&quot; {{champion:497}} &quot;I&#039;m... trying something new. Do you like it?&quot; {{champion:498}} &quot;No. No, I do not.&quot;)\n\nI know there&#039;s more I probably haven&#039;t put here that I&#039;m going to regret not saying later (including more of my fave Rakan quotes because seriously, I love everything he says, feel free to leave your favorites in the comments!) but I at least had to try and make sure the people that put the work into this champion saw just how much he means to someone and just how much it means to some people to put something as simple as representation with identifiable ADHD. Lastly though, I think I&#039;ll finish off with the quote that&#039;s stuck with me since the moment I heard it and one last Thank you:\n&quot;I&#039;ve been kicked around since I was born. It&#039;s alright! It&#039;s okay! I&#039;m staying alive!&quot;\n\nEdit: Wow, this has actually gotten a decent amount of attention! I see myself when I click on Top, wow. Keep the comments coming, I'd love to hear more of all of your guys' favorite things about Rakan like quotes or animations, or just tell what champion there is that you have this kind of experience with !! I love seeing what resonates with people :D Have a great day everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-05-24T20:22:29.678+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw... shucks.

Imagine Rakan having the shield from Face of the Mountain and his passive.  It's probably to keep him from buying into that 24/7.\n\nAlso to help him with CSing since he's not as naturally tanky.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-05-25T04:44:43.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but his release was before the update.\nAlsom supports don't really cs unless they have relic.","replies":[{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2017-05-25T17:08:05.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah his release was before the sup item changes but that doesn't mean the team didn't know about the changes when making rakan","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-24T18:16:19.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"rakan feels like he has the most voice lines and I love it I prefer mid rakan compared to support rakan tho because he feels lacking as a support in terms of actually killing people","replies":[{"poster":"Kitty Pix","date":"2017-05-24T18:18:45.046+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnboundHades,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=wX1wphnV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-24T18:16:19.097+0000)\n>\n> rakan feels like he has the most voice lines and I love it I prefer mid rakan compared to support rakan tho because he feels lacking as a support in terms of actually killing people\n\nAs someone who mains support, I think you're confused on what supports are supposed to do for a team in League of Legends LUL","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-24T18:21:42.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I know what supports do it just rakan cant do anything as a support when his ult is down and his base q healing is way too low making u need to run windspeakers and redemption for it to do anything","replies":[{"poster":"Kitty Pix","date":"2017-05-24T18:25:03.540+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnboundHades,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=wX1wphnV,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-24T18:21:42.989+0000)\n>\n> I know what supports do it just rakan cant do anything as a support when his ult is down and his base q healing is way too low making u need to run windspeakers and redemption for it to do anything\n\nYeah, I highly disagree so .-.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-05-25T03:17:51.281+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your name is fitting here.

I don't want them to take out everything though, I think the aura thing is a great mechanic to help people learn the game and see what's happening around them which is why she's all I played, but her skill ceiling I feel is incredibly low even compared to supports like Janna. \n\nAnd I like all of those supps in one, so Rakan's perfect for me. His heal seems lackluster but once you get to lever 3-5 it starts to feel more noticeable since the heal scales on level. I've just been really wanting a mobile champion to play, almost started playing Ahri supp cause of it, and now I don't ever need to!
