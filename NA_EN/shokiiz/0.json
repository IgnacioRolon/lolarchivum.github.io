This happens before anybody spawns at the fountain or shortly before minions spawn and so far it's happened every single time, often times taking about 10 minutes to reconnect, putting me behind in the game. Sometimes the problem repeats later in the game but this isn't always the case. This doesn't happen with any of my other games either. Interestingly enough I've noticed my download speed drops to zero at the start of every game and slowly rises back up over the course of more or less 20 minutes before stabilising. This happens in custom games, PvP matches, PvE matches and even the tutorial. I'm totally clueless as to why this happens and, outside of the basics, I'm quite technologically inept. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else faced a similar problem? Could someone who knows what they're talking about possibly help me? Any kind of assistance would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-23T22:59:55.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've got a pretty unstable connection, so you're getting delays or cut off from the game at random moments.
