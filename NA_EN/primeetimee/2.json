Zed in lane is a bit of a bully but if you don&#039;t get fed in lane then late game zed is meh as a mid especially in this tank meta and full tank items on other non tanks.  Seems like zed is really a non issue and these nerfs are a bit of a knee jerk reaction to zed being played and dominating LCS games...  Nerfs seem silly and I am not even a zed main or play him that much but don&#039;t find zed that difficult to deal with.  If they pick zed just go leblanc or talon and watch zed cry.","replies":[]}
