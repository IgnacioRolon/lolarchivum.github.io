I know I know you should be and your shit teammates are holding you back.  However, lets be honest the champions that these players are telling you to play and are playing on stream are usually high skill cap champs or champs with many important skills shots that require.....wait for it.......SKILL.  I am not saying low elo players lack skill but the skill is no where close to diamond+.  \n\nSo what is my guide to low elo.  The concept is to stop playing high skill cap champs and focus on champions with easy skill sets.  This will allow low elo players to focus on getting better at the other aspects of the game that are more important in winning at low elo.  Here is a list of suggested champions for each role at lower elo.\n\nJungle:  Master yi, Warwick, Amumu, Volibear\n\nMId lane:  Malzahar, annie, Kayle, Morgana\n\nADC:  Lucian, EZ, Cait, sivir\n\nSupport:  Janna, Alistar, Leona, Morgana\n\nTop:  Dr. Mundo, Garen, Malphite, Maokai\n\n\nBefore anyone says &quot;X&quot; champion is trash why suggest that ect.  Well each of these champions has someone that mains them in diamond and higher and each has a relatively easy skill set to pull off that don&#039;t require god like reflexes are challenger game play to win with.  I am not suggesting that these champions are for everyone at all levels of play but these champions are easy to play in lower elo and allow players to focus on getting better at other things like laning/last hitting and general game mechanics.\n\nI will try to put some videos together of each champion being played at gold elo on a smurf that you can use to apply to anything gold and below as that is the elo this guide is aimed at.  I will also try to get some games on each of these champs on my stream so that you can see how they should be played for each role.  (twitch.tv/nyscienceteacher)\n\nI welcome anyone to add any information or constructive feedback.\n\n\nHere are some tips for all elo's          **WARNING WALL OF TEXT INC**\n\n1. Mute your team and enemy team upon entry into the game. Most of the players in bronze are little annoying shi#s anyways so just mute them and play the game as if it were an RPG. This helped out a lot because you are not looking at chat or chatting yourself. I've died raging at others because I was typing. Just mute them and play the game you know how to play.\n\n2. It does not matter which role/lane you play. I found that the games I lost it did not matter where I was as feeders will feed regardless. Always try to get one of the two roles you are best at and stick with 2-3 champs in those 2 roles. I played mostly support and had a KDA of 6:1 with 60% + win rate (sona, janna, nami). If I did not support I went man mode with graves ADC with a KDA of 5:1 at a 72% win rate and I also jungled hecarim, elise, and amumu. Support is the hardest role to carry out of bronze with but I did it so can you.\n\n3. Nexus > Inhibs > turrets > baron > dragon > kills. You win the game when the nexus blows up. You do that by taking turrets and inhibs. Do not chase for kills. Taking down that turret will benefit your team 5x more than you getting that one kill or not getting the kill and instead getting jumped by the enemy team because you chased him to their nexus.\n\n4. Unless your duo/tri queue  buddy's are pub stomping gods just solo Q. I won many more games solo than duo.  Match making will put the players on your team against other players of higher skill level if they are solo and expect the duo/tri to fully carry the game.  This is how match making works.\n\n5. Just keep playing. Even if you don't win you will get better with each game played and that alone may be worth the loss. You learned something from that game and you can adjust the next time you play that lane / match up and not make the same mistakes again. Pro players have 1,000's of games played each season. Your few hundred games is no where near that level of play. However, if you continue to play you will get better with each game. If you want to improve at ranked play you must play ranked games. Normals and aram's are for fun not for getting better at the game.\n\n6. Just focus on your lane. You cannot control the actions of others. If that mid/top is feeding just ignore it and continue to play at a high level of play. If you can help them by all means help them but you cannot lose your to help others. I have been able to make up for bad early games of others by never giving up myself when my team was 0-6 at ten minutes into the game. Your team may have better team fight ability and late game champs (nasus, fed yi, ori/malph/amumu).\n\n\"Don't stop believing\"\n\n7. \"Ping everything\"- Literally ping enemies missing even when they are missing from another lane and you happen to see it, ping when you see the jungle regardless of where you see them, ping a warning and let your teammates know. Ping when you see your teammates about to engage a 4v5 or other dumb sh#t you know they are about to do. Ping for assistance with a turret, dragon, baron or even when you want help pushing your lane before backing. PING EVERYTHING to the point where your teammates are probably going to get really annoyed.\n\n","replies":[]}
