I have to click so many times and there are instances that my char randomly moves forward (didnt misclick). My ping is stable at 34ms and fps at 110-150. \r\n\r\nAt first I thought it's a lag but everything moves perfectly fine except me. I read a couple of same issues happened 2013-2014 but they just waited for riot to issue a patch fix. Any other players w/ same problem out there?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-16T22:33:04.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This could be caused by a difference between your mouse cursor speed settings on your computer and in your client.
