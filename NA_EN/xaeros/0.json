Please allow at least 24 hours before attempting another purchase of the item.\n\nFirstly, I was completely unaware of this limit, and if it intentionally exists, is there somewhere that I can read about it?\n\nSecond, this message is now appearing on all of the items in the BE Store for me, not just the \"Mystery Champion\". (Ex: BE Emotes, Mystery Ward, Mystery Mini Icons, etc).\n\nIs this intentional? If so, does this really reset \"24 hours after the last purchase\", or does it reset at a certain time of day?\n\nAny info is appreciated, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"DancingHippo","date":"2017-11-27T04:28:13.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fudge Cakes!

We have this up on our Essence Emporium FAQ, but many of the items in the BE shop share a limit of 10 purchases per day.\n\n> Mystery Minis, mystery icons, mystery ward skins, and mystery champions share a limit of 10 purchases per day. That means any combination of those items up to ten will prevent you from buying any more of those items until 24 hours after your first purchase.\n\nMore info on our [FAQ ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014872088)but I hope that helps clear things up.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Xaeros","date":"2017-11-10T21:59:05.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An FAQ that I missed? \n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}} \n\nThanks for the info!
