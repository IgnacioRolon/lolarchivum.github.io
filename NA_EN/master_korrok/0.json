I have to double click it twice for it to open, and then i get the msg in my title in top left. I turned off everything including firewalls to try and get it to update, its definitely not my internet because i can download anything else at top speed right now. I tried to click Legacy Client and it just closes out the league window i had open and doesn't open a new one. Someone please help i tried looking in that pinned thread and found no info of value to me. \n\nP.S. It also changes in between 1 and 2 files scanned every now and then randomly when i open it.","replies":[{"poster":"estebuddy","date":"2017-10-25T03:58:20.529+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game 6+ times over the last 4 days alone. At first, the game wasn't loading menus or sometimes wouldn't load avatars on the rift even though it still processed that the game was going on while the screen, with the exception of the rift, was blank and audio was shot. Then it simply wouldn't load the client. After the 3rd install, the game simply wouldn't download anymore. It wasn't an issue of installment; I can't install what I don't have downloaded. It simply wouldn't download even as admin until it felt like it. After that, the game finally began to download and install properly, but it will not patch. It'll give a small message about the \"scanned file 1: release manifest\" and either not update, or begin the update and stop immediately. Doing nothing. I am incredibly frustrated as I know my laptop isn't an issue, nor is my network/internet connection. Everything else is running completely fine even on my laptop (it is a gaming laptop, so yes, it can run league fine -- until recently, I guess). However, as the client begins to act up, it absolutely wrecks my entire laptop. I don't want to waste yet another hour and a half uninstalling and reinstalling just so it can play 2 smooth games and immediately begin acting up again. Somebody please help. I've read through all the supp pages on corrupt files, troubleshooting, firewalls, admin rights, c: file clears for re installment, rebooting, patching issues, and even downloading the windows 3.5 .net framework in addition to the 4.0 for performance security AND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAS CHANGED.","replies":[{"poster":"Cfvalliere","date":"2017-10-26T18:04:44.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=estebuddy,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Vzr3YUtW,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-10-25T03:58:20.529+0000)\n>\n> I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game 6+ times over the last 4 days alone.

This early, though, your patcher is trying to scan game files to prepare for your update so it hasn't actually connected to the patching server yet.  Something in this case seems to be blocking that scan so nothing's happening.  I suggest going over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that league is being added as an exception.  Even though changing your DNS can help with downloading files, you still need permissions to access your directory.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master Korrok","date":"2017-04-05T05:46:52.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how it happened but i changed my DNS to google public and then just changed it back, when i opened it again it was actually scanning files.
