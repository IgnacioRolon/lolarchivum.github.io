The only &quot;3rd party tools&quot; I use are logitech gaming mouse software and discord. I spent hundreds on this account. There is no way I would ever be dumb enough to even think about using hacks. And this was after a 1 month break from the game too. I was busy with uni, and now that it&#039;s summer, and I come back excited to play the game... this happens. Truly devastating.\n\nI play one game, and boom I&#039;m banned. You can even search me up Sumerian on na.op.gg. There is 0 way I&#039;m hacking. I have mediocre kdas and mediocre wr&#039;s...\n\nI&#039;m actually so sad wtf. Hopefully, they will review my ticket and unban me, but knowing Riot support, they&#039;ll probably give me an automated message.\n\n* **Update 1:** Got sent an automated message :'(... I've replied begging them to re-investigate again.\n\n**Update 2:\n**\nOk, hi guys...\n\nI kept replying to the tickets, and Riot Support kept insisting that I was indeed scripting or using 3rd party hacks. I have never ever used 3rd party hacks/scripts before, so I was so confused--angry even.\n\nToday I learned something new.\n\nI'm in an extremely difficult predicament. Apparently, my computer has scripts installed on it--by my brother. He admitted to it, and I even ended up finding traces of it in my Program Files.\n\nNow here's the thing, I've never used scripts before, and my brother does not have access to my league account. However, we do share the same computer to play League on: our family computer.\n\nI'm not sure how Riot's detection system works--it may have picked up the scripting program he installed onto our computer, even though I never used the program. Heck, I didn't even know about it until today.\n\nI really don't know what to do. I have never scripted on my account before, but I might lose it forever--that just does not sit well with me.\n\nAny help/attention would be appreciated. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"kF2vSItcYM","date":"2017-07-14T15:26:35.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update 2:\n\nOk, hi guys...\n\nI kept replying to the tickets, and Riot Support kept insisting that I was indeed scripting or using 3rd party hacks.

And rightfully so. The 3rd party detection systems for League of Legends have a relatively low false positive rate, and for those who are found to not actually have been scripting were usually compromised. \n\nPlayer Support can look into additional records associated with your account, but _if_ you were suspended for 3rd party applications, it was likely for a valid reason. \n\nI've upvoted your post so you can get some justice for your account!

Not only do they destroy the game, they also destroy legitimate players.\n\nIf this truly is the reason for the downvotes, then the hacking community wins. They successfully drowned out innocent and legitimate players like me.\n\n\"found this formula to give the most positive feedback and highest chance of regaining an account\"\n\nIf what you say is true, then do you know why these \"many many iterations of this complaint\" used to work? It's because it's the most genuine sounding shit in the world. And I'm as genuine as possible right now, because I just lost my account with years of work on it--and that's the recipe for genuine depression.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-07-11T19:34:22.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks to me like I'm being a dick.

Don't make additional tickets because that would drop you back down to the bottom of the pile. Do respond to every email they send to you.

And I think people downvote because these threads don't help you at all. You make a ticket and you wait. Nothing more you can do and thus you shouldn't worry about things that's out of your control. If you've made a ticket and made this thread, it's kind of like someone who just won't stop talking about something bad that's happened to them. Well this might sound mean but to be frank, this isn't that bad. It's just a video game. At worst you won't be able to play your main account for a few days. Don't worry too much over it.\n\nIf you really did not use 3rd party programs that League has flagged, you should be fine so sit tight and relax. If you are worrying even after that fact, then you probably are guilty of using 3rd party program.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-07-11T18:00:05.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nSend a ticket into Riot talking about this.
