Did research, but still need help :(","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the past week or two ive had a bipolar ping. one minute its 40 then BOOM shoots up to 200-300 then back down to 40. It repeats this process over and over. Of course this has been a popular post for many occassions so i did my research online through PAST boards for help instead of just wasting time making a post. I changed a lot of things on my computer to adapt and fix the ping on league, including flushing my DNS and in fact changing my DNS to google's according to what was suggested by a senior member of an old post which was upvoted. I figured it was my computer over heating and maybe ruining my GPU card so i started tuning things down, such as CPU usage etc which did stop the over heating, but i had no success in ping going back to how it was (according to my settings, my GPU is working correctly). My internet is honestly fine, it's the best internet you can get around my area and i made sure of that when i got it because i love to gaming in my free time. I've also had all my settings on low in game. All of these ping issues came soon after patch 6.24 i believe.. but no one seems to have the same problems as me so i think it may be something else causing it. Any ideas on what it could be? I'd appreciate your input","replies":[{"poster":"Holobox","date":"2016-12-30T04:17:35.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same Problem since about 23.12.2016","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T17:03:07.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some packet loss or other connection issue, and it can be due to your ISP but local issues as well.

I run different programs, like hextech repair tool. Result=0 packet loss. They keep saying is the packet, why I didn't have any problems before the new patch? I mean, before the patch the game run perfectly, after the patch I get \"packet loss\", just wow. And the other thing is that i can play normal(no lag problems) games like cod, battlefield, dota, fifa, overwatch, hots, cs go... but this one? Nope! Really now? Really? Packet loss? Why there is no packet loss on the other games too?
