I was wondering if there is anybody out there who can give me tips on how to lane against Orianna as Aurelion Sol. The playstyle I ussually run with is, farm for the first 3 waves then back afterwards. Then repeat for clearing waves while trying to add slight pressure to Orianna. Afterwards I would roam if I hard pushed my lane and try to help my teammates. The problem I have with Orianna is that even though we go stale in lane she always out damages me. If anyone has any itemization set against Orianna I would like to hear it, so far I have tried megatron Cloak as a early mitigation of damage.

Thank you though. Also The potential to out damage her is cut when she has the chance to ult you, your w resets and you're basically sitting duck for a good 3-4 seconds.
