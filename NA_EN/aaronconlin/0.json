These skins are seriously amazing, I was excited for the Nautilus skin as soon as the splash art was leaked onto the PBE by mistake. However, I do have one small complaint (that's also not a complaint): the price.\n\nEach of these skins will be 750 RP each. Sweet, I can get awesome skins for relatively cheap, BUT (here's where the complaint comes in), the price tag limits the skins in terms of what they can do. There are no special animations (esp. recall), no particle effects, etc. These have so much potential, and I'd gladly pay the 975 or 1350 RP for these skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-01-28T02:10:26.860+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm digging these fully-armored, full face masked skins they're putting out.
