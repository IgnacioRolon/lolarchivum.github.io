Actual Marksmen aren't really a problem with LW because they can't get it as a second item and have it boost their damage through the roof like a Zed or Riven or other melee bursty champion. The one exception is of course Varus who is more like Jayce than an actual ADC in most cases.","replies":[{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2015-02-01T14:36:40.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If melee burst champions are the problem, just switch the 20% ranged to 20% melee","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-01T22:10:04.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then mages would go tanky and beat the melee burst champions. To reduce the ArP, you'd have to reduce the armor on Zhonya's and put restrictions on what items everyone can go etc., which isn't what League is about. A mage can already buy a Zhonya's and one other defensive item and make most melee burst champions pretty sad if they don't have their LW. \n\nSome things are simply a necessary evil so that a tank can't 1v5, which they can in some cases still if they got ahead early.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-02-01T14:49:46.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is Arpen is %of target's armor. It should be flat pen like the old days. If you want to leave a dent, you need to focus your build on penetration, instead of just throwing 30% of that Rammus' defenses down a toilet with a cheap item. Either that or an item with a passive: %armor penetration on this champions is reduced by 30%.\n\nSo imagine an enemy Zed penetrates 35% of your armor. With this item, a little less than a third of that penetration ceases to exist (maybe turning it into around 27% penetration).\n\nBut I still think flat penetration is the way to go.","replies":[{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2015-02-01T14:53:33.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. I wonder if changing the (this applies before armor penetration) to (this applies after armor penetration), so the amount of armor left to be affected by the 35% is lower.
