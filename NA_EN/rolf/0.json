The main reason I'm upset about this is because it's different to the low priority queue you get when you dodge champ select, which in my opinion is fucking r%%%%%ed i waited the 20 min now let me play the game i have spent my life and money on >:(. If someone at riot sees this i would like to say.... Please change this make leaverbuster have the same mechanics as low priority. ty &amp; fuck u jk ily ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T04:56:03.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because *Leaverbuster* low-priority queues depend on a **completed game** being played through to remove that 20-minute mark, if you drop out once you've started the queue for any reason, it will not count towards removing the LPQ.\n\nWhile I can't change how the system works, you can leave this feedback on the [Miscellaneous Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) if you'd like.
