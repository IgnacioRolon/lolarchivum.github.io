It was at silver 4 0lp. Legit took me about 100 games of trying to get through it. People tilt so freaking hard in this elo and just feed like animals when they lose lane. Then theres all the new to ranked players you randomly get on your team... Like jesus... theres so much trolls, so many toxic players, etc.... i mean not saying being plat makes me super good or anything but to take that long to get through silver for a plat player says something about how trash the matchmaking is here and how tilty these people are. Near impossible to carry half the games. Goodbye silver. Elo hell is real.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2017-10-04T23:58:20.603+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, funny how that works and yet how people claim elo hell doesn't exist and you can carry any game if you just \"get good\". Some reasons for the challenge:\n\nNew players - valid reason for them being bronze/silver\n\nPeople refuse to take constructive criticism - not ok; people are not toxic for telling you to ward or to NOT engage a 3v5\n\nPeople are good enough to climb, but they always end up with more smurfs on the other team - this is where I get upset at smurfs. Play on smurf account, try out a new champ or build, that's all fine and good. But you shouldn't go out of your way to hard carry - this boosts bad players and holds down people who truly deserve to climb. Thus creating and reinforcing \"elo hell\".\n\nMacro play - very few players have a decent understanding of macro play - most follow the famous words of Gambit Gaming - \"see hero, kill hero.\". This means many swings in who is winning and longer games where it is more of a toss-up and advantages can easy be turned.\n\nTilt - people lack macro, so they don't realize that they can easily win despite losing lane. They think they must immediately get a reply kill if they die in lane - causing them to feed rather than lose gracefully. Also causing afk, flame, and lack of teamwork in more abundance than what should be expected. There seems to be a few bottlenecks in climbing and I can attest that silver (especially low/mid silver) is one of the worst.\n\nTroll picks - either they saw it on YouTube and have no clue why it worked, or they tried it in bots or ONE TIME in pvp and won with it. Therefore, it must be good against everything in every situation. And then it doesn't work. And they are feeding. And they are useless because their odd pick and build means they are either tanky without any damage or cc to threaten enemy team or they are all damage but die in 1.5 sec before they can make use of that damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze 5 Teeto","date":"2017-10-05T00:06:30.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fun part is when ur enemy top laner and jg are duo smurf and u get dove under ur tower by nasus and hecarim 3 times before 10 minutes while ur jungler is busy with gromps.

Meanwhile they can 4v2 get aced without killing anyone and they aren't feeders somehow.\n\nDie to a repeat gank thanks to flash cheese and laner taking ignite. Then ganked by a 3/0/0 mid at level 4 and die when you were about to 1v1 kill your opponent. Get told to stay bronze. Go on to be able to 1v2 double kill laner and jungler by level 11. Carry the game. Get 0 honor or apology for being flamed all game.\n\nTake a feeding team, stall out the enemy essentially 1v5 for 15 min till your adc can come online. Set up winning baron bait and minion wave to push bot tier 2 tower while you win a miracle 5v5 via tp flank onto the only ward in area - which you placed because team can't afford to use their free wards. Get baron. Pull 3 fed enemies top to stop your splitpush with baron. Get a kill and escape - keeping 2 more people top and giving team a 4v2 easy double kill and bot inhib tower. 1v2 stop enemy backs and let team win the game. 0 thanks - just flame and getting called garbage for not grouping. Never mind we would lose the 5v5 guaranteed.\n\nSo many players know so little. And the worst part is, they know so little they think they are right. It's not even worth your time explaining how they are wrong because they don't have the game knowledge to comprehend what you say or how it is better than what they did. Not that I know everything. But I know a lot more than most (low and high elo) would give me credit for.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bańg","date":"2017-10-05T00:01:47.788+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"come to diamond 5 and tell me how long you last before quitting the game for a couple of days.\n\nthat elo literally takes your soul and fucks it","replies":[{"poster":"kaironen","date":"2017-10-05T00:53:53.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been in d5 for a long time (just got it back since i quit for 4 months about a month ago).
