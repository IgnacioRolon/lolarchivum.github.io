I can hardly believe that Brand is still available in ranked games, given the fact that picking him is more or less signing up for a defeat...\r\nSo questions for the people in charge at Riot Games : were you aware of this issue, and are you actually working on it? (maybe not solving it right now, but for example preventing people from getting a free lose, especially in ranked games...)\r\n\r\nPS : yes i&#039;m sightly upset about the defeats. Thanks for asking.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-05T16:58:36.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Agone -\n\n(Just the messenger here - I looked at the database for the status of the issue.)\n\nWe are aware of the issue and we are working to resolve it ASAP.
