Unfortunately, I don't have an answer for you, but perhaps Riot's support team will. Be sure to have your friend [open a support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) and include as much information about the issue as possible!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-22T23:56:38.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn you Elduris!

All I could say was \"WOW!\", the odds of this happening almost at the exact second is extremely rare and has to be incredibly crazy.\n\nBecause you gifted Championship Thresh to your friend, I went ahead and manually refunded the 975 RP that he spent on this skin.  Let him know that he should see this added back the next time he signs in!","replies":[]}]}
