When I first saw the skin I was actually pretty stoked because the red particle would contrast against the overwhelmingly green tint of Summoner&#039;s Rift, but seeing them in game the reality fell super short of the expectation.\r\n\r\nFor reference, some Blood Moon &#039;Wind Wall&#039; vs the Regular:\r\nhttp://www.newsoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Blood-Moon-Yasuo-W-11-1024x640.jpg\r\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-llvZCk14Vwg/Vs0pm9qMgWI/AAAAAAAALmQ/HOGEjzSLhHw/s640/yasuow.jpg \r\nhttp://lkimg.zamimg.com/shared/guides/221017/images/Yasuo%20W%20Ability%201.png\r\n\r\nWhy is the Blood Moon version so transparent? \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s so insubstantial it might as well be a 5 AD buff to Warrior. \r\n\r\nThe clarity of the Wind Wall is reducing the clarity of gameplay for me. \r\n\r\nIt might as well be called a Wind Window.
