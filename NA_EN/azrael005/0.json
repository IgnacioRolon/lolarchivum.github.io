Whether its because someone got irritated that someone else wanted to go into a lane or because people get more enjoyment out of frustrating their own team and then dropping reports at the end once they have pissed everyone off to such an extent that they just rage out.\r\n\r\nI get that its policy to not enforce meta but at the same time the game lends itself to certain roles. I mean adc needing farm to get items to become strong has always been built into the game i.e. kogmaw is not close to the usefuless of a jarvan if they both have one item or the utility of a thresh before kog&#039;maw gets going. Anyways point being when people make picks to actively hurt the team whether its because others have already selected champs or &quot;called&quot; lanes it seems like there is a free pass for unsportsmanlike conduct which as far as I know doing something for the sake of frustrating other players or sabotaging your own team for personal amusement is unsportsmanlike.  So when someone goes adc style champ and a troll goes something like another adc or a wave clear champ and isn&#039;t playing to last hit as much as deny farm to the guy trying to play adc, it just seems like they are immune to any form of repercussions just because any moderation that could be construed as enforcing a meta is avoided.\r\n(generally I play solo lane champs given the choice but its pretty noticeable when so few people want to play a support style champ and adc&#039;s get screwed so often because of it game after game).\r\n\r\nAnother issue is in normals/blinds where the someone will state &quot;its just normals&quot; implying that they are not putting any effort in trying to win as if it were ranked they would not be playing in that manner. I mean it is a team vs team game and even not taken seriously at, part of playing the game is trying to win...\r\n\r\nI mean if I&#039;m playing a casual game of baseball with friends I still swing the bat I don&#039;t just say &quot;meh its fine its not as if it matters.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-08-23T04:20:17.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then QtPie mine as well get banned for when he kept playing GP adc and Yasuo adc... and bard jungle without smite.","replies":[{"poster":"Azrael005","date":"2016-08-23T11:56:26.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again my point was not about picking off meta but the people who  will do things to actively hurt the team.

Ive had people do this to me because they didnt like my adc pick in gold so its not always just inexperienced people. Ive also seen adc/supports take smite to steal the junglers buffs and follow him throughout jungle because they didnt like that champion","replies":[{"poster":"Azrael005","date":"2016-08-23T20:59:31.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, personally I get that its a difficult issue to address because it can be incredibly difficult at times to tell if someone is legitimately having a bad game vs players actively taking the time to play in such a way that it is detrimental to the team. There is definitely waaaaay to many games to review each of them but at the same time it actively empowers a growing number of people who exhibit sadistic tendencies in their desires to aggravate others and attempt to get them banned for giving into their frustrations through chat which is the only real tangible I've seen riot take action against. These are the junior swatters who take pleasure in agonizing the people around them and causing potential financial damage to those who may have spent money on the game. It's why I will never spend real money on this game. The frequency with which people like this appear in games is all too high and at some point I may respond in such a way that I know isn't right in hind sight but in the moment it just comes pouring out. Personally there are a few skins I would love to own and i've poured a huge amount of time into this game but riots arbitration system seems incredibly one dimensional towards chat behavior rather than overall player behavior. I've had maybe one or two reports go through to my knowledge and both of those I suspect went towards either a report on homophobic slurs or racial slurs. So the other reports for negative behavior which have made up the majority of my reports because I usually just turn on the mute if chat bothers me are largely wastes of time and the worst part of this is the community knows it.\n\nHonestly I would rather an honest removal of everything but offensive chat and offensive name be removed from the report function as at least that would accurately reflect punishable offenses in the game rather than the farce that the other options of the report system present. Love to get a rioters thoughts on the matter.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2016-08-23T05:33:42.190+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"League is so funny because it does so much to try and punish toxic players that it usually just ends up punishing the people who react to toxic players.\n\nTrolls have more power than ever now, because it is now a team game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TSM True Shadow","date":"2016-08-23T12:38:09.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one guy in my last game on my perma banned main account trolled,lost game,laughed at us when we died and flamed us,i told my team to report him,i got banned,he didnt,logic","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-08-23T12:48:15.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TSM True Shadow,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=cmOEwee7,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-08-23T12:38:09.477+0000)\n>\n> one guy in my last game on my perma banned main account trolled,lost game,laughed at us when we died and flamed us,i told my team to report him,i got banned,he didnt,logic\n\nThat's because asking for reports is considered harrassment.
