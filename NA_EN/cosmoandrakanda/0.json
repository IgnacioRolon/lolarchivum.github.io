I get on and start playing and 2 days later I get an email saying \"your account has never been compromised too many times we are going to suspend it.\" I was shocked and dismayed at this since I never shared my info or been hacked. I am proceeded to ask several questions which are some that there is no way in hell I can remember for an account that's about 7 years old (first 5 champions bought first, first thing bought with rp, gifts and stuff ive received)\r\n\r\nThe only thing I was able to recollect was every transaction number for everytime I've purchased rp. \r\n\r\nAccording to the riot supporter this infomation was incorrect and my account was deleted.\r\n\r\nBut before this all transpired, I noticed on 4/12/2017, there was an aram game and ip purchases I didn't do, and I mention this to the rioter. He ignored that I was actually hacked and proceeded to delete my account anyways.\r\n\r\nI am really upset because about 300$ dollars and 6 years of my life deleted just because I didn't have every gift, every rp purchase memorized.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-14T02:29:10.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \nIt looks like you may have encountered a new [**phishing attempt**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204230720-Phishing-Don-t-take-the-bait) that hackers have developed.
