After every patch, I cannot log into League. After every patch, when I click to open the League client, it takes like 5 minutes for the launcher to pop up. Please note that this is not what normally happens. Normally my launcher pops up in 10 seconds. Also, again, after every new patch, as I'm entering my password or the second I have access to the client (after entering the password) I get an error saying: \"There was an error connecting with Maestro. League of Legends will now exit. Please try restarting the client.\"\n\nThis is the same case after every single patch. --> The patcher/the landing page pops up in 5 minutes. When I enter my password or I have gained access to the client, I get the error: \"There was an error connecting with Maestro. League of Legends will now exit. Please try restarting the client.\"\n\nI do have a solution for this. I delete the following folders in RADS-Projects: lol_air_client, lol_air_client_config_euw, lol_launcher and lol_patcher. This usually fixes the problem but here is the thing. I have a slow internet connection and downloading all these files all over again after every patch is really a big bother.\n\nLet me answer some of your questions beforehand. I didn't make any hardware changes during the period when the issue began. I didn't install any software that might interfere with League's connection. I have all the League ports forwarded in my modem's interface. All League related .exe files are allowed in the Windows Firewall. I have COMODO as my antivirus program and again all League related exe files are included in the Exceptions list. I'm definitely sure I do not have a virus on my computer. I regularly do scans with COMODO, Malwarebytes and Adware Cleaner. I have tried opening up the launcher/patcher/landing page as administrator. I have tried resetting my modem several times. I use Google DNS. And this started after patch 6.17 hit live.\n\nPlease help. How can I solve this without having to delete all those files every time a new patch hits?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T21:26:29.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because patches only modify local files insides your League directory, they're *extremely unlikely* to impact your connection. You mentioned a few things that stick out to me as potentially problematic, specifically your firewalls and slow connection. \n\nI strongly recommend ensuring your local network settings are compatible with those listed in our [connection guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if you notice any changes after working through those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Wukοng Bot","date":"2016-09-09T16:48:18.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhh, this is going to sound weird.\n\nI tried running League with Windows Firewall disabled, it didn't work. But then I thought of something else. Like I said in my initial post, I use COMODO Antivirus but for the last couple of weeks I had both COMODO services disabled in Services.msc. I activated the services and restarted the computer. I started League and it worked fine. No maestro error. But here is the strange thing.\n\nThe error clearly had something to do with COMODO. I guess it was interfering with League's connection, but how? It was disabled. It wasn't working at all, none of its processes. But when I activated it, League worked fine. It's interfering with League when it's disabled but when it's activated League is working okay. Shouldn't it be the complete opposite? This is quite odd. Do you have any idea how this might be possible?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T15:52:27.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like with Comodo, 'turning it off and on again' may have helped it figure out that League isn't a sketchy dude trying to sell you strange goods from their trench coat on a street corner at 3AM. It can now see League for what it actually is, which is simply a polite dude who simply enjoys wearing his trench coat and fedora because they're comfortable and suited for the weather.\n\nTL;DR Comodo restarted and probably whitelisted League again.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
