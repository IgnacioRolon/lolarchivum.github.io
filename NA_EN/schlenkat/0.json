This is fine. However, if the enemy has only one more tentacle to (help) kill before removing the debuff and you *reapply* vessel, they still only have to kill one to remove it. The timer is reset to one minute, but the &quot;tentacles remaining&quot; counter doesn&#039;t change. I can&#039;t imagine this is anything but an accident, and it can be very frustrating to make someone a vessel, only to see them remove it after killing one tentacle. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n*This has happened to me on several occasions. I am not sure that it happens every time, but it feels like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-03-09T21:20:29.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play her a lot,  so I understand how painful this bug is.
