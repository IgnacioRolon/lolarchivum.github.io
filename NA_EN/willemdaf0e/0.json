I was playing Lucian, and was laning against a Tristana. I fire my ult, and she ults me, but hers cancels mine. Now, I&#039;m sure anyone reading this knows, Lucian can move (and dash) during his ult, so why would being knocked back interrupt it? Furthermore, in a game earlier in the day, I stunned an opposing Lucian during his ult and it wasn&#039;t canceled. Makes very little sense to me that his ult would not be canceled by a stun, but would be canceled by a displacing ability. Lucian already has a hard enough time existing in the current meta, whereas Tristana is one of the more commonly used and potent adc&#039;s as it stands now. It&#039;s utterly absurd that one of his only good tools should be completely removed by a point and click ability that takes no skill to land.\r\n\r\n/end rant","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-07T04:51:46.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"? how would a displacement not stop lucian, whose being forced to move and in certain way against his will.","replies":[{"poster":"WillemDaf0e","date":"2017-10-07T17:31:30.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's able to move during his ult without canceling it, so why would someone moving him cancel it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-10-07T03:59:22.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
