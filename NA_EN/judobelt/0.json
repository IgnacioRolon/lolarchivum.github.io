I just started cuz my brothers play, but I suck at it. since everyone is saying I suck (I don't know why, they say I buy too much duplicates or whatever) I'm scared they will report me for a permaban. I don't think lol is that unreasonable but Im just scared.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-22T02:22:15.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you believe someone to be too harsh towards you, remember to report them after the game! It's not always the best idea to build multiple of the same item, so you should try to build different, but related items. There are recommended items to buy, so when in doubt, see which recommended item will work best for you! Sometimes people think they're trying to help you, but don't realize how harsh they might come off as, and sometimes people can just be straight up mean. If you are making a full and honest attempt to learn and play the game, then it doesn't matter whether or not they report you, as those would be considered false reports.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-22T03:13:48.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Kokua mentioned, those players are most likely just upset that they think you're not doing the best job you could be. I wouldn't let that get to you too much, and just focus on having fun and enjoying the game! I'd suggest maybe trying to play more co-op vs ai for now while you're picking up the game, that's a much more relaxed area where people are known to try out new things. \n\nAlso, always remember to report people if you are feeling attacked. Even if those players think they are helping, becoming negative and ruining someone else's experience just isn't cool. I wouldn't worry about getting punished for others reports for the things you mentioned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JudoBelt","date":"2017-12-30T02:39:39.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your replies. Im liking the game, but there soooo muuuchh to memorize. like, wats stun? armor? penetration? I'm like whaaat ._. Don't you just kill and win. For example, this might be a stupid question but when I play fighter, I can't kill anyone as they just run away. But wen I play marksman, the fighters like teleport to me and they kill me?","replies":[]}]}
