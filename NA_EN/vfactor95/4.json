His low base attack speed makes building the stat on him not very attractive which in turn encourages the poke and chunk play pattern we see.\r\n\r\nAnd so for that he&#039;s had various aspects of his kit nerfed, and will probably continue to be randomly nerfed until he&#039;s just another generalist mage who isn&#039;t good enough at anything to justify picking.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to happen is that Riot needs to shift power to where it&#039;s supposed to be in his kit. Note that when I say power shift I mean he needs nerfs and buffs.\r\n\r\nSo to start off his Q needs to be gutted, in both damage and cooldown. The power in this spell should be in its utility (slow and repositiong soldiers) not in raw power. Furthermore considering that most Azir builds give him 40% cdr (with cdr blues) his q ends up being on a low enough cooldown that it&#039;s very hard to punish him for positioning his soldiers incorrectly.\r\n\r\nTo offset this I propose we add a passive to the ability (I know how much people here love passives) that marks champions hit by Q for a duration. Soldiers that attack marked targets deal bonus magic damage that scales with ranks in Q _but not with ability power_. The purpose of this is to make his damage less frontloaded as well as reward building AS.\r\n\r\nI also think the AS for CDR should be moved back to Azir&#039;s passive because as it is right now the tower is just a free 100 gold for the enemy team most of the time.\r\n\r\nThose changes alone should go a long way to making him more balanced, but one thing I&#039;d like to see as someone who played a lot of Azir is putting the knockup back on his E without the shield. Now I know a lot of people hated it but I honestly thought it added a lot of interesting play potential to his kit. Even if it means disabling the use of Q while dashing I still think Riot should find a way to add it back in because it made for some cool plays and as it is his E feels very lackluster. You generally need to use 2 other spells in order to get the full dash from it and on top of that it can interrupted by people just standing in your way.\r\n\r\nAgain, I know a lot of people here hate Azir but I do hope this at least sparks some healthy discussion about how to fix him even if my suggestions are deemed bad.","replies":[]}
