If ignite is a counter to mundo or something it might serve a greater utility, but honestly just build morello's. However, the argument is that TP will have a greater impact in the majority of instances than ignite will and so you have given the enemy a significantly larger advantage than just losing lane.\n\nFor example, ignite can clean up a kill or deal w/ shield or something. TP can take a tower that is pushed you wouldn't have been able to get to in time (like before enemy respawns, or it is low hp tower, but enemy could get back to defend it in time if you don't have tp for it), which is multiple kills worth of gold (like 1k right?). Also TP can get you to a team fight where team was being chased 3v3 or something and you turn it around w/ advantage and take objectives off the ensuing 4 or 5v2.","replies":[{"poster":"AsheGetsGanked","date":"2015-05-13T00:16:15.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"again it depends on the match.
