You match garen in sustain (with q) and escape potential (with e) and while it&#039;s harder to secure kills you can still push people out of lane and create map pressure. Furthermore it&#039;s easier to protect your portal because you have a taunt.\r\n\r\nSame build as Garen (Zz&#039;rot, Sunfire, Spirit Visage, Thornmail, Randuins) but I&#039;d recommend taking ignite instead of flash (if you can do so safely) so that it&#039;s easier to kill high sustain champions you might find yourself against at various points in the game.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[]}
