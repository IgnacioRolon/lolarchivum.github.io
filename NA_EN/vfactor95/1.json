I wanted to say this when 4.20 came out but I'll just say it now: This guy is amazing at making Patch Notes not a chore to read through.\n\nAn important part of game balance is for players to actually keep up with it. Kind of like how a democratic government doesn't work as well when it's voting population is ignorant of issues, it's harder to balance a game when players aren't aware of balance changes (seems like common sense, but we all know how common that is).\n\nAnd I'd like to recognize Pwyff for making Patch Notes actually fun to read. Especially for 4.20 (man those patch notes were long), which was chalk full of gameplay changes, the notes kept you from just giving up and winging it for the next week.\n\nSo thanks Pwyff, keep the funnies coming for many patches to come","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Clueless PhD","date":"2014-12-10T20:14:19.004+0000","up_votes":78,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll agree.
