In this league of tanks and with assassins having fallen out of favor, a lot of teamfights come down to which frontline falls first or can outmaneuver the other one. Well Ashe helps with both!\r\n\r\nShe can apply her passive slow on up to 3 members of the frontline (which is usually the most tanks you&#039;ll see) and with her Q active she can also shred 30% of their armor instantly. You can use Hawkshot to watch for flanks, and her ulti is great for locking down carries in the back of the fight to make them easy pickings for your team.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t something that will work every game and probably requires a specific team comp for but I feel if done right can become a very potent niche pick that is completely viable in the current meta. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this or other ways you&#039;ve found to make new ashe work?","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-05-15T23:00:25.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer the standard build or you can go super Assassin Ashe with an IE and Ghostblade.
