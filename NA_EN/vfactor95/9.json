More autoattacks means you&#039;re getting more out of your AD and it also means you&#039;re lifestealing more often.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, getting AP doesn&#039;t make your AD more valuable and while technically AS does make AP more valuable with the 8 stack on-hit passive, practically it doesn&#039;t matter that much (unless you&#039;re kayle with nashors).\r\n\r\nThe item is 68% gold efficient at no stacks going up to almost 200% at 8 stacks.\r\n\r\nRiot actually did a good job conceptually of tying the efficiency of the item to time spent in battle.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that for melees, it&#039;s too easy to reach that peak and for ranged, it&#039;s very easy to maintain stacks given that they only go away after 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nSo I do think that if Riot did away with melee autoattacks generating 2 stacks of rage and decreased the grace period from 5 seconds to something like 2 seconds it would go a long way towards the item being balanced.\r\n\r\nIf you nerf the efficiency you might as well remove the item from the game since that&#039;s all it has going for it, so I hope Riot takes the correct steps towards balancing the item or outright deletes it. It&#039;s annoying when Riot makes an item, it&#039;s popular for a bit, then nerfs what made it worth buying in the first place, and then no one buys it for the rest of the season after which it gets deleted or reworked.","replies":[]}
