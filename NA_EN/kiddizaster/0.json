Unless you're playing a lot of RPGs or something, you probably don't need to accest most of the slots for active effects.  Stick your boots into the slot most ackward to reach, assign your trinket to the easiest, and most people shouldn't need more than two _maybe_ three actives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oddysseas","date":"2015-04-04T00:04:34.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wired mouse, although more reliable and longer lasting, can also be very uncomfortable.

I switched to a Thermaltake Esports Volos though, because it has more buttons for my MMO's and more options than the Razer Nagas. The Volos wasn't too expensive and I enjoy it. Like Hugh does, I also use a Razer Nostromo (it's a Belkin model that Razer bought).","replies":[{"poster":"Oddysseas","date":"2015-04-04T00:10:30.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think too many buttons can be confusing.

Has been pretty good to me so far, been about 4 months since I got it and it has shown no signs of giving up any time soon. And I've played games that require a LOT of clicking. FPS, MOBA, MMORPG, Card games, Dungeon Crawlers. \nThe design is nice, especially the thumb part, its very comfortable. It slants in all the places you would usually expect to put your fingers. In length it is about the size of an iPod 4th Gen, so it is probably meant for bigger hands. My only complaint would be the scroll pad, as its pretty loud and a bit clunky. Other than that, the design of the second one you showed is amazing, feels great in your hands. \n\nI really like the AULA mouse, but I will say again that its only been 4 months. So who knows. Mine only cost me like $12, though. Definitely worth the price.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hugh Drectum","date":"2015-04-03T23:54:04.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zelote - Using it now... perfect...However chord is SHORTER then Heisenberg's hair so get an EXTENSION.

HOWEVER\n\n I purchased a Razer Keyboard for 80$ and it didn't even last 11 full months.  I replaced my mouse, keyboard, and am working on my headset. ALL RAZER PRODUCTS... I no longer recommend them.\n\nThey have awful customer service and your buying a name. \n\nThe only other Razer product I have is ACTUALLY BELKIN.  Razer just wrote the programs.  \n\nOverall, pay less replace in a year and you will be better off then a razer.","replies":[]}]}
