I really love league and I would hate to drop it because the damn thing is unplayable.\r\n\r\nAlso side note, League is the only thing running on my computer, and my computer is the only thing on the internet, hooked up with Ethernet.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-08T20:41:37.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're fps and ping are showing what you're used to seeing but you're still disconnecting that often, it makes me think this might be more related to packet loss rather than your actual internet speeds. There's a chance that your connection is hitting a rough spot along it's way to our servers which might be what keeps making you lose that connection. \n\nCheck out our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) with the network logs of some of the games you disconnected in, take a screenshot, and post it here using something like Imgur so I can look over it too.","replies":[]}]}
