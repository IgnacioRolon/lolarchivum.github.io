Call up your jungler and watch where Riven wards.\n* Riven deals entirely physical damage.  If you need to, use flat Armor Quints and Seals.\n* Riven will typically try to force fights early-game.  Make sure you are durable enough to survive using your runes and items so that you can farm up your items.\n* Riven's health regeneration without lifesteal is horrible.  Any damage you deal to her early will stick quite well.\n------------------------\nPotential starting items:\n{{item:1028}} {{item:1029}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1054}} \n\nThese options all provide early durability (to survive all-ins) and decent sustain (which Riven lacks).\n\nRuby Crystal and Cloth Armor both build into many defensive items, which is beneficial for bruisers and tanks.\n------------------------\nItemization:\n\nIf possible, you want to build an early defensive item so that Riven can't easily assassinate you.  The optimal choice will depend on the champion and enemy team composition, but the following are all good options.\n\n{{item:3047}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3191}} {{item:3027}}  {{item:3742}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3136}} \n\nMost of them provide a mixture of offensive and defensive stats to help you survive and kill Riven.\n\nThis is by no means inclusive as some champions are better served by sticking to their core items (i.e. Trinity Force, Guinsoo's Rageblade, Black Cleaver, Manamune) and deviating would significantly delay their main powerspike.\n---------------------------------------\nPlaystyle:\n\nRiven will be stronger early-game, so you have to know when to give up CS to avoid taking unnecessary damage or dying.\n\nFreeze the minion wave outside of your tower.  If you can, then Riven will risk taking tower shots whenever she tries to harass you or farm.   It will also leave her significantly overextended and make it easy for your jungler to gank her.\n\nRiven has long-ish cooldowns early-game and the early CDR she can purchase has been reduced.  If she wastes cooldowns to farm, it can be a good opportunity to trade with her.\n------------------------------------\nClass specific:\n\nAD Bruisers (i.e. Renekton, Gnar, Illaoi, Garen, Darius) may benefit from building 2 Doran's Blade into Black Cleaver and/or Sunfire Cape, which provides a significant amount of sustain, damage, and durability early.\n\nAP Tanks (i.e. Maokai, Cho'gath) benefit from building Rod of Ages into Frozen Heart for durability, mana, damage, and CDR.\n\nPure tanks (i.e. Malphite) want to build Sunfire Cape into Frozen Heart/Iceborn Gauntlet.\n\nTaric rushes Iceborn Gauntlet into Deadman's Plate and dominates her.\n\nTrinity Force bruisers (i.e. Irelia) should still rush Trinity Force, picking up Ninja Tabi early for damage reduction and mobility.\n\nMages and AP Bruisers can build 2 Doran's Rings (for mana sustain and health) into Seeker's Armguard.\n------------------------------------\nCounterpicks in Lane:\n{{champion:44}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:54}} \n\nSkill Matchups in Lane:\n{{champion:75}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:23}} \n\n-------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any specific champions you want to use against her, let me know and I can go into more detail.\n\nI'll likely add to this later today when I have the time.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that all of this advice is based on my opinions and experience.

If you have to back multiple times, it'll hurt, but do it.  A Riven with a kill pre-6 is very difficult to face 1v1 in lane, since it'll get her her first real item and get her her ult before you do.  Most champions have a better chance against Riven once they hit 6 - yes, Riven's level 6 power spike is very big, but getting your ult can often do a lot to prevent her from killing you, especially if it's a defensive steroid, cc, or movement ability that will allow you to survive/escape her.\n\nThat said, Riven tends to have very predictable all-ins, mainly at 3 and 6.
