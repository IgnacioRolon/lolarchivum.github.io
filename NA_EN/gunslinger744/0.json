A. Champion._**\r\n\r\nBefore the Mind of the Virtuoso trailer I was a bit sceptical, I try to stay away from the theorycrafting but it was obvious that he was going to be something along the lines of a precise killer. I was expecting a sniper that could engage from ridiculous range at a very very low attack speed or something crazy like that. What you gave me was so much better.\r\n\r\n_Jhin, the Virtuoso._\r\n\r\nAt first glance I saw an Ionian criminal, an absolute psychopath. A twisted man that sees the permanence of death as the only &quot;true&quot; art and will stop at nothing to create his &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Calculated and slow, as were his kills. Another one that thinks he can play god amongst men.\r\n\r\nBut then I listened to his voice, I read his lore and studied his kit. And as I looked closer I saw an artist. A misunderstood soul that just doesn&#039;t understand why nobody recognises the beauty he creates, the magnificence he sees in his work. Anger manifests itself in arrogance and ruthlessness covered by elegance and grace. The living are his blank canvas, precision is his brush, bullets are his paint. And when the curtain finally falls for his victims he _knows_ he&#039;s created beauty. Even if those around him don&#039;t see it.\r\n\r\n**THAT** is how you write a character. Holy _SHIT_. Once you look past the first glance, once you stare beyond the mirror reflecting what you see back at you. The psychopath turns into a... Virtuoso. And that&#039;s amazing.\r\n\r\nAlso holy god the Western references on his High Noon skin. Rito pls I need to eat once in a while too. You&#039;re taking all my money again.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-01-20T23:50:06.146+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"ThanX!","replies":[{"poster":"Gunslinger744","date":"2016-01-21T15:57:12.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you pass the message on to the rest?

That account hasn't been flagged as Red though because I don't post on it (at least on purpose :o).\n\nMy NA account is just Kindlejack and not RiotKindlejack because I made a choice to be a little more subtle in NA. That way if players recognise the tag from the boards we can chat about Skins stuff, but I don't have people randomly telling me to 'nerf Lee Sin' every game, or trolling my promos >.<\n\nI know this is a tangent from the thread but what do you think?
