The time an akali can stall a team is something around 24 seconds. Enemy team down exept for akali? Wanna do baron but you wanna go for the ace cuz and that is the safest way to go about it? Good luck trying to kill her for an entire 22 seconds during which the only hope of killing her is landing skill shots? The adc is going to be useless here (not to mention, all the auto attacks that aren&#039;t happening from the other team members), cuz getting close is basically asking to get killed. Besides, when was the last time you saw someone killed with only skillshots? I mean exept...from a zoe.\r\n\r\nThis shit is not on the cute level of fizz e zhonya e. Or vlad with his pool zhonya. That is 22 seconds + interest if the player is good or/and has banshees. All which does is stall the game out.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I&#039;m not saying she&#039;s OP or anything. Just that playing against her is like banging your head against the wall. It&#039;s one thing being bursted down like you are a minion. She is an assassin afterall. But having a to deal with this shit AFTER she gets caught out... Ugh.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-10-15T20:01:48.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thinking about it and maybe i'm wrong, but Akali can be shrouded late game permanently can she not?  With 40% cdr (probably bad build anyway), her 11 second cooldown is 6.6 instead, and it's base duration is 7 seconds.\n\nI feel like I have to be missing something.  When does the cooldown start?  When the thing ends or?","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-15T20:06:32.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the CD desnt start until it vanishes I believe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weiss Guertena","date":"2018-10-15T20:51:30.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Akali's shroud is a weird one when it comes to cooldown - it starts when base duration ends, so always after 7 seconds. This means that if you make full use of duration increase, the cooldown starts 3 seconds before the shroud itself ends. So in a perfect scenario (full duration increase + max CDR), there will be only a 3.6 second downtime - a scenario which doesn't realistically happen since Akali's build rarely includes full CDR. WIth an AP build commonly seen both in regular games and LCS, Akali will have 20% from Zhonya and Lichbane, leaving 6.9 seconds of shroud downtime - which leaves you about 4 and a half seconds to burst her down even with taking 2.5 seconds of stasis into account.\nBut since this is just another upvote farming post bashing the Board's latest favorite scapegoats, I doubt any actual facts went behind writing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Póppy Chulo","date":"2018-10-15T22:11:54.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shroud is 5 seconds duration, not counting entering/leaving +time.
