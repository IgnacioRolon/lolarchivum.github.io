I imagine you've already been suggested the following guides [**here **](http://riot.com/12B7oac)and [**here**](http://riot.com/2dlHSAF) for troubleshooting, which is what I like to start with when I have problems. If you haven't I STRONGLY advise you follow through with those guides; trying all the steps can be a lil time consuming but ultimately very helpful in zeroing in on a fix. :D\n\nAlso, there are some connection issues going on right now in EU that may be interfering with your performance. We're still looking into that for fixes, but to keep up to date, watch for updates and development [**over here**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/uxE7avEp-622-connection-issues-on-eu). If you keep having these problems, stick with Tech, and they'll keep trying to help you to the best of their ability.","replies":[]}]}
