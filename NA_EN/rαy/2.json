Someone brought up that first timers have a way lower winrate with her, obviously, but you'll find out that most 50+ games played winrates are similar (so this is hardly an argument). I did not include playrate and banrate because I trusted people to check the stats for themselves.\n\nThere's several other champions with a higher winrate than Irelia but a similar playrate and banrate. They all have 50+ games played winrates similar to Irelia's.\n\nAnd this whole argument contradicts with the OP anyway : \"Hey, this game is over again because someone rarely put in any effort in killing the entire enemy team on her own.\"\n\nIf it's that easy and requires no effort, then why are people even talking about first timers and inexperienced players on the champion?\n\n---\n\nTo be fair I expected the massive downvotes.
