But when I worked at a major tech company, they said that an engineer with $100k annual salary cost the company $250k per year when you add in benefits, hardware, software licenses, morale budget, supporting staff like HR and management, parking, etc.\n\n$80/hr * 40 hours a week times 52 weeks a year would be about $166k/year. Which, amusingly enough, is the average salary for a senior dev, according to \nhttps://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Riot-Games-Salaries-E247538.htm. Multiply that $80/hr by 2.5 for the full employee cost, and you're right at $200 for one hour of FTE work.\n\nOf course, entry level artists won't get paid as much as senior programmers, and the total cost probably isn't linearly a 2.5 multiplier.
