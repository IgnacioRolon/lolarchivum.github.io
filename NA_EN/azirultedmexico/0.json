You only have three lanes, but five players. Since there's no real need for jungle or support, eighty percent of the team ends up having to contest each other for their gold income. This quickly escalates into players aggressively pinging you out of their lane, blaming their teammates for \"stealing their kills\" and the list goes on.\n\nThe problem is that co-op is so inherently easy on any difficulty that it doesn't inspire any teamwork and your allies become your only real competition. This has always been the nature of trivial content, when there's no challenge players tend to make min-maxing the goal instead which your allies only get in the way of. For instance, Doom Bots never saw this kind of problem because the game mode was difficult enough that there was an actual real possibility of losing.\n\nRiot always low prioritizes everything but 5v5 SR. The truth is Co-op could use a lot more work as well, the jungle is obviously a huge element to the map and yet bots in co-op pretend it doesn't exist. It doesn't teach new players the importance of warding or jungle pressure and it doesn't motivate players to play the game the way it was intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nunya Bezwacks","date":"2015-12-08T17:07:43.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it happens a lot more then you think","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-12-08T17:25:15.013+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick free week..?\n\nHuh?","replies":[{"poster":"Westonbirt","date":"2015-12-08T17:36:49.580+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, that sounds like bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"Smithney","date":"2015-12-08T18:51:40.233+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broken Fangz,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=bAr86KrW,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-12-08T06:09:37.519+0000)\n>\n>when i was first starting the game a couple years ago\n\n^I think this kinda explains it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Autrah Fang","date":"2015-12-08T22:49:49.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Westonbirt,realm=EUW,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=bAr86KrW,comment-id=000900010000,timestamp=2015-12-08T17:36:49.580+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, that sounds like bullshit.\n\nonly bullshit if you're too new to have been around when he was actually on free week :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2015-12-10T05:45:39.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I remember him being free last January.\nso, yeah, once a year or so.","replies":[{"poster":"Westonbirt","date":"2015-12-10T07:10:00.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No he wasn't.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Free_champion_rotation\n\nHe's been on rotation three times as noted above : October 2011, April 2012 and November 2012.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Autrah Fang","date":"2015-12-08T22:48:34.257+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silents429,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=bAr86KrW,comment-id=00090001,timestamp=2015-12-08T17:25:15.013+0000)\n>\n> Yorick free week..?\n> \n> Huh?\n\nthere was indeed a time where Yorick was available in the free week rotation. this was like the week after he came out, so of course he was on the free rotation. it was one of the only times where they actually decided to put him in it.\n\nEdit: if you're curious, he has been on the free week rotation only 3 times since his release lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2015-12-10T05:44:22.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know, they actually put {{champion:83}} on sale for **reduced IP **once, you know, to get more people to try him.\nFirst champion I ever bought...
