CPU could be overheating or downclocking due to damage/incorrectly seated cooler. RAM could be underclocked, GPU could be in a slow PCIe slot.\n\nOn to software: OS or drivers could be causing issues independent of hardware, and so could software like an overlay or antivirus. The game itself could also be corrupted due to drive damage or a failed patch.","replies":[]}]}
