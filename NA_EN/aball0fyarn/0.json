I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the new Microsoft update because I didn't have a problem until last night after my computer updated. The update fixed Cortana (which I purposefully broke because Cortana is stupid) it updated Windows Defender (which is likely the problem) and now my computer's boot time is significantly slower. I'm going to uninstall the updates probably and see if it helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-09-03T00:58:51.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try disabling the XBoX Game Bar if you're on Win10","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-03T00:04:55.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post your OS, specs and running processes, league graphics settings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-02T23:55:11.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This used to happen to me a lot, and I got very friendly with a few Rito members because of it.
