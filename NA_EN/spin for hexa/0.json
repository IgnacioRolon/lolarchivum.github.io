After I get {{item:3057}} , GP's poke gets much more interesting and i can finally zone him myself, since Parrley is point and click and he can't hide behind minionz.

Vs. GP, Jayce can out-poke GP with gate-blasts. Jayce can also win an all-in vs. GP by slamming into him and unloading everything.\n\nGP only really wins if he carefully navigates that fight by staying in this awkward medium-range where he can Parrrley Jayce without being so close Jayce all-ins him or without being so far Jayce pokes him down.\nAnd GP is kind of weak, he'll probably need RNG to favor him even when playing near-flawlessly.","replies":[]}]}
