Looked through your account and based on what I've seen: pretty confident in this ban.\n\nI'd like to give you some clarity around the decision, but public dunking on the boards isn't my style. For more information about the ban, I encourage you to send us a [**Player Support Request**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), where we can talk with you privately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-08-12T04:03:40.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heya **WeateraBarryz**,\n\nAs this is an account-specific inquiry, we can't assist you much further on the boards. You'll need to [submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) regarding your issue. A few tips as you submit your request: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n2. Do your best to not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n3. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n4. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. \n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}
