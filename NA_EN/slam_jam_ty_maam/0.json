I've been a loyal customer and fan of Riot and LoL since beta but I've never had such a hard time getting my account access back. I'm really worried about what the hacker is doing with my account and how it's reflected upon me. Please. Could ANYONE help me solve this issue. I know Riot makes a lot of money and has a lot of staff. There's no way this should take so long. This in reference to the fact that there is no hotline to call and no real time chat service. Standards with every other merchant I deal with.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, this is an old account i dug up because I'm unable to log into my currrent one\n\nEdit 2: Update, I just received a discipline.......wtf...\n\n~~Edit 3: https://i.gyazo.com/0719b9244d0da60e36e4611942abe793.png\n~~\n\nEdit 4: Ok, Porocles was kind enough to help expedite things. I appreciate the account lock until things get sorted. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-08T22:17:48.446+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and see that your ticket has been received!
