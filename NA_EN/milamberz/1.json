The other one is available and valid but consistently ignored.\n\nThere's a difference between a bad patch that requires reverting and one that doesn't. If they changed stuff in a way that (like you said) changed things for the better, but the champion ended up in a bad place, by all means keep the change and mess with the numbers to improve them. I don't think anyone's really complained when this happened.\n\nBut if you change things in a way that just made things worse all around, there's no shame in reverting it and do an alternative. This is what ends up getting all the backlash, because Riot seems to refuse to take this option. No one's saying this option must be taken every time, but it isn't taken even when it's a good time to do so.\n\nKog'Maw's attack speed passive being moved from Q to W is an example of the latter.\nBefore, it made you think about what you needed: more attack speed and shred from Q, or more range and lower down time for W. Now it's W, no question.\nBefore, the power of each individual skill was slightly more balanced, though W was still a tad overloaded. Now W is completely overloaded with all-the-things.\n\nAnd on top of all this, it moved Kog'Maw into OP status somehow. Messing with the numbers at this point may \"fix\" his status, but his changes still left him in a worse state, not a better one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-02-18T01:23:46.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whens the last time a late game hypercarry has actually had a weak early and been a good pick that wasn't overshadowed by another pick. Wanna know why every one was picking Jinx and Vayne last year but not Kog, because despite all three being hyper carries two of them didn't have a weak early. \n\nWhen is the last time you have seen a Jax or a Nasus be strong without a stronger than usual early game. \n\nHell even Cassiopiea and Azir had FoTM's last year because they were lane bullies and hypercarries. \n\nThe only way to have hypercarries even some what relevant is to shift the meta to focus late game again like it was in the past. And no one wants to go back to the league of late game where we endlessly clear waves and stall and the game is decided by a single baron fight.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2016-02-17T00:14:35.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather they just revert his buff and leave him as he was, he was actually good, but people didn't give him the time of day because people keep circlejerking about \"there is no late game!!!\" and \"20 minutes!!!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaughingStapler","date":"2016-02-17T00:11:28.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The way they're nerfing him is stupid and showcases a typical inability to revert bad changes on Riot's part. It actually really makes me lose hope in them because it shows an arrogance and lack of flexibility that is rare to see for a professional in any type of work. Nerfing Kog's base AS hurts every build and role for Kog while forcing you to max W even more than before regardless of whether you're up vs very tanky teams or squishy ones. It also hurts his scaling with AS runes, items or any other source so it takes a champion that was supposed to be good late game and makes him FAR worse than even before the 6.3 changes.\n\nKeeping AS on Q would made sense before to make Kog choose between less downtime and more range or more damage but less safety. It gated his power and gave him a more typical hypercarry curve. They had a really dumb idea to put AS on W and give him access to his level 18 power at level 13. Now, instead of accepting this and being smart enough to revert it, they're moving forward with it but nerfing Kog's scaling. Kog players chose him because they wanted an immobile hypercarry with massive damage and good scaling, not another mid game carry. All they had to do before was reduce the ult. mana cost slightly and he was fine for both mid (a role left in the dust) and bot.","replies":[]}]}
