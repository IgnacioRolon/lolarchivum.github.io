In order for Doran's Shield to outvalue the other two options, you would have to be consistently be dealt damage by being all inned with autos . Nasus, while auto based, does burst. Making the blocking passive almost pointless. The only champions that makes Shield viable against are Fiora, Shen, Jax, Xin, Voli, and Trundle. 5 of which you will actually see in the top lane. 5 top laners out of around 30.","replies":[{"poster":"Onegarion","date":"2015-02-06T11:17:49.864+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm only going to talk to one of your points and its the one you want to get across the most that is actually the worst. Its the first one saying Ruby + 2 pots gives more. It doesn't give more. It gives it faster than dorans, but not more. You can argue the fact that one is faster, but with a passive health regen you are going to get MORE with Doran's + pot. While yes 1.2 hp/sec isn't a whole lot its always going on. From the moment you lose that first bit of HP it starts working and paying itself off. If you aren't taking tons of damage its going to be the better buy from the start. \n\nYou also do dismiss the passive of dorans quite a bit. blocking 8 Damage from AA and single target abilites (which a ton of top laners have) is completely going to skew the numbers in the favor you want them to be. You have to look at the total effective health and you can't accurately do that until you figure out and average number of times a champion gets hit by AA and single target. \n\nTo make Doran's passive work you need to get hit 20 times by an enemy champ to pay off in effective health. I would put money on many top lane matchups trading about that many AA/single target before your first back. Under this condition that equals out to a full Pot in health. \n\nHonestly I personally hate Ruby + pots because I think its really inferior unless you are building full tank which VERY few champs do anymore especially those that are still viable. Many are working on an early damage item making either Cloth + 5 better for the easier laning to cs (which just the pots alone give you 750 effective health alone) or even a flask and pots. \n\nOverall Ruby + pots isn't the BEST start by any means or we would be seeing it used a lot more. I rarely see this start and usually its only on a mundo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-02-06T21:17:58.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Again Ruby+2 pots soaks up more damage than Shield+1.

You potions completely become useless if your enemy laner is like me and tends to poke when they are healing to nullify the potion.\n\n> The tree is irrelevant because its the same numbers applied to the other options as it does to Doran's Shield. Literally the same numbers. You still block 2 from autos, you still get the same health 2 regen per 5 seconds, ect. I have no idea why you keep bringing it up.\n\nThat doesn't make it irrelevant do you even know what that means?? Yes a tank who is going 9/21/0 is going to have those same masteries if they have a Ruby crystal or a shield but I said those masteries go perfect with the shield, they do not go perfect with the Ruby, they are actually weaker with the crystal. The shields passive and block mastery together are so much better then the ruby with the block mastery.\n\nDo I need to do math? You seem to like math. 8 + 2 = 10 > 2 + 0 = 2 \n\nIf you need help, The shield plus its passive plus the mastery is better then just the mastery. \n\n> That and that alone defeats your whole argument and the whole purpose to even debate about this. \"by my standards\"\n\n> So how about you give me numbers and prove me wrong because you havent. You keep on saying regen and blocking passive when even I proved that its negligible compared to the other 2 options.

And this isn't by my standards, this is by definition. \n\nNot every argument needs a bunch of numbers, if Ruby crystal plus 2 potions were so much better then you would see it more often.  \n\n> You brought up mastery tree, which is irrelevant to the conversation. \n\nI was talking about the shields passive?? Do you even know what this item does?\n\n> I never, ever said Ruby and Flask are the perfect starting items.

Its a terrible item that offers extremely little value compared to the other 2 options.\n\nYes yes you did, Your entire argument has been that the shield is useless and serves no purpose in comparison to those 2 starting items. Every single thing you have tried debating has been that everything the shield is doing your 2 items are doing completely better. Therfore perfect in comparison.\n\n> Im not pulling out anything. You are the one that is ignoring the numbers and **bringing up irrelevancy with masteries and play style that applies the same numbers to both.**\n\nRefer to what you said before \n\n> 3 minutes your opponent has control over the lane. 3 minutes your opponent can set up ganks. 3 minutes you're missing potential CS. 3 minutes of patiently waiting for your health to go back up. 3 minutes to set up even a towerdive.\n\nThis here is bringing up playstyle, I have never witnessed someone so awful at top lane they would give me control for 3 minutes because they were moronic enough to wait for their health regen to heal them fully.\n\nWhats even more stupid is you didn't even take into account a champions base health regen either, And you KEEP SAYING masteries are irrelevant yet you don't seem to ever use that word correctly. I am sorry but only tanks take this item, and everyone has masteries which greatly impact the early game, and tanks tend to be heavy in the defense tree, it would be stupid NOT to take these into account with the item. Considering a lot of tanks are going to have health regen from the masteries themselves. A lot of tanks have a high base health regen as well.\n\n> Again, prove me wrong. You've been telling me that i'am wrong, but you never proved it. That is all im asking here. Also..\n\n> Im not pulling out anything. You are the one that is ignoring the numbers \n\nI don't need to prove anything, you are disproving yourself from your blissful ignorance on this, You are pulling things out, because you take only 1 part of the item in account and ignore the rest, half this debate you refuse to even acknowledged the shield gave any health regen. \n\nYou mock the passive, but claim it is \"irrelevant\" to bring up masteries and how they further enhance this item. 150 HP with 2 potions is utter shit without any masteries or runes. Once your potions are gone what is your next tactic in lane? Leave and buy more? Hell of a lot of CS going away, and god imagine all that time you are giving your enemy laner for him to setup ganks, control the lane, or set up some kind of tower dive.\n\nIf you can't so much as take a step back and actually think about what the item is for and how it is suppose to be used then you can't argue on whether it is useless. You can't.\n\n> And another thing about your champion list, really? You're including Rumble? In order for Doran's Shield to outvalue the other two options, you would have to be consistently be dealt damage by being all inned with autos . Nasus, while auto based, does burst. Making the blocking passive almost pointless. The only champions that makes Shield viable against are Fiora, Shen, Jax, Xin, Voli, and Trundle. 5 of which you will actually see in the top lane. 5 top laners out of around 30.\n\n> you would have to be consistently be dealt damage by being all inned with autos\n\nRumbles E is blocked by it.\n\nNasus Q. Nasus isn't burst either unless you let him farm his Q, Which you would be doing if you were to say, leave lane to go buy more potions or something like that.\n\nBy the time he is doing any burst, you have more items anyway and aren't relying solely on the shield. \n\nWe are talking about early game here. And he can't spam his E and Q constantly on you or he is going to be OOM all lane. \n\nFiora is AA based.\n\nShen is Single Target and AA based.\n\nJax is AA based.\n\nXin is AA based.\n\nVoli is Single Target and AA based.\n\nTrundle is AA based.\n\nAatrox is AA based.\n\nGnar is AA based.\n\nGangplank is Single Target and AA based\n\nTryn is AA based.\n\nMaster Yi is AA based.\n\nOlaf is Single Target and AA based.\n\nRengar is Single Target and AA based.\n\nPoppy is Single Target and AA based.\n\nWukong is AA based.\n\nTeemo is AA based.\n\nAND EVERY SINGLE ADC CHAMPION.\n\nNow I just named well over 5 champions that see plenty of play up top, that the shield is good against on a tank.\n\nI don't need math to point this out. Don't say irrelevant to everything either, you haven't used it correctly at all, everything I brought up related and works with the shield to help it. You would say irrelevant if one of my responses to your point was if I randomly tried using a bot lane support katerina to help prove the sun can rise from the North.\n\nIrrelevant isn't a word you can use because you don't want to acknowledged a point","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"S E X Y B O I","date":"2015-02-05T21:17:02.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, everyone agrees that it needs a change.

It only give stats, just like the 2nd Doran's Shield do, so there is nothing that technically stacks on the 2nd DBlade purchased\nThe lose of the passive on the 2nd shield put it at disadvantage vs DRing and reduce its gold efficiency, BUT, it is still in the same situation than DBlade...and you see double DBlade while you not see so double DShield, so it's clear that the problem is that the 12 health regen per 5 seconds of double DSheild is believed to be much much much less valuable than the 6% lifesteal of double DBlade","replies":[{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2015-02-05T20:38:51.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't say Doran's blade had a passive.

Period. Warden's mail cost only 1050 gold and has a powerful passive that counter enemy damage based on AA. The situation for big MR and health items is similar. \nTo get such a boost for AD or AP you must spend much more gold and you could need more time and trips to base to gain the gold needed if you are with champs whch have trouble early because of their kit or you just got behind vs your enemy, and that's where the idea of picking a second cheap but effective item that gives an immediate noticeable boost to help you go beyond that moment of trouble kicks in, and in doing that DRing and DBlade accomplish the goal. They do it because mana regen and lifesteal are perceived as great tools to sustain in the lane. The health regen of DShield is considered as bad/worse tool to remain in lane, especiall given how accessible are other forms of defense, and so the double DShield options is discarded. It's pretty much easy to see\n\nThe solution is not overbuff DShield (a lot of people here have pointed out how much OP would be letting the passives of the two shields stacking), but understand why health regen is considered so little as tool to sustain in lane/ as general stat, and if that aspect of DShield could see a buff to improve the item on itself, and as consequence to favour also the double DShield set-up\n\nWhy not propose a simpler thing with less colllateral effects as, for example, to raise the health regen of DShield from 6 to 8 per 5 seconds (a value in the middle between the actual value and the pre-nerf value) ?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hgjkdlsaf jeldvb","date":"2015-02-06T01:57:44.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the better question is why do the other dorans stack?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-02-04T12:55:39.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like this although they would probably reduce the damage reduction to 7 from 8 because of it.","replies":[{"poster":"S E X Y B O I","date":"2015-02-04T20:29:14.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if they reduced the damage reduction, it would still be great if tanks had an actual good early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Baculus","date":"2015-02-05T17:24:24.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most tanks are junglers so... \n\nit does little to help tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"S E X Y B O I","date":"2015-02-05T21:19:10.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?
