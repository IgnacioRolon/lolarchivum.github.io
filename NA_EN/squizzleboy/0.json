It's alright, splash art's a little outdated, though. I have Headhunter and was going to use it today in ARAM until someone dodged, and I got all excited I finally got to use it.\n\nFrench Maid is, and I'm gonna get downvoted for this, kinda ugly. I mean, it's not even close to the quality of Nurse Akali in terms of splash art, in-game look aside. What's with her eyes? They look...startlingly abnormal.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-01-03T23:06:51.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
