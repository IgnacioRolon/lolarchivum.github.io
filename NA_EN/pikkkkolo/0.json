Most Azir's never expect this. Try to avoid his soldiers as best you can. Playing him and learning his ranges can help with this.\nXerath- Avoid his poke and push. He'll usually push to poke so this lane becomes very farm oriented. \nSyndra- (I play this champ a lot) Syndra is going to do one of two things: instantly q then e which is harder to dodge or wait to position the ball for a stun and extra ball combo. Buy boots asap against her. Since she's skillshot dependent it hurts her a lot.\nYasuo- I hate this matchup soooo much. You have to bait out his windwall to kill him, but even then he may have a wave to dodge everything through. Use autos to drop his shield and auto harass the hell out of him. I have a rune page titles \"Against Heavy AD\" Look it up. It's what I take against him","replies":[]},{"poster":"BzRazor","date":"2016-07-10T00:48:04.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple trick to counter poke. \n\nWhen they poke, they move forward.. that's when you throw your Q. \n\nJust sit on the edge of their range and wait for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"japan hate acc","date":"2016-07-09T23:53:38.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Yasuo, continue kiting him. Just aa him, removing the shield, and use your Q to bait him into using his wall. From there, go in on him when he doesn't have his shield and wall. For Azir, think of his soldiers as fire. Don't stand near/in the fire. Charm him towards you and burst him down. As for Syndra and Xerath, I don't play them enough to really know.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-10T00:01:35.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Xerath, just push lane with Q early.  Her passive will sustain through a decent bit of poke.  Wait until 6 (unless you can get a gank and land charm) and all in him as soon as he overextends.  So long as you dodge his stun (the orb thing) with any of your dashes, you should win the fight.\n\nA good Xerath will try to sit far back and poke you from way beyond your range.  If this is the case, let him push the wave until it is just outside your tower range.  Then, get your jungler to wait just outside his vision.  When you get the chance, flash and/or ult and charm him.  This should give your jungler plenty of time to get in there and help secure the kill.\n\nOnce you get a kill or two on Xerath, you should be able to all in him fairly easily, or just push to his tower and roam.  Just continue to dodge his stun, and don't underestimate his damage as the game drags on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-07-09T23:59:38.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to defeat the enemy you must first defeat yourself!
