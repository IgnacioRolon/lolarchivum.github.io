One is once the game begins loading, no borders are visible and there's nothing but the champion pictures. Once in the game, everyone has gray health bars and black names. This problem can be fixed by alt-tab and then coming back into the screen. Was wondering if this is a known bug.\r\n\r\nSecond, my highlight videos haven't been recording sound properly since the recent patch. All I get is a clicking and zapping sound which sounds like my PC is trying to rip out its insides. Older highlights work fine and the full replay works fine. It's just highlights from the recent patch. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T22:50:22.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That weird loading screen is probably happening due to the client having a hard time grabbing the assets it needs for the loading screen. When you alt+tab, that gives it a chance to refresh the screen and correctly draw those images the second time. I'd try running a quick repair through the client options to see if that gets the loading screen showing up the right way from now on.\n\nAs for those weird screeching noises in replays, we're currently looking into what's been causing that noise and it seems like it's being caused by certain third-party programs or overlays being used in the match that was recorded. Let's try turning all of those off by doing a [**clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7) and seeing if the next recorded game has that awful noise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BugsBunny93","date":"2017-07-05T07:35:05.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's never happened before on any other patch.

I might be a bug, but I highly doubt it.\n\nYour second issue: It seems to be happening a lot in the current patch. Not sure why, but you'll have to wait for Riot to fix this.","replies":[]}]}
