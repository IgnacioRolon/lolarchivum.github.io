I will elaborate as clearly as I can so that you can get a clear picture of whats happening. To start, on many occasions, when attempting to login, it simply will not load, and just says \"authenticating\" for 10 minutes before telling me there was an error. Restarting does not work, but a full repair works for maybe 2 logins. In champion select, on occasion, it gives another error message when attempting to pick a champion, thus kicking you out of the queue and placing you on a short ban. Once I can actually get into the game, it usually lets me play for a good 10 minutes before I begin to see signs of corruption. Minor ping spikes of about 5-10 for about 2 minutes. Then, out of the blue (on one occasion it hit 10553 ping) I will get a major spike, and then \"attempting to reconnect\". I continuously disconnect for a few minutes while getting what I call freeze lags. Exiting and restarting does not work. Internet connectivity is fine. Everything else on the PC works like a charm. But I am unable to rejoin the game unless the computer is restarted, and even if it is restarted, once I connect, it is 5-10 minute lag spikes where everything and everyone is sliding around. Occasionally a big boom will happen in which it will show everything happening all at once in a certain area, but then it goes back to sliding around. I have reinstalled the game, I have deleted all the files and reinstalled, I have updated the PC, and I have repaired the client more times than I can count. Repairing does the trick, but its more like taking Tylenol for a GSW. It only fixes the problem for a little while, and sometimes, it doesn't even work. It has something to do with the Alpha client. I have had these problems on the old client, but they were few and far between. If you have any input, it would be most helpful. I certainly am tired of being put in low priority queues simply because I could not stay in the game due to client glitches.\r\n\r\n~ Your's Truly, Bugs Bunny\r\n\r\n\"What's up Doc?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T04:39:00.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of these weird interactions like \"attempting to reconnect\" popping up constantly, being able to login in a couple times fine and others not, and especially when you mention everything freezing and champions sliding around all sound pretty identical to packet loss. Packet loss happens when some data coming from your network gets damaged or lost before it ever reaches our servers. Essentially, your connection is getting chopped up before it gets to us, so then our servers and your pc doesn't how to handle all of this messed up data.\n\nTake your most recent game logs that had these connection problems and use our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to analyze them.
