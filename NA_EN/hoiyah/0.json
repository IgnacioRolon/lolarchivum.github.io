In my first game of my series i chose kalista and we lost. After the game i got off and i just logged on today to find that i am at 84 Lp. There are no games after my loss as kalista, but i am not in series anymore. Can anyone from Riot look into this?","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2016-03-07T22:06:32.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deep Terror Nami is correct. You're currently in your series with 1 win and 1 loss. Your next ranked game should count towards your series. Good luck getting to gold!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-07T21:51:53.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Soccerbro14,\n\nYour LP amount will actually dynamically change when you win or lose in your series. It won't ever show above 100 LP so it can be confusing when you don't see it move, but it does change. You're probably still in your series.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
