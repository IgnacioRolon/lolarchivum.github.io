I reported them. Then I get a notification that I'm now chat restricted, and this game is cited as the primary trigger. I open a support, and this is what I'm told.\r\n\r\nRioter: (I do want to focus on Game 1, this was the trigger game and game 2 is considered supplementary to the trigger game)\r\n\r\n[24:25] Marid King (Udyr): you guys are so toxic its insane\r\n[25:06] Marid King (Udyr): ior what\r\n[25:13] Marid King (Udyr): youre gonan report me?\r\n[25:21] Marid King (Udyr): thats fucking extortion\r\n\r\nRioter: (In all honesty, taking the time to point out other player's poor behavior really only causes more turmoil for yourself and others)\r\n\r\n[26:13] Marid King (Udyr): and I'm reporting you\r\n[26:20] Marid King (Udyr): becaue i've done literally nothing wrong\r\n[26:29] Marid King (Udyr): and you're still being an incredibly toxic asshole\r\n[26:45] Marid King (Udyr): 0/7/5 is inting &lt;-(referring to my own score)\r\n[26:57] Marid King (Udyr): yeah that's not reportable\r\n[27:00] Marid King (Udyr): whatsoever\r\n[27:05] Marid King (Udyr): you are so toxic its not funny\r\n\r\nRioter: (I completely understand the frustration but announcing your irritation really does only cause more issues for the playing environment for other players)\r\n\r\n[28:40] Marid King (Udyr): your nonstop flame\r\n[28:46] Marid King (Udyr): and attempts to get the enemy team to report me\r\n[28:51] Marid King (Udyr): are actually reportable offenses\r\n[29:01] Marid King (Udyr): not sure if you understand that rio makes the rulse\r\n[29:52] Marid King (Udyr): stop being toxic pls\r\n[30:23] Marid King (Udyr): why would i ever listen to someone who is toxic to me\r\n[30:28] Marid King (Udyr): and swears to report me\r\n\r\n(at this point I get called a skinhead)\r\n\r\n[30:39] Marid King (Udyr): thats racist\r\n[30:47] Marid King (Udyr): you guys just keep getting more toxic\r\n[31:19] Marid King (Udyr): no, you do\r\n[31:24] Marid King (Udyr): your report is worthless\r\n\r\nRioter: (I will stop here, at this point, I believe you're able to get a strong idea of what is considered to be negative)\r\n\r\nIn a followup reply:\r\n\r\n\"These are a few avenues in which our IFS (Instant Feedback System) can detect negativity for in League.\r\n\r\nArguing with others (Even if you didn't start the problem, you can slow it down or stop it by ignoring the misbehavior of others)\r\n\r\nCalling out other player's poor behavior (Players want attention so they'll try and push your buttons, it's important to do your best to not let them get to you)\r\n\r\nCalling out other player's poor gameplay choices/performance (This is more self explanatory but if you're not focused on future objectives, you're only hindering your chances of having a competitive match)\r\n\r\nPlease note that these are only a few ways our IFS can detect negativity, there are more, but these are the most common ones that I've found when it comes to penalties within our expected escalation. If you're still having trouble determining whether your words can be detected as negative I think of chat like this. \"Is what I'm going to say either positive or neutral towards other players\"? If the answer is no, then it's likely that what you're going to say next is going to come off as negative/frustrating for other players.\"\r\n\r\nend of reply\r\n\r\nLet me be the first to say that I've been chat restricted before, and I know when I'm an asshole I deserve to be silenced. Somebody please read the above chat and point out to me where the chat restriction-worthy filth I said is.\r\n\r\nWhat gets to me are the three things that were cited as toxic by the rioter.\r\n\r\nArguing with others (Even if you didn't start the problem, you can slow it down or stop it by ignoring the misbehavior of others)\r\n\r\nSo if someone flames you, don't defend yourself. If someone else gets flamed, don't defend them. Don't call out toxic behavior. If you do, you'll get chat restricted like me.\r\n\r\nCalling out other player's poor behavior (Players want attention so they'll try and push your buttons, it's important to do your best to not let them get to you)\r\n\r\nSo if someone is being toxic, pretend its not happening. Do it, or you'll get chat restricted like me.\r\n\r\nCalling out other player's poor gameplay choices/performance (This is more self explanatory but if you're not focused on future objectives, you're only hindering your chances of having a competitive match)\r\n\r\nSo, if someone makes a mistake, never say so. If they go in 1v5 then blame you for not following, remember that you can't argue. If they then flame you and are toxic, remember that you must pretend everything is fine. Otherwise, you'll get chat restricted like me.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is just me, but I thought chat toxicity was flame, insults, and racial slurs. What is this Orwellian police state nonsense where we are all to pretend toxicity doesn't exist, and those that speak out are punished?

Report them after the game to decrease the likelihood that other players will have to deal with that behavior. If the only reaction you're capable of in response to getting flamed is to start arguing with your teammate, insist that you'll report them (less than a minute after you label that behavior \"extortion\"), call them an \"incredibly toxic asshole,\" call them racist, and so on, then yes, you and your LoL account would benefit from pretending that you're not getting flamed.

But I think that you can't see their punishment cause' it escalates. Starts out with chat restrictions for some games (10?). Then for 14, 25 and finally a perma. ban. Tbh, I know what you mean because I've reported people for racial slurs before as well. Yet, seen them still playing. I think that racial slurs aren't an instant ban but just some chat restrictions for a limited number of games. And then they keep increasing their punishments if they continue. \n\nThe number of toxic players or people who just want to flame are way too many. You can be patient once, twice.. thrice. Its just endless because you get atleast one annoying guy every 2-3 games, average! And you aren't allowed to open your mouth and talk back to defend yourself even if they started it. It is a little bit depressing. And that's why I just mute chat completely.
