But, if you start charging her q and walk into Miasma, you will lose the indicator that shows how far Vi will go, but keep charging. I use quick-cast, so i don&#039;t know how it reacts with regular casting, but you will keep charging even if you take your hand off of the q button, and pressing it again will cause you to dash towards your mouse.\r\n1.
