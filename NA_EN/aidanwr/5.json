This leads to frustrating moments when you are either trying to escape, or get a kill, only to be pushed when you weren&#039;t trying to dash or jump over the wall.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-09T21:52:44.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That may happen if you blink _inside_ the wall, but so long as you avoid that, blinks should get you across fine.
