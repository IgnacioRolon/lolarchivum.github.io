It occurs if you cleanse the slow into sleep, or just the sleep itself. Either change the interaction to do what it says, or change the description to say that an enemy hit takes double damage please.","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-07-29T04:59:26.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"how do you know it was doubled are you sure that's not her normal q damage it can be that high from certain angels \ni can't vouch for this 100% because i can't do it myself but saw zoe's doing it before","replies":[{"poster":"AidanWR","date":"2019-07-29T05:07:43.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because all Zoe hit was her E, and in death recap it said that she did true damage with it.

You can play dumb all you want though. Zoe's \"True Damage\" is not actually true damage. Literally Switch it from True Damage to Magic Damage and it would still does the same DMG because its mirror damage. It does the same damage the first hit did which the first hit is magic damage.","replies":[{"poster":"AidanWR","date":"2019-07-31T22:48:49.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you dumb? Zoe's e doesn't deal true damage unless a spell or ability hits after sleep. If you don't get hit by anything, it deals no true damage.

Cleanse doesn't remove debuffs, it only removes CC (except suppression and airborne) plus some summoner spell effects. And since the double damage debuff is a debuff it's not removed by Cleanse.\nSo the issue here is simply that they failed to account for Cleanse when writing the description. They should just rephrase Zoe's description to \"The first source of damage within 2,5 seconds is doubled\". That way it accounts for Cleanse and other potential CC removers as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-29T04:59:27.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"༼ つ .\\_. ༽つ Report a Bug ༼ つ .\\_. ༽つ\n\nThat is just concerningly buggy.","replies":[]}]}
