My ping is constantly changing and is anywhere from 45-700 (but usually around 200) I am wondering if there is any way to accurately check your ping before game. I've seen here and on Reddit that pinging 104.160.131.1 should give it to your. However when i do this it always gives me about 35 and in game i get way more than that. Even if i ping that ip while lagging a ton in game it still shows 35. So is there any other way to do this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T21:40:05.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your sudden change in ping is happening only in game as a result of packet loss, and we can use some tools to figure out what's going wrong.
