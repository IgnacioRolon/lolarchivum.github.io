Unless it deals some magic aoe damage while in stasis then your point is valid (which is not btw).\nIf Zhonya gets removed, then how the can those who play immobile mages be able to deal with Assassins? This will just make assassins with much less counterplay to begin with. And stop watch rune and Zhonya aren't the same.

Zhonya doesn't heal you. If you use it with 10% hp remaining, you'll return with the same amount of hp. Guardian requires you to die and you come back with 3/4 hp remaining.

Do you have any idea how such mechanics will be abused? Buying Zhonya will be pointless and a troll build.\n\n> You logged into a level 10 account which obviously isn't your main account on purpose to hide either the your rank or the fact that you were perma banned so I have no way to tell what you main, your average elo, etc...\n\n1- No, my main account got perma banned for calling certainlyt a cheap reincarnation of Robin Williams and for him to be fired.\n2- Elo shaming?

Can you perhaps elaborate on how to bait out a zhonyas as a Kha zix, Diana,\nZed, Twitch, Kayn, Katarina, or Akali?\n\nYes you can time...depending on the champion. Let's say Vel'Koz. When an enemy uses Zhonya, I aim my Q and wait for a bit and then fire it. Once the stasis from Zhonya ends, the Q hits the enemy right away. THAT'S timing your ability.\nThose champs? Their cooldowns are super low to begin with anyway.\nHmm let's see...you don't use your ultimate if the enemy has a Zhonya at the ready? Zed, Kayn, Katarina? Like come on...\nA Twitch doesn't need anything. Just right click and finish. Diana's ulti is superlow cuz it relies on landing her Q.\nKha'Zix can do extra damage due to his Q passive, difficult to escape due to his ulti (movement speed and E) and his Q cooldown is low.\nThose champs are strong in a 1v1 situation.\nLiterally, just play smart, and get the enemy low enough to the point that they'll be forced to Zhonya and then finish them off. Usually when i play Vel'Koz i never use my ultimate unless i know the zhonya is on cooldown. Although i have to land all QWE and double passive proc to force a Zhonya out.\nUsually, it works best when you have back up, in order to bait an enemy Zhonya.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Shift","date":"2019-10-22T12:26:15.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is by far the dumbest shit i've ever read on the internet.
