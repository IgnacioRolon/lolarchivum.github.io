The client team is moving in the right direction on the whole.\r\n\r\nDespite this, I have a suggestion. According to the main post, the current plan for your profile background is to show the champion you've recently played. Instead of this, much like selecting your champion icon, the player has the option to select their profile background. Within this pool, you can select images of splashes of champions and skins you own, perhaps including other League art (such as that of Summoner's Rift or eSports events). Perhaps you could even make backgrounds available in the Store for a small amount of IP.\r\n\r\nWithout proper customization, profiles don't feel as personal as they should. I think this is a pretty good idea in order to ensure that quality is met with the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Is0lated","date":"2016-11-25T10:20:53.650+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a question \n\nsome of my friends have their skin showing on the profile \n\nlike \ncreator viktor\nm tai lee sin \n\nhow is that posbl ??","replies":[{"poster":"Valkraz","date":"2016-11-29T17:21:17.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this too recently for a couple skins, that's why I came looking here.
