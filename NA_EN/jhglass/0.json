If it's not your hardware, there could be an issue with your config as well, which is especially prone to happen if any manual modifications were made:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"JhGlass","date":"2016-12-30T07:12:27.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely not hardware, tried various keyboards and the same happened.\nIll try that when i get home and see if it happens again, thx!","replies":[]}]}]}
