It just kind of came to mind. \n\nAs rangerofshadow pointed out having the gap closer and auto's reducing the E would be super overpowered. \n\nIF Olaf did get mobility out of his E, then reducing the affect auto's have on E is more than likely a necessary change. Any Olaf advocates VERY against these changes?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-05-19T22:13:42.831+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a very generous and scary change.","replies":[{"poster":"VVoe","date":"2016-05-28T23:48:03.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any way to increase his base attack range like all the other juggernauts","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShemsuHor","date":"2016-05-19T23:19:22.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmk just throwin out idea's. I dont play him and only seem him on rare occasion when one of the teams has adc and mage with no escapes/postioning.\n@RangerofShadows: i did forget that his E cd is reduced by AA. if the cd only reduced by .5 seconds from autos or if the cd was reduced and the AA function was removed do you think the leap could be implemented? I think aesthetically based on his art work it just seems so fitting!","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-20T00:03:20.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be less op however I feel as though it would be overbearing to have both a ranged high dmg spammy slow, be uncc able+ movespeed and have a gap closer.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sett up 4my gank","date":"2016-05-19T22:16:01.320+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He also just got indirectly buffed pretty big by ghost change.","replies":[{"poster":"ShemsuHor","date":"2016-05-19T23:22:06.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still havent seen him picked since the changes BUT you're right, the ghost buff is a HUGE buff to Olaf.
