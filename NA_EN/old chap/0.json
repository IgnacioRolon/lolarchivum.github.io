I've tried the 'UserKernel' method, and it still doesnt work. The icon bounces once, then nothing.\n\nWhat could I try?

Make sure you're launching it from your *Applications Folder* to ensure it can launch correctly. If that still doesn't do the trick, then this is likely caused by your Client being unable to reach the Patching Servers. In this case, I'd recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac) to address the most common causes for this.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
