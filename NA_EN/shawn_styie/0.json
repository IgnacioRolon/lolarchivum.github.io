It can certainly take some time, but you can also slow down if you have less than honorable games in between.   The key is to stay consistent to level up faster!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-15T14:52:23.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's easier to start off in good standing and rise than it is to fall to the bottom and rise up again. Your honor gets dropped when you receive punishment for breaking the rules, and you must improve your behavior over time and show that you have improved. Some things that you might have been able to get away with aren't as easily overlooked during this period. If you show that your behavior hasn't improved, that will only prolong the duration that you have a lower honor level. Some people have shown dramatic improvement to the point where they were able to rise up in honor again in a matter of weeks. Since I don't know you, how you play in game or your specific chat behavior, I can't point out what you were doing wrong to keep the punishment going. If you do honestly believe that you haven't said or done anything wrong between then and now, I'm sure you could write a support ticket for someone to look into it. They'll either tell you that the system is working as intended, or determine if your behavior has actually changed for the better.","replies":[]}]}
