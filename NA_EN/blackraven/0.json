I think they need to rework him to be basically a AP version of Zed. \n\nIm fine with a whole mobility but hes too resilient. As soon as he takes out a objective (The ADC) he should be at a very high risk of dying. \n\nAs he stands he does his job of assassinating the ADC but he just goes Invulnerable before he can be shutdown and just goes ham on the now Damage-less enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-11-22T22:09:52.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"zed has always had a chance vs ap ;l","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-11-22T22:00:46.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i thought fizz was bullshit then i saw some cowsep master yi montages and im lyke... this mtherfker is way worse than fizz lol","replies":[{"poster":"BlackRaven","date":"2014-11-22T22:01:54.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i thought fizz was bullshit then i saw some cowsep master yi montages and im lyke... this mtherfker is way worse than fizz lol\n\nyi doesnt get to go invulnerable and do what he wants throughout the enitre game. fucking riot has down syndrome if they dont nerf him next patch. im seriously furious as to hwo they keep releasing anti melee making us as useless as possible then they leave fizz to YOLO all over the map.","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-11-22T22:09:38.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes fizz is pretty bad... yi is pretty much the high reflex required version of fizz lol as his invulnerability time is much shorter","replies":[{"poster":"PapaFizz","date":"2014-11-22T22:17:41.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> yes fizz is pretty bad... yi is pretty much the high reflex required version of fizz lol as his invulnerability time is much shorter\n\nExcept his invulnerability is more of a gap-closer than used to dodge skill-shots.
