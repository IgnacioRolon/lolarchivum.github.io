Most trynds that you will face will make the mistake of using Q and having no fury, and that is when you can engage on him most of the time. Just don't take stupid auto attacks for minions, it's not worth it at all. If you are playing someone like Lee Sin, you will have to play it smart, and go in only when he doesn't have crit.

More than likely what happened in this lane, was both players traded a little bit early on, and around level 4 - 5 both were probably at 2/3 hp or so; in this situation Lee Sin will want to fight Tryndamere and force a trade to bring him into kill potential for the next trade, setting up for the all in and executing with ignite and the second part of Lee's Q before Tryndamere hits level 6. What likely happened, is that Tryndamere got a few lucky crits which essentially won him the lane, because now, instead of having kill potential on Tryndamere, Lee Sin is zoned from the wave, and Tryndamere either forces him from the lane, taking his turret and continuing to outscale Lee, or he hits level 6 before Lee Sin due to zoning, killing him. Either way, those 2 crits essentially win Tryndamere the lane, because to have any chance in this matchup Lee needs to snowball early. To say that you shouldn't pick Lee Sin because he gets out scaled by Tryndamere is absurd, because Lee Sin SHOULD and WILL be able to snowball this lane, as is the case with most early game picks to counter Tryndamere.. unless the RNG gods rain on your parade, in which case, what was and should have been a winning lane is automatically lost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ashes Arise","date":"2015-01-04T03:05:58.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is tryndamere... he crits at lvl 1.

I'll assume our friend here was playing Lee Sin toplane. Firstoff, when you're playing Lee Sin top, you're typically trying to snowball the lane early due to the high base damage of his abilities etc. Tryndamere on the other hand is supposed to be weak early in the laning phase until he at least gets his ultimate and 1-2 items. The whole goal choosing Lee Sin is to punish Tryndamere early in the laning phase, so naturally you want to force trades, trades you should win 9/10 times.. unless of course the RNG gods strike, in which case Tryndamere slams you in the face with back to back crits, and you're instantly zoned from the wave and all kill potential is now lost, (save a misplay by Tryndamere or jungler interference). As soon as this happens, any strong player will then proceed to walk straight up to the front of the wave and freeze, in which case your early advantage is completely nullified and it becomes a free scaling lane where Tryndamere automatically gets kill potential if you try to get CS. And yes, all because he crit you twice in a row. It's safe to assume that this is almost exactly what happened to the Lee Sin player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-01-04T04:26:19.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile assassins are 1 shotting tanks...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaisha","date":"2015-01-04T01:35:00.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right'click'n'win is the epitome of skill I hear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-01-04T03:38:36.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"says maximum {{champion:64}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-01-04T19:28:59.155+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"#NerfLeeSin2015","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-01-04T01:20:20.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"just play quinn or teemo\n\nhe cant crit you if he's blind","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frikgeek","date":"2015-01-04T16:50:09.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep.
