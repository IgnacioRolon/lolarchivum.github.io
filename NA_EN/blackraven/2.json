Use that to your advantage early game before they can secure lane. Focus on early game lane sustain when dealing with a pantheon. Get doran's shield and ninja tabi, and make sure to use potions. Trust me, almost all pantheons will waste their mana on minions and poke. Think of them as someone fighting on bot lane. Notice that most people on bot lane will almost always be at half mana or less? For bot lane the side that keeps their mana up is almost always the side that wins lane. The same can be said of top lane and middle lane. Let pantheon waste his mana and you will gain control over top lane.

Certain champions will beat other champions and lose to a third set of champions. And then the rest are considered, more or less, equal matches.\nThen, there's the build. If you're playing against a champion that's going to give you a hard time in the lane, counter-build to beat them. Pick one specific early item that you can use, something that will make them less difficult to handle.\nAnd, yes, the final part is out-playing them. Recognizing how to defeat your opponent, and using that knowledge, is extremely important.\n\nAnd, yes, in the laning phase, your main goal is to counter-play *one* champion. It doesn't matter which lane you're playing, even Jungle has counter-jungling and counter-ganking. You make *smart* early game plays to get a lead, and then you transition into the late game team fights by being equally smart, as well as working with your team.\n\nIf that's too much to process, by all means, quit League of Legends. It's only the basis of playing the game, after all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wizzleboom","date":"2014-12-25T04:14:14.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude of course there are counter picks to Panth.
