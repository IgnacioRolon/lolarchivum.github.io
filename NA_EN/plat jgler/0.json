The new clash game mode looks awesome! But, I have been muted in the past for being toxic. it has been a couple months , and I play once a day and lately I would say I have been a lot better when it comes toxicity. I offer people advice, willing or not. My friends are starting a team and they would love me to attend it. I’ve had the notification that I can earn honor again. But it has been a couple months and I’m still dishonorable. As far as i know , Clash requires a honor level of 3. Help?!! Is there anyway you can track your progress in honor? I feel like I’m in crunch time right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-08T03:33:53.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't yet have a way to track your current honor progress, but it does look like you're earning honor at the normal pace now. Keep in mind that sometimes certain borderline behavior (meaning it run the risk of being actioned on) could skip being punished and simply hold your honor progress back a bit.","replies":[]}]}
