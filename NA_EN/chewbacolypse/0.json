Thank you. GL HF(:\n\nTo whomever is reading: \nFirst I would like to thank you for your time and for actually reading this request. With so many request being sent into Riot I truly hope this does not get lost in the shuffle. \nI started playing League of Legends when it was just starting out. Not many people had heard of it, but everyone who had loved it. Myself included. I quickly fell more and more in love with the game play and champion lore and everything about League! That love for your game is still strong within me, more than a girl likes to admit! About seven months ago my health started slipping away from me. Slowly at first and then all at once (Thank you John Green for that oh-so-true quote). I have spent more nights in the ER than I've had normal doctors visits in my entire life. Mind you this is all within the last seven months. 10 CAT scans, 13 ER visits, 3 surgeries, and countless specialists later and here we are. No closer to answers than the beginning and gone through too much for any 18 year old. I had to leave college. Leave all of my friends behind. Now, this isn't the main point of this request so I will move on, but needless to say...I'm hopeless. League of legends became my escape. It was something that was fun, engaging, and didn't take too much of my energy away. The obsession continues. However, tonight that all changed. I hate to air on the dramatic side of things, but what happened tonight was inexcusably horrid. I was playing an ARAM with two of my friends. Things were going fairly well, but it was chaotic in true ARAM fashion. There was a player who kept getting killed and after a few more deaths decided to send this comment, \"I hope you get leukemia.\" Now normally I would just brush something like this off, we all say things we don't mean when we get frustrated, but leukemia is becoming a very real reality for me over the past seven months. It struck a chord with me, very deeply at that. So I responded with \"I have leukemia. That isn't funny.\" To which I was told \"Good. Have fun dying soon.\" At this point my friends stepped in. Saying things like \"This is a real fatal disease.\" and \"This is uncalled for.\" Nothing brash or rude. The players response was horrifying. \"It's not my fault she [talking about me] is flawed.\" and continued to taunt me about this cancer, no taunting pun intended. The things that were said hit me to my core and pushed out some tears. All my friends could say was \"I'm sorry.\" \"No one, especially someone in your situation should be told something like that.\" I thought it was over and I would just report this player at the end game screen and that would be that. The game ends and it goes to the end game screen. I reported the player and then looked at the chat room. \"Enjoy dying.\" and other messages were plastered across the room from this same player. My heart sank and for the first time ever I had felt as hopeless on League as I did in the real world. \nI am sorry to write a novel about this particular incident, but League of Legends is a large passion of mine and someone needs to hear this story. It may not seem like a big deal to someone who is able to have a job and will go home tonight and snuggle in bed and sleep comfortably. But to someone who sits in bed for days at a time, not by choice, and gets to stare at all of her friends accomplishing the dreams she has for herself, this means the world. \nI understand that a lot of people slip through the cracks, not everybody in the Tribunal would ban this person. I need your help. This person seemed very proud that they could offend a sick person, which is disturbing but I know that I can handle it, what bothers me is the fact that they won't ever understand that it is wrong. \nI am sorry to write such a negative thing about a game that I love. In the meantime, I'm back on the rift and you better get back to creating something awesome. \nSincerely yours, \nOne Proud Gamer (:","replies":[{"poster":"Slumber Jack","date":"2015-11-18T22:13:30.237+0000","up_votes":197,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey guys, just as an FYI.

Well no...not exactly our whole community, but moreso the \"poisonous apples\" within the basket.\n\nLeague is a game that many of us play to escape many problems of reality and like yourself, the endearing champions and incredible game modes continue to make us come for more with friends or even alone. However, like the Internet itself - some people just abuse the system/status of being \"anonymous\" online and harass other players just for the sake of their own sickened amusement. I've seen plenty of these in game, and  I do hope the one who was toxic to you in this specific incident is banned real soon.\n\nHonestly people...think before you speak online. It's so obvious that being toxic is going to negatively affect the entire game and its players. Though sadly, some probably do find enjoyment out of this and I hope the ban system in the future quickly detects such behaviour. Being an online game doesn't mean that it's providing an opportunity for people to openly insult others. It's a shame that such a system is abused really...as many good things can come out of our community as well. Regardless, I'm glad that you found League to be something you love, and I hope it continues to deliver as well. \n\nI'd imagine that this event must have been a beyond imaginable terrible experience to yourself especially having lost many precious things as of recently due to  your health. I'm really sorry you had to suffer that as I truly wish the community had more people like you to get along with as opposed to the those who ruin the game based off their ingame chat logs and behaviour in general. Indeed, the mute button is always available - but it just takes one sentence to trigger us at times especially if such a comment or insult directly relates to us. \n\nAs a game, I truly hope the League of Legends continues to entertain us all for many years to come and I have confidence that Riot will provide justice for us with their upcoming ban system as players like the one who directly insulted you should not be allowed to play. Truly, such people are a disgrace to say such things so confidently in our community. \n\nI do wish you well and I hope that your experience with League is not ruined by the attitude of such players. Seeing such a topic, I had the urge to read and respond to it - and I hope that many more will continue to view this topic to show that there are many of us who do enjoy this game just as much as you do and will defend our fellow players from such toxic experiences. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chewbacolypse","date":"2015-11-17T09:05:42.061+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could not agree more.

ARAM is suppose to be one of those game modes that is just chaotic, throw everything and have fun (unlike ranked summoners rift at the moment) where there's nothing on the line for winning or losing. What's even more appalling is that he kept it up throughout the game. I know I've said a few things in my time playing this game that I'm not proud of, but there's moments where I recognize things and either apologize or just stop talking (hell, my last game this evening was troll central and I unbound my enter key to stop from getting a chat restriction I was so mad at the intentional feeding and toxicity from both sides of the game that I reported) This guy doesn't even sound like he WANTS to reform and thrives on the misery of others.\nI hope he does get banned.

The Annie on the other team had serious issues, and the stuff she said to my team was horrible.  This was just after the Howling Abyss map was added, but to this day I remember her name and some of the things she said.  I kept chat open so I could get screenshots to send to Support, but looking back I regret that.  \n\nIt seems to be getting worse too.  This community's always been known for its toxicity and nastiness, but recently it's harder to find 'nice' people that realise this is just a game.  Sure, it's competitive, but so are sports.

Going through the comments I have come across some posts about what my message \"was trying to say\". I wanted to clear something up. The point of this post is to get the attention on Riot on the issue of poor banning and player punishment issues. It is not meant to focus only on my story, but the stories all of us can share of being hurt by someone while playing one of the games we love.\nThe point of this post IS NOT...let me repeat that IS NOT to:\n* Cause a witch hunt for the person that said these things. Yes the summoner name of the player was originally included because I literally just copied and pasted what I had sent Riot. The name was edited out by me within the first 15 minutes of this being posted.\n* To get pity for my situation. I don't need or want pity from anyone. EVER. Is my situation sucky, absolutely. Do I want prayers and positive vibes, absolutely. I do not want any one to feel bad for me or send love just because of my situation. Guys, I'm a big girl, I can handle my life. It's ok. Don't get me wrong I appreciate hearing that I have the communities support, but causing an emotional reaction from the reader was not the purpose of this in the least. I told my story how I see it and that is all. \n* To focus on my story alone. I wanted to get this out here so I can hear others stories and draw Riots attention to the matter. Something needs to be done about toxicity in  our community. I wish there was an easy answer of how, but with so many competitive people in such a frustrating environment is hard. I merely want to address the issue and have support from fellow summoners who have had this problem as well. \n* Belittle the person who said these things. I would never wish anything bad upon anyone. It is simply not who I am and I never will be. There are several posts saying \"I wish he would rot in hell\" and other brash things. I do not agree with those. Do I think he/she should have a consequence, yes. Is that in my hands to decide which punishment, no and I'm not naive to that! \n* Lastly the poll. The question of whether this player should be banned or not was simply a question of what your opinion is. It wasn't \"who would ban this player\" or \"let's find this person and ban them now!\" It is simply asking what you think the correct action would be.\n          I am sorry for all of the miscommunication, but I am so overwhelmed with support from the community and I will forever be grateful for all of your opinions. Whether I agree with them or not everyone's opinion has a place here and is valued. Thank you for your time in reading, responding, and sharing my story. It is one of many that need to be told.

It must be hard and my condolences go out to you.\n\nBUT, I don't agree with some of what you and a few of the replies have stated.\n\nFirstly, no one in-game knows your backstory. In his initial comment, he obviously had no idea of your condition. I'm not trying to say that this makes it excusable in any way, but you can't just assume that people will know what you go through. Comments like the one he made go unnoticed and are not punished, because frankly it doesn't offend a lot of people. Again, that doesn't make what he said \"OK\", in any sense, but he may not have known better.\n\nAfter his initial comment, he most definitely became highly toxic and detrimental to the play experience of you and your team. That is punishable because it disrupts a positive gameplay. However, just because it \"hit home\" doesn't make it more punishable than it normally would be.\n\nA lot of these replies are suggesting that he's going to \"burn in hell\" or be put to death or the like. He made a few comments in a video game. It's really not that serious. How could he know that he was actually talking to someone with Leukemia? And even then, it's still only a few insults.\n\nI'm not trying to make this your fault or responsibility, but you easily could have muted him after he first offended you rather than continuing to banter. In all technicality, you did bring the extensive abuse upon yourself by continuing to talk to him. (Keep in mind, not trying to excuse him for his actions. He should be banned and he was being a d*ck)\n\nAll in all, he did create a toxic game experience, but just because he offended you more personally because of your condition shouldn't make it more punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-11-17T19:13:17.872+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe he didn't know the first time, but he definitely knew after that, and he deliberately harped on it with the intention of causing harm.

However, just because it \"hit home\" doesn't make it more punishable than it normally would be.\"\n\nA lot of your reply just restated what I already said, but let me try to grasp what you're saying.\n\nI believe what you're getting at is that because he DELIBERATELY offended her, it should result in a worse punishment than if he had ACCIDENTALLY offended her?\n\nThe precept under which he acted doesn't constitute a change in punishment, it's the same offense either way.\n\nWhether he had said \"I hope you get Leukemia\" with or without knowing she has it shouldn't affect his punishment, as he said the same thing regardless.\n\nAs I said before, the whole reason he pushed harder to offend her is because he learned that he was succeeding in upsetting her. This in itself could easily have been avoided.\n\nAlso, from what I gather, you don't think this type of behavior should be tolerable in any society. I'd have to disagree with you. Because this part of your argument is completely a matter of subjectivity, neither of us can really be correct... but I'll give my opinion on the matter in case you have any interest.\n\nI personally am not a sensitive person. I can't know what she feels, so I can't make a judgement myself, but I don't think that I would take offense to what he said in a similar situation. From a technical standpoint, it's just a collection of letters. Words only have the connotation that you give them, and if you refuse to take offense to insults, then you won't. It wasn't even in person. It seems easy to ignore what he says or to mute him before it escalates, but maybe that's just me. From a moral standpoint, I personally find no objection to insult because what each person finds offensive is highly variable, and therefore it is unjust to punish someone based on one such set of \"limits.\" \n\nHOWEVER, this still does not justify what he said. He began playing LoL while knowing with full certainty and agreeing to their standards of gameplay. I agree he should be banned, but purely on a basis of policy. In a situation where he had not agreed to censor himself to a certain extent, I would fully support his right to say such things. It's acceptable by my morals and by U.S. law, so I have no objection to it.\n\nAnyway, I appreciate the banter.

Why should the code of conduct for a private community (however open to the public, it is in the private control of Riot) be any different? Riot has it to their discretion when and to what extent to enact punishments spelled out for any violations of that code, and most people will agree that vague rudeness is not so grave an offense as willful and directed malice.\n\nBy the way, willfully causing emotional distress, whether by communication or other means, is in fact _not_ protected by U.S. law, and is a criminal act. Proving it is, of course, another matter. It's hardly as simple as \"he said a mean thing\". It must be shown that they had reason to believe they were causing significant harm.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fritterz","date":"2015-11-17T19:19:14.889+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ban that mofo","replies":[]},{"poster":"WooBeeWoo","date":"2015-11-17T15:04:46.582+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account has only been warned once I have never been banned.

There is a difference between getting frustrated and being a terrible person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-11-17T13:32:49.183+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"One more reason to implement a way to give real punches through the net...\n\nI'm sorry you had to face such things...","replies":[{"poster":"Chewbacolypse","date":"2015-11-17T16:22:47.297+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean what doesn't kill you makes you stronger but that doesn't mean that it was right.

For you it seems this has become your way to fight through the pain and do something you enjoy doing. People in general are insensitive and brash and some are just downright evil and get enjoyment being a bully of words. You are better than them (maybe not always in the game but as a human being and that's what's really important).
