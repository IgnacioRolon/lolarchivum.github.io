It's been 4 days and I haven't even received a message from them saying my ticket has been read and something is being done. Finding it quite frustrating as I am trying to get back my account which has been hacked and I'm not getting any responses from Riot. \r\n\r\nI also made another ticket yesterday asking them to look into my first ticket and for someone to let me know that my issue is being looked into. Still no response on either.\r\n\r\nIs this normal? What can I do to make sure I get a response from Riot?\r\n\r\nThanks guys.","replies":[{"poster":"xMrNinjax","date":"2018-03-02T10:48:45.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just created a ticket in my LOL account and how long should i wait for the respond?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-05T23:42:11.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on the issue, your ticket may have been fielded to a large volume.
