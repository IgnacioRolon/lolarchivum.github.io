While I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this, I've noticed that other players often blow this ideal way out of proportion, to the point where if you do not live up to their Needlessly Large expectations, you are met with a flurry of giant, yellow \"?\" pings furiously barraging your character model.\n\n**It is okay to be bad at League of Legends.** I do not have enough fingers on my hands to count how many times I, or others on my team, have been called \"bad,\" \"trash,\" or \"garbage\" at the game -- all for making simple mistakes. Yes, the Internet is a harsh place. Yes, I know not to let these insults affect me overmuch. That does not mean expecting EVERYONE in League to play perfectly every single time, and then kicking them down when they fail, is okay.\n\nI'm proud to say I'm not always good at this game. I am only human. Sometimes I'm decent enough to carry; other times, I singlehandedly lose a match for my team. My play is inconsistent, but not intentionally, and it can have to do with any number of factors: emotional state, Champion mastery, level of awareness; even body temperature at times (those who have played with cold hands before know what I mean). There are so many small and subtle things we don't think about that can affect our performance in game, it's astonishing. Not to mention League is, fundamentally, a trial-and-error experience. We are constantly learning. Think about that the next time you decide to whack someone over the head with a \"Missing\" ping, or threaten to report them for playing poorly despite their best efforts.","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2016-07-16T11:26:49.859+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/fd/fd3d970c53aa6ae1dfdda0c2aa7c344c883bf5455bf924fdb6e3d8b1f4983385.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-07-16T12:00:59.210+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"This captures exactly what I was trying to get across except in plain language and with fewer words.

There's no tying, no simultaneous loss, none of that stuff. The only way for a game to not end in victory for one team and defeat for the other is for the game the server is on to just die, preventing the game from reaching its conclusion. And because of this, it is literally impossible for there to ever be a skill group where a person is incapable of winning - though that's a pretty dumb thing to imagine, anyway, as if low-skill players are being matched properly, _they still have a good chance of wining and climbing because their opponents are also low-skill_. Which, due to victory increasing LP and MMR, will lead to some of them leaking into higher skill groups.\n\nAnd keep in mind, no matter how unlikely it is, it _is_ possible for someone who never improves to get carried all the way to an incredibly high league by the randoms they end up matching with. The ladder is based entirely on winning and losing. It is entirely possible for someone who has literally never killed a minion or gotten a kill to get to Challenger, in theory.\n\n...
