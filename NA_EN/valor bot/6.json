Awesome :D\n\nI picked Zaun, but I concede that I can't draw a clear line between where my love of the idea and place of Zaun ends, and my love for the emblem begins.  Look at it, though!  (And thanks to Duke Anax for linking them.)  The subtle asymmetry in the lower half with the perforated tank and the blasted tank, as well as the piping that connects them, isn't immediately what draws your eye (the garish glowing, perhaps even _bioluminescent*_, green wins there) as is instead a... what... third read?  Maybe even later.\n\nMy brain goes:\n\n1. GREEN!!!  ->\n2. Twisty sharp helix-shaped drill thing ->\n3. Pointy sharp claw bits that look a bit like the biohazard symbol -> \n4. That ornate metalwork across the top that remind me of train station ironwork -> \n5. The perforated canister in the bottom right.\n6. Syringe needle\n\nIt's got layers, you know?  Like Zaun.  \n\nIt's got beauty (that ornate ironwork) that's almost been hidden by the flashy body horror stuff in front of it.  It's got practicality and function, even while it looks cobbled together from mismatched pieces.  It's revolting and fascinating at the same time.  It has shadowy parts made all the murkier because it's literally generating it's own light.  \n\nIt's making light!  F*#& all those haters trying to keep it down - it'll make it's own bloody light!  Shove it in the shadows, try to obscure its beauty, give it nothing but mechanical scraps and labware to use and BY GOLLY it'll make an emblem out of them nonetheless!\n\nSo yeah, Targon - you may have a window to the heavens, and Shurima might be literally creating water from the Sun Disk, but none of them (in my opinion) hold a candle to Zaun's.\n\nWhew!\n\nDid I mention I'm a bit obsessed with Zaun right now?  I am.  None of the above is official Riot verdict on any of these, blah blah, etc. etc. - and I think they're all cool (plx don't kill me for having a favorite, Worldbuilding team!).

It's the kind of crest that looks like it wouldn't be weathered by the passage of time, and would have eternal meaning no matter who looked upon it. Something about it almost seems just \"right\" about it, like there's a meaning behind the very way it's been designed and an indication as to the greater values and history of Demacia itself. I feel it's a perfect fit for Demacia.\n\nMount Targon's is a close second because of how layered it is. The mountain is depicted in gleaming stone, already indicating its importance and the power surrounding it, the Targon iconography frames the celestial bodies, giving subtle indication as to Targon's influence, and the cosmos as viewed in the centre feels symbolic of the wider mysteries of not only Targon, but the universe as a whole. The stone backdrop also helps it out, as it gives the impression of something truly ancient, from a past long forgotten and unvisited by men, but also enduring and almost timeless, such that you can immediately understand the importance of what the emblem signifies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2016-11-27T14:10:28.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Freljord** because as a Swede anything related to snow, ice and Vikings in general gives me a boner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xodiathe4bdn1","date":"2017-01-07T20:51:37.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"die hard shadow isles crest\nGhost stories have just always been my thing","replies":[]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-11-29T10:34:24.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"may be it is just me but this:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Lt0T3Mo.png\n\nlooks kind of like this:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6LQ728p.jpg\n\nit's the death of mami from madoka anime, a monster bit her head off while she was hanging in the air with her head in its mouth\n\ni mean those black thingies aside the sword look like legs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2016-11-29T02:10:01.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BLOOD FOR NOXUS","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-11-28T22:03:53.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be so cool if we ever got specific faction login screens (or at least music themes, besides Demacia, which already got one), like we once got for the Shuriman event.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-11-28T22:01:08.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder what Yordle is gonna be part of the Bandle City Emblem, or is it just a generalized Yordle on the Emblem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"mr Boombastic787","date":"2016-11-28T18:10:28.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't pick one, my favorits are Bilgewater, Ionia and Shurima.
