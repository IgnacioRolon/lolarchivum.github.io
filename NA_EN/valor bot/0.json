Usually, I sit at around 60-120 FPS otherwise, while having all my video settings maxed out in game. However, joining a Nexus Siege match almost immediately causes my FPS to spike down to the 20s-30s in bursts. I tried lowering my graphics, but it did not resolve the issue.\n\nHere are my specs:\n\n> OS X El Capitan\n> Version 10.11.5\n> iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013)\n> Processor 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5\n> Memory 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n> Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 1024 MB\n\nThanks for any help.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-16T05:43:17.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Boost your FPS by utilising the **[Frames for days booster.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)** This booster is legal and is approved by Riot.\n\nhttp://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/Skins/Tristana_RocketGirl_Splash.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-07-17T06:23:12.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, it seems like all I needed to do was repair the game files to resolve the issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-17T06:38:01.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcomed!
