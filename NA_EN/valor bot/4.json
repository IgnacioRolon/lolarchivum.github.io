Looks dumb on a marksman.  And I highly doubt Quinn would dress up like that...Just sayin, you probably figured it out by now she is not the typical \"girly\" type. And this skin is very feminine and girly. Something a witch/mage/caster would look good with. Sucks how Vayne is getting all the skins Quinn should have gotten. ","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-06-03T11:00:46.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye, I agree the Ravenborn thematic has a very magical feeling to it at its core, something that's attuned to the more caster-y types of the League roster. I wouldn't say that's problematic in this case, though -- skins are meant to explore alternate fantasies and themes for different Champions (hello, Elderwood LeBlanc), and that's exactly what I wanted to do here with Ravenborn Quinn, which is why I didn't mind giving her an outfit that she would perhaps be too conservative to wear in the main canon. \n\nThat being said, I do think blending \"marksman\" and \"magic-wielder\" can lead to some very fun and interesting results. I didn't even design her crossbow with functionality in mind because, in my head canon, it's powered by magic. Likewise, I can't imagine that Valor would be able to carry her with that size, so she'd have to travel around in her ult through some other unconventional means.\n\nUltimately, I felt Ravenborn was a good match for Quinn because it helped me play up her avian theme with a twist, while also taking the skin line in an unexpected direction by giving it to a marksman (similar to how Orianna got a Heartseeker skin, which was unprecedented for a mage). I know not everyone's gonna like it, though, so in any case, thanks for your feedback/critique!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ClockworkCreeper","date":"2016-06-02T19:32:52.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool","replies":[]}]}
