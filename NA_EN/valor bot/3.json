These black/yellow spikes appear unfitting for the ability and should be removed or replaced, IMO, by something that is not only higher quality but also flows better with the new chain VFX.\n\nIf anyone could leave this feedback on my behalf in the PBE thread titled [&quot;[Assassins] Artistic Feedback Thread&quot;](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/U6gAHgZu-assassins-artistic-feedback-thread)--I&#039;d really appreciate it, as I don&#039;t own a PBE account myself but want to make sure Riot is aware of this!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Phoenix","date":"2016-10-21T22:02:15.495+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo Valor Bot!\n\nIt was intended to be kept from the old visuals.
