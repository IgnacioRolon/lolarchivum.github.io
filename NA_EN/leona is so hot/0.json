What you're seeing on the map are the continents of Valoran, Shurima, Ionia, ect.\nIt does seem a bit small. It feels like there would be more south of what we're seeing, as there should be an ice cap on the north and south pole. Its entirely possible that this could just be one side of the planet as well. Unless Riot said that this is all there is to Runeterra, I don't see a reason why there isn't room to theorize about the possibility of other continents. To me, it just looks like the northern hemisphere.","replies":[{"poster":"MaidensKnight","date":"2018-07-26T23:39:14.527+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"On reddit, Riot Bioluminescence stated that the map is about only 1/6 of runeterra.
