It's just hard to see the justification in what you (Riot) pick and choose to prioritize sometimes.\n\nedit: One of the other problems I see in his kit, which is due to the \"feast or famine\"-ness of his grabs and all the power it alone takes up, is it doesn't really allow him to do much else EXCEPT land grabs. Everything else requires he stand relatively close and in danger range of the enemy team to take full advantage of. If he lands a grab, thats all he has to do and his team can get a near-guaranteed kill, at any point in the game. If he doesn't land one, then he's out of commission more or less for 20-10 seconds. There's not a lot of room to do much else other than the basic things any other champion in the game can do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2015-03-19T22:14:41.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZBgsJx0j,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-19T18:51:16.077+0000)\n>\n> We don't have any plans for a Blitz rework, we think he's in a good spot overall.

He still has a single target knockup and a team-wide silence which does a lot of damage for a support. His hook is a lot of his power but Blitz is far from useless in a team fight, if nothing else his ult allows him to disengage and with the cooldown being so short his team can just wait for a hook to land again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PubgamerAU","date":"2015-03-19T14:05:03.517+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Uh.

No, he is not balanced. As a matter of fact, he's a very unhealthy champion. He shuts out so many champion picks in bot lane, both adc and supports. A champion that can pull you with minimal risks and costs, other than 100 mana cost and a fairly long cd ( although you typically build cdr and mana on him), and then guarantee your death is stupid. You get pulled, chance are you're dead. You're very unlikely to survive, and if you do, you're out of the fight and that hurts an entire team instead of hurting one player.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-03-19T14:40:10.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or, you can just stand behind a minion, or juke his pulls?","replies":[{"poster":"Wydiwyg","date":"2015-03-19T23:15:24.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A typical reply, but we all know that it isn't that easy.\nYou can't hide behind minions (or your tank) for 30+ min straight, you just can't.

Blitz' winrate in Plat is ~56% and only slightly less in Diamond and Master/Challenger while maintaining a pick-/banrate that rivals Lee Sin's. That is higher than his winrate in Bronze, Silver and Gold.\n\nYes, it is possible to avoid most of Blitz' hooks, but all he needs to do is land a handful of successful ones over the course of the game to let it all snowball from there.
