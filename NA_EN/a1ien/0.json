The game alone- the mouse and keyboard still worked.\nThe first time was before the victory screen, I was able to open task manager and close that window, but had to wait to reconnect into the game.\nThe second time was midgame, could not leave the game screen at all and I was forced to hard restart. Internet did not drop, it just froze. \n\nIs this due to the game mode itself?\n\nedit: And I've been leavebustered. Great.

You might have the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been known to cause freezing like this.
