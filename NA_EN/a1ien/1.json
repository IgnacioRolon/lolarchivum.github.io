Since I always have to force shut down, and hardreset each time (even if it happens in game) I've ended up with the leavebuster thing twice in a row.\r\n\r\nSo really, should I expect the punishments for essentially \"dodging\" \"afking\" to increase\r\nor should I just not league?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-22T01:32:14.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks that you're having those problems, but if you do keep entering matchmade games and leaving for any reason you're going to get longer LPQ's for more games. I'd suggest troubleshooting that hard freezing as it could be a sign of over-heating in your laptop. First make sure those fans are cleaned out, as well as checking for any driver updates you could have missed.","replies":[{"poster":"A1ien","date":"2017-11-23T05:06:24.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've pretty much run every scan I could find advised to do in this situation, defragged, updated my drivers and cleaned the fans. I mostly suspect its my graphics card giving issues, but I can't really do much about that right now. \nThanks for the info though,\nI'll probably stick to the bot games if I really want to play. The timer is pretty frustrating.","replies":[]}]}]}
