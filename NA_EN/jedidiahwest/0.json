My match history speaks for itself. My provisionals did not warrant a bronze 5 placement, this is so discouraging and upsetting that I am not sure I can find the will to ever play this game again.

I played with many silver players this season and to be honest. They suck, and I don't find it far at all to say. We put you where we think you belong in your post about new Ranking season. This game isn't about luck, but player and there chooses.. If you says {{champion:7}}  can play a support roll. You trolling and you know it cause I had that. If you say {{champion:40}} can play a Tank roll for your team. You are again Trolling cause I had that. If you say {{champion:42}} is a good Mid or {{champion:19}} is a good support. AGAIN YOUR TROLLING cause I seen that. There is no such thing as lucky and unlucky. It players trolling or just not wanting to put time in looking up how to do other rolls and champs needed for it. Maybe if you Lower the IP Prices on a FEW MORE CHAMPS. Player could be able to play better champs.","replies":[{"poster":"ThreshTecSupport","date":"2017-10-29T20:43:33.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this was 3 years ago but I cant help but say that corki is a good mid now, maybe the guy wasn't trolling and he could see the future lmao","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tabex","date":"2015-02-05T15:34:03.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Digital Ram,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=rNaHAxic,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-28T22:49:46.978+0000)\n>\n> Hey JedidiahWest,\n> \n> It looks like you finished the season last year in bronze.
