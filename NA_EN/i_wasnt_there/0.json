I've got 16gb of RAM and the CPU and memory don't seem to be getting pushed to the limits (when looking at things through the Activity Monitor) but I'm struggling to keep over 20FPS in teamfights at the lowest settings for every type of windowing mode.

The whole client and game both seem to have a newly-discovered lag to them - ie. delays when buying item from shop in game or out of game (store). \n\nIt's a shame that since OSX users represent a minority of players we get kicked to the curb. I'd bet most of us spend more than the average windows user on skins etc. Maybe if we all stopped purchasing new skins they'll pay attention?

It doesn't matter what I'm doing in the game, still get it. I really notice it with certain champs (such as warwick). Im also losing all game music from time to time. That started in 7.2. Hopefully riot finds a solution to the problem and realizes that before they put out a patch for the game, they need to test it on all platforms and not just windows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T03:28:18.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this affect all Window modes, or does it only affect specific ones? You can try swapping between them in your **VIDEO** settings in-game. Please let me know which window modes are affected by these framerate issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PJ Tha Don","date":"2017-02-12T04:40:12.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I've been having problems with 7.3 too. Tried repairing client, still the same. In busy situations like teamfights I have very low FPS and slideshow gameplay. Towards the beginning of the game it's fine, then steadily declines. Internet and ping is steady, never had serious problems with fps before 7.3 either. \n\nJudging by the speed of how fast riot fixes issues for mac, I wouldn't hold your breath for a fix soon unfortunately. Not a ton of mac players, so they aren't riot's priority. May be a week or more before a fix.","replies":[]}]}
