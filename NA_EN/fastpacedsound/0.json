Check him out if you haven't and let me know what you think! Are there any specifics you'd like to see in the champion if he were made?","replies":[{"poster":"FastPacedSound","date":"2017-08-01T05:39:24.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't even notice that board, I'm so blind xD. \nAnyway, Rakan seems pretty cool, but sadly not what I'm looking for. I'm thinking of something fully anthropomorphic, a devious personality, fast melee with high damage, but extremely fragile.\n\nThanks for reading my suggestion ^_^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuyiyo","date":"2017-08-01T12:40:08.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We do have Azir, Nasus, and Renekton.

They just look like they're angry and from ancient egypt, which I guess is the point of those characters, but that's just why they aren't a match for what I'm looking for. \nWarwick just comes off as a werewolf to me and Kindred is only half male.\n\nI just wanted to make a suggestion for something that would make me play the game significantly more. Although it is probably only me wanting it so I guess what is currently there will have to do.","replies":[]}]}]}
