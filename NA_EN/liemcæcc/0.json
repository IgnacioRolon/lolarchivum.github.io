I&#039;ll include the top Reddit comment here since it contains some great additions to the article. These are some Rioters who can confirm that sexism is alive and well as Riot Games. \n\n&gt; Some former Rioters were bumping this article btw (which lends more credibility imo):\nIron Stylus: https://twitter.com/Iron_Stylus/status/1026918454824034306\nMiniWhite Rabbit: https://twitter.com/MiniWhiteRabbit/status/1026918229296308225 (TW:hers is particularly brutal to read)\nScarizard was liking a few of these tweets as well Edit: https://twitter.com/ScarizardPlays/status/1026919535960444928\nRicardo Luis tweeted about it as well (I know I can&#039;t link it tho)\nMirhi: https://twitter.com/FFMirhi/status/1026916236083359745 (the power rankings guy)\nJessie Perlo: https://twitter.com/Gogo_Usagi/status/1026908342159962112\nRiot Mori Grl: https://twitter.com/guldeuxchats/status/1026910053272498176\nDevon Giehl: https://twitter.com/devongiehl/status/1026912574221111298\nKatie Chironis: https://twitter.com/kchironis/status/1026924235552251904\nEmeraldSatyr: https://twitter.com/EmeraldSatyr/status/1026911041593253889\nQuickshot: https://twitter.com/RiotQuickshot/status/1026937738086502403?s=19\nDraggles is sharing a lot of tweets like /u/urclades stated\nJes Negron (in the article): https://twitter.com/JesNx/status/1026940602133434369\nRiot Tiza: https://twitter.com/RiotTiza/status/1026938535058665472\nAlex Manisier: https://twitter.com/alexmanisier/status/1026948097388109824\nRiot TinyBun: https://twitter.com/RiotTinyBun/status/1026934845195182080\n_credit: /u/naxter48_\n\n> _From a former Rioter&#039;s (MiniWhite Rabbit) Twitter:_ **Multiple women confided in me about being sexually harassed at work. About their asses being slapped, being groped at parties, or being raped at Riot events. At first it was shocking. Then it became standard. **\n\nTruth be told, I&#039;m also posting it here because it needs to be seen by everyone working at Riot and all of their customers. This should be at the the back of every one of our minds when we go to purchase a skin or tune into pro games which generate ad revenue for Riot. Riot needs to step up and address these issues of sexism. This is not okay.","replies":[]}
