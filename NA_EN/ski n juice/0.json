It's like, I get it. LoL is competitive so when you try to play with an S/O tensions can rise a bit more than usual. Maybe some couples don't fight but in my experience, the fighting is somewhat normal if both people are competitive. However, my bf takes it to a new level.\n\nWhen we first started playing, we were super cute and it was so fun to play together. In fact, we met because of League. This was basically \"our\" game together. But he got too into the game and just started raging after every losing game. I'm competitive too, so when we do fight we both tend to get a bit toxic towards eachother. It's just our competitive nature. But my bf is more than just competitive. Like he is straight up an asshole to me in game now and I don't really know why.\n\nWe rarely play league together anymore because he just rages way too much and he just doesn't play much anymore in general. The thing is, when we do play he just gets mad at me. Like we will be skyping and he will hang up on me or start raging if he even dies. Like why can't this dude just relax?? We play with his friends sometimes and he doesn't rage at them. It's always me. \n\nFYI, I'm Gold V (this is my smurf....I'm trying to be sneaky lol) and he is Diamond III. I know we have a huge gap in our ranking but it's not like he gets mad at me because I'm a scrub. He gets mad at me when HE fux up. Is this some kinda guy thing?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the guy. IRL and outside of LoL we get along great and don't have problems. It's JUST THIS GAME. I just don't get it because we used to have so much fun together in LoL and now we can't cuz he sucks.\n\nI'm just putting this here mostly to vent....but I seriously am hoping other people have some insight on similar situations. I can't be the only one with this problem. And if not, how do other people deal with it?. This is clearly an issue HE has to fix I understand, but I wish there was a way I could help him.  Before I strangle him in cold blood.....\n\n\nTL;DR  my BF hates me and hates league and I don't know what to do about it.\n\n","replies":[]}
