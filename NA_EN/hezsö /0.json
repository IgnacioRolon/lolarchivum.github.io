My internet is fine, I can play any other game and go on internet etc. However when I play League, all through the game, I get the \"Attempting to reconnect\" sign although my internet is up and running. This didn't used to happen and it's frustrating since I CANT PLAY. Appreciate all the help I can get.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T16:56:04.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your internet is strong, you can still experience issues specifically connecting to the game server.
