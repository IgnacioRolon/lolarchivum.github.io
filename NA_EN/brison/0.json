My internet went out during the loading screen and I wasn't able to join my ARAM game until a couple minutes in (I was level 5 when I joined). I then played the rest of the game out with my team, even though we lost very quickly (admittedly because my internet fell out). I even finished the game connected and playing. It is obvious that I wasn't dodging or leaving the game and was wondering if i would be able to have this queue lifted from my account. I have been playing since the beta and this account is very close to my heart and don't want any punishments associated with it. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBrison","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T22:04:05.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you weren't in that match for a good amount of time if you noticed you were level 5 by the time you reconnected. Once the system notices that you're inactive for a certain amount of time, it will flag you with an AFK since that time without you could have made the difference between winning and losing that game. You can always check out the [**Leaverbuster FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714) for any questions about these penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"Barrosy","date":"2017-05-26T22:20:34.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offence meant, but it sounds like the system is kind of horrible in such situation. Sure it's not okay to leave a game and sure people who disconnect from the game (and won't reconnect) should get punished for such reasons, but if a player who comes back to the game and shows some sort of apoligy and intent to actually play the game \"it's supposed to be played\", then I'd personally think (and problaby others are with me on this one aswell) this should be looked into. I'm not trying to start a discussion here though, I'm just letting my thoughts go out here about this matter.","replies":[]}]}]}
