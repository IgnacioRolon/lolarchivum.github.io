You can do a perfectly good gank by E+R+Q+W to stop mobility. It's not super optimal unless you're confident you'll get the kill, since you might burn ult for nothing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-10-09T19:17:43.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"better than top imo","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2016-10-09T19:19:00.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HWlFIZ8E,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-10-09T19:17:43.919+0000)\n>\n> better than top imo\n\nShe's really strong in lane, but she's still a pretty good jungler.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-10-09T19:17:36.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo it's pretty good.","replies":[]}]}
