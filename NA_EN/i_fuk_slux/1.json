Well I got reported and got a Leaverbuster as I should of, and I got a 20 minute timer before I can find a game. But when the timer gets down to about 17 minutes it makes my computer freeze and shut itself off. I can play and do anything else I normally do on my computer. For some reason when i'm in the countdown it makes my cpu extremely hot. I'm assuming overheating is the problem, but I have a larger cpu fan than I need, and I have no idea why the que in league is making my cpu overheat itself. I can't play the game or do anything because of this. Any suggestions on what I can do short of buying another cpu?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-11T23:49:21.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unlikely that sitting idly in the queue for a match is stressing your PC to the point of a shutdown due to overheating.
