Now, I've had this happen before, and it was fixed by just forcing my computer off by holding the power button. But, after restarting, I let my computer do it's boot-up thing, and I go to open the league client. Before the updater/bootstrapper/client itself could open, everything freezes. \n\nI have I/OBit and Advanced System Care (related products), and ASC gives me a little desktop gauge of how much Ram, CPU, and Disk Space (Disk something, I can't remember offhand) are being used at the moment. After trying to open the league client, my CPU usage goes from its average of 30-40%, down to 5-10%, and nothing responds. Can't open Task Manager with Ctrl+Alt+Del, can't open a browser to Google what's going on, but I can still watch the CPU fluctuate between two small numbers, and hopelessly click on things. The only way to escape this is to force shut down my computer.\n\nI will note that this only happens when opening league, and every single time since that original crash.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollo Jetic","date":"2017-03-14T19:53:56.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response, I'll be getting to this right away.\n\nYes, it's a PC. It could be either hardware or drivers; I haven't updated drivers recently, and my harddrive wants to die, but I'm hoping if it's either it's the drivers because I can't afford to replace the HD right now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-14T18:33:13.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on a PC?
