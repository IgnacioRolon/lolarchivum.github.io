It's not our \"connection\" because I doubt it's a coincidence that all Mac users suddenly cannot connect to the servers, but all Windows users are doing just fine. When we click on launch, we expect the game to launch.\r\n\r\nRiot fix this. It's getting pretty ridiculous. At least own up to the fact that you guys made a mistake, and stop giving advice like \"Oh tRy OuR HExtEcH REpaiR toOL!\" Like c'mon. That shit won't fix anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T23:19:21.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have been noticing these Mac issues lately, and while it's been a little difficult to narrow down exactly what is causing those login troubles, we are working to figure out what's going on. \n\nWith that being said, we do need a little cooperation from our players to help figure this out.

Hextech repair several times. Deleted everything with \"league\" or \"riot\" in its name in Applications and Library. Reinstalled and repatched half a dozen times. Cleared out all my caches, preferences, settings multiple times. Rebooted multiple times. Tried on multiple accounts. etc. etc.\n\nYour client is broken. I'm now on a Core 2 Duo Late-2007 iMac7,1 running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (highest version of OS X Apple will support on the hardware) and the LoL client will install, say \"It is time\" for the new client, install a 1100 MB patch, then show a \"Launch\" button. When I click it... nothing. Mac users have been posting this same symptom all over the forums for days.\n\nSeriously, chain your mac dev and QA person(s) to their desks until they sort this out. It isn't going to go away magically by itself. And while you are at it, show them https://sparkle-project.org/ and get them to ditch their Rube Goldberg patcher.\n\nIf your dev team really can't reproduce this in house, then send me a debug version of your client and I will run it and send you whatever logs you like. I will work with your dev team to troubleshoot if they want to contact me directly. All free of charge. Alternatively, buy an older mac on ebay and test every release on it before pushing it out. There are one person developer shops that can write reliable software that runs and patches itself on macs flawlessly. This should not be that hard for Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"amyopacman","date":"2017-05-22T20:52:37.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@broporo\n\ni notice something odd (maybe its the source of the problem?!?) \n\nin the rads folder /  project folder / league client NA folder / release folder / (number of the release) / then NOTHING in that folder!\n\ni'm not sure it this may help?\n\ni also noticed that launching directly the patcher make it crash on launch (bugsplat)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marsh23","date":"2017-05-22T02:24:21.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=ffEIFOEE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-05-21T23:19:21.285+0000)\n>\n> We have been noticing these Mac issues lately, and while it&#x27;s been a little difficult to narrow down exactly what is causing those login troubles, we are working to figure out what&#x27;s going on. \n> \n> With that being said, we do need a little cooperation from our players to help figure this out.
