I understand you feel it's not your connection and I'm totally up to hear out why, but I still recommend going through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out a few more possibilities.

The legacy client and updated version are separate applications.  Your settings may have been configured on the legacy, but may need some tuning up on the updated client.
