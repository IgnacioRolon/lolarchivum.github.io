They honestly had a noble purpose. Rhaast seems like he honestly just wanted to kill things, while Varus... I don't even know how he felt about fighting against the Void. But Aatrox genuinely believed that he stood for something great. He fought to protect them, and they betrayed him. It makes me sad, listening to some of his lines. \r\n\r\n\"We march to battle... Let me carve flesh, let me cloak myself in the slaughter. Hide me in their carnage... Hide me from this suffering...\"\r\n\"I have no goodness left, it was taken from me, stolen! I... am the nemesis of life.\"\r\n \"The heavens, the endless skies folding into each other. Where are they now?\"\r\n\"How far I have fallen! A god... reduced to a prisoner!\"\r\n\"Once in noble battle, I screamed against the silence. I stood as light against the darkness. Now, I serve a new master... oblivion...\"\r\n\"I am but an unholy copy of life... A mockery of its freedom... And born in the cruel betrayal of the noble ideals I would've served.\"\r\n\r\nHe truly feels betrayed, and listening to these lines makes me feel for him. Aatrox is genuinely suffering from the pain of being turned on by those he trusted, and wishes everyone else to be a part of his suffering. Good job Rito.

His best lines imo, are the movement and long movement ones, and those are the ones you'll hear the most. The worst ones to me are some of the ones attached to the first encounters, but even then, they ARE first encounters, so you'd only hear them once. The way they are said come off as poorly articulated, and the voice actor doesn't really sound all that great when he says them. One example: \"A troll king?! Come! Defend you throne, king of trolls.\" Sounds really redundant and dumb. But, like I said, the dumb ones are attached to First Encounters, Taunts, and Jokes.\n\nAs for old Aatrox, he wasn't really all that interesting, imo. Even some of his best lines that people bring up like, \"Rage against the dying light\" doesn't sound all that special when compared to New Aatrox's lines. He also felt really one note. Very similar to Syndra in a way. Syndra is constantly spouting about her ULTIMATE POWER, while Old Aatrox just talked about how men should fight, because that's what men do. There were no other facets to him. Just war. New Aatrox other facets to his character. Despair, a need for purpose, confidence in battle, and of course, a need for vengeance. I agree, neither of them are supposed to be nice guys. What you get when you see new Aatrox is a sense of sadness akin to pity. And I think that's really cool.\n\nAlso, where'd you get the idea that he thinks he's the greatest? He has a bunch of lines talking about how he hates his current state and form.
