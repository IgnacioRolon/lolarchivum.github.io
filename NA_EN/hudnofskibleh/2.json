People complaining about the amount we get, and how the new system isn't good. I can't really tell if this is true or not, as I hardly play at all. Can anyone confirm if we get more BE, less BE, or the same amount of BE? And can you also provide a comparison with the old system?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-11T22:49:20.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here's a great post from a Rioter that explains that, yes, you do gain slightly more BE than in the old system](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hAaYMrEs-leveling-and-rewards-early-impressions-and-adjustments). That being said, BE is also *worth* more now, so you're actually getting a decently sized advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-12T01:22:23.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chermorg with the assist!
