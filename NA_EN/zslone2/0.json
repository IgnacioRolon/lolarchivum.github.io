But come every patch day, every single patch day, after updating my league client all of my sound for the game is reset back to 100 both in the game options and on my computers sound mixer. Now I keep league at a nice and quiet 2 on my sound mixer, loud enough to hear pings and quiet enough so my ears aren't bleeding should a teamfight happen or the announcer say something. Is this happening to anyone else? And if so have you figured out a way to fix this? Or is this a league / my computer thing? \n\n    Thanks for the help,\n                                     ~Z","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T23:56:34.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be a corruption with your config that's failing to sync up your settings on our side.  You may need to reset your config folder to fix this up:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll have to rebind your keys and redo settings.  That should get you fixed up, though!","replies":[]}]}
