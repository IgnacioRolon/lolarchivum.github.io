Everything around me is perfectly fine like I can see my allies move, the enemy move and see them attacking me but cant do anything about it. The stoping duration will be like 7 seconds and then after it my character would start doing all the moves and spells I press within the 7 seconds. I move to different computers in my house and I am still experiencing that problem. I try using WTFast and that didnt do anything. I follow the link from league website but I cant use it because you need Java and google chrome stop using Java. Plz someone help me fix this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-23T20:59:32.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like packet loss.  Have you tried uploading your logs via our [Log Reader?](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) This should help you to find out whether or not it's packet loss (and some potential fixes if it is!). Shouldn't require any Java on your end :D  Let me know if this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metalrichdog","date":"2016-05-23T18:04:48.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Packet loss is heavily due to one's own internet rather than anything that Riot can avoid. Of course, sometimes it is server based (But everybody feels those ones)","replies":[]}]}
