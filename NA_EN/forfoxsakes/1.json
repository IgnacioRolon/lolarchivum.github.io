Tribute lockout for last-hitting a minion increased.\n> \n> &gt;We haven&rsquo;t seen much of the Spellthief&rsquo;s line since we made Ancient Coin an actually-appealing item earlier in the season. This is less about Coin and more about Spellthief&rsquo;s: the line just isn&rsquo;t doing its job of enabling early aggression. We&rsquo;re moving the cooldown reduction of Frostfang&rsquo;s upgrades onto Frostfang itself, making it a more potent laning threat. This has the side effect of unlocking more build flexibility: sitting on Frostfang in the midgame will be less punishing for supports who&rsquo;d rather start building into their late-game oriented items.\n> \n> &gt;That said, the Spellthief&rsquo;s line has historically been vulnerable to midlane poaching when strong. We&rsquo;re upping the Tribute penalty for last-hitting to nip that problem in the bud.\n> &gt;Tribute passive\n> LAST-HIT PENALTY After last-hitting a minion, Tribute charge generation is paused for 6 seconds &rArr; 8 seconds\n> >Frostfang\n> NEWCOOLDOWN REDUCTION 10%\n> >Frost Queen&#039;s Claim\n> BUILD PATH Frostfang + Fiendish Codex + 450 gold &rArr; Frostfang + Blasting Wand + 500 gold (total cost unchanged)\n\nSo basically the coin is too strong, so as compensation lets nerf FQC even more right?\nOverall item&#039;s CDR doesnt change, cost doesnt change, get CDR a bit earlier - whoop-de-do. Supports arent spamming their shit on CD anyways \n\nTHEN a nerf on top to further punish last hitting a minion:\n-ADC needs help shoving a lane to go B in a hurry, or there&#039;s 2 minions about to die and ADC cant CS both in time? Well supports take this punishment for helping out\n-Mage mid laners building a support item? NOT ALLOWED - GTFO. Top and jungle building support items - ok no prob. \n\nThese changes aren&#039;t fixes at all in any way","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-13T19:43:04.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will grant that I expected more positive changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Altonius Amakiir","date":"2017-09-13T19:52:58.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would first off like to commend your professionalism in this post. The changes are aimed at making the item viable for support mages, they have basically given up on making it so some enchanters might want it. The cdr is so the support mages can build full ap items like rylai's, luden's, liandry's, and void staff instead of ap/cdr items(they can build more damage for late game). Since it now fits a mage fantasy but they want it only for the bot lane(since support items are very gold efficient and they need to make sure others lanes don't abuse them and cause them to be nerfed as has historically happened) they increased the penalty. As for the aspect of that hurting you picking up your adc's missed minions, I can tell you having used it recently, thats not a problem. You get multiple charges so as long as you already had a charge before you killed the minion, you will still have it, you just won't charge up a new one in that time. \n\nIn summary: ancient coin is for enchanters, relic shield is for tanks, spellthief's edge is for (those unethical) support mages. No longer matter of one being strong over the other, now they fit different niches.","replies":[]}]}
