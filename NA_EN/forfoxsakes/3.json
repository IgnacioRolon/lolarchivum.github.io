Lets come to a compromise. \n\nLooking at the facts on your side:\n1. Giving back a lot of BE means a lot of people will dump this into new champs meaning lost RITO profits, understandably bad\n2. Giving some vet chests at X# of years/seasons played isnt fair when someone can do 10 games a season on an alt vs someone who actually plays 1000 games in a season (vet by years played)\n3. Giving some compensation for games played like someone who played 1000 games in their single year of playing vs the 10 games player isnt fair since it&#039;s based on a person&#039;s free time and doesnt necessarily make on worth more or less than the other (vet by games played)\n\nLooking at the facts on our side:\n1. A LOT of runes cost way more than what they were listed at with the most recent prices (prior to the now 99% discount) and the return rate now is not satisfactory to anyone\n2. Runes were forced upon us and cost players time, some money and most people champs when they needed runes\n3. Rune pages cost A LOT of time/IP/$$ \n4. A lot of players gave a lot of loyalty, time in years and multiple seasons and are being grouped w those who just started for champ xp, getting insufficient recognition\n5. For the most part, we DONT want icons, emotes or some flair especially since they&#039;ll be replaced (ie can only use 1 icon, limited emote selection space etc)\n \n**So lets nail all of these in 1 sweep. Turn the launch of the Runes Reforged into an event**\n\n* All the rune and runepage refund will give Rune Reforged Tickets as currency\n* Each player will have RR Tickets based on their spending on runes/pages so it&#039;ll be fair for those who have spent a ton vs spent little, but return will be 100% based on the amount they spent to obtain it. If someone spent 820 on a rune and it now costs 410 they&#039;ll get the 820 value. This will reward the vets  more since they paid more, as it should be\n* Currency can be used on the items you&#039;ve planned already PLUS MORE\n* Plus more = icons for those who want it, loading screen flair for those who want it, but most importantly summoner XP. Vets who dumped a lot of IP/RP into runes/pages can use this to get something some levels over those who dont have as many RR tickets to spend\n* The RR Ticket currency segregates from costing RITO revenue from not giving up champions since it wont be converted to IP/BE for champ purchases\n* The RR Ticket system gives the PLAYER the control on what reward they want as compensation based on what they value, rather some who feel that RITO tells them what they should appreciate with set or restricted rewards\n* Add some quests to reward tickets to those who don't get a significant RR refund so they aren&#039;t left out\n* IP and BE currently held will have no value towards the RR event since this is about the old rune system and new, not how much IP/BE the player has currently collected. This is one major problem you're banging against right now\n* RR tickets are already locked in the past, people can't try to cheese them with discount runes, champ shard investing and whatnot so what you put in already is what you get back\n\nTa Daaa","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2017-09-06T14:21:23.971+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's a great idea.

IMO not much of a bigger investment for RITO to give leveling capsules (many posts have already said vets want capsules now as recognition) over straight champ purchases. Time played vets want recognition as well, so they can opt for the summoner exp for immediate payout now which really doesnt cost RITO the same since those people will level a bit slower at higher levels right?

They were going to earn those leveling capsules regardless, except using the RR tickets it's a front loaded reward with slower rewards later.\n\nLetting them open even 5 capsules (that they were going to get anyways at some point) at once is exciting and more rewarding and less insulting than grouping them the same as everyone else","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Calad","date":"2017-09-07T03:33:19.527+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You do want people to buy champs with transition rewards, but not to the extreme that a huge BE refund will cost the company in significant revenue when a big refund means lots of champ purchases.\n\nTrue, I think that's a reasonable distinction. I kind of separate them into 2 different categories, though of course they're intertwined.\n\nPhilosophically, we wanted players to be able to purchase champions with their transition rewards. I think how many champs players are able to purchase is more about what kind of rewards you get, and what feels fair.\n\n> Time played vets want recognition as well, so they can opt for the summoner exp for immediate payout now which really doesnt cost RITO the same since those people will level a bit slower at higher levels right?\n\nIt probably costs a bit - since those people will reach higher tiers of rewards faster, but my guess is you're right that it would probably be cheaper for riot.\n\nIt's an interesting idea, letting people opt in to starting at a higher level via their transition rewards. Overall, I think the new leveling system will be really fun, especially leveling up from 30. We didn't want to deny veteran players that early level-up experience by starting them at a higher level. \n\nSomething you said that I agree with is that riot should do a better job of rewarding veterans who have been playing the game for a long time. You guys are the reason we're even still around! My question for you is - what kinds of things can we give you?

That's no excuse.'\n\nIf veteran's rewards must exist, they should be accessible to every veteran player who hits that milestone, not just a one time 'everyone who's played since beta gets this cool thing, fuck everyone else' mechanic.

There's been this back and forth always about exclusivity towards the veterans. And this is why lifetime RP rewards became such an overall flop because it would stratify newer players.\n\nIn the end, it creates a pain point. Because it feels as if the community reacts in a pretty similar way each time Riot tries to make it \"fair.\" Because it appears to always slide more towards the newer players, or the veteran players get very non-visible recognition points (i.e. talks of a ward skin/emote/another icon). And this is why there's these logical arguments about veterans feeling they should be ahead/get more stuff back because it sounds like a secondary deal to us.\n\nNow, I understand every account situation is unique. I also understand that Riot is going at this like a business. Attracting a consistent flow of a new player base.\n\nBut sometimes it feels like Riot, itself, over complicates the problem. A lot of the BE shop issues that I see are veterans feeling like they can't shop enough to get what they want. Prices are intentionally set high to make it exclusive. And I look at some of the content options like so:\n\nMystery icons. With the introduction of emotes/these kinds of icons, it looks like Riot is going for ways to kill some of the memes about when will we get ways to better showcase what champions we love actively in game besides through the mastery system. But there's a RNG factor to the icons where I might not have that BE to spend for it. Also, it's potential a champion I like won't be in the initial pass (i.e. various monstrous champions). Emotes I don't know the full specifics. \n\nI was again pretty disappointed to hear with the Star Guardian event that it's not feasible to make the redone Cho, Skarner, Vel'Koz, Kha'Zix, Rek'sai into a chroma. They would have been wonderful, personally, for the BE shop for me as it hit a niche that I very much wanted. I still hope Riot reconsiders making them work...\n\nI would have liked if say a reward could be something like an increased chance to get skin shards say for your favorite champions (like with the personal shop) coming out of chests/or just a personal shop with a skin or two that could be bought with BE would be nice. I just again feel a bit apathetic that what I spent in RP on rune pages is probably coming back to be....more RNG champion skins. I've disenchanted a ton recently for champions I don't play; I'm also sitting on a good bit of orange essence. I know the personal shop is a certain excitement point with the community---and I'm a bit surprised it's not being taken advantage of for this kind of scenario to make it more personal.\n\nAll-in-all, I don't technically \"need\" anything. It just feels like it's not equal as a focus point. It feels there's this constant incentive to make the new players feel better even at pain points for the old, but when it comes the opposite way---the treatment isn't the same. That community is just told to be understanding of Riot's fiscal policy. Yet, I supported Riot with a good deal of RP purchases; I'm left thinking I should have just been a much shrewder player and been not bamboozled, so to speak, by runes on the whole which were a bit of an IP trap. They did open up a good deal of minor tactical options and some were mandatory---theoretically---on each season. Just feels bad, and it's not feeling any better yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-09-07T05:06:00.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Honestly?

Meaning someone who played since Season 2 gets a better icon vs Season 3 who gets better than Season 4 etc. Those Seasonal rewards have already been handed out. Time thresholds arent fair because for example - someone who played since S2 then took a years off may be getting something better than someone who played Season 3 on everyday. \n\nThe Icon reward should be based on cost. A good icon for 20,000 RR Tickets or some godly one for 50,000. People who have paid more in runes should get the option to unlock a nicer one. Same goes for flair, emotes, etc whatever is released on the store.

And come next season I might not even bother playing.

It isnt going to be an extreme amount of levels, something maybe even like at most 10 level if the person had purchased all the runes and pages and used them all towards exp could be satisfying to a degree when the reset rolls over and a level 40 is around they'd immediately get recognition as a super invested vet.\n\nWith the RR ticket currency already going to be limited based on what was put in past runes, it's not really possible to get a massive head start by banking IP/BE right now anyways. \n\nChamp mastery levels will be already tied to BE as it is now.

I would probably appreciate if e.g. \"veteran\" emotes would play automatically, say like a multikill, or maybe during recall. Speaking of recall, what about recall decals that show the seasons you played in? It's something that would show often during game, and it doesn't need a specific action by the player.\n\nAnother user suggested portrait decoration, that was something I was thinking about too, it could also show in the \"kill\" message (like the little banners you added a few seasons ago that show killing sprees and bounty - not sure if it's clear what I mean).\n\nAs for unique skins for BE store, I see you are experimenting with special chromas for skins (championship ashe, pax sivir), and it's an idea I like (I already liked it when Riot first threw around the idea of different chroma for the victorious skin for different ranked tiers). What if you released rare and/or unique skins, but with a different chroma? That would give players the opportunity to use that rare skins, but it would distinguish them from those who got them when they first came out.

And im only getting a return of 70k ip. i cant get the rare skin that i actually wanted.  i had to drop £70 ~ on riot points and just buy a fuck load of champion shards to make up the terrible conversion rate on ip im getting as a vet to even be able to get urfwick. a skin that was put on sale from MY era.  let me be clear THAT IS JUST FOR ONE ITEM FROM THE VET SHOP.\n\nIn my genuine opinion and i do not want this to seem  malicious - But if the changes go live as they currently are. you are already *fuucking* vet players over so hard who invested into  runes and continued to do so because it was the only ip sink for years, especially people like me who intentionally brought champions with RP early on because runes in s1 were so god damn expensive..

Grouping both issues and looking for one answer is the wrong way to look at it.\n\nOk, granted, but still, it's not about solving the IP banks problem. It's about excluding people who didn't want to buy Runes. If the RR shop contains exclusive loot (such as Urfwick), why someone playing since season 1 with literally hundreds of thousand of IP shouldn't be able to get it, simply because they didn't want to buy all the useless Runes? If they had been warned in advance, they could have dumped that IP into Runes to get Urfwick, but now it's too late.\n\nAdmittedly this second problem is very minor compared to the first one. The first one is a major blocking point against your whole suggestion, the second one is just a detail that can be ironed out.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
