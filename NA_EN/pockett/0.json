I've had this problem now ever since I've downloaded the game where I disconnect mid game and a \"bug splat\" report shows up on my computer. My ping is usually at 110 ms and my wifi connection is usually at 50 down and 100 up (mbps). This is becoming very annoying and I bet some others have this problem as well. I've tried on multiple occasions downloading league of legends again but the problem still arises. If anyone has any suggestions I am more than welcome to listen to your feedback.\r\n Cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T04:07:07.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats aren't related to your connection at all, which might explain why you haven't been able to get it fixed up on your own yet. If League crashes but can't figure out what went wrong you'll see these Bugsplats. Generally, a repair should be able to help, but be sure to go through the rest of this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) in case the repair doesn't help.","replies":[]}]}
