But then suddenly all of my teammembers disconnected. Coincidence? Guess not. Because 3 teammembers of the enemy team disconnected too, at the exact same time. So finally the enemy team finished 2v1 against me. This is not the first time something like this happened. In the end I lost 20 LP for a game we would probably have won.\r\n\r\nThe Point is, I invest/ed a lot (money and time) in this game and I can&#039;t see why the players are punished for those technical problems. I just can&#039;t understand why there is still no concept which is able to detect such faults caused by the client... \r\n\r\nI guess I&#039;m not the only one with this thoughts and i feel kinda mad about this topic.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about that?
