I don&#039;t mean their play, I mean the fact that they are always behind level-wise. And that makes things really annoying to play and watch. In most cases in competitive play, they filter all the experience into the Marksman while the support roams. And I was thinking of a possible way to fix this without breaking the game. The solution that I came up with is a system similar to one that is already implemented into the game. It&#039;s basically the same system set up for the junglers. In order to get any real experience with camps, you have to use a jungle item. Well I was thinking that the junglers benefit from this so much because they are gonna kill jungle camps no matter what, so it&#039;s basically built for them. What if we could do that with supports?** What is the one thing that separates supports from the others.** Everyone places wards, but **supports clear them the most**. So What if we give experience for killing wards. but we make it similar to junglers. You have to buy a support item to get the experience. And it won&#039;t be a ton of experience. Not enough that everyone will start a support item, but enough that maybe they can at least get a 3rd point in their ultimate by the end of the game. Maybe just under a minion&#039;s worth of experience. Maybe it scales with the game time or with minion worth. Maybe it doesn&#039;t scale at all. I think beta will be able to solve that for us. And yes, junglers buy the red trinket and clear wards a lot too, but they get enough experience from jungle camps, so they would have no purpose in buying a support item other than delaying their power spikes. And it would hurt almost everyone else if they tried to buy a support item just for the experience. Maybe it helps is the deciding factor of the support getting the gold and the experience or the ADC coming in and taking the last hit for the gold. It will also be a tool to teach low level players to clear wards. Kind of like a reward system.\r\n\r\n         I understand that it is not a perfect idea and it might be something that will change the meta in super low ELO play as they try to get every advantage that they can. But I know that In high ELO play and even the competitive scene, it won&#039;t be enough of an advantage for them to risk getting it. I had kind of envisioned it to make up for the old mastery that was removed. Maybe we set the experience gained at a set amount that scales off how far behind your team you are. Maybe it is a set amount that scales with time of the game. Maybe it is a flat amount the whole game like the gold from wards is. I don&#039;t think that the experience should be gained from clearing pink wards though, but that is up for beta to tell if it will be worth it. And I also think that it should be a part of every type of support item meaning both the ones that have special actives and the one that builds from Sight Stone.\r\n\r\n         I have linked the Spring Split Finals as a reference to anyone thinking that i am only basing my judgement on low level play. In game 1 the supports are as far as 5 levels behind being level 13 when their team is starting to reach level 18. And in game 5, the only reason that the supports are only 3 levels behind is because the game goes on for almost an hour. (i wouldn&#039;t recommend watching the whole game. just skip through the vods to late game, but you do you.)\r\n\r\n        ** Thank You For Your Time! :)**","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-06-01T04:24:51.451+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey, thanks for the well written thread.

If the support is tethered to a champion higher level than him for 20 minutes that would be:\n\n_**\n#20x60= 1200 EXP (when 1 level behind his teamates) =>  This is a free level 11 worth of experience!\n_**\n\n For the record, the **rough average** champion level for 20 minutes\n(checked my last 20 games without the stomps) \n\non the rift is 12 \n\n - top laners average 13\n -  mid is 12.5\n -  jungler 12\n -  adc 11.5 \n - support 11\n\n Meaning if the support constantly receives 1 exp (he won't as he will catch up in levels) he will be at least around the 11.5 mark on average (same as ADC) even if he roamed. \n\nThis will fix the under leveled supports issue but it might birth a new meta where supports roam near top laners \n(as they are usually the highest level)\nand get access to level 12 Exp on 20 while ADC also get level 12 EXP (solo lane exp due to roams)\n making bot lane higher level for mid game team fighting.\n\nPersonally, I find it interesting but this will also mean that I will have less EXP advantage as a Top laner main so I'm not too sure I want this shift in the meta. (and the coin support item will become even more useless than now....)\n\nThis will change the meta a lot. ADCs get insane advantages in EXP during the midgame team fighting  as they are usually the last to die if the teams play correctly. \n\nMeaning they get the most EXP out of team fights in mid game + almost solo lane EXP on bot + catching side waves in their free time post 20.\n\nThe most worrying factor is that they enter the mid game team fights 1 level higher than before. \n\n I'm not gonna be very happy with the damage they output but this will be a slight indirect nerf to tank meta and a buff to assassins when the fights go correctly.\n\nTo conclude - it is nice to poke around with meta more and higher level ADCs and Supports means more EXP when I assassinate them so hell why not ?\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-06-01T16:23:46.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES, systemic changes to support role please, as well as increased LP gains and better tuned mastery grades would make the whole game so much better by increasing the number of people who are ok with supporting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beldair","date":"2016-06-01T15:07:13.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew I could trust the Riot devs to give us Supports some love.\n\nWe feel it devs, we feel it ❤","replies":[]},{"poster":"coniciua","date":"2016-06-01T11:16:58.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that you put it that way I guess  it's true, Thank you for the response :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-06-01T07:33:27.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realise that mastery did basically nothing?

Utility is very strong early game when the damage focused champions don't have enough damage yet to counteract it.  The supports job is not to carry the game.  It's to enable their carry to get to their \"carry\" build before the other carry.  As such, supports don't need to have a strong late provided that they can be useful early game and make leads by setting up kills.  If by the time their fall off based on the other team dealing too much damage, then they lose the game since they couldn't snowball their lane, plain and simple in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TNHA Baritone","date":"2016-05-31T19:10:00.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How far behind what/who?
