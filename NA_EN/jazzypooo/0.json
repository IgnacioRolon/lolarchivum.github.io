The client works but getting into the loading screen/game does not. I tried re-installing LoL and still nothing. And also tried re-installing DirectX9 and that doesn't work. I've ran out of ideas of what to do, only thing I can think of is a full HDD restore, but I would like to avoid that if possible. Someone please help! This costed me a loss in a ranked D; now I am back down to 0 LP! And I know my whole team probably reported me for leaving the game but It was not my fault and out of my control ;(\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \n\nLeague of Legends.exe - Bad Image\nC:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\d3dx9_39.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error.

Essentially, it is pointing out a problem with either DirectX or Direct 3D that is not allowing League of Legends to run normally.  It could indicate a problem with your Windows Installation or possibly a problem with your graphics card and associated software.\n\nBefore doing a full restore on your harddrive, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!
