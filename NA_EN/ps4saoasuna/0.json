Streamers, the pro&#039;s who are like 18-24 keep creating smurfs accounts like their life&#039;s depend on it.\n2. Game**s aren&#039;t not fun **if your getting carried by a smurf or vice versa.\n3. Loop-sided age differences. Seriously I&#039;m not going to hold the ADC hand and teach this lad how to play safe or properly. We have the practice tool for that or normals.\n\n4. The game developers or Riot&#039;s development team hasn&#039;t made any success in fixing the Smurf problem which is affecting the ranked system and MMR  (I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they Riot employees have made tons of smurfs accounts as well).\n\n5. Not going to lie but we are too busy to sit on our asses all day to play League unlike most kids that play this game. (In conclusion we can&#039;t climb at all why try)?\n\n6. Too much added on stress and we can&#039;t banned all the broken champs or we can&#039;t  keep on baby sitting poorly uneducated kids .\n\n7. This is why LOL espsorts the pro players will soon quit.\n\nNow I'm going to play Assassin Creed Odyssey","replies":[]}
