But I also think that people sometimes slip into the habit of applying real life logic to a situation that doesn&#039;t require it. If I go to the police to report a crime, I may be asked to provide evidence, via a witness. I understand that since Riot is Big Brother in the sense that they see all and know all in regards to chat, asking for reports can be seen as nothing short of unwarranted harassment, but I also think that many people slip into the affirmation mentality that normally applies to real life situations. Sometimes, when you are harassed verbally to the point of becoming irritated, you may forget that one report = x reports. Sometimes it becomes more of a plea for sympathy, rallying behind the masses so as to validate your own suspicions. This is just food for thought. This is not me trying to defend: &quot;Report x for feeding&quot; &quot;report x for trash&quot; or &quot;report x for owning a Teemo skin.&quot; I understand the rules are what they are, and will not change, and no I did not get punished for anything. I just want to share my perspective as it pertains to the issue of some seemingly toxic habitual behaviors.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-17T21:44:11.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only thing a report does is trigger a review.

If you don't have an obvious case of intentional feeding it's not cool to assume it is, so this is definitely not GOOD behavior. I doubt it'll be a problem occasionally if the player is otherwise in good standing, but they really should probably have addressed the player in question politely first and found out if they're just having a bad game.\n\nIt starts to be DEFINITELY unacceptable if the player keeps going on about it though.","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-04-17T23:08:24.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately we can speculate all we want, **but I'm looking to get an answer from Riot Tantram about this** -- as I have been trying to get an answer out of Riot since they made their \"clarifying\" posts a month ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2017-04-20T18:47:16.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's only natural if you are asking for someone's report to give a reason.
