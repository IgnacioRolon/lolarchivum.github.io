I don&#039;t have a lot of skill with this game but because of my defensive playing I&#039;ve seemed to be passable. Is that a good tactic or should I learn how to calculate damage potential with each champ? In other words, my greatest fear is blowing my full combo and falling short by a 100 or so hp and dying. I&#039;m not very good at all of this stuff like animation canceling and fine skill mechanics so would that really put me out of the ranking system? Do I need to watch youtube videos on all this stuff, and if so, which champion should I thoroughly learn that seems pretty balanced from mid to late game (since I hate early game.) I like cc and teamfight potential but also prefer to be somewhat capable of soloing if my team doesn&#039;t know what a map is or something similar :)","replies":[]}
