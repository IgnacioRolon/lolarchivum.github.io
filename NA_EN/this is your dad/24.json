Now I get that some unique pieces look ugly, but rather than just slapping exactly what you want together through crafting, I&#039;d rather find something amazing that I can&#039;t craft. Oh my, I found some crafting recipe, just gotta go mine for ore now! \r\n\r\nBleh, I know my opinion isn&#039;t shared by many, but I much prefer discovering real secrets and gamechanging gear, not &quot;Absorb 5 health&quot; Mace of Molag Bal or whatever with my &quot;Absorb 500 health, stamina and magicka&quot; dagger I forged 4 hours ago.","replies":[]}
