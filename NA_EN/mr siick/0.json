It looks like you had 2 losses in your series which ended in losing the series and taking you down to 15 LP.  Since then, though, I see that you're back in a series!  Good luck and let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-05-17T13:14:41.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you dodge in Champ Select?","replies":[]}]}
