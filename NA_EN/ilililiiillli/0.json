But that is not all. The other day, I was in champ select and the client crashed, causing me to lose 3 lp and enjoy the wait of a 5 minute leaverbuster. I'm not one to complain about anything, not even about the trolls or patch changes that I disagree with, but it's starting to get old when I lose lp (and even series in some extreme cases), when I experience bullshit issues like this.{{item:3070}} Is anyone else experiencing this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2016-05-09T23:24:39.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might not be helpful, but if you're playing on Wireless, don't.\n\nMy wireless connection is great but this game cannot handle Wireless apparently... I get ping spikes from 50-1200 when playing LoL on any Wireless network (tried 4 different networks and 2 different computers, One with a way better network card and same result). Makes it entirely unplayable on Wireless for me. I have consistent 20-40 ms ping on Wired connections, but Wireless is just impossible to deal with.\n\nI am certain the game's programming for 'recovering' from lag spikes is very buggy. Cause whenever I have a lag spike on Wireless it takes way longer than it should to 'return' the game state to normal, meaning usually a guaranteed death depending on when it happened. In some super rare cases, the entire game has frozen from a huge lag spike (over 3s ) to the point where nothing will happen in the game at all until I restart the game. Again, this only happens on Wireless and never on Wired, so it's not too big of a problem, but still kind of annoying that it is impossible for me to play this on wireless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-09T22:26:51.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Deep Terror Nami's steps are fairly solid, are you still consistently experiencing these issues?
