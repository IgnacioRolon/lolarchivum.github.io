I know it isn't my ping because in game it is always at a 61. Pingtest.com says it is a 23 ping and a jitter of 13. And it has only really occured during this patch in the 7 years I have been playing, and I literally can't think of the last time it did. I have restarted my router 4 times, even called my internet provider to restart my router and it still happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-25T16:50:43.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Input delays like this can be due to a network issue or packet loss.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for games this is happening in, and get an overview of what's going wrong.  The results will also provide some resolution steps specific to your issue.  That should help get you fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
