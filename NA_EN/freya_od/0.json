Like blown right up from 100-0. Anyways, continuing on, after i died i all-chatted, \"JUST DIE WOULD YOU\"\r\nfollowing this game a member of my team told me i was way too toxic. because that ^^^^ really bothered them. Like, seriously? It's a joke. because he got away. and i died. \r\n\r\nIt's on online, world-wide (area-specific) MOBA. and people think THAT is toxic? I've played a few games lately with people who call my teammates pieces of shit, %%%%%%s, and everything else in the book, but I'm apparently too toxic, and it's just blasphemous that I'm a girl who could rage that much. \r\n\r\n............................................................................\r\n\r\nI'm so at a loss for words. The sad thing is, this isn't the first time this has happened. I don't cuss at people, i don't call them names, i don't tell them where they can put their genitals, heh, but people throw around the word toxic and always report you for nothing. It's like people really don't know what toxic is, like at all.\r\n\r\nand the even SADDER part is, i've actually received these \"automated punishments\" in the past because the system just adds up number of reports and slaps punishments on you while no one is actually reviewing them. Why even have a chat system  if you can't say anything at all without the community flipping the fuck out? It's getting really old.","replies":[{"poster":"ExcaIibur Morgan","date":"2015-08-06T22:04:41.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I just avoid talking.

Rare to come across, but they're around. You could also drag your real life friends into this craphole of a community. :D I could be your friend but I'm low-elo...you could vent to me though! Or dick around.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Knalxz","date":"2015-08-07T08:42:26.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very few people are cool in this game. I remember I was playing Talon once and i died killing the enemy Graves and I typed, \"Worth\" into all chat.

I think its better to mute the jerks and move along. \n\nI'd wager your chances of playing well double when you mute jerks.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RlCARDO MlLOS","date":"2015-08-07T03:18:29.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Relax ........................","replies":[]}]}
