My main account is gold 3, I made this smurf account a few days ago out of sheer boredom, hence this being level 7. Anyways, to my point.\r\n\r\n**1) yall really need to bring back the tribunal.** I am a formerly permabanned person myself, making this smurf I&#039;m posting on my third account. My first account got permabanned over a year ago, I deserved it tbh. Now I&#039;m running a fully reformed second account and now this smurf. I don&#039;t encounter much troubles these days as I play on stream, play with music, and talk to duo&#039;s in chat to decrease my chat toxicity and focus less on other people in the game. Whoo! But as a reformed person myself who has to keep myself in line, this automated system is way too whacky. my points being:\r\n                                           \r\n                                          * Yall still don&#039;t record pre and post game chat to be included in reports. You can&#039;t tell me they are when they&#039;re never included in chat logs, and no one is ever banned from not talking in game, and just talking post game. As I had a teammate who would call us N***ers in pre and post game chat, act like an angel in game while intentionally feeding, and slips right through the system. So this leads to people being mislead by false information and having their report count lowered for nothing.\r\n                                           * I was given a chat restriction back before the season started sometime in december, a measly 10 game chat restriction, and I was outraged. As I did not curse, I didn&#039;t call people names, or put them down. I decided instead of letting a premade gang up on me, I would just retaliate with laughter and indifferent sarcasm. I didn&#039;t rage at anyone, and I was told my behavior was antagonizing to my teammates and had a rioter force close my ticket in a rude manner saying she was done debating this with me after all I did was ask her to tell me what parts of my chat logs were &quot;berating my teammates&quot; and she ignored me and got a snobby attitude (Moonsugar from riot). \r\n\r\n                                            * Meanwhile, I never get report feedbacks. Ever. Just on the small hand fulls of games I&#039;ve played on this account (less than 15) I got matched up with a poppy/yasuo duo in bots while trying to reach level 4 or 5 who literally told a roaming olaf to fucking kill himself, he&#039;s a piece of shit and no one wants him here, cussing and making a scene all game where the yasuo also was cussing and acting a fool, constantly spamming pings so hard to anyone who dared go near his duo lane that I had to mute my pings to get some peace and quiet........0 report feedback. I encounter a high level of toxicity all the time and have only ever received a feedback report twice in the entire time it&#039;s been up. It&#039;s extremely discouraging and makes you believe the system doesn&#039;t work.\r\n\r\n                                            * That being said, riot doesn&#039;t want it to work properly. They don&#039;t give a flying fuck about toxicity because they could seriously very easily handle these problems, and they choose to ignore it and let this shitty automated system take its place. People have been asking for the tribunal to come back for how long now? a year and a half? two years? It was a perfect and very amusing system and riot just...doesn&#039;t care. Yet throwing out false promises that it&#039;ll be &quot;back up and running&quot;. Enough with your lies. And if you don&#039;t want to handle toxicity so much, why don&#039;t you let people disable their own chat or make perma-muting a thing? It literally doesn&#039;t hurt anyone, and it&#039;s an option for the people with more anger problems to keep playing and feel like they&#039;ve been worked with in a helpful manner than riot just stealing their fucking account. Yall don&#039;t just to be fucking dicks. It&#039;s really sad.\r\n\r\n**2) The game just. isn&#039;t. fun.** It&#039;s cancerous. Instead of doing some actual balancing work, you just over buff and gutt; over buff and gutt; and I&#039;m so sick of this. People constantly make requests (like for cloud drake to give 10 flat movement speed per dragon in and out of combat) and you just continually ignore what people ask and think on the PBE and just do whatever the fuck you want anyways. It&#039;s disgusting. It&#039;s literally disgusting. Why even pretend like you care then? Like the high elo automatically fill after like 4 minutes or whatever, did you at least suck your dedicated playerbase&#039;s c**k before you fucked them up the ass with no lube? Pat yourselves on the back for the overwhelming smurfs in diamond and plat, just making EVERYONE hating ranked all together. Good job, you really know how to screw yourself.\r\n\r\n**3) Riot, your priorities are way off, and your company disgusts me.** When we hit a time where game play is falling, playerbase voices being heard is falling, general any shits given about the quality of your game has fallen off the map, but yall pumping out new 1350+ skins so often that are more impressive than these dumb new champions yall releasing every now and then. I honestly stop paying for skins past 970, and since 1350 is the new base/normal costs for skins, guess I have no reason to buy RP anymore. Yall focus wayyyy too much on making money than you do on squaring off the actual quality of your game everyone is dropping like flies. If you wanted to make money all the time, why not just let people pay for the game and pump out quality content rather than making it free to play but rolling your golems downhill and gathering no rust.......idk, I just wanted to throw that in there, but you catch my drift.\r\n\r\n\r\n_TL;DR_ Riot, you suck. You&#039;ve sucked ass for a while now, and I can&#039;t wait to watch the day this game really shambles because I will get a sick satisfaction out of knowing that you greedy fucks know you fucked up, but will be so greedy, you&#039;ll never turn it back around. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gargamel Bot","date":"2016-06-28T00:49:03.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"freya od","date":"2016-06-28T00:50:46.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gargamel Bot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eTIXY0t2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-28T00:49:03.674+0000)\n>\n> Crazy how you have been using it on the boards since 11 months ago.
