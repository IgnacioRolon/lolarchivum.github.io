It stays close to the original Fiddlesticks and looks pretty terrifying. I don't even think Nocturne could top him with the uncanny valley of horror.\n\nI also love the way that he twitches, it's pretty unsettling. Which is why I like it!\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hx7sJaxOxBA/Xac_T8qjJcI/AAAAAAABZ2k/lTmkctyWUDcg5spAddEb937w2c3IMO90ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/OIh9Pe5.gif\n\nI just have a few questions:\n\nWhy make Fiddlesticks semi-mechanical instead of wooden? Is there a reason to stray away from the wooden structure? Why the saw-blade on his shoulder? Does his elongated claw-arm play any part of his gameplay kit? Same thing goes for his scythe? Why keep the point-and-click status?\n\nWhat dance will he have knowing he has that kind of arm dragging behind him? How will the arm affect his skins? Has the champion theme been made yet? If not, may I recommend Sons of Perdition (they make death country music and they composed the music for the short: Backwater Gospel)?\n\nThere's a lot I wanna ask, but I feel that you don't want to answer everything just yet. All I can say is keep up the good work! This is looking pretty gnarly!","replies":[{"poster":"NelsieLisnen","date":"2019-10-16T20:17:48.552+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the whole mechanical thing, well the most obvious answer is \"to make him look more edgy and cool\".

There are champs like Galio/Sylas/Kassadin/Ekko who are essentially mage/x hybrids, and itemize like mages. The whole melee thing has to do more with visual cohesion. If a character has a huge ass scythe then you expect them to use it to slash people up. Imagine Aatrox coming in with that sword and only using his fists instead. Although if they have to make him ranged, they could make it so his AAs produce slashing projectiles.","replies":[{"poster":"nachocheeseeeee","date":"2019-10-19T16:45:48.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But all those you mentioned have hybrid roles. Ekko and Kassadin are assassins, Galio can be a tank, Sylas is a skirmisher/diver. When we are talking about pure mage, I don't think there is a single champion that is melee. Mages are supposed to be immobile, deal ap damage, offer some cc/utility, have some aoe ability, be heavily dependent on ability than auto (Azir may be an exception, but he has a secondary marksman tag) and not have tank stats (other than Vladimir), so in the laning phase, in order to be able to cs and not be completely overpowered by assassins, they must have the range advantage over them to poke them. Assassins on the other hand can close the gap from being poked, and deal burst damage that will devastate any squishy.

If you design a game on that limiting a system, where every champion is allowed to have a very narrow selection of traits according to their class then you end up with few directions you can push your champs towards.
