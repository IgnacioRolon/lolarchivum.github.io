I am what Mankind fears.\"\n\nA being that's more than just urban myth, Fiddlesticks is a monstrous magical aberration brought to life ages ago after his master vanished without a trace. Now filled with his master's malice and hatred, he roams across Valoran looking for his master while bringing fear upon anyone that comes across the walking hay-man.\n\n**LORE:**\n\nRuneterra is filled with tales of the strange and terrific, passed on throughout generations as a way to tell a story to lull children to sleep, or as a cautionary tale to heed a dire warning or to scare the troublesome. Urban myths and legends has grown and spread all across Valoran, influencing cultures of many rising nations. However there is one urban myth that has changed many denizen’s perspective on how they see crows and scarecrows alike forever. This is the Legend of Fiddlesticks, the Harbinger of Doom.\n\nFiddlesticks was once an ordinary scarecrow created by a young sorceress named Salina Kuttner, a powerful and feared student within Azathon Academy, Haïta of the Hollow Lands, to protect her father’s crops from invading crows that has plagued their farm for years. She has considered Fiddlesticks as her sole friend as every day from the Azathon Academy, she'll tell him about her day as if he was alive and listening, providing comfort for her.\n\nAs the years went by, Salina stopped by her old farm and decides to bring Fiddlesticks to life, using a reanimation spell she tore out of one of the ancient tomes of the Grey Warlock. Reason being is that her power grew too dangerous as her unstable emotions and greed for forbidden knowledge became uncontrollable and was later expelled for the safety of the academy's students and staff. Feeling betrayed, Salina sought bloody retribution against the city of Haïta and bring doom to everyone who dare oppose her blackened might. Following the instructions from the torn page, she tied a lantern containing essential ingredients around his wooden waist and then chanted the dark incantation, but as she finished the spell, it didn’t work. Frustrated from the spell’s failure, she abandoned Fiddlesticks and vanished into the horizon of the petrified wastelands.\n\nYears went by as the scarecrow stood by the decaying Kuttner farm, the lantern around his waist finally started to give an eerie glow. Fiddlesticks’ eyes has started glowing as the essence from the spell has finally ignited. All of Salina’s inner rage, hatred, pain, malice, and her tender moments with the scarecrow flow through his wooden limbs, unleashing a ear-piercing wail - Fiddlesticks is alive.\n\nWithout the mentoring of his master, the risen scarecrow lifted his scythe and ventured out into the wastes. The Hollow Lands is as desolate as what his master described, outside the dead farm lies a vast petrified desert far from civilization. As he traced her fading steps through the wretched barrens, a lone crow perched upon his shoulder. He doesn’t know why nor does he care, but as he continues to wander, more joined him and later created a massive murder of crows. The longer the flock accompanied the walking scarecrow, the more these birds are enchanted by Fiddlesticks’ mysterious dark magic. Then, a stranger came.\n\nA pariah from the outskirts of town found him accompanied by a flock big enough to engulf the entire sky as he was running from his home. Fiddlesticks locked his haunting eyes on the lowly human, giving him a sense of fear. Seeing the man tremble in dread grew a certain satisfaction within Fiddlesticks and, without hesitation, he struck him down with his wicked scythe in a break-fast speed. With the taste of death on his fingertips, Fiddlesticks kept on killing with a malevolent grin on his sack-head face.\n\nWhatever dark magic Salina has brought upon Fiddlesticks, it has transformed the scarecrow into an embodiment of fear, spreading terror across Valoran. The dark magic that has empowered him has now flown into his trusty scythe and his feathered friends, enabling to silence and siphon the life out of anybody brave and foolish to go near. His discovery in bringing terror upon the mortals has given him much joy, filling him with glee from watching them scream and flee in terror. Just the mere presence of the hay-man has given terrible chills down spines of many.\n\nFiddlesticks, once a lifeless scarecrow, has found a dark purpose: bringing fear upon Runeterra and slay anyone he sees fit. Despite his morbid fascination in instilling fear upon the innocent, Fiddlesticks is still determined to find the whereabouts of his master, longing for her guidance and acceptance. No matter how many souls he has reaped, nothing will stand in his way in searching for his creator. In the meantime, not a force in the world can stop him from slaying anything in his path.\n\nAs Fiddlesticks ventured on, his tale of bloodshed has become a popular, but grim urban legend in some parts of Valoran. Rumor has it that he can see through the eyes of crows and ravens, watching every move and listening to every conversation unfold. They say that the only way to tell the difference between crows and Fiddlesticks' crow familiars are the eyes; no crow would naturally have a sinister, glowing green eyes that are able to distill an uncomfortable silence.\n\nPeople have told stories of their encounters with the malignant scarecrow and share many drawings on his depiction. His presence around folklore had people believe that having a scarecrow around will attract crows and possibly Fiddlesticks himself. Even a single crow showing up in public will signal impending doom, fearing that if more come, so will Fiddlesticks. People also believed that Fiddlesticks can disguise himself as any old scarecrow to ambush any poor unfortunate soul.\n\nAs this legend unfurls, nations such as Noxus, the Hollow Lands, and even some parts of Shurima, forbid the usage and crafting of scarecrows. Even if banning scarecrows would get some of its denizens fall back to sleep, there’s no denying that Fiddlesticks will come whenever he pleases. Because of his search for his master, he will follow her faded footsteps and visit any place that he believes that she might have stopped by; he could be heading to cities of Noxus, Demacia, or even Shurima. There might be a chance that he might be right outside your house.\n\nJust remember… if you see a crow with green eyes, he's near. He's watching. He's coming.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Alias(es)**: The Harbinger of Doom, The Cursed Hay Man\n**Gender**: Sexless (considered Male)\n**Race**: Scarecrow (Magical Construct)\n**Birthplace**: The Hollow Lands\n**Residence**: Unknown\n**Faction**: The Hollow Lands (Semi-Independent)\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Abilities:**\n\n_\"New\" Passive_: **Harbinger's Presence**\n\n\n_Innate_: Fiddlesticks will go into a Scarecrow stance if idled after 5 seconds. Once he becomes a scarecrow, he'll remain untargetable until he moves again or uses an ability. Once he moves (only if he moves), he'll gain a short burst of movement speed for 1.5 seconds. CC effects like knock-ups and knock-backs will force Fiddlesticks out of it.\n\n_Dread_: Every time Fiddlesticks attacks an enemy (jungle monster or champion), basic or ability, it will fill them with **_Dread_**. If the enemy reaches five stacks, they will be instantly **terrified** for 1.5 seconds.\n\nEach stack of _Dread_ upon an enemy will give Fiddlesticks a small piece of movement speed for 0.75 seconds.\n\n2% for 1 stack of _Dread_.\n4% for 2 stacks of _Dread_.\n6% for 3 stacks of _Dread_.\n8% for 4 stacks of _Dread_.\n\nOnce the victim is terrified from its 5th stack of _Dread_, Fiddlesticks feasts on their fear and gains a 10 / 12 / 14 / 16% burst of movement speed and attack speed for 2 seconds.\n\n_Dread_ lasts for 8 seconds, but if stacked the counter will reset back to 8.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Shadowkirby14,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=LJZi7ZU1,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-03-22T23:38:21.666+0000)\n>\n> Each ability attack stacks Dread at a time. Crowstorm can stack Dread on multiple enemies, but again, one stack for each spell/autoattack. It works well when once you ult (which adds a stack), you can Q, W, E, and auto-attack your target to add in additional stacks.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Shadowkirby14,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=LJZi7ZU1,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-23T03:14:36.634+0000)\n>\n> It'll be like Ekko's, the stacks won't last forever, but the timer resets if it stacks.\n\n_\"New\" Q_: **Reaping Whirlwind**\n\nRANGE: 750\nCOST: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110\nCOOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8\n\nFiddlesticks will swing his scythe and unleash a long range cone of burning wychfire, similar to the one in Twist of Fate cinematic. The opponent is slowed for 1.5 seconds when hit.\n\nIf Reaping Whirlwind hits the enemy champion and adds the last stack of **Dread**, the target will receive 20% more magic damage while stunned for 1.25 seconds. \nhttp://orig06.deviantart.net/681b/f/2013/320/0/3/another_fiddlesticks_epic_gif__3_by_raycorethecrawler-d6ufdi2.gif\n\n_\"New and Improved\" W_: **Wychfire Blast/Drain**\n\nRANGE: 650 (Cast Range) / 750 (Tether Range)\nCOST: 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 / 120\nMANA COOLDOWN: 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6\n\nFiddlesticks will spit out a ball of wychfire on a targeted area, engulfing the enemy and dealing magic damage every 0.25 seconds within the 3 second duration.  If you press W again, Fiddlesticks will suck the burning wychfire from the enemy back into him, inflicting pain and terror while extracting their life essence and restoring 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20% of his missing health.\n\nIf two enemy champions are hit by Wychfire Blast, Fiddlesticks can cast Drain on both of them simultaneously, recovering his missing health twice as fast.\n\nDuring **Drain**, _Dread_ will stack on an enemy champion every 2 seconds when tethered.\n\n_\"New\" E:_ **Pecking Order**\n\nRANGE: 630\nCOST: 40 / 45 / 55 / 60 / 70\nCOOLDOWN: 8 / 7.5 / 7 / 6.5 / 6\n\n**Passive:** _Counting Crows_: Three small crows will hover over Fiddlesticks. Every time Fiddlesticks plants a ward, one of the crows will perch upon the ward, giving it extra vision.\n\nIf an enemy champion comes within the ward's vision radius, the crow will scare them **stiff** with fear for 1.5 seconds. Once the nested ward is destroyed, the crow will fly back to Fiddlesticks, providing vision as it flies back to him, similar to Ashe's Hawkshot but with smaller vision radius. Once all 3 nested wards are destroyed, this passive will go into a 30 second cooldown.\n\nThe downside is that once the crow is done scaring, the nested ward will remain revealed until it's destroyed.\n\nTrinkets like {{item:3341}} {{item:3364}} {{item:3363}} will force the crow to retreat back to Fiddlesticks, saving yourself from being jumpscared and restoring the ward back to normal, stealth and all. Teleporting {{summoner:12}} to a nested ward will also force the crow to fly back to Fiddlesticks.\n\n**Active:**\nFiddlesticks will regurgitate a swarm of crows in a target direction and deal magic damage for 3.5 seconds. Upon hit, the target will be _silenced_. If the target dies, the flock of crows will split and transfer to two of the closest things they see and reset the duration. This works well in the jungle, and especially well against jungle monsters like Raptors, Wolves, and Krugs.\n\nWith Counting Crows, each returning crow will reduce Pecking Order's cooldown by 2%.\n\n_R_: **Murder Storm**\n\n**_Remain the same_**, however any champion within its radius will be instantly _feared_. Any champion that has **_at least_** a stack of _Dread_ will be feared 1.5 seconds longer.\n\nWhen casting **Murder Storm**, the targeted place will have a few crows circling around before activating. *Murder Storm** can now be **cancelled** early, reducing the ultimate's cooldown by 50%.\n\nWhen Fiddlesticks becomes a scarecrow, he can instantly cast **Murder Storm** without channeling.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Voiceover:**\n\nChampion Select:\n\n\"Those who have nothing to fear have yet felt the crows.\"\n\nUpon Starting a Game:\n\n\"More to fight, more to feast.\"\n\"One for sorrow,\nTwo for joy,\nThree for a girl,\nFour for a boy.\"\n\"Five for silver,\nSix for gold,\nSeven for a secret never to be told.\"\n\"Come, my friends.

Eye-like drones for his E and Passive.\n\n* _Undertaker Fiddlesticks_:\n\nBased on the [Undertaker from Backwater Gospel](http://www.faaf.tv/img/film/197/bc1b4cd79d8f76882d0fcccdcd73d458k.jpg). Has a unique recall whenever he's nearby a dead champion (ally or enemy).\n\n**MISC**:\n\n* If Fiddlesticks, Shaco, and Nocturne are on the same team, they gain a hidden buff called **The Terror Trio**. This buff will increase their **flee** duration for an extra 2 seconds (this empowers Fiddlesticks' Harbinger's Presence, Shaco's Jack In The Box, and Nocturne's Unspeakable Horror). If they kill an enemy while nearby each other, they all gain an extra 2% movement speed for 1.25 seconds.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Rivals:**\n{{champion:50}}\n\n**Enemies:**\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:26}} \n________________________\n\n**Trivia**\n\n_Development_:\n\n* This concept was made from pieces of my previous posts and lore threads across the board. I've eventually compiled all of them into one major thread.\n* I've shared this concept with RiotWrekt on Twitter and gave me his [**critique**](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sohp2p) on the rework concept. After that, I took his word and edited some of the said abilities to meet it standards.\n\n_Lore_:\n\n* The Hollow Lands was formerly called The Voodoo Lands. I've decided to change the name since voodoo is considered a real-world religion. I chose The Hollow Lands because it fits thematically on what it suppose to be: a cursed petrified wasteland. I've made a [**thread**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/2cbNdi4k-will-there-be-another-voodoo-land-champion-like-annie) about this.\n\n_General_:\n\n* Since the release of the newly updated Dread passive, I've been disappointed by how lackluster it is. I've decided to implement it into Harbinger's Presence by having Fiddlesticks increase speed whenever he's near a stacked enemy champion, appropriately giving the sense of dread for the enemy team.\n* Harbinger's Presence's second Active, Counting Crows, is the name of an [actual band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_Crows).\n* The name for his new Q ability, **Reaping Whirlwind**, is a play on an idiom \"Reap the Whirlwind,\" which means _\"to have serious problems because you did something stupid in the past.\"_\n* Fiddlesticks is, by far, the only champion that can use wards for gameplay.\n* Before the lore retcon, {{champion:9}} {{champion:56}} and {{champion:35}} were all friends in the Institute of War. Although their friendship are no longer canon, they're still together in-game. They were called the Terror Trio by the community and Fiddlesticks have special interactions for Shaco and Nocturne respectively.\n\n_Quotes_:\n\n* The quote in Fiddlesticks' new champion select, \"Those who have nothing to fear have not yet felt the crows.\" is a reference to one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's opening statements in his first inaugural address, \"...we have nothing to fear but fear itself\".\n* Some of the starting game quotes are from the British nursery rhyme, _One for Sorrow_.\n* \"This valley will flood with your mortal blood\" is based on \"This valley will flood with your hypocrite blood\" from the song [\"Blood in the Valley\" by Sons of Perdition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay8SxiZ_wtk).\n* \"This maze is like... a maize.\" is based on the [quote](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/422212533786444667/) said by Andy Dwyer in Parks &amp; Recreation.\n* Most of Risen Fiddlesticks' quotes are references from an episode of [Courage the Cowardly Dog, King Ramses' Curse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pWC-4dx3Q0).\n* \"Fly, my pretties! Fly!\" was based on a famous misinterpretation on the quote said by the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz.\n* \"Time to send shivers down your spine!\" is based on the lyric of Andrew Gold's Spooky Scary Skeleton.\n* \"What's up, guys!!\" was based on a quote from [**Hyun's Stick Figure Spotlight 4 - Final Eclipse**](https://youtu.be/CMJo3vaijx4?t=79).\n* \"Balloons! Balloons everywhere!\" is based on a Toy Story internet meme.\n* \"Brace yourself! Winter has come!\" is reference to Sean Bean's quote from Game of Thrones. {{champion:9}} shares this quote with **Freljord Taliyah**.\n* \"Killing in a Winter Wonderland!\" is a play on _Walking in a Winter Wonderland_.\n* \"SNOWSTORM!\" is based on [Lord Marrowgar's quote \"BONESTORM\" in World of Warcraft.](https://youtu.be/VowrR8zcmMY?t=39)\n* \"Dududududu dudududu du dududududu!!\" is an onomatopoeic form of the song Sandstorm by Darude. The song was played in this [LoL gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT5BC2f8MQg), in which it became popular.\n* \"The only thing you have to fear is... me!\" is another reference to Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous quote.\n* \"Have you seen my crows, little child?\" is reminiscent to {{champion:1}}'s quote.\n*  {{champion:9}} taunt towards {{champion:31}} because he's considered the Terror of the Void while Fiddlesticks inflicts terror and is, possibly, Terror incarnate.\n* One of Fiddlesticks' taunts towards {{champion:29}} refers to **murophobia**, which is a fear of mice and rats.\n* Fiddlesticks' taunt towards {{champion:17}} is a direct reference from Hunson Abadeer's encounter with Gunter from Adventure Time, joking on how the league community refers Teemo as an evil monster or worse, Satan.\n* \"These would look great on my feet... if I have any.\" is based on a Fairly Odd Parents internet meme.\n* \"Guinsoo, you're my new best friend!\" is a nod to Fiddlesticks' creator, Guinsoo.\n* \"The boys are back in town!\" is a song by Thin Lizzy.\n* \"Clones are a cheap tactic to make weak assassins stronger\" is a reference to Jasper's quote during the episode, Jailbreak, in Steven Universe.\n* \"Oh, you think darkness is your ally?\" and \"The shadows have betrayed you, because they belong to me!\" are direct quotes from Bane in Dark Knight Rises.\n* \"Even the crows know what it's like to stare into the abyss.\" refers to Nietzsche's quote, \"If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you\".\n* \"Now you know my pain!\" pokes fun at {{champion:35}}'s Jack-In-The-Box. Fiddlesticks' new passive works similar to Shaco's W, but instead it stuns than fears.\n* \"Is this the real Shaco or a clone?\" pokes fun at {{champion:35}} 's Ultimate, Hallucinate, as the passive also works on his clone.\n* \"Do I look inanimate to you, punk?!\" is a reference to a quote by Audrey 2 in _Little Shop of Horrors_, and is a retort to her taunt.\n* \"My crows will peck them to pieces\" is a reference to the title of Stefan Żeromski's 1895 novel, _Rozdzióbią nas kruki, wrony_, which translates to _Ravens and Crows Will Peck Us to Pieces_. {{champion:9}} shares this quote with {{champion:50}}'s Polish selection quote.\n* \"I don't always walk at midnight\" is a reference to one of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps books, \"The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight.\"\n* \"What's your favorite scary movie?\" is a direct quote of Ghostface from Wes Craven's Scream. Ghostface is also a character Roger L. Jackson voiced.","replies":[{"poster":"angery pout","date":"2016-03-23T01:04:15.415+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that concerns me is the durations of the CC, especially since there are so many ways to stack it up in his kit.

Just a few questions. \n\nThe passive counting crows, does it STUN the enemy or does it TERRIFY them? \nWould there be a windup on the passive? If not I could see some clutch plays where a supportlesticks saves his ADC who is caught out by planting a ward right on them with a crow, which applies CC to the enemies on them. It would be cool if it applied a stack of dread on them as well. Maybe reduce the CC to one second instead of two, and then double the duration if it gets to apply the last stack. We would also have to have it so that if a champ gets feared with the passive that they can't get a stack of dread applied to them for like...5 or 7 seconds maybe. \n\nI think his Q should have him throw his scythe (or a glowy green magic scythe). He would throw it in the same way he throws his scythe at TF in the Twist of Fate trailer. On another note this new Q means that surprise party fiddlesticks is not as fun as it used to :(\n\nThis is something that Fiddlesticks has been needing for a long time though...a way to cancel his ult. Right now the only way to cancel his channel as the player is to use flash...which is BS. That means that if you start channeling your ult for an epic gank and all of a sudden the shit hits the fan and your laner gets nuked you HAVE to go in cause you can't stop yourself. You should be able to cancel this channel. NO this does NOT mean that Fiddlesticks would get a CD refund for not using his ult. I'm just saying that it' s really silly to try to ult as him and either completely miss or go in at the wrong time and die. \n\nAlso are we keeping the \"flee\" concept on Fiddlesticks? Few of you may know this, but fiddlesticks actually doesn't have a fear/terrify ability. Fear/terrify makes the enemy champion run in random directions, however Fiddlesticks has \"Flee\" which means that they enemy runs in the EXACT opposite direction as Fiddlesticks through out the duration of the fear. I was wondering if we are keeping that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZGM Permabanned","date":"2016-03-24T03:10:50.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you draw that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkyBlade79","date":"2016-03-24T02:57:44.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the taunts, but I think that the kit has a bit too much CC.
