A features where summoners can check their server status, the strength of their internet connection and pings before they play. Think about it, all this time summoners just find the match without knowing the pings status of their connection, and when the game start, they got rekt just because of one their teammate got lagging or dced. \r\n\r\nThis features will be awesomely a great help to the summoners and the team ofc. well, im not comparing League any other games like Dota 2 or what, but, yea, they got the features. And it really helps the players that play from outside of the region to play in NA, EUW and etc based server. \r\n\r\nI hope riot team consider to add this features in league client. Lets together improve and make League better than any other games :)\r\n\r\nhantoo1","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-26T00:23:29.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're leaving a feature suggestion for the New Client, I recommend you repost this to our [**Client Discussion Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion).
