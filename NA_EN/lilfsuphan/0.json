Blitzbot is not a specialist, but an automated smart tool...thing.  There should be a button that says request a human, which will send your ticket to our tech team.  They will be your best bet in helping to figure this out, but I also recommend downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to obtain some logs.  \n\nAttach those logs to your ticket, and our tech team will respond back as soon as they can.\n\nI know you're eager to get this resolved, and we really want to help.  Just be really wary about spamming threads or tickets, because it can only cause confusion and delay.

You can always reply to a ticket that's Solved until it's set to Closed.  I fielded your ticket for you just in case manually, so it's in queue for our tech team to take a look!  There should be an option in the ticket center to attach your file to the ticket.

Sometimes your OS doesn't recognize certain programs as being safe and you need to tell it those files are okay.
