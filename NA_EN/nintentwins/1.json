My advice is to just keep practicing until you have all his best uses and patterns down. I'v played Yorick so dang much I feel me and the champ have become one, though lack of play with him could very well make me lose that status with the guy. Practice is whats best, for any champion. But dun try em in ranked until you are very confident in your abilities with that champion. One bit of advice. If your team has a fed AD user, ult that person more often, as then the ghoul you spawn will have more AD to fight with. Ult someone who is at like 30-55% hp, that way you can allow the ghoul to attack, but the ally whom has been ulted will still die soon enough to get the revive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-02-04T23:39:18.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have yet to lose top lane against yorick with my main {{champion:421}}.

I can now cs with him better than most other champs I play, I know when to poke and when to fully engage in lane, I know when to ult in which situations and who to ult in the first place, I always build situationally with em, and overall I feel much more  one to one or \"we are as one\" sort of a sense with me and Yorick than I do with any other champ in the game. Still though, I honestly suck at this game, so I do poorly alot of the time. xD But whenever I win lane, things go really well, and whenever I get fed, then I become an unstoppable machine, until I get cocky and towerdive anyway. xD\n\n\n\nThis is amazing, two Yorick fans brought together by chance.
