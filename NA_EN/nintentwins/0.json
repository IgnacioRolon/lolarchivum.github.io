I would like to talk about it.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":72,"down_votes":15,"body":"I was simply playing a game of league of legends. Playing as udyr to practice for when I can have the hilarity that is the definitely not udyr skin. Everything seemed ok. Our mid, whom was Zed, was having an argument with the enemy mid, Anivia. I didn&#039;t think too much of it, until something happened. The enemy Anivia tried to insult our Zed by calling him autistic. Even though she wasn&#039;t talking to me at all, I felt greatly offended. As I, myself, am autistic. Then Zed responded by calling her retard, to which again, I am offended. Then the enemy blitz gets into the argument himself, and combined with the fact our support Anivia literally admitted to trolling. (She was taking cs from the adc, and was trying to build IE after she refused to get sightstone.) It all and all made me feel very awful, and sad. It was 44 minutes of sheer agony. I have autism, it is a disorder I&#039;v been through my whole life. But it&#039;s not just a stereotype saying I&#039;m stupid or something like that. I can be really smart, especially in school. But I can&#039;t socialize with others, and I have trouble communicating to people, even in game. Autism affects everyone differently, it should NOT be used as an insult. Being a retard and being autistic are also two different things, neither should be used as an insult. And if they are, it should not be taken lightly. League is still one of my favorite games of all time, I will never stop playing it. But I can&#039;t deny the game has alot of toxic people. Very rarely do they draw the line with me. And using autism and retard as an insult, is where the line is crossed. People, everywhere. Please don&#039;t use those two things as insults. Real people suffer from them, but it&#039;s not a pure stereotype as it affects each person differently. I just felt offended is all, and I wanted to talk about it. I apologize if my rant offends anyone, that is not my intention. For all that took the time to read this wall of text, bravo. Thank you for reading. This is my first discussion post on the boards so if I made any mistakes let me know, I&#039;m new to using the boards and website for communication rather than the actual game. Been playing for years and I just now use the boards, took me long enough. xD Thank you for reading. Reply if you feel the need to do so. I just had a rough experience in a game and I wanted to share it/talk it out. I hope whoever is reading this has a great day! Season 6 HYYYYYYPPPPEEEEE!!!!! : D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I meant to edit this earlier but I was lazy, my bad. xD Anyway. Thank you guys for all the responses, but I'd rather it not be as popular as this ended up becoming. I don't like so much attention. xD Anyway. I have learned not to be offended by such insults anymore, at least in league anyway. Since this post I'v experiences the same thing again, only this time I have learned to mute them, report them afterwards, and just get on with the game. Now I have learned to ignore the toxicity that tends to happen from time to time.\n\n\nThank ya'll for the advice, and for all the negative responses I have learned to ignore those as well. If I knew how to edit the title I would change it to \"NEVER MIND PROBLEM SOLVED\" or something like that. xD \n\n\nAnyway I hope whoever is still here has a great day!

Simplifying the issue just pushes it onto other people, and while it's great to support this post, it's more important to think about why you do/don't support or emotionally react to this post, and what that means for your behavior and ideology.**\n\n\n\nI'm not sure that it's been increasing so much as social progression is an actual thing. If you consider that anyone using a disorder is essentially just moving to a more socially accepted form of discrimination, then I'd say it's probably less prevalent than it has been in past generations. In the past ridiculing race/gender/sexual orientation was very common and prevalent. Now that those have become more universally rejected as acceptable behavior people have shifted to discrimination that is not lashed out at as much. Autism is actually an interesting case here, because it straddles the line between what is perceived as mental health vs physical disability.\n\nIt has become less and less socially acceptable to ridicule someone for a physical disability such as being paralyzed, but as this happens it seems that people have shifted into ridiculing mental health as a perceived issue w/ the person rather than a medical issue. For instance (and I hope my belief here is wrong) it seems to me that the support and traction given to this post is much stronger than it would be for some mental health related issues. People frequently say that muting people who are negative is a solution so people need to be more thick skinned, or that some of the things people consider behavior that is unacceptable in their teammates does not really constitute toxicity or an issue, but just them being rude having a bad day. For some people who are sad/depressed it is an environmental stress issue that will pass when their life changes and they process the problems they are currently experiencing. However, for many people there is a biological component to their depression which makes them prone to ruminating on negative input, so the rest of the game they will focus on a player insulting their play or something and not be able to enjoy the game even if they use the mute button. This is a similar issue to being autistic and not being able to change that, yet my experience of how the boards reacts to the issue is that the reaction is fairly different.\n\nIn part this is difficult bc it is easy to say \"don't be a jerk and make autistic people feel bad,\" while it is much more difficult to address the nuances of mental health. For instance, even smaller issues that would not effect many players will harm a player w/ depression who is having a symptomatic day (even w/ meds the brain chemicals have high days and low days so sometimes people are experiencing symptoms even when being treated properly). However, if you fully cracked down on the behavior that harmed them you might be unfairly punishing players who were struggling w/ increased stress in their life and acted in a way they usually do not because they were struggling to find the mental resources to deal w/ both bad news in their life, and stress in the game that requires them to regulate their behavior w/ higher level brain functioning. This issue is additionally compounded by the fact that many people have adrenaline and anger responses that function at higher levels than normal, and so it may be more difficult for people to regulate themselves during stressful events in the same way that it is more difficult for people with clinical depression to be resilient to stress/criticism/negativity. It is a complex issue of where to draw the line about what is socially acceptable and isn't and often saying \"this isn't acceptable\" rather than addressing the underlying concept that the behavior is discrimination/bigotry/stereotyping will only lead to sliding the behavior down the line. I'm glad this is getting traction on the boards, but people should think about why they do or don't react to this topic, and how they think of similar issues rather than just glibly answering w/ the socially acceptable statement and saying it's all good, let's move on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vikíng","date":"2015-11-11T22:30:15.138+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mute.

Somewhere along the line, that became a phrase that you just didn't say without EVERYONE turning against you.  The word \"autistic\" was not even a word at the time.  Or one that very, very few people used.  And those that did usually had several professional degrees hanging on an office wall.  (Today, defining what is and is not \"autistic\" is so broad a topic that just about anyone can be labeled with it.  But I'm not posting to start a medical discussion.)\n\nAnother thing I noticed, even before my chronological age had double digits, was how quickly people started to say they were \"offended.\"  Adults were really big on popping that word out there.  \"Oh, I was offended.\"  \"Those words offended me.\"  Etc, etc.  Along with being offended was how quickly THAT became the only part the offended party would focus on.  They were offended.  The entire space / time continuum stopped at the moment of offense.  Once someone was offended, that was it.  Beyond making sure that everyone else knew the offended person was offended, that is.\n\nCan I empathize with the OP?  Certainly.  Was the OP offended?  Clearly.  But what did the OP do about it?  Did the OP report the jerks?  The original post does not say.  Did the OP mute them?  Again, the post does not say.  But more importantly, did the OP make note of the jerk's name so that if they ever played a match against them, they would up their game and gank the ever-loving frell out of them?  Nope.  The post does not mention that either.\n\nYou'll have to forgive my nationalism (or whatever the word is,) but this is a very American type of thing.  Americans will complain and complain and complain about something.  But they will never DO anything to fix it.  And don't blame me for that outlook.  I first heard about this type of outlook from the novel \"Rising Sun\" which has a movie adaption starring Sean Connery.  \"Fix the problem, not the blame.  Find out what's messed up and fix it.  No one is blamed.  We (meaning Americans,) are too obsessed with who messed up.\"  And it's quite true.  For the last fifteen years, any time there has been a tragedy of some kind, school shooting, child beatings, you name it, there's always a bunch of someone's who jump up and loudly point a finger.  \"Blame that person!\"  \"Blame this!\"  \"Blame that!\"  Meanwhile, more offensive things happen with more people pointing fingers.\n\nHere is my point: did someone offend you?  Fine.  Channel your anger in to something more useful than telling everyone about it.  Report the jerks.  Go up against them and stomp a mud hole in their butts and then tell them in post game chat \"Take THAT, jag off!!\"  \n\nStop being offended and _DO_ something about it.  Anything else is just a waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2015-11-14T21:13:41.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to assume that he reported the player.

I hope you and everyone else doesnt have to cross people like that in-game ever again :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Top Lane Terry","date":"2015-11-11T22:23:10.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got in a game where the enemy mid laner and jungler camped me as lee and yasuo, and insulted my mother for no reason. Like, heavy insults. They were probably on skype. \n\nAnyway, I really hate these kinds of people. I can't even call them people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HayRoss","date":"2015-12-18T21:27:04.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm Autistic as well, and while it is pretty offensive that people use my disability as a regularly used insult around the internet, I just suck it up. People of the Internet will try and use ANYTHING seemingly derogatory as an insult. People get called gay, %%%, queer, retard, etc. mostly because it's commonly perceived as being a bad thing, when in reality, for the most part, it isn't. calling someone autistic is just another thing that people will throw around as an insult for an amount of time before they get bored of it and move on.\n\nIt sucks, I know, but it will (probably) move on in the future. There's nothing we can do to change it faster, we just gotta suck it up until then","replies":[]},{"poster":"nintentwins","date":"2015-11-13T18:50:43.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy crap I haven't checked this post in two days and so much has happened since then. How the heck did I get 54 upvotes on this, when this is my first post on the boards, ever???? Is this normal? I don't care, actually. But this is too much. I don't need this much attention, it's starting to overwhelm me a bit.\n\n Allow me to continue on a bit more. The reason I was upset is not cause I got insulted, but cause their insult was pretty much a slap to my face. Me being autistic, hates when autism is used as an insult. Obviously because I'm autistic myself. Austism and mental retardation are real life disabilities, they are not supposed to be terms to describe someones intelligence. Even one whom is autistic, and even one whom is a retard in a literal sense, can still be very very smart people. So using autism and retard to describe stupidity isn't even a valid insult. \n\n\nSorry if I ranted on so much, but let me continue. You guys have given me some advice. From now on I'll try to make sure things like that don't get to me. I need to just mute them, keep a smile on, and focus on the game at hand from now on.\n\n I see I have some people bashing on me here, but I'm not gonna let it bother me. If I did let it bother me, I'd be giving ya'll individual replies. I'm kinda sensitive, but I can get real defensive at times. But instead, I'll ignore the hate, and thank everybody else for the support.\n\n\n\n\n\n As for some that said I should have done something about it. Your right, I should have. I should have at least reported them for toxicity, but I didn't. I left the end game lobby without a second thought. I'm experiencing a bit of familiarity with that as well. I'm gonna be extremely vague on this next sentence, for privacy's sake. But let me explain. There was a time I would complain about something, something specific actually. I would complain saying \"this needs to be resolved\", but I didn't do anything. For months I kept putting it off and off again. Until I talked with some friends and finally helped out to do something about the situation. \n\n\nThank you guys for the talk. I posted this cause I wanted to talk it out, share what happened. I did not intend to offend, or even insult anybody. And I especially didn't intend for this post to become so popular. If the responses keep coming this quickly I might delete this post, as it's so hard to keep up, and there are so many responses, that it's taking a toll on my anxiety. If I feel overwhelmed (Which a bunch of people talking at once gets me overwhelmed, personally.)  then it causes me to get anxious slowly but surely. If it's possible at all, slow it down a bit? xD That request is just bonkers, I know. \n\n\n\nThank you all for the positive  feedback that has been given. I really didn't intend for this many people to show up. I hope whoever is reading this has a wonderful day! I'v been having fun with preseason so far, hope ya'll are too. ^.^ Ta ta for now.","replies":[{"poster":"shyv","date":"2015-12-01T21:43:11.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey sorry to bring back a really old discussion, but using the word retard to describe autistic people is really outdated language and usually offensive even coming from an autistic person. i get that you're autistic too, but if you called me a retard i wouldn't exactly be happy about it :P\n\notherwise though, great post, it bothers me a lot too. last week i saw my team mate call someone retarded, and when i brought up the fact that i'm autistic and they should use a different word, it just ended up with them making fun of me for being autistic. sigh","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ApexInTheCircle","date":"2015-11-25T05:10:55.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've honestly stopped taking offense to anything anyone says. I don't condone harassing other people or arguing although I've done it when my nerves reach their limit, but then again we're all human and WE ALL have a breaking point. However, if I was you I would just stop listening to what others say or do, especially in league. \n\nAt the end of the day they weren't targeting you with their insults (although I do understand where you're coming from) I have a facial twitch from a baseball bat incident from when I was around 8 and I got called retarded all the time in high school and middle school but I just shrugged it off.
