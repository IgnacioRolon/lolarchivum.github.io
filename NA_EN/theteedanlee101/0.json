I'm getting sick of not being able to tab out or worrying about the cursor becoming too small. 4k isn't something new but it just seems like you guys like working on the things that aren't improving the experience of a lot of LoL players. But yee, please let me know, I wanna be able to enjoy League with this 4k UHD shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T21:25:40.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have any kind of ETA, but we are looking at bringing more compatibility for [**4K graphics**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/ask-riot-summoner-spells-4k-support-and-reddit) into the client.

You get 0 (ZERO) vision advantage in 4k as the aspect ratio stays exactly the same, the problem is that the UI gets INCREDIBLY small and you can hardly play the game anymore. And league makes more money than any other game on the planet, and even ONE man indi devs can add 4k support.","replies":[]}]}]}
