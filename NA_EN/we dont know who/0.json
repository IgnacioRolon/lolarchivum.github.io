It's like you want to infuriate your playerbase more.\r\nInb4 \"Dont play it then lul\".\r\nI wan't to enjoy TFT but only having gold drop (or MR capes nonstop) in the first rounds and after that seeing none of the same champ(s) pop up to stack to lvl 2 is just aggravating as all hell when the enemy players already have 2-3 lvl 2's in the first PvP games. I can't count the amount of games where i have not had a single lvl 3 for the entire match duration while other players have up to 3. Some even 4. \r\n\r\nAnd before you say that \"Well the enemies probably had the same champ as you hence why you couldn't get your own to lvl 3\"\r\nNo. I made sure to check each time, no other player had the same champs as i did so it shouldn't hinder me in getting a champ to lvl 3 but because TFT is purely RNG based it did and it fucked me.\r\n\r\nA game where luck decides wether you win or lose should NEVER have a ranked game mode. This only goes to show how out of touch Riot truly are with their own game and games in general it seems. And ofcourse if you express any of your frustrations ingame you'll get banned for toxicity even if what you said wasn't even remotely toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2019-07-27T10:31:22.693+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=We Dont Know Who,realm=EUNE,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=3JEEpkoU,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-27T09:32:45.179+0000)\n>\n> A game where luck decides wether you win or lose should NEVER have a ranked game mode.\n\nThere is such a game where so-called luck is a huge factor, yet it has not only a \"ranked\" mode but it's played for huge money.

There is no \"haha I drew the ace of spades now I get to draw 3 extra cards\" or something like that.\n\nSecondly, in poker you can fold. **Folding is important**, because that is essential to stopping the game from being an unstoppable coin flip that you have no control over.\n\n~~Thirdly, the best poker players don't play the luck game, they play the number game by counting decks. And if they do that in casino, they are instantly kicked out to the streets because they can actually earn money from the house who from the very beginning is designed to suck money off gamblers (casino often either just accuse any winner of card counting and throw them out, or they can hire a trained personnel who can count decks to do the dirty work of sitting behind a monitor wall and inform the security to butt which guy from which table out of the building).~~ EDIT: Confused poker with blackjack.","replies":[{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2019-07-27T14:26:29.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=3JEEpkoU,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2019-07-27T14:14:43.137+0000)\n>\n> Thirdly, the best poker players don't play the luck game, they play the number game by counting decks.

The reason is twofold. In poker there is direct human interaction in the form of bluffing and other subterfuge. This is where the actual \"skill\" of poker comes into play, since the odds for all of the hands are known and it's not too difficult to calculate the statistically correct play for any situation. This is the part that people are watching when they see professional poker on TV, and what the commentators are generally topicing on. Otherwise, it would be boring. Additionally, poker only becomes interesting over a series of hands ( a game, in poker's case, which is really a series of small complete games).\n\nLet's compare TFT to another RNG game. Maybe backgammon. Indeed there is professional backgammon. I can't imagine anybody ever wanting to watch it on TV. And again, the \"skill\" of backgammon comes from use of the betting cube over dozens of games. The correct movements to any situation on the board has been established long ago.\n\nTFT is a game of statistics. This is BECAUSE it is RNG. The most successful response to any arrangement can be calculated without too much difficulty, and played. One won't always win, because RNG, but one can play the best odds. Much like Blackjack. In Blackjack, the statistically best response to any presented situation can be quickly assessed and played. There's generally no dispute about what move a player should make at any time. Since it's a casino game, proper play still tends to lose, but very little (about %49). (And if one counts cards, the odds may be tilted above %50.)\n\nTFT is a bit more complicated, but not impossibly so. A robot could play it. Computers are very good at calculating the play with the best chance for success. It's still just a chance, and won't win every time. Over hundreds of games, I would expect it to even out (when being consistently played optimally).\n\nThere shouldn't be a ranked system for TFT. There, should, properly, be a kind of in-house gambling associated with it. Give each player a \"purse\" with some sort of token currency that can be used for cosmetics. And let people play with that. The size of the purse, would be more representative of the players success with this game.\n\nLet TFT remain casual. It's almost completely non-toxic as it is. Ranked could only give people an incentive to act out. \n\nI feel like putting ranked on TFT, is like revealing that rank in LoL as well, is not as meaningful as most people estimate. The existence of a ranked system in TFT demeans the meaning of ranked for LoL.\n\nLet TFT remain a pastime. Something that we like to play casually when we can't play LoL, or when we're burnt out. Don't popularize the game as being more than it is.\n\nWould you also have TFT as esports with professional play? If the game was a bit slower, so that we could read the decisions being made by the various players, then, this might be interesting. We do like watching people think. But as it is, there is nothing to see, and the game still takes 40m.\n\nRanked TFT is a joke. Riot is trolling us.","replies":[{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2019-07-27T14:09:58.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Absolut Garen,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=3JEEpkoU,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-07-27T12:38:13.826+0000)\n>\n> it's not too difficult to calculate the statistically correct play for any situation\n\nOh, but it is. There are so many variables - all of the opponent's possible holdings (aka their range of hands), various bet sizes, possible future cards, game theory (balancing your bluffs and value bets, minimum defense frequency), opponent's tendencies, position (indicating how many players are to act after you), in tournaments there's also ICM.\nPoker has only been solved for fixed limit heads up (1v1) holdem.

(I did have the solution for hold'em in mind when I wrote that.) However, in TFT the value for all of the considerations is known, and a statistically correct result can be calculated.
