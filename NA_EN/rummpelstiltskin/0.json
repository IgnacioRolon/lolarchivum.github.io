Why can&#039;t we express our feelings in a moderated chat or trial system? I&#039;ll admit, I&#039;ve been toxic before. Which I&#039;ve tried to work on. But when I get reported for something that wasn&#039;t even considered toxic by the summoner code, I should at least be able to dispute that. It&#039;s not right. Everyone deserves a say in what punishment they get. Or at least a dispute. It&#039;s not fair man. Some of us are trying to be less toxic. Sometimes it&#039;s just how the brain is wired. No reason I should receive a 14 day suspension because someone else was salty.\r\n\r\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nffs\r\nwhy does no1 ward jungle anymore\r\nenglish?\r\ncuz they suck\r\noops\r\nim bad\r\nlul\r\nDid I blame you for me dieing to him? lmfao\r\nno\r\ni didnt blame you.

Later on, it sounds like you decided to stop participating in the match; even if you're physically at the keyboard moving around, it's not any different from being afk.\n\nIf you're having a problem with the way a player is acting in chat, mute them. If they are trolling, you can report them. Making inflammatory remarks and refusing to play the match out just makes things worse, and there is no excuse for that kind of behavior. Just mute them and play the rest of the match to the best of your ability. I'm sure you'd prefer your allies did the same, right?\n\nIf you're having trouble figuring out what kind of behavior is acceptable, I suggest checking out these articles;\n\nhttp://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751874","replies":[{"poster":"Rummpelstiltskin","date":"2016-05-12T03:07:00.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, see, there's also a difference between going ACTUALLY not playing, and just saying you're not going to. I only said that. I kept on playing. Where does it come to the point where riot sees that we should have at the very least a defense in any issue? Trolls come along every day and ruin peoples games. They instigate people and some people, I being one of them, are annoyed easier. I refrained from throwing out cuss words and tried to discuss the issue with them. I'm only human. But as I said, that right there certainly wasn't worthy of a 14 day suspension. No way.

You can drop tiers but it takes a while of being reformed. Have you received prior punishments in the past several months?\n\nIf one person is punished more severely than another for the same behavior, it's usually because they have been toxic in more matches and/or have prior punishments already. Everybody gets many chances, and one person in a match being punished doesn't justify taking that opportunity from everyone else in it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Peri2","date":"2016-05-12T02:51:33.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"dude your toxic .............. how is that even questionable like................... lmao just man up start a new account and play with friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Rummpelstiltskin","date":"2016-05-12T02:59:22.954+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I understand that I'm toxic.
