You can go through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your connection, but you can't exceed that physical distance.  Your best bet may be to play on a closer region.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
