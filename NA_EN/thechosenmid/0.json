So why not?\n\nI didn't say no one ever plays bots, and I didn't say I never play bots (I do, frequently), and I didn't say few people have ever played bots.\n\nBut the co-op vs AI mode is barely more popular than TT. Riot just doesn't take it seriously, which leads to all manner of silly and very visible bugs that persist for ages, like the bots saying incorrect quotes at the start of a match (fixed), and the load screen showing all bots as using Cleanse/Smite when they're actually not (not fixed).\n\nRiot doesn't spend much time on co-op. I'm not saying that's a good thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-09-16T04:27:11.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dgAtEGFg,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-16T02:10:11.864+0000)\n>\n> Most people don't play bots.

It's happenned more than once that I become aware the the other 4 players represented a family.)\n\nThey tried to introduce more bots a few years ago, and many had bugs and needed to be retired. (Notably, the Yasuo bot tended to ragequit.) Some bots were retired when the champions were re-worked.  Currently, we only have bots for about 1/3 of the roster.\n\nYou're right; it's apparently not a priority. Maybe it should be. Whatever function the co-op modes had when they were instituted, surely still exists.","replies":[{"poster":"TheChosenMid","date":"2019-09-24T00:38:04.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, thinking about it i remember quite a bit of bugs with champs and some still do. But if they could figure out a way to fix them then i think it would be a pretty easy way for people to come up with effective play styles vs certian champs.
