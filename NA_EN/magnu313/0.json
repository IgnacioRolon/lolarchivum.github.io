I have waited maybe 30 minutes so far to try and reconnect but without fail I have not been able to get back into the game and only \"reconnect\" to see the stats. I have restarted my game, client, computer, and switched to wifi (only use ethernet cord when playing), but nothing will let me be able to reconnect. I also have friends who say they experience the same thing as me. If anyone has a solution please let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T20:34:11.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection is degrading in-game and eventually kicking you off.
