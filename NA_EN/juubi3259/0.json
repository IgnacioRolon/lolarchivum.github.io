I know little to nothing about computers so any help would be greatly appreciated. It absolutely does not have to be high end (preferably under 600$-700$), as I am a very casual gamer and am accustomed to playing League of Legends at very low settings and with poor fps. All I'm looking for is a budget laptop that I can play League of Legends on at reasonable fps (40/50/60) with medium/low settings. Thank you in advance for all of your help. \n\nEDIT: In the research that I've done, I've seen this laptop mentioned multiple times: https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Aspire-i5-8250U-GeForce-E5-576G-5762/dp/B075FLBJV7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B075FLBJV7&amp;pd_rd_r=M84CSXV69Y0FT5YX0HQW&amp;pd_rd_w=iozq3&amp;pd_rd_wg=lRkGk&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=M84CSXV69Y0FT5YX0HQW&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=laptops4study-20&amp;linkId=8112427cfaa86d1446fbab801ee5fcf9\nI have also seen this laptop mentioned as a cheaper alternative: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079TGL2BZ/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&amp;pd_rd_i=B079TGL2BZ&amp;pd_rd_w=DFYmA&amp;pf_rd_p=80559f3c-f83b-49c1-8a72-40f936e9df7a&amp;pd_rd_wg=7p1Xl&amp;pf_rd_r=GTN89STMVWEFENF7KQHH&amp;pd_rd_r=69f1e156-5fa6-11e9-97cc-7fd3667cd97a\n","replies":[]}
