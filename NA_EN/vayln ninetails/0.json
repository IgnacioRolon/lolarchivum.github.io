I am very bipolar and suffer from depression and I know what players are thinking right now. \"Wow this guy is crying over the internet\" or \"Then don't play\" Well its not that easy. See I could just give up and trust me I have a lot, but to be honest I enjoy League all of us do. I started at the beginning of season four on my old account that I lost the password too. I quickly fell in love with this game. It is fun and brings smiles to my face also offers an escape, but then we have the players... I have had some rocky games with champs and sometimes you have a bad game. No matter who you are that will happen at some point. It is the worse feeling to let your team down and with the player base saying \"Wow Fiora main at her finest\", \"Wtf could you feed anymore?\",\"Refund skin please\" and \"Could you just like stay dead?\". Its hard to stay positive when you are just being out right told not to play, because of how bad you are. I have had out right people saying for me to kill myself and yes I am aware that its \"Just a game\", but it still hurts to see someone agree with thought you have been struggling with for a long time.\r\n\r\nI ask you deer players, not to be so mean to others. Flaming and calling someone stupid may have a small effect to some, but to others it can hurt a lot. If Riot is seeing this they should fix this or work on it, Because I want to play, but sadly I don't think I can keep this up with all that others and I are going though.\r\n-Darkgrinder14 A.k.a Drake Vayln King","replies":[{"poster":"Lys Shallia","date":"2015-09-19T05:03:26.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is actually perfect.

I believe people should practice how they play. What pisses people off? getting continuously BAD TEAMMATES because its literally too hard to read about what your doing.\n\nThe league community and the game is not designed to cater to \"your feelings\" like, seriously. How about read up on your champs, watch high elo games, learn how to simply not feed, and you'll see things drastically change. How often do people ever tell me I'm trash? NEVER. because I don't fucking feed 14 kills in 10 minutes....ever, and I know how to build.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"awesomeuno","date":"2015-09-19T04:38:09.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.  If trolling, you're terrible\n2.  If you don't want people to get mad at you over doing bad in a competitive game, either move the chat box so you can't see it when you start a game, or just play bots or some easy mode BS.\n3.  I took a look at your match history, and honestly, while people maybe don't have to tell you to kill yourself, you are really bad, and should be practicing champs that require decent mechanics in bots or something.  If you are going 0/9/0 as fiora, you are BAD.  \n4. Use wards, and pay attention to the mini-map.  You will eventually gain a sense of where people probably are, and be able to make decisions that won't kill you.  Literally can have infinite wards at level 9 for 250 gold.  It's OP AF.\n5.  Do not jump into ranked with champs you haven't practiced with.  0/7/0 Azir ranked game, i would be pissed if i was on your team and you took a high mechanical skill champ you are not good with.\n6. Learn what items to build on a champion, and when to prioritize items early.  Not once did I see a zeke's on any of your support games.  DO NOT BUILD IE ON FIORA.  It's one of the most expensive items in the game, and the gold is better spent elsewhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-09-19T04:26:30.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right off the bat I have to tell you to stop. building. runaans. unless you're kayle or kalista, no one has any reason to build runaans. its a noob trap item.\nSecondly: ward. more.\nthirdly: play safe! i see you have a reallllly high feeding rate in a ton of your games. It takes literally no skill to not go balls to the wall 24/7 or wonder the jungle blindly\n\nfourth: Honestly, I have borderline personality that mixes with depression, and these people can call me whatever they want, and it never affects me because they literally know nothing about me. That's the extent of that logic that i use, and I laugh it off so hard, because they can honestly go fuck themselves. \nWho gives a shit what some snot-nosed 15 year old says to me on the internet?","replies":[]}]}
