Your specific issue sounds like your patcher is trying to load but something is blocking it.  Is this on the updated client?  What happens if you try loading the legacy:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if you run through any problems from there.","replies":[{"poster":"sherblom","date":"2017-01-14T16:24:59.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a shortcut to the legacy client, but now when i press on the orange launch button it'l darken for a few seconds then go back to orange with nothing happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T16:35:48.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the Launch button keeps reappearing then a patching issue may have caused a corruption.  Meaning the installation didn't go properly so it's failing to load up.  In this case it may be necessary to [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).  You can then select to install the updated version, but I'd make sure the legacy works first.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"sherblom","date":"2017-01-14T18:14:30.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I reinstalled league like you said to, but now whenever I go to open the game it just says \"Another instance of the League Client is running. Please Try again,\" but there wouldn't be another League running. It just says that ever single time. \n\nP. S. I'm sorry for the trouble; I just want to go back to playing one of my favorite games you know.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
