I looked through this scenario with the VFX artist, and unfortunately, there isn't an elegant way to solve this without drastically changing the Molten Shield (E) VFX. We actually got this feedback before and made changes to separate the Molten Shield particles from Banshee's Veil, Sivir's Spell Shield, and Edge of Night (mainly by adding more details and graphics to the shield), so thanks for bringing this up. It shows that we didn't separate the particles far enough and need to index harder on this in the future.\n\nWe don't want to change up the shield too much since many players like its current iteration, but do you have any suggestions on how to improve the readability here? :] Help would be wonderful!","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-10-30T23:06:31.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot LoveStrut,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uvoAXGGz,comment-id=000100020001,timestamp=2017-10-30T22:03:20.585+0000)\n>\n> We don&#x27;t want to change up the shield too much since many players like its current iteration, but do you have any suggestions on how to improve the readability here? :] Help would be wonderful!\n\nPersonally I think a color tweak would be good enough, like adding a hint of purple or red (like her armor or her hair). Changing the VFX's shape is another option, but I think that takes too much bandwidth to do.\n\nEDIT: wait, there is a hint of purple on it already. Maybe it;s just my potatoe not showing it :( I might get used to it after seeing it in a few more games.\n\nEDIT2: Maybe try reversing the blue and purple colors? That might make it look less like the banshees cos the colors are different but would still give off the blue flame feel?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-27T19:05:05.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi hi!
