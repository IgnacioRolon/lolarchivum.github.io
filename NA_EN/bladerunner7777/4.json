Skarner (one of the best stories so far), Rek'Sai, Amumu, Rammus, standard humans with magical power (Taliyah). What have others got? a bunch of humans? Dull. Plus based on the recent lore, it sounds like Shurima will be the start of things going haywire in Runeterra. A once ancient and dead civilisation returning, it's people uniting and lead by an all powerful being with an army? How long do you think the Noxus controlled cities in Shurima will stay Noxus controlled? Will others stand for a mad ascended running around trying to 'conquer them'?
