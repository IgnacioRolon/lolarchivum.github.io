When I first got it there was a visual bug (on mecha kha&#039;zix only) where his claws always appeared to be evolved even when not, but this was fixed in patch 5.20. I think this bug emerged after they fixed the evolved claws bug but it could be older.\r\n\r\nWhat it does: The bug makes Mecha Kha&#039;zix&#039; model flail around for a few seconds before returning to normal.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce: I&#039;m not sure what exactly are the conditions to reproduce it but I notice it all of the time in game. The only way I can 100% produce it is by spamming joke while running with the homestart speed boost. \r\n\r\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUwT9Z9hz40\r\nIf you can&#039;t tell, the bug occurs whenever Mecha Kha&#039;zix tucks his head in and swings it side to side briefly. He&#039;s not supposed to do that, and it&#039;s only for his Mecha skin.\r\nThe quote 6 seconds in is actually another bug!\r\n\r\n- Incorrect Attack/Movement quotes (all skins)\r\n\r\nEstimated date of bug emerging: Patch 6.2 or 6.1. I&#039;m not sure if it was in 6.1 because I didn&#039;t play him very often last patch and when I did I was using Mecha Kha&#039;zix (quotes are difficult to hear with the mecha voice processor).\r\n\r\nWhat it does: If you didn&#039;t know, Kha&#039;zix unlocks additional quotes depending on what he has evolved. For example, if you evolve your wings at level 6 then the quotes &quot;My wings are restless&quot;, &quot;I will soar over them&quot;, and &quot;Strike from above&quot; are added to his attacking and movement quotes. Right now all of his &quot;evolution quotes&quot; are unlocked by default.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce: Play Kha&#039;zix\r\n\r\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn4pguDaU2E\r\nIn the video I&#039;m using Guardian of the Sands but it applies to all skins.\r\n\r\n- Glowing claws with Unseen Threat passive incorrect size (all skins)\r\n\r\nEstimated date of bug emerging: Around patch 5.23 (November 12th on pbe). This was when they did a mass tuning of champion sizes. Kha&#039;zix&#039; model size was decreased, but his passive &quot;glowing claws&quot; weren&#039;t.\r\n\r\nWhat it does: When Kha&#039;zix&#039; passive is ready his claws will glow. The glowing is supposed to be the size of his claws but they are slightly bigger so it looks strange. Most noticeable on Mecha Kha&#039;zix.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce: Play Kha&#039;zix\r\n\r\nPictures\r\n\r\nDefault:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/upDQmFR\r\nDefault evolved claws:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/PacSpM1\r\n\r\nMecha:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/7Ua0tNd\r\nMecha evolved claws:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/imTg6sy\r\n\r\nGuardian of the sands:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/5d6f2mT\r\nGuardian of the sands evolved claws:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/TqBtCrr\r\n\r\nExample of what it should look like (taken from surrender at 20): http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EKUCUm3U09o/VhIYwOBMIQI/AAAAAAAAG94/5tyCufaN4xU/s640/kha.jpg\r\n\r\nYou may now make puns about The Bug with bugs","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-10T19:08:54.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bladerunner7777! \n\nThanks so much for this well written bug. This is super helpful for us. ^-^\n\nOkay, let's tackle these one by one. \n\n> What it does: The bug makes Mecha Kha'zix' model flail around for a few seconds before returning to normal.\n\nMmm. I'm not able to repro this one - have you seen this recently? I'm looking on 6.3 at the moment. Looks like it may have been an issue with Homeguards. \n\n> What it does: If you didn't know, Kha'zix unlocks additional quotes depending on what he has evolved. For example, if you evolve your wings at level 6 then the quotes \"My wings are restless\", \"I will soar over them\", and \"Strike from above\" are added to his attacking and movement quotes. Right now all of his \"evolution quotes\" are unlocked by default.\n\nThis isn't a bug - we changed how his VO works. All evolved lines were actually broken and not playing - so we just put all evolved lines in his default attack and move.\n\n> Estimated date of bug emerging: Around patch 5.23 (November 12th on pbe). This was when they did a mass tuning of champion sizes. Kha'zix' model size was decreased, but his passive \"glowing claws\" weren't.\n\nYup! This was definitely due to the resizing. It's on our radar of things to fix soon!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dinko","date":"2016-02-11T01:08:42.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Bladerunner, nice post. I'm glad you were able to draw the attention of Riot. \nI'd just like to mention that in your last picture \"Example of what it should look like\"; you are actually showing another bug, which has been fixed. The claws should definitly not look like that.
