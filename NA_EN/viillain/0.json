Let's do the calculations on a target with 3000 HP, and no Armor. We'll use a champion who often builds BotRK, like Vayne, as an example. We'll give her 2.0 attack speed for calculations' sake, even though some of her builds take her past the 2.0 mark.\n\nTarget: 3000 HP and zero Armor\n\nElapsed Time: 10 seconds\n\nJhin AS rounded, at lv 18: 0.95\n\nVayne AS: 2.0\n\n\n\nHere comes the math.\n\n\n\nVayne: 6%/s ---> 2.0AS = 12%/s = 120%/10s ---> 1.2Ã—3000 = 3600 HP dmg dealt over 10 seconds\n\nJhin: 6%/s ---> .95AS = 5.7%/s = 57%/10s ---> .57x3000 = 1710 HP dmg dealt over 10 seconds\n\n\n\nSo, not only does Jhin get less than HALF of the effectiveness from the item as someone who can build Attack Speed, but I'm being generous here. I didn't count reload time, I didn't count the time it takes for Jhin to W, drop traps, Q, etc. Vayne's abilities weave into her attack speed much more smoothly, and she also has a passive to synergize with BotRK. Under non-ideal conditions, Jhin would likely get 1/3 or 1/4 the usage of BotRK that any AS-building champion would.\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr: OP is stupid and doesn't know how to math, nor can he even gauge a ballpark estimate, because he somehow manages to think that even theoretically this could work on Jhin.\n\nThere's your math you so desperately craved.","replies":[{"poster":"ViiLLAiN","date":"2016-10-22T23:15:52.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do u realize that jhin only needs 2-3 autos to kill people right","replies":[{"poster":"trash sion","date":"2016-10-22T23:20:18.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but that's because he has crazy high AD, it has nothing to do with BotRK.
