Please Read!","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello Riot!\n\nI want to start off this feedback post by saying you did a fantastic job on the new Legendary Riven and Yasuo skins and that we Riven and Yasuo mains are very appreciative of the fact we received not only new skins, but LEGENDARY skins!\n\nI would also like to say that I am here to give constructive feedback and do not mean to offend the creators of this fantastic skin.\n\nNow I want to give my opinions on Dawnbringer Riven, and how I feel, and some of the Riven community as well.\n\n\nI believe that the gauntlet/shoulder piece should be the same color as her sword and/or hair. Having the hair followed by the arm followed by the sword in 3 different shades of blue and purple throws the skin off a little.\n\nThe color pallet is identical to the Water Elementalist Lux form.\n\nThe hair is all one shade, and would be much better if it faded to a white towards the back, or white that fades to a blue/purple towards the back.\n\nAdd more flair toward the back of the hair like flames and the art that was teased during the patch 7.11 cycle.\n\nThanks for reading my opinions, I hope a Rioter sees this!\n\n(Also not sure if this is the right place to post skin feedback. derp.)\n\nThanks so much.\n\n\nP.S. I would love a PBE account to test the skin and these changes if they happen. Thanks again.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Time Wizard","date":"2017-06-01T21:24:39.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DanKBluR! Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts and opinions. I'd like to share some of our thoughts from the dev side. :)\n\nA character artist could explain it better, but most often there's a reason we choose more than two colors as primary. When too much of a skin is made up of only 2 colors, the way the colors grouped make the skin much less interesting and create a monotonous design. The feathered purple arm is also meant to show that she's not quite human; the arm is touched by some sort of divine power.\n\nWhen it comes to selecting a hair color for any given skin, it's difficult to make a call based on feedback alone. Whereas some people love the current color, others want her to be blonde -- another group prefers white, and so on. No matter what color we choose, some portion of players will have preferred another one. We try to balance player feedback alongside what works best for the overall design of the skin. \n\nI worked on Elementalist Lux for months, so when you pointed out Water Form I knew exactly what you meant by the color scheme. Out of curiosity, I loaded them up in game and found that they're really quite different! \n\nhttp://imgur.com/o4CJ1gX\n\nLux has a much bright overall read: lots of teal and greens and her golden pieces are more of a yellow-gold. Also note that Riven's wings glow with different colors which can give the illusion of a variety of different color palettes. It's also interesting that you suggested a blue/purple fade for Riven, since that's exactly what Elementalist Lux's Water Form hair looks like. :P\n\nIf you've got any more feedback, please feel free! I may not be able to respond to everything, but here is the main thread for feedback: https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/gYkO3KXE-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-dawnbringer-riven\n\nHope this context was even a little helpful.

I recently learned that the 7.10 artwork that came out was an earlier design and that you made adjustments since then and that they reflect he concept better. I appreciate the long reply!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Queen Elsa","date":"2017-06-14T05:00:56.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are there any chances of her splash art getting fixed? It is inconsistent with the in-game skin as her arms are switched. It wouldn't make sense to say that the splash art is mirrored either because in a mirrored version, the arms would be on the correct sides but then she would be holding her sword with her dominant hand on the bottom.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SS7 Lucky ZStyle","date":"2017-06-03T01:00:13.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Time Wizard,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=v43fa89w,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-06-01T21:24:39.117+0000)\n>\n> Hey DanKBluR!
