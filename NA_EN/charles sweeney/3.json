I suspect your client may be dropping its connection from the platform service, which will often crash the client entirely. Most of the time, this is caused by local network settings that don't play well with League, so I suggest working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your settings are compatible.\n\nLet me know if this issue persists.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
