If you've ever shot someone with a ranged auto attack but died before it hit the target, and it did no damage, thats what that is. Its the same with melee champions dying mid swing.\n\nSome spells have an instant windup animation but a long ass cast animation, like ezreal ult.\n\nBut spells and attacks can be interrupted, the window for doing so is on the windup and is really tiny, so people assume its not there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auroramancer","date":"2016-02-29T11:43:04.366+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"...the amount of times I've had my Blitzcrank/Nautilus auto attacks interrupted by CC. \n\nThis is not correct man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheScav","date":"2016-03-10T16:53:01.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does {{champion:157}} 's q not work the same way when he is knocked up?
