A tanked out, steroided viking you can't push back is running at you with even more speed now than ever. I honestly hope that he doesn't need to cling to {{item:3800}} to be effective though, because then its just pigeon-holing him to an item and restraining his power curve. An ability shouldn't need an item to be good, and vice versa.","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-05-05T02:45:02.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's just say 50% movement speed puts him at 500 ms (simplicity sake).
