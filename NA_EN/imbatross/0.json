Well, I could for a while, but it randomly stopped working after a specific game. I'm not sure which one, but I don't think that's important. It gave me an unfamiliar warning text box that told me that there was a problem with my connection, and that I needed to check my wifi for more information. I am currently using my college's wifi, so there was clearly nothing wrong with it. But it that wasn't enough of a red flag of this peculiar situation, when I attempted to log back into the client, it gave me the same text box again. I resorted to reinstalling my client, and now when I try to log back into League with the new client, it comes up with the warning message linked to this post. \r\n\r\nThankfully, League still works for me if I do not use the new beta client, but I would sincerely like to go back to using it. Is there any remedy to this problem, and if so, I would like to know it as soon as possible. You guys did a pretty good job on that client and I would love to use it again.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nImbatross","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T00:42:26.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this issue a few times when a reinstallation of the client went wrong.

People w/ low budget computers literally cannot handle the animations and other things in the client. Kinda excessive.","replies":[{"poster":"Imbatross","date":"2016-12-04T23:53:58.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have an ASUS laptop.
