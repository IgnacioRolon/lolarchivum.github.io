Two of my favorite things together :D\n\nHuge fan of VR at the moment - I obviously need to have a go at making my own Aurelion Sol in Tiltbrush too!  I can't quite tell past the blue smoke, but did you use the space background, or the nighttime one?  (I love the sense of vertigo the space background gives.)\n\nMy last creation was a spaceship/pod like setup, with window out to the night sky, and a control panel in front of me.  Even though I drew it, it was very jarring to attempt to walk through it to draw the hyperspace streaks outside the window! :D  My fave thing, though, is sitting on the ground, drawing grasses, flowers, and trees all around me.  Very relaxing.","replies":[{"poster":"NissaAnimist","date":"2016-04-25T07:33:00.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy must feel amazing to have a Riot member be the first to comment on his post. \n\nRito doing good one comment at a time :3","replies":[{"poster":"MrWiilson","date":"2016-04-27T18:00:05.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do feel amazing right now just to have you reply too !!!(:","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrWiilson","date":"2016-04-27T17:59:41.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a huge fan of VR too! :3 it's been amazing working with tilt brush as well. I don't even draw in real life and everything just comes to life! \n\nYes i used the space background! But wanted to get that background more like the picture so I added a load of bluish smoke . It looks even more amazing in tilt brush though. Let me know if you want to tilt brush file, I can export it for you to see!(:\n\nOmg that sounds super relaxing! Definitely something I will look into doing now!
