After restarting client 4 times and still having the same error message, I restarted PC. Logged back in, same error message. So I give up. 2 minutes later I get punished for leaving the game.

Used to work perfectly fine two days ago. Any other games/stuff is working as well - its only league, so no, its not me.

Restarting your PC is a solid plan, but it might not resolve issues with your network.  Instead, run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, and test it in a custom game.  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
