His W that is also a skill shot that you have to predict where they're going to be in order to land it. (Unless you're stupid enough to stay in the area) An E for gap closing just like Ahri's ult, Talon's E, Akali's ult, Katarina's E. And an Ult that is much like Orianna's ult, without the pull-in or heals, but still massive damage. Here's a tip: Instead of complaining that someone's OP and needs to be nerfed, how about you learn to dodge skillshots and coordinate with your team in stunning and bursting them down. Simple as that. I have him mastered along with quite a few other assassins and easiest way to stop any assassin is with a stun. or a silence. Either way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Snake Town","date":"2015-05-29T21:49:47.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?

I haven't played him myself, but there has been one in almost every game that I have played since he came out. His slow just doesn't do enough damage, his passive needs more burst, the stun duration needs to be longer and the range of it increased, and his ult shadow needs to last longer. Why does Riot have to make Ekko so weak it's like I'm stomping lvl 3 newbs when I play against one...(enough sarcasm for the post?)","replies":[]}]}
