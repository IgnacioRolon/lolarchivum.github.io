This is likely directly caused or at least greatly exacerbated by certain network settings that could conflict with League. The most common solutions for this can be found inside our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), so I strongly recommend starting there.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
