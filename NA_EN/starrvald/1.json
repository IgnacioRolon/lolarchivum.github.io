I went into a game and after tried to see if i could add a page, also I had tried many other ways; going to the store first then going back, exiting client then reopening, tried logging into another computer and same thing happened.\r\nBut when I go to the old client I am able to add them right away. I'm not sure if it is a bug or just a fluke, but I thought it should be mentioned.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T23:58:28.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can access and edit *Mastery Pages* under the **COLLECTION** tab in the New Client.

From what I have read so far, it is a common problem that, from what I have read, is being fixed by riot (you guys) already and to just use the legacy client to add mastery pages.

Are you seeing an error when trying to make a new mastery page? Can you possibly record what happens or [**grab a screenshot**](https://gyazo.com/) so I can see what's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Starrvald","date":"2017-02-16T16:52:00.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I used to be able to add a mastery page by the drop down and just click add a new one, but now there is a plus next to deleting a mastery page.
