Is the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She is also one of my favorite support champion in Leauge of Legends. After realizing that I have clinical depression I learned about N.A.M.I. The coincidence of the name was too much for me to pass up. I wanted to see a Therapist Nami skin in the style of Surgeon Shen, Nurse Akali and Kennen M.D. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have the artistic skills to make fan art for this idea. So I thought I would share on this discussion board not only to see if other people are interested in making fan art of Therapist Nami but to gain support in hope that this skin might become a reality some day.","replies":[]}
