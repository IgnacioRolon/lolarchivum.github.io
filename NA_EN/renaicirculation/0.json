When playing Sion and you use your roar on a minion, occasionally, it will almost instantly come to stop (as if hitting terrain) instead of flying through the wave and into your cowardly opponent. It seems like it happens slightly more often if you use E immediately after a knock-up charged Q, but it&#039;s never consistent in when it does happen. It&#039;s kind of annoying because it can hurt farming abilities and definitely impacts your trading ability. I don&#039;t know what more to add, but if you need elaboration, just say so, and I&#039;ll try to come up with something or make a replay/video. :P\r\n\r\n{{champion:14}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-04-09T19:06:36.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Sion main, I understand how you feel.
