But for ISPs with a quality network it is a non-issue.\n\nA ping of 120-130 is very noticeable and completely unavoidable for even the best ISPs if they are on the East Coast. It is playable, but it is definitely a disadvantage compared to someone under 60ms ping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperman438","date":"2015-01-21T00:10:28.658+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DericDraco,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bJyaOGqB,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-01-20T23:42:03.072+0000)\n>\n> It's not about ping, its about PACKET LOSS.

But because they have 40-50 ping and you have 90-130 ping as well as packet loss since they are closer to the server and their information gets processed first.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-01-21T16:27:40.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lets be realistic though.\nHow often, outside of challenger, do you encounter someone who is 100% equal skill?\nNever mind other lane dynamics (like ganks).\n\nLatency does create an advantage.
