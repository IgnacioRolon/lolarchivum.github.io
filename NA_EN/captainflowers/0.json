(NA)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before anything else: THIS IS OPEN TO ALL ELO&#039;S. JUST BE LEVEL 30.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re reading this, hopefully the title grabbed your eye and you want to play in some casted games live on stream. I&#039;m CaptainFlowers and I&#039;m part of the Houseparty5v5 community, an amateur LCS-style organization on the weekends, and a source for casted, streamed gameplay during the week. We shoutcast multiple games every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night from 6-9 CST at twitch.tv/houseparty5v5. When one game ends, we pull people from the twitch chat to play in the next one, so everyone watching has an equal chance to play. Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re brand new or have been watching for weeks. \r\n\r\nTo play, all you need is a level 30 account and the ability to use teamspeak. No talking is required on your end, but you need to hear your teammates. Voice comms are one reason why our games are more coordinated than solo queue, despite not being full 5-man rosters on weekdays.Once we pick the 10 players for the game, the two players with the highest houseparty mmr (we keep our own ladder/elo system for these games) become the team captains and draft everyone else gym class style. After that, the game starts up with normal pick/ban phase. \r\n\r\nUsually we do 3 games per night, but on some occasions might host more. They&#039;re all casted and streamed, so if you want to play in some on-air games and show off your league talents to an audience, come join in! \r\n\r\nTL;DR - twitch.tv/houseparty5v5 Casted games. No rank restriction. Tues/Weds/Thurs 6-9 pm CST. Come play!","replies":[]}
