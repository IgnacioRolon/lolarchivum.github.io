In that game I dealt 8k more damage then him and he just starts flaming be saying I suck at that champion and it's my fault that he didn't get in his promos. Just warning everyone who wants to duo with him. Like bro its my fault that you even were close to promos by carrying his 3/15 match before.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasuo XIV","date":"2017-02-11T00:26:31.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm Interested, I have a 59.6% win rate, much higher with my main champions.
