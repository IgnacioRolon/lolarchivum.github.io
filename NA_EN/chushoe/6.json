Both full hp, she was farming lane and I attempted an assassination. I'm not complaining about her being broken or anything, it just came as a surprise to both of us.

If the burst is delayed, you might as well be a dps champ. Rather than making the counterplay by having a window to react to the assassination, the counterplay should be the ability to avoid the assassination in the first place.
