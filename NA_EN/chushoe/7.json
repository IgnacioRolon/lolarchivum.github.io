Literally every single time someone brings up their desire for marksmen to _not be mandatory_, there is at least one player who comes in and misinterprets this as the player asking for marksmen to _not be viable_. These are not the same thing. At this point I'm pretty sure this misinterpretation is largely deliberate, particularly as I've seen many of the same people make that same mistake across multiple threads, in spite of corrections from other players. Nonetheless, it still appears to carry weight as if it were not completely bogus. Asking for greater diversity in League, while still expecting marksmen to be present on both teams in every match, is inconsistent at best, and hypocritical at worst.\n\nAdding to this, League is also not the only MOBA out there, and literally every single competitor has a much larger compositional variety, where their roster does include many marksman-type characters, but where those characters aren't mandatory to winning games. In fact, oftentimes it's not even mandatory for a team to have a DPS character if they have bursty damage-dealers, and carry-level scaling is therefore not limited to only a small subset of champions with near-identical features in common. Therefore, anyone arguing that marksmen need to be mandatory in League \"because that's just how the genre works\" would do well to take a look at literally any other game within that genre.\n\nIt's also worth noting that not even Riot believes marksmen need be all that mandatory: during this year's Worlds, when the Ardent Censer debate was still ongoing, a Rioter [chipped in](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/bPE1A1gi-the-problem-with-adcs-is-they-do-too-much-damage-full-stop?comment=0005) on the status of marksmen in the game's meta. Their response underlined the fact that not only is Riot aware that marksmen are mandatory and stronger than other DPS classes, but that this choice is deliberate, and that they could indeed switch at any time to giving another class, such as battle mages, the spotlight marksmen currently enjoy (with some adjustments). There is this deeply ingrained notion among much of the playerbase that marksmen _need_ to be in every game on both sides, but that notion comes from years of status quo, rather than any sort of valid design reasoning. League could very well not be marksman-centric, and I think it would in fact be tremendously beneficial to everyone if it weren't.","replies":[]}]}
