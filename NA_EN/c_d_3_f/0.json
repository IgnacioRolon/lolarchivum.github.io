Objectively speaking, they all meet our minimum requirements, but some should perform differently in-game than others, especially when comparing consumer vs production hardware. You may want to reach out to the [**PCPartPicker**](http://pcpartpicker.com/forums/) or [**/r/BuildAPC**](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/) communities for extra insight into this decision.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"C D 3 F","date":"2017-01-18T04:28:21.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! Ill definitely check them out and see what they got to say but would you be able to say by these stats which would be best for league? I understand they meet requirements though! Thanks again for the quick reply\n Appreciate it","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T23:46:54.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'd have to test them in real matches to verify their performance. Objectively, the last option has the most recent video card, but 2GB of RAM is pretty rough on anything newer than Windows 7. The Q6600 is a rock solid chipset that was a huge hit with gamers for a long time, but it's also aging fairly rapidly at this point. \n\nThere are a lot of things to be said about each computer and their components, which is definitely a big reason why I suggested getting additional input from those awesome communities. :)","replies":[{"poster":"C D 3 F","date":"2017-01-19T00:49:20.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have listened to your advice.
