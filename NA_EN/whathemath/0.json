If the base damage went up by rank in Q, it would still cut his damage versus minions by more than half (110 bonus damage at rank 5 currently, PBE damage caps out at 40) and Q max would still feel actually meaningful. Having the damage go up by Shen&#039;s level just makes putting points into Q feel worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2017-04-08T00:14:17.906+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"His Q's % health damage still ranks up like before. \n\nQ's new base damage component doesn't scale with rank because it is intended to add base line effectiveness for farming, not increased dueling power over the course of the lane phase which is already provided by his % health damage rank up.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky Moniker","date":"2017-04-08T00:44:09.602+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still doesn't make it feel impactful to put points into","replies":[{"poster":"whathemath","date":"2017-04-08T02:23:45.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, putting points into Q will make your empowered autos deal like 2-3 more damage to minions per rank.

My point is that even if the base damage increased by rank in shen's q, it would still be a huge nerf to his pushing power. Right now shen gets +20 dmg to minions per rank. If riot implemented my idea, it would be +5 dmg to minions per rank. That's still a big drop in damage AND it would retain some of the impact from putting points in Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-04-08T22:46:18.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Borsuk,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G0EfhUo1,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-08T15:55:34.704+0000)\n>\n> The whole point of this nerfs is that Riot wants Shen to suck ass at killing minions because he doesn&#x27;t pay the price other splitpushers do(not being able to join their team without burning a summoner spell).

For example, W could give him and any other ally in it a small shield when its up or have an invulnerability zone. His E could grant him a shield per enemy hit by it. And his Q.... could well remain the same? Shen stood out as a top laner because of his ability to use shields. It would be cool to see something like that. Now while that may be broken with his W, you could remove the reduction given when an ally is in his zone. It would definitely make him more dynamic to use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zephyrous X","date":"2017-04-08T03:37:38.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen will still get played because his ult is so good so this nerf is fucking dumb","replies":[]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2017-04-07T22:31:42.110+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Only logical way to play Shen now is going Support Shen and maxing E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acheron16","date":"2017-04-13T22:13:19.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll just state this here:\n\nI don't want to play Shen.
