I don't even use any third-party software related to the gaming and I tried closing all the unnecessary apps, and I also tried restarting the client, restarting the laptop and reinstalling the client. Even my friends who are running tons of third-party apps are still loading normally. Nothing has worked so far. Please tell me what to do.

Was a struggle to delete it and immediately after deleting it experienced same issue as OP (i.e. league wont start after showing a brief logo). I was waiting for Riot response on this thread and tried to play some other games in the meantime and realized my battle net launcher would not work either. Did more research online and discovered that the xunyount.dll messes with lsp and was suggested a winsock reset, followed through steps here https://iihelp.iinet.net.au/Resetting_Network_Adapter_%28Winsock_Reset%29. Game is now working. Presumably windows will sort it self out (seeing as op was able to eventually get in), but i did not have to wait half an hour and hope. My internet was a bit sluggish immediately after restarting computer so follow the steps above at your own peril (but it is completely up to speed now). Leaving this here for anyone with the same problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NA Noob","date":"2018-06-15T01:22:38.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have the exact same issue here, i played till maybe 11 pm yesterday , but today when I got through champion select i could not actually get into the game.
