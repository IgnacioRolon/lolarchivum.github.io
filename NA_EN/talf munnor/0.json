I have been having some really **annoying** problems. When I am using the client a message box will pop up saying I have been disconnected then the whole launcher will reboot again. I have had problems in the pass with the infamous \"PVP.net\" bug so this might be the case here. The thing is though, I **rarely** **ever** have any disconnect issues in game. Instead I can get dc'd 6-8 times in the client while I wait to load into a game. The disconnect only last a split second but with the new client that has to restart every time I dc it is getting really annoying. Is there something you can do on your end to fix this bug? \r\n\r\nThanks for creating an awesome community!\r\n- Talf Munnor\r\n\r\np.s. I have disabled \"iphelper\" and \"ipv6\" in my network settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T05:57:34.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't sound like as much of a bug as it does sound like a common connection issue. These are typically caused by specific network settings that simply don't play well with League. I'd advise you to check your network settings against our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as those steps commonly fix these issues.\n\nLet me know if this worked.","replies":[]}]}
