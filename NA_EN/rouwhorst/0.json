Welcome to patch 5.9 - the one where we ship some new behind-the-scenes changes (check out that new attack move functionality and changes to combat text), deliver a sparkling new Ashe champion update, trade Cinderhulk's champion-chewing power for jungle-clearing fire, and dole out some balance tweaks in the name ofchampion diversity.","url":"http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-59-notes#patch-renekton","image":"http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/patch_notes_banner_25.jpg?itok=TfCRtWXy"},"up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"In patch 7.10 there is this bugfix:  &quot;BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Ruthless Predator&rsquo;s lockout time was shorter than intended (0.525 seconds instead of 0.75)&quot;.\nHowever, in patch 5.9 there is this fix: &quot;SELF STUN ON EMPOWERED CAST 0.75 seconds &rArr; 0.5 seconds&quot;.\n\nSo over 2 years the cast time has been 0.5 seconds, but now it gets reverted with the excuse it was a bug?\n\nI have tested this in game and it feel absolutely horrible. After the visual cast time Renekton will just stay put for another while before moving on. (The empowered cast visual matches the lockout time a lot better but it's still long)\nPlease revert these 0.75 seconds to 0.525 or 0.5 seconds again.\n\nlink to the test result: https://streamable.com/gtb1n\nRecorded in 60fps\nAs you can see, after the first ~14 windup frames, the actual attack goes trough (2 hits) and takes about 14 (all damage dealt) to 20 frames (animation complete) then there follows 30 frames in which Renekton pretty much does nothing. This is about 0.83 seconds so not 0.75 as was said...\n\nI really like bugfixes but when you remove an advantage he has had over 2 years which has become a major part of his kit, then it gets unacceptable.\n\nThe E fixes were a result of patch 7.9, I noticed in game that the dash was slower. \nThe dash speed still seems to increase with movement speed, but this is nowhere mentioned, can this be confirmed?\n-I checked this and there seems to be no significant increase.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-05-18T21:34:47.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey man.
