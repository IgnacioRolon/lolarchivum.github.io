Expose Weakness being in the ferocity tree seams out of place and would be more fitting in the Cunning tree (it makes sense for a cunning person to expose a weakness...), and for Expose Weakness to fit into the cunning tree, assassin should be moved over to the ferocity tree. (I don&#039;t play too many assassins but I would expect they would go full dps and spec into, 21 in cunning and 9 in ferocity or the other way round), even though this would make the tier 2 masters in the ferocity tree seam  plain (A 3% bones in a given situation or a 2/3% bonus with a trade--off). \r\n\r\nAdd a comment on your opinion if you think this should be changed too, ty for reading","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-03-03T11:45:41.693+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly, that would go totally against the point.\nAssasin was added to the low tier cunning tree so assasins, which are supposed to go cunning due stormraiders/thunderlords, have a masteries they actually like down there.\nExpose weaknesses was added to the ferocity tree so there are options for no-glasscannons.

In Cunning, you have Runic Affinity, which increases neutral buff duration, and Secret Stash, which improves sustain by giving your champion biscuits.\n\nFerocity has no options for champions that don't want to deal extra damage and either don't want or can't use the sustain that Feast provides. For aggressive supports that want to run any of the Ferocity masteries, they have no good options for their tier 1 keystones. Likewise, Cunning has no options for solo laners that don't want the sustain that biscuits provide, so assassins don't have any good aggressive options in the tree.\n\nSwitch the masteries around, and suddenly there's a lot of overlap.
