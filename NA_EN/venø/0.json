It's only a fairly minor increase, but 63 is already pretty damn high, and I'd like it to not go any higher. Is anyone else having similar issues? Is there a fix? I already ran through the network guide Riot has put out. It's definitely not on my end because every other game runs how it normally would, and my speed test put up the same results it always does. Something is wrong on league's end and I'm not sure what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-31T21:43:44.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your routing to the game server may have changed and causing this, or a more local connection issue.
