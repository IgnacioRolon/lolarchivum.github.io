After pressing accept, my laptop freezes then restarts. I've tried to launch it 3 times, and it hasn't done anything. I'm not sure if it's just me since my brother said that he had no problems when starting up league.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T20:33:58.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, this sounds like a potential issue with the laptop and I'm not sure we'd be able to help with any hardware based problems.  On the off chance, a recent update with Windows has caused issues for some players.  Specifically, the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) auto enabled and has been the cause of some weird problems.  Try disabling that and see if it fixes the restarts.  Otherwise, it may need to be checked for hardware problems.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Self Loaf","date":"2016-10-01T02:06:28.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah my laptop was just bugging out, thanks haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SqueeSquee","date":"2016-09-30T09:20:30.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also having the same issue...
