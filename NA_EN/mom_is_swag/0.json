What gives?\n> \n> The drop rate for key fragments is a curve, not a line. With each fragment you earn, the chance to earn your next one goes down slightly. This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n> \n> We wanted to give players who didn't play as frequently a good drop rate for keys, without making it feel like farming was mandatory if you wanted keys.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T21:49:17.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quality post right here.
