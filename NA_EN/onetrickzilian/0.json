There were 3 games on which I was punished, but this one was the 1st in the line.  \nWas it a reason open my case based on this game ? Well, debatable, especially when RIOT can read the whole chat and not just only my respond to really sever toxic and disgusting flaming on my family.

Now if you are comparing this case to a criminal situation, then I would submit that perhaps you didn't stick around past the guilty verdict on that case you were sitting in on.  After a verdict is passed in a criminal case, the circumstances, mitigating and otherwise, are considered in the sentencing portion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-01-07T19:13:41.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The circumstances were looked at before you even started the game.\n\nIn legal systems there's a concept about responding appropriately to the situation.
