You can disguise as 1 hp soraka and go bait enemy abilities and murder them, even though it an ap item, in my games , my entire team buys it and disguise as 1 hp ally and walk mid lane while enemy staring at 5 bananas throwers with no hp dancing (You copy their emotes also) .\r\n\r\nI would like Trickster&#039;s Glass to come back any time soon, it was a unique item and makes game more fun and deceiving. \r\n\r\nIf not , at least as a champion ability, disguising as champion ability sounds fun and it makes game more interesting. You can disguise and go to your disguised champion lane , if the disguised champion is stealth this would make it much easier to gank  e.g. your jungler backed , he has few hp from last fight / camps he fought , disguise as him , make sure no one knew he backed, go to lane but pretend your not gonna suicide to bait enemy abilities, ultimate or even summoner spells or escapes .\r\n\r\nHere is the Item stats:\r\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/0332fe34c1674785bb52013ee4a95300.png","replies":[{"poster":"Bunnymap","date":"2017-01-22T17:25:00.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They tried this with Leblanc, but it was incredibly frustrating and was almost impossible to balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silencega","date":"2017-01-22T16:46:12.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You thought 10% HP add, but actually it's a full HP boop drag","replies":[]}]}
