Select your sound icon on the bottom right of your desktop and select volume mixer.  There should be a bar specifically for the client (while it's open), where you'll be able to tone that down.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Gulakoth","date":"2016-09-22T17:10:59.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah that was the issue, how stupid of me, thank you for the fix lol","replies":[]}]}]}
