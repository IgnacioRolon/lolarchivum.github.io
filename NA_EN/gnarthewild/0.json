Click OK to close the application.\" That error is seriously annoying. An issue that I felt was unfixable before this one, was something about directx but I forgot the error. Anyways, to explain how I got these errors, my pc was apparently not being able to update or something like that, so I had to reset or refresh my pc. It said it wasn't going to mess with any of my files, but it deleted tons of my games, and files. Google and directx was apparently one of them (I found the directx file in my folder). It wasn't really a problem at first, until I tried to get into a game. It said something about the file directx not being there, and I couldn't get in. So I looked up the error and found out I should redownload directx. Nothing happened, I don't know why, but it didn't download. It just wouldn't run. I restarted my pc and tried to get into a custom game, now im getting this error. No idea what to do. Help, please.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T02:32:06.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be able to resolve this by taking two steps.\n\n1.
