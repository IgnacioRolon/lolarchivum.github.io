The thing with Blitz isn't that he's OP, because he isn't, and his grab isn't hard to dodge once you get the hang of it. Not to mention most people who play him can't land a grab to save their mothers.\n\nThe thing is, if he ever does grab someone who isn't a tank, they're pretty much dead because the knock-up and silence followup will keep them helpless long enough for the rest of the team to burst them. It doesn't matter if you can dodge 9 out every 10 hooks when the one you couldn't is essentially a death sentence (which is ironic considering Thresh's actual Death Sentence is a hook that's a lot healthier).\n\nWin or lose, a game against Blitz is never enjoyable, and that's why people hate him.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-10-23T04:37:47.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You stun somebody as Elise, they're probably dead. \n\nYou charm somebody as Ahri, they're probably dead. \n\nYou bind someone as Lux, they're probably dead.\n\nYou land Q as Naut, they're probably dead.\n\nYou hook someone as Thresh, they're probably dead. \n\nYou stun someone as Veigar, they're probably dead. \n\nYou knock up someone as Vel'Koz, they're probably dead. \n\nYou combo someone as Alistar, they're probably dead. \n\n_______________\n\nHopefully this has enlightened you as to why Blitz is not an issue.
