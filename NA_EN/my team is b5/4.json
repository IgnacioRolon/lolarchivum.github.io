The quests are much easier to follow, when you go into a random off the beaten path area it isn&#039;t just an empty area with nothing to do, there&#039;s at least a few enemies in there and some cool rewards for exploring. I just started crafting weapons and armors using upgraded perks for them and i&#039;ve made some really useless pistols into essentially long range rifles that do good damage...(you get a particular type of ammo all the time in the game and not a lot of the other types of ammo, so that&#039;s why i made this pistol a rifle)\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve got a good 5 hours into it or so and am liking it, which is a nice surprise.","replies":[]}
