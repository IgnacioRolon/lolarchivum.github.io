The reason it feels like friends and family can't help is because that takes you the furthest away from what is easy.  Friends and family can help.  They are the only thing that can help.

They don't work well in the modern age, and in some countries they do basically nothing.  As has already been said the United States most often uses dynamic IP addresses, meaning if you don't specifically set up your network to have a static IP your IP will change periodically.  It will change and you won't have to lift as much as a finger to do it.\n\nWhat that means is if an IP ban is used the banned IP will be given to someone else, and if they also play the game in question they will randomly lose access at no fault of their own.\n\nOn top of this it's insanely easy to change your IP.  That's one of the many big reasons people stopped doing IP bans, it's just so easy for the average person to get around it.\n\nThere are countries that can actually ban people from a game.  China in particular can do it, but that's because internet use there is tied to a number similar to our social security number.  You can ban access from that particular number, and that stops that person from accessing something.  Western countries do not have this.\n\nYou're asking why Riot can't do a thing, but you were told multiple times why they can't do it.  You're wishing that they could in spite of the facts right now.  This isn't about greed, it's about you looking for an easy solution to a complicated problem.\n\nIt's time for you to walk that harder road.  Go to your family and tell them what is going on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-07-08T22:46:55.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought there were two other cases just with T1 it officially became known as an ID ban.","replies":[{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2018-07-09T01:22:58.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Imperial Pandaa,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vHdHJdwt,comment-id=000700000001,timestamp=2018-07-08T22:46:55.053+0000)\n>\n> I thought there were two other cases just with T1 it officially became known as an ID ban.\n\nI can think of maybe 2 or 3 others.  I think one was a ban from competative play, not a full ID ban, and was reversed after a period.  Although it triggered similar outcry about him getting \"unbanned\", he didn't regain any permabanned accounts, he was just allowed back into the pro circuit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Painted Celt","date":"2018-07-08T22:00:36.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Man, take this as an opportunity to prove to yourself your ability to develop self-discipline.  That will translate into the most value to you going forward into other areas of your life.

The only way Riot could probably permanently IP ban you would be to ban everyone using your Internet Service Provider in your local area.  Otherwise, your IP ban would likely be transferred to someone else within a month, which would be unfair to them and would unban you.","replies":[{"poster":"All Muted Gl Hf","date":"2018-07-08T22:05:24.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are right, i would give anything needed, my physical adress or isp , anything needed to be out of this game for good, trust me i tried willpower long enough and im tired","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-07-08T22:50:20.118+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then an ip ban won't help.

Try to find a hobby that you can be happier obsessing over or devote yourself to career/education.  The issue you'll find with that is that you're still replacing one unfulfilling habit with another no matter what you do, and success in work or art can't make you happy forever either but they might give you something to feel good about for a while.  The trick is to keep growing and have some sense of progress balanced by a sense of freedom/control of future opportunities (more doors opening than closing) or you will fall into nihilism and despair.  For now, try to focus on what you can do to best increase your future opportunities so that you can choose which you want to pursue later in life.
