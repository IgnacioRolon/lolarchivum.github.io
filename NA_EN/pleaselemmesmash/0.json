Never has a game run so smooth, and also drop to 30 frames at times. Never has a game frozen my entire computer just for alt tabbing, or for alt-f4-ing. Never has a game punished me so annoyingly for breaking my computer. This game needs some serious optimizing. My computer can obviously run the game. So why all of the problems?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-01T15:21:33.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tabbing out while on full screen forces your connection to try and catch up on everything that's happened while you were tabbed out, so it's trying to restablize.  It's basically throttling your connection.  Switching to Borderless or Windowed might help resolve that.\n\nYou want to also make sure your pc is meeting[ recommended specs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements), and regularly tune up your PC settings and drivers.
