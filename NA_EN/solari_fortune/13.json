Given her character and role, she should have been in the front and the focus of this splash art, as the other two are characters that hide behind/are protected by her.  Instead, it looks the other way around. She doesn't even get her own portion of the splash art, having to literally share half of it with Jayce, while the other get their own portions, devoid of anyone else, and get to be the focus of it.  I wouldn't even be able to tell Sejuani was the focus of her own portion if you didn't blue out Jayce - and consequently blur literally 3/4's of her in the process.  She's also of very obvious lower quality; just look at the loading screen slice.  It's bland, blurry, and her face just looks awkward and flat.  She should have some more emotion there.\n\nCome on, Reav3.  Once (Beast Hunter) was bad, but twice in a row now?
