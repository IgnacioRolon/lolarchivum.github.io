I do not like the older e-sport skins because they look too much like walking logos with ridiculous designs. Making skins that look good, while still paying respect to the winning team with colours and subtle details like the wings, is far better. The approach should be: if you know the team's logo, you can recognize the colours and some properties of the skins. If you don't, they just look like really cool skins.\n\nMy favourite part of the new skins must be the badass Olaf and his recall. You have managed to make him look like a high-fantasy viking without the design being similar to any of his older skins. He reminds me of the Vrykul, mixed with Warcraft's dwarven aesthetics.\n\nLove it!
