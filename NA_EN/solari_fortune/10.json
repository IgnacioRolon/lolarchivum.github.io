I *might* have already asked this before and if so I'm sorry, but what does the skins team think of leaving the skins on PBE for two cycles rather than only one?

There would also be a larger window to pivot on content.\n\nOn the flip side, players could be upset that the content is sitting on PBE for so long, as opposed to shipping on live. I'm speaking from experience for the last one, as we left content like DJ Sona up on PBE for longer than a cycle and there was a flood of players asking why it wasn't just shipped to live. Similar things have happened when we leave skins up on PBE for a bit longer during the holidays 'cause our release cadence is a bit off. \n\nWe could also fall into the scenario of, 'we gave you these suggestions, why aren't you changing anything? You clearly have time.' You'd be right, we would have more time, but when we talk about suggestions, we weigh in if the suggestion makes the skin better, but also if it meets the pillars/goals that we set out to hit when making the skin. Some of that comes down to subjectivity of art, and in a lot of cases, we rely on our craft experts in a particular discipline. \n\nSeriously though, there are some really awesome ideas that players come up with that we do implement - like giving a jade dragon tattoo to Firecracker Jinx! \n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't think that these are sentiments that couldn't be changed, but right now, it would be a concern for me.  We could likely mitigate some of it with more transparency with why we are and aren't changing things. That's something I've personally been trying to get better with, as opposed to just saying, 'Thanks, but we won't be making changes.'\n\nThis is a bit out of my wheelhouse when it comes to if/how we would make it happen, so I don't feel comfortable wagering bets on how we could do it, haha. BUT, these are some of my personal thoughts on the subject. :)","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-08-02T08:16:19.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, thanks for you reply as always :)\n\nWhile I get your concerns, I want to try to give a different point of view: \n1.  when DJ sona stayed on PBE for longer than usual (with good reason, being an ultimate skin), people were used to seeing one patch worth of content on PBE, skins stay on PBE for two weeks and then are released. DJ Sona staying on PBE for longer was an exception, it was not expected, not standard. If skins by default stayed on PBE for longer, I think/hope people would get used to it. But then again, there will always be people asking 1000 times when the next piece of content comes out, so would this really change, for better or worse?\n2.  I'm perfectly aware that not every suggested change will be accepted, I don't think that's the point of the problem. What makes me a bit sad is when you clearly say \"this is a good suggestion, but the skin was released on PBE on wednesday, now it's friday and we can't change that anymore\", meaning that the suggestion would be implemented if you had more time. Something similar happened with the tattoos on PP Fiora's chromas, for example. I know that changes take time, and that when you release a skin on PBE you aren't in your office sitting around and twiddling thumbs but are already working on the next content, but we also often can't give feedback within two days since the skins hit PBE.\n\nI know it's not your responsibility to make this kind of decisions and I appreciate a lot that you took the time to answer meaningfully nonetheless. I also won't get mad over this, I just wish sometimes there was more time to implement suggestions. \nI have to say though that I can see that while you can't always implement feedback on the skins currently on PBE, that you keep it in mind when working on future skins, and that's something I appreciate a lot. Keep it up, and send a hug to all people on skins team! :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-08-02T17:18:28.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey again!\n\n> I think/hope people would get used to it. But then again, there will always be people asking 1000 times when the next piece of content comes out, so would this really change, for better or worse?\n\nRight, as I've said, I don't think it's something that we couldn't change in terms of perception, it's just a current concern I would have. :) \n\n> What makes me a bit sad is when you clearly say \"this is a good suggestion, but the skin was released on PBE on wednesday, now it's friday and we can't change that anymore\", \n\nAllow me to clarify what I mean by saying something is a good suggestion. I comment on things when I think they're good suggestions because I, as Katey, think it would be a cool idea. It doesn't mean the team would agree with me and want to implement said change. \n\nSuggestions that I see when new content hits PBE are brought to the team, and we discuss 'em. Ultimately, the team makes a call on if they agree with the suggestion, and if so, what scope does this add to the project/what's feasible. If we're living in the world you'd suggested (2 week PBE cycles) there would still be *some* things we still wouldn't be able to accommodate, such as new VO, VO processing, and some larger animation work. This is due to the point I'm about to make below!\n\n>  when you release a skin on PBE you aren't in your office sitting around and twiddling thumbs but are already working on the next content\n\nYep, we've got ~8-10 skins in flight at a time, so we allocate x amount of time to each, which includes bug fixing and potential feedback adjustments. \n\nCurrently, if we were to make a larger scale change to something on PBE, we're taking away from development of something else, which means the unreleased content may not get that extra love it deserves. \n\nAs I'd mentioned before, I really can't speak to if/how any of this would change, but this is more to give you an idea of how we currently work and the bumps we hit during development now. \n\nI totally get that can be frustrating, especially when you're passionate about content and want to help shape it; it can be a really exciting feeling when a change you've suggested is implemented! \n\nOut of curiosity, would you mind dropping me an instance of when you had suggested feedback and it wasn't implemented?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-08-04T23:05:58.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, yeah, sometimes weekends may get in the way.

We also changed the violin SFX because players felt that playing an invisible violin seemed awkward. This was updated to use Vandal Twitch's foley. \n\nThe Venom Cask SFX weren't changed because it's one of the clear indicators on this particular champion, and we felt this would maintain the skill's readability for the sake of gameplay. \n\nI know the knife was also a hot topic, but this was explained; it was a design choice that we knowingly made to avoid it reading like a spike at the end of his tail.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-08-04T22:55:31.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if you saw the final changes, but we updated it so that it uses foley from Vandal Twitch based on the initial feedback that was given regarding the invisible violin. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2017-08-02T17:28:45.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Omega Squad?
