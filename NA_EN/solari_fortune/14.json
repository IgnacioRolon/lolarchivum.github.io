Needs more blistering skin and vibrancy to the raw, exposed muscle to really capture that.\n\nHowever, the most important part of Trundle's original lore to me was how he accepted the disease as his source of power to the damnation of his tribe. You can't really pull off the same sense of scrappiness with the current model anymore, but I still get the sense of a solitary, yet confidant nature from this one. \n\nCast another ray of sunlight so that it's not just showing off his taut abs but also the lower diagonal of his face with the savage grimace and the diseased gash of his face and I think the splash would be more the business with little else needing to change.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2016-04-29T04:40:40.311+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Is that potentially new Urgot behind Trundle in the Lil' Slugger splash?\n\nAlso, love how the new Traditional Trundle is presenting his junk, almost inviting one to please him.
