Visible moderation consisting of:\na. visible warning counter - no fucking questions asked\nb. comments not being completely deleted, unless it was a multi-post, which were either removed to combined, depending on the content. You could also say sorry in the doubled post and ask for a removal there; nobody would make a problem\nc. threads posted in wrong sections were moved to the correct one in most cases\nd. comments with \"bad\" content were in most cases censored and a colored comment was added by a moderator\n2. Strict set of rules. For example \"No swearing\" meant \"No swearing\". Period.\n3. Moderation which followed those rules, instead of issuing punishment based on their personal butthurt.\n4. Moderator whose behavior didn't follow #3 were warned themselves and on repeated offense removed.\n\nNobody ever had any problems with it.\n\nLeague of Legends has none of that.\n\nBringing any issues with moderation to the Riot Support only shows that they can't deal with it either due to lack of power or knowledge, so bothering with them is a complete waste of time.\n\n> Want me to share my Syndra folders too? _Why am I having a deja vu there as well..._\n> Or better yet: share yours too!\n> _Onedrive, Google Drive, Dropbox...surely you have either._\n\nI never really used any of those things, so I dunno.\n\n> Then there is when you say &quot;thank you&quot;. But I accept skins as well. ;)\n> _One just gotta try, right?_\n\nDo or do not.
