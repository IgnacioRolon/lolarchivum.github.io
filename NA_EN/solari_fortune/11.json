This was a problem in the old client (one of the many issues with Lore/Narrative at the time), but shouldn't there be as much space as needed in the shiny new client to tell stories?\n\nI mean, If the goal is to get players to read the longer stories on the Universe site, shouldn't these pages include a direct link to the website?  Also, shouldn't the focus of these be on pitching the entire story like a movie and not on a minimal word count?\n\nHell, the last time there was an attempt to shorten lore stories for the client a Rioter on the newly created \"Narrative\" department ended up getting a death threat.  (It was unfortunate and unjustified, but their flippant attitude towards lore fans was horrible.  Especially on the heels of the Great Retcon, the announcement that removed summoners/players from the game's story and shoved the entire established mythos into the toilet.)\n\nWe'll see what happens when Varus's story gets released, but history is not on Narrative's side.","replies":[{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2017-11-29T01:01:49.768+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"The word count is a formatimg issue, the new champion page in the client is not fitted  for long bios.

My comments about in-game are about how players react to Riot changing lore, not about lore needing to be or not be in-game, or even lore needing to explain the game.\n\n People have been playing as these characters for a long time - they interact often on a daily basis. That is a different kind of relationship than most other relationships between audience and story. People like Game of Thrones characters, they like their stories, they identify with them. But they don’t interact with them on a daily basis (unless they are the most hardcore of fans - on forums, roleplaying, writing fanfic, whatever). There is a level of authorial control that George RR Martin has - he shapes the story and we are his audience. We are a level removed from the story - much more passive. My point is that there is a much different relationship between audience (players) and Riot (authors/creators) in a medium like LoL as well as between audience and characters (champs). Maining a champ makes for a much more active and personal relationship than reading a book and relating to a character. We all have that “hardcore” level of interaction with the characters. These personal relationships have existed for a while and so changing and retconning lore is more personal. Diana’s story can’t be the choice of the Riot author in the same way that Jaime Lannister’s story is the choice of GRRM. That’s my point.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2017-11-30T01:31:47.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear you. :-)\n\nI have some experience with this already - I was a commissioning editor for Games Workshop for years, working on fiction that accompanies games that a lot of people care very deeply about.

For example, the idea of turning Varus from a lone family man desperate for revenge to an imprisoned Darkin that two dumbass hunters somehow released must've come from a bunch of wonderful creative meetings (and I'm sure some very powerful cocktails).\n\nYou also say that reverting a bad decision will create player pain, but what about fixing the player pain the bad decisions initially created?  If the Varus reveal doesn't pan out like you hope, what then?  I've also heard some very mixed feelings about Nautilus's new story as well.\n\nI'm also curious about what the threshold _actually_ is.  Is it a majority of fans of the particular champ or a majority of overall players?

It&#x27;s the worry! :-P\n\nI deeply care for the Lore in League of Legends(hence my username)... but I feel that no matter how many times these Lore discussions come up between Rioters such as yourself and the more lore focused community nothing really gets changed. This I think is in part due to the situation that Lore is currently in with the majority of players. Many players simply do not care about Lore and only play the game and Lore has no impact on them. I understand that you will not simply cater to the vocal few who hold these discussions because there are many more people out there who do not come into these discussions but still have an opinion. (Ideally I would love to see more Surveys, especially regarding the current state of Lore. They may give some insights and metrics on how well received the updated Champion Bios are post release and the lore of the newer champions)\n\nI have been here since 2010, I have seen the various changes to the Lore of the past 7 years. From my perspective(hopefully keeping the Ruby-tinted glasses off) some of the best Lore that Riot has is the older champion Bios. Some of my favorite stories are that of Lee Sin, Lux, and Irelia. One of my favorite parts of the old lore were the \"League Judgements\" because they brought a whole new level of depth to the characters. In my mind when I try to compare the current biographies of the newer champions, it ends up one-sided because of the lack of depth the newer champions have. Newer champions lack a solid reason as to \"why\" they are a champion. (I understand Summoner's and the Institute of War were retconned)\n\nI make an effort to give critiques on Champion's bios when they are released and I enjoy the discussions. There are always multiple points regarding the good and the bad of the champion bios in these discussions but it seems that many of the discussions end up turning towards a more negative direction. It pains me because it really does feel that the years of participation in Lore discussions have been wasted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-12-01T00:46:30.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=AE9GL99e,comment-id=0000000200000000000100010000,timestamp=2017-11-30T01:54:58.801+0000)\n>Again, I&#x27;d say that _**Riot shouldn&#x27;t ever change something &quot;because we can&quot;...**_\n\nAnd yet, we now have Varus, a story that was changed just because you could do it.\n\nJust because you guys could tie in a comic book with a music video and give the LGBT community something more than Taric to latch on to.\n\nI also don't see how this change improves the story.

I was personally baffled by how she was retconned from someone shaped by the horrors of war, a symbol to her people who'd ended up falling because she couldn't watch what was done to them without acting, into some daft, celestial unicorn girl who got conned by a dude who wanted her heart for a potion or elixir. \nOne had depth, not to mention a fair bit of tragedy, she lost a large part of who she was because she gave into anger and despair. Is there a chance you'll move back to her having been shaped by the Noxus/Ionia war, and closer to how her lore used to be, when you eventually get around to changing her?\n\nOh, and is Lux one of the 15-20 champions who got retconned, or was she still more or less torn from her family so she could be recruited into Demacia's military? Getting to see the darker sides of Demcia in her Observation/Reflection was one of my favorite tidbits of lore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2017-11-29T03:16:48.228+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I would believe that post  three years ago regarding riot deciding to take a new narrative direction was a good enough of a “warning” to most people but I guess not. \n\nWhat kinda of context do you want about a ret con?

All of these are \"the lore\"... but a lot of it simply isn't relevant to the majority of people playing League.\n\nThe more content we have, and the more it gets updated (note, not \"retconned\") over time, the more we need a place outside of the client to correlate it all - i.e. Universe. Consider it like the Wikipedia of League lore, for now. :-)\n\nEDIT: A lot of older champions don't have the three basic elements I mentioned. They are now getting them, in addition to the production of new content for new champions and champion updates.

As an editor I looked at the lore content in the client every day, and I cringed. It was terribly inconsistent. Some champions had THOUSANDS of words, some had a single sentence. Some had quotes, some didn't. Some just had plain bad lore, well out of date compared to everything else.\n\nThat's what we're addressing, here, and along the way various other teams at Riot have weighed in and asked us to make changes, to enable other improvements and new stuff in the future.\n\nThe champions are all consistent now, in client.

They do not seem to be new ideas, but retreads of the same solutions that Rioters have claimed to be working towards in the past. I think holding Universe at arms length from the client is a mistake. The client ought to be the primary point from which players interact with everything League-related.

Karma is one of the 15-20 champions you did this to and refuse to address? Why did you do this? She is very bland, has no place in the world, and is not very creative. This character is a Avatar the AIrbender knock off with nothing. Don't tell me . . . . . .  give you time to give us a story about Karma buying shield enhancing items and sitting in the back pressing E+R? You guys basically removed her role as a leader and mage.

Everything in the client is made to give you as less information as possible. For example, I couldn´t believe that you couldn´t look up the scalings on abilities in a game with such a competitive background and it took me a year to \"discover\" that there is actually more lore to my favorite champ than assumed. In addition to that, you also have to TOGGLE ON additional info in the new runepages to get any useful information out of it. And this turns itself off every time you close the game.\n\nriot could i please upgrade my scrublord-client-9000 to something that takes the game at least a little bit serious and doesn´t treat me like a 9year old\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2017-11-29T04:58:30.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=AE9GL99e,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-28T23:47:45.027+0000)\n>\n> Correct.
