I hope it doesn't happen for any of u out there but if you already have the same problem as me please comment below.RIOT PLEASE DO SOMETHING.{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-06T01:54:02.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd suggest first going into the client options and turning on **close client during game** to see if that lets the game run a little smoother.
