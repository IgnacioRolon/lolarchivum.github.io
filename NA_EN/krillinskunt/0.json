What do you do when you encounter a person who intentionally griefs the game? I don't think you do anything at all, when called out, the person calling the griefer is banned. My language wasn't pleasant, sure. It probably would be considered toxic. It's not meant to be pleasant when you grief. So is griefing. \r\n\r\nIn fact, I'm sure I was banned by the person who I was teamed with (the one that was griefing). I offended him, he took his power and abused the ban hammer. Riot, your banning system is completely absurd. \r\n\r\nIt seems that you don't let the accused defend themselves and let the accuser (who also violates ToU) off free. My situation seems to be one of many on here. Riot, you're failing -- much like your habitual champion updates.","replies":[]}
