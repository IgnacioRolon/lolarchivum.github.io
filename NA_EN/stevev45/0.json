The wall lives for like 2 seconds or so. touching the wall stuns you the same way it does now.\n\n**What&#039;s better about it**\nMany stuns in this game have a trend where they are more reliable at close range, and harder to hit at long range. This allows Veigar to make defensive stuns while making offensive stuns still dodge-able. I think it would make trying to get out of the cage before it closes more interesting.\n\nIt might be harder to code, but hey, that&#039;s why you make the big bucks.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsohgder","date":"2015-08-15T07:01:23.798+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope RiotRepertoir sees this.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-15T07:17:59.064+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":2,"body":"I do see this, and I hope we can ultimately give some love to Veigar.

The old edge-stun mechanic was annoying for all parties, but there was something flavorful about the panicky \"land it or die\" minigame. I think it's important that Veigar have some way to react to divers, and some way to nail down an enemy for a megaburst.\n\nHis cage needs *something* new that can tie his kit together the way the old stun did. I'm not even sure it has to stun anymore. Maybe it should be impassable terrain with some kind of weird effect inside it. I don't know. But I think most Veigar mains would have agree pre-rework that, while most people thought of his R as his \"signature ability\", in truth it was always his ragecage. Those few times he got played in LCS, the commenters astutely focused on his stun as his most significant aspect. It's what makes him unique as a Champion. It needs some love.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-08-16T02:42:30.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Maybe it should be impassable terrain with some kind of weird effect inside it.

If/when we do something for Veigar, I'd like it to be the right thing.\n> \n> I don't really have a solution or any good news on this front right now, but it is something I would like to address.\n\nOn the one hand, I like that you're discussing Veigar so readily with the community. On the other hand, most of what I'm reading makes me want to grab the monitor and shake it violently while shouting, \"NO! NO! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? NO!\" (Like, \"Hmm, I think what people like about Veigar is that he's a Champion who can farm up a bunch, then just push one button and insta-kill an enemy!\") So, kind of a mixed bag.\n\nI don't have all the answers myself. But I think a good start would be to recognize that however miffed Riot was about Support Veigar taking over the Korean scene, Veigar **was a good Champion.** He had one of the most complex, multi-layered kits around, with lots of nuance. Sure, there wasn't that much to the EWQR combo, which is the first \"trick\" that one learned when playing Veigar. But you didn't get very far if all you did was wander around looking for someone to throw EWQR at. …I'm going to stop here before I go off on another rant. Suffice it to say that I've never seen a Champion with such an elegantly interconnected kit, with so much depth of strategy worked into it.\n\nReally, I think it's about time for me to just stop playing Veigar and find some new Champions. I'd been meaning to do that for a long time. More than once, before the rework, I said, \"okay, this is getting silly, you need to play some Champions who aren't Veigar.\" But…I had a hard time actually doing it. I kept going, \"Well, sure, but…first, just a few more Veigar games, I think I'm really starting to figure him out.\" Perhaps I should take the rework as an unpleasant but necessary motivation to finally drop him and try other Champions.\n\nSo, in a sense, I'm not sure why I'm getting so worked up over these discussions, or wasting so much time I don't have posting in them. I mean, at this point, I'd probably agree to just about any change just to roll the dice again. It's not like it's going to make him worse than he is now.\n\nI guess the frustration is that a lot of Rioters don't seem to understand how what they did in the post-DFG patch was not a \"tweak\" but a truly drastic rework. His stun, as stupid as the \"land the edge\" minigame was, nonetheless was the keystone for his entire kit. It informed every other skill he had. He is no longer the same Champion in any meaningful respect. I think that's where the frustration comes from: Riot does not seem to get how radical that change was. I wish I knew other Champions well enough to provide a good analogy. I don't know. Maybe like…yeah, I really can't come up with a good example. Maybe changing Cho'gath's Q from a delayed knock-up to an instant slow? That might be somewhat similar in how it would affect the rest of his kit.\n\n**tl;dr: It's the stun. The problem is his stun. The old stun was the lynchpin of his entire kit. The make-or-break issue with new Veigar is how Riot is going to make his stun interesting, and more importantly, how his stun can be altered to have meaningful interactions with his other abilities and overall playstyle.** ","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2015-08-16T02:43:56.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As long as it isn't completely terrible to play against like the old stun, Veigar needs it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cicote","date":"2015-08-15T12:00:27.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"WE HAVE AN ALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE! {{champion:45}}\nBut really, thank you for being so active on the boards and interacting with the community.
