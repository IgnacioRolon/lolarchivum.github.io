Morgana, Zyra and Zilean all considered support their primary role when the pre-season came about and that is why they got buffed in that way. Lulu is confusing but is against the trend.\n\nYour point of view regarding how well they do in solo lanes doesn't matter - Riot made the changes so their thoughts are the relevant ones. I find everyone on that list to be an excellent solo laner and love playing Zyra mid myself but that doesn't change that Riot considers them supports. The theory that they got mana regen buffs because Riot wanted to buff them makes no sense - first of all it's far too large a coincidence that Riot randomly wanted to buff basically every champion who can be both a support and a solo laner and second of all, there is absolutely no way that they'd desire to buff either Lulu or Morgana. Finally, if Riot were really deciding to buff champions like Karma and Zyra, then why not various other weak champions that got mana buffs? Why would they have left Syndra, who they've discussed being weak, with a paltry +50 base mana? It makes no sense.\n\nThe chances that Riot buffed Karma in exactly the same way that they buffed every single support for reasons other than thinking she's a support are ridiculously slim. It's almost certain that Riot balance her as a support and the pre-season changes are the perfect example of that. \"Maybe they just wanted to make Karma better?\" is a huge stretch with no real basis.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-02-24T17:24:29.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Again.

Her kit actually allows her to play two roles with different play styles. Who else can easily fit into another lane now? Lulu. What does Lulu do?

That prompted a rework which, overall, hasn't been particularly successful. It was done at a time when we didn't have a dedicated team for rewoks and frankly it shows in her kit. Revised Karma's a more functional, healthy champion, but also in many ways a pretty bland one, with a lot of tools on her kit that feel too familiar, even if there's some interesting nuance to their use. I wouldn't say she was weak, I'd certainly agree she wasn't sufficiently satisfying or distinct though.\n> \n> As to why we're not working on Karma at present the short version is that we felt other champions needed the work more or would benefit from it more. Concentrating the team's focus onto particular sub classes is also something we believe yields good results (multiple people exploring the same concepts at the same time results in better discussion, team support). As above pick mages and sustained damage mages are the classes that, overall, we felt would most benefit from some focused work, so we've chosen to work on those at this time.\n\nJust wondering, what made you guys pick mages over assassins or diving fighters? I'd seen a lot of posts from you guys talking about how you weren't fully satisfied with assassins and their sometimes lack of counterplay, or fighters that were just stat checks, so I was kinda surprised you picked immobile mages since I never saw you guys talking about game health issues with them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2016-02-24T13:03:11.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I happen to really enjoy the current Karma.

She has aoe to farm and clear waves, a very low cooldown poke, and a shield with a movespeed buff to help her get in and out of range safely. She has an obvious combo of EWRQ to land a snare into a mantra Q for a bunch of damage and provides a ton of utility for her team in fights.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2016-02-23T22:38:12.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I'm not arguing that, I already stated riot isn't doing that subclass so you really didn't need to drive that home to me.

She's a great poke mage and possibly the best mage at helping her team skirmish in the mid and late game.
