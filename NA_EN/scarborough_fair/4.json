Preseason and a lot of recent balancing changes really killed that excitement. Frankly, I just don't trust them with mages.

Remember the \"massive buff\" from the plant AI changes that did nothing to fix broken plant targeting priorities? And the reverted .5 second knockup duration on her ulti that was just too powerful? Clueless comments about her winrate in a vacuum. {{item:3151}} and {{item:3020}} aren't even listed as recommended items. Riot totally lacks any understanding of Zyra, her players, or how she functions in any given meta.\n\nOn the bright side, Riot has managed to give themselves lots of room to succeed with my expectations being as low as they are. Just think about all the most recent reworks: {{champion:82}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:82}}.
