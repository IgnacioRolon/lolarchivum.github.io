Essence-specific things? Or just RP purchasable? Or the whole lot?\r\n\r\nIf it's the whole lot, then why?\r\n\r\nWe've seen Chroma IP sales before, so that's nothing new, same with the mystery chests. However, now we have the various essence-locked icons, ward skin, Urfwick and emotes that are supposed to be essence-only, so if I accidentally mispent after not reading the text located in that singular location, what's the gig?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T21:31:09.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That shop closes on Nov 27th I believe, and I'm pretty sure the icons/wards/emotes/skins will all be going away as well. I'm actually willing to bet that you could maybe get a refund if it hasn't been too long and you haven't used that specific item too much yet, so it'd be worth sending a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) over to our billing team.","replies":[]}]}
