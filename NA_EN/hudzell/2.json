Nidalee is a jungler, if her traps wouldn't react to creeps (or in her case: jungle monsters) it would affect her clearing. Because she just has her spear to tag the monsters for the skill reset then. And Nidalee can place her traps in bushes in her jungle, to get vision for a counter jungler and marking him for extra benefits to punish him.\n\nTeemo Shrooms and Jhin's flowers are invisible and are actually meant for different tasks. Like making an ambush for the enemy, letting him step in the traps for burst damage and then follow up. And they can be used as an escape tool. Especially Jhin should place these traps the way he wants to escape through, so his following enemies step on them and he can follow up with his W to snare them, giving himself a speed buff and dealing damage. That's why they are invisible, because if they weren't, they wouldn't function for ambushes and escapes.\n\nThe purpose of Caitlyn's traps is totally different. They should be used as area denial and for sieging power. If minions would activate them, the traps would have absolutely 0 sieging power. Same if they would be destroyable. You have to keep in mind how the skill is meant to be used, you can't just blindly compare them to each other and say \"that champion doesn't have it, so that champion shouldn't either!\".","replies":[{"poster":"Thin Air","date":"2016-12-19T02:18:06.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee's traps have worked that way since well before she was a jungler.

Cait's traps allow her to burst people too you do understand that? She gets a free long range headshot out of it. \n\nCait already has the longest AA range in the game, and she can hold off an entire team just because of traps and the AA range when they activate. That's flat out unfun and it's unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2016-12-19T02:53:32.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee's traps worked like that since before she was a jungler, correct. In that time, Riot wasn't really focusing on giving all champions unique niches to fulfill, so that is no good argument for me as well. She is meant as a jungler now and will be balanced around that. The functionality that the traps trigger on creeps has to stay because of that.\n\nI didn't elaborate enough about Jhin it seems. Right now, Jhin's traps are used for the following tasks:\n- ambushes\n- escapes\n- wave clear\nI missed out the last one, sorry for that. Jhin's wave clear is pretty bad, especially if there are really big waves. He has a wave clear tool with his Q, but it will just kill 4 minions. If you have to clear a big wave, you will likely use his traps to kill the minions. With that functionality, his traps still can be used as escapes, you just have to place them at places minions usually are not walking through.\n\nHis traps are not area denial or sieging power. The fact that they are invisible contradicts the use as area denial and they are visible and destructable in tower range, so they don't function for sieges.\n\nThat's what I mean. Now look at Caitlyn's traps. She doesn't need them for wave clear, that's what her Q is for. They are clearly designed to deny walking paths for enemies and giving her the strength at sieging, which is her whole design.\n\nOf course I understand that she gets a long ranged headshot for them. That's why they work in sieging and controlling the movement of the enemy. They are punishing the enemy for stepping in them. If you make them targetable in tower range, they simply don't do anymore what they are actually designed for.\n\nYou may think it is unfun and unfair.... I disagree. Sieging is her main strength (that's why she has long range, she is a **siege** adc), the weakness for that playstyle is breaking the siege with flanking. I think she is managable, I never felt helpless against a Caitlyn. But maybe that is just me.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2016-12-18T00:03:01.518+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":15,"body":"Or you could stop being bad and walking on clearly obvious flashing red traps.\n\nBut thats none of my business.","replies":[{"poster":"hudzell","date":"2016-12-18T00:16:13.162+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":7,"body":"What about the times when she puts a trap under my reviving body as Aatrox?

Jhin's root is easier to dodge than Caitlyn's trap? K.\n\nYou also act like Caitlyn does not have any weaknesses at all which is simply untrue.

Her E. Jhins Root is a joke in comparison as a means of self peel to her Net.\n\n> You also act like Caitlyn does not have any weaknesses at all which is simply untrue.

He's not getting back into that fight until its mostly over, and when you're the ADC and the main source of damage, this becomes the nail in the coffin for if a team with Jhin wins a fight or not. \n\nI've seen Jhin's use it to open up in the begin for engages sure, but honestly, the overall impact of using it to engage feels weak. I've also have seen him use it to try and pick off stragglers, which at that point, becomes a mind game, again, nothing wrong with that. \n\nSure your top laner or mid laner might be going for him, but they typically won't be the highest DPS output barring maybe a Syndra (but wtf would a Syndra be doing near Jhin ulting from off screen?)\n\nJhin is strong, no doubt about it, but he also has his weaknesses on full display as well and no matter how much of a god you are with Jhin, you will never be able to conceal them, ever. Additionally, he falls off late game: the point in the game where everyone knows when late game has arrived. \n\nAs an assassin or even as a support, your window of killing him is clear: wait for him to ult or wait for him to use his 4th shot in which he has two seconds in which he can not fight back. Additionally, he's not going to be able to burn through four bullets to kill you before you kill him as an assassin. If you jump on him then, he's dead. Simple as that. \n\nCaitlin on the other hand, while she has her weaknesses, are a lot easier to hide, especially by someone who plays her well or for a long time. For an assassin, it's far more ambiguous in when to kill her or how. Her main weakness is a weak mid game - but mid-game power is often times difficult to assess by the average player. \n\nAnd also, lets be clear: the question at hand is not about Caitlyn being broken, almost none of these threads have actually been venting about her being broken, its about frustration, two completely different things. \n\nAsk any support, they'd rather play against a Jhin over a Caitlyn any day of the week.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2016-12-18T11:10:46.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that they gave her 6 traps to be out at once is what broke her.
