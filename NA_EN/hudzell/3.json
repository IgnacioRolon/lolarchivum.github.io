Go in the practice tool and see for yourself. I know what the hell im talking about because I confirmed it in the practice tool myself.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-06-26T12:28:08.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> will just briefly interrupt it for like 0.2 seconds \n\nYou just admitted I was right.
