If you all remember, at the start of this season, the infamous &quot;ADC in 2k17, lul,&quot; meme took reddit by storm, and it seemed like every other post was showing some play where this random ADC seemingly got mowed down by some tank with sunfire and iceborn gauntlet (usually poppy). Back then, I remember specifically trying to argue with the circle jerk nature of the meme, and if you check my post history, you&#039;ll probably find it, but it didn&#039;t seem to help anything. Everyone was convinced that ADC was weak, so people started to take {{champion:115}}  bot lane, which started with ImaQtpie, when he was infamous for taking stuff like GP, Mordekaiser and Yasuo bot lane, but to the hive mind, this didn&#039;t matter. They saw a mage bot lane and started screaming, &quot;look how weak we are, we can&#039;t even have our own lane! REEEEET!&quot; and in came the bombardment of Ziggs bot lane. At the time, I hadn&#039;t ranked my main up to Diamond, I was just playing fun stuff on smurfs, so I saw my fair share of low elo players taking Ziggs bot lane and proceeding to feed their ass off.\n\nHowever, the issue at this time never WAS that ADC&#039;s were weak, it was that {{champion:78}}  and any other tank that built Sunfire and Iceborn were just too strong, and first blood tower was so impactful and gold worthy at the time, Ziggs W helped grab it quickly. Alas, no one looked at it like that though, they saw a full tank poppy run down an adc, one shot hit, and lose a hundred health in the process. During this whole time no one stopped to think, &quot;Maybe Poppy&#039;s the problem,&quot; It was somehow every ADC being too weak to function.\n\nPoint is, Riot has infused the ADC class with too many tools to survive, and it started with the new support items({{item:3107}} {{item:3109}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3301}} ) , which again was the communities outcry to make support more, &quot;rewarding.&quot; Somehow riot decided to do this by just throwing items with stats at them, stats that specifically would buff up your ADC with either a: shield, heal, or life steal was the way to go. That was wrong.\n\nA new lifesteal mastery was introduced, and eventually, a tank mastery that allowed ADC&#039;s to literally sap health from their tanks when they took damage. {{item:3812}}  was introduced, giving them even more survivability on top of the newly released {{item:3026}}  and {{item:3046}} , turning them into drain tanks with insane late game carry potential that could take too much damage for any assassin to eat through with their newly gimped kits, so they faded into obscurity. \n\nSince Lethality was strong, ADC&#039;s started to build that, and abuse that, giving them both a strong mid game and late game. Riot saw this as a problem, and instead of changing the items to be more rewarding for assassins, or for gods sake simply making them _melee only_ they decided to nerf said items, then buff Crit items over time, with price decreases and just straight up damage buffs. I don&#039;t think anyone here is going to argue with crit being weaker than lethality at the time, but that doesn&#039;t mean it needed as much buffs as it was granted, especially considering the raw survivability options the ADC class was given considering they were designed around being squishy and easy to take down when jumped on top of.\n\nThis is why champions like {{champion:40}}  and {{champion:117}}  are strong, because the ADC class is simply TOO STRONG. They revolved completely around buffing up their ADC with point and click abilities, and now with other items as well. Their winrate has ALWASY fluctuated around how strong the ADC class is as a whole, and Janna has ALWAYS been a problem because of it. To me, it&#039;s ridiculous that she is only getting complaints after reaching an **INSANE 58% WINRATE.** I have ALWASY complained about janna, back when she had a 54% winrate or 53%, and I ALWAYS banned her until Jayce and kennen became meta. Whenever I did, of course I was downvoted, but I also knew I was right.\n\nBecause of all this, the problem is too deeply rooted to just be solved by nerfing crit, or hell, even nerfing every single ADC one by one. All their tools they have been granted over time, and the continual indirect nerfs to both bruisers and assassins alike has made them too strong. No one can kill them, and no one can pressure them, so everyone&#039;s just decided to join them by playing tanks and enchantment supports to buff them up. The games essentially turned into a 1v1 between the ADC&#039;s on both teams, mindlessly shredding whoever is in their path and whoever kills who&#039;s frontline first wins.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-08-23T03:08:21.962+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-08-23T12:57:02.599+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=magewick,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AwI2WofG,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-08-23T03:08:21.962+0000)\n>\n> To be fair, adc in 2017 was far more of a reddit thing. The boards were split and more on the side that adc were fine or even too strong.\n\nTo be even fairer, people on boards were the ones pushing for assassin nerfs. The only class the boards hates more than ADC's (atm) are assassins. Why the \"atm?\" Because half a year ago you'd almost see no hate against ADC's whatsoever. Even in the early stages of lethality item abuse, the boards were still having mixed feelings about whether it was ADC's that were broken or the items themselves. The consensus seemed to be the items, because anytime someone would say ADC's are broken with lethality, someone would jump in an say \"BUT ASSASSINS ARE XYZ TIMES MORE BROKEN ONE SHOT.\" \n\nAnd so the solution was to nerf lethality items, and buff crit items so ADC's would buy them. And now the highest damage ad scaling abilities in the game are outdone by two or three times by a single auto attack from an adc.\n\nThe boards might have been bitching about ADC's, but people here sure aren't innocent for making their counters almost obsolete.\n\nI still remember threads whining about how it wasn't fair that assassins won the majority of the time in a 1v1 with ADC's. Nowadays even if you surprise them you'd at best have a 50% chance of winning the fight.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-08-23T18:55:48.107+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never forget the patch that introduced Duskblade 1.0\n\n\"Everyone ready to permaban Zed/Talon after this patch?\" followed by nobody building it.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-08-24T03:07:17.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMårvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AwI2WofG,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-08-23T18:55:48.107+0000)\n>\n> Never forget the patch that introduced Duskblade 1.0\n> \n> &quot;Everyone ready to permaban Zed/Talon after this patch?&quot; followed by nobody building it.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd when it was built, it was built on Jhin and Graves, not Kha/Zed/Talon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-08-23T17:47:18.999+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop it, we're having a witch-hunt here.","replies":[{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2017-08-23T22:26:36.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burn the heretics!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Avarist","date":"2017-08-23T08:02:28.143+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot has their own dedicated statistics and investigations into characters / character archetypes beyond perusing what reddit/boards are complaining about on any given patch. \n\nA lot of complaints can prompt specific investigation, sure, but I think it's pretty naive to think a company is going to base their balance decisions off of sifting through here and reddit. (Sorry if that comes across as a bit abrasive, I don't really intend it to be)\n\nDon't get me wrong though I agree with the majority of what you're saying, but I think it is just a consequence of them addressing various other problems in the game which have elevated ADC's pretty extremely. \n\nFor example at the time, support genuinely did feel like an underwhelming role, you had very few interesting itemisation choices or means to obtain gold. I'm not saying that they were -weak-, because that is a case by case basis, many were capable of protecting their adc's and all of that good stuff, but does that mean that the support role should be exempt from any gameplay improvements / itemisation changes? Support mains want to feel good about supporting, they want more impactful options like other roles have, etc.\n\nAlso, in regards to the support items being introduced targetting their Adc's specifically, I feel like that is the support fantasy in general, isn't it? To protect and empower the ally of your choosing, which makes sense it would be primarily the ADC, as they are your assumed laning partner and who you would typically roam around with later in the game. They also have some AoE options for supporting their team too.\n\nIt would be nice for there to be support itemisation that specifically empowers ability power based characters though, so they don't feel pidgeon-holed into giving the ADC everything.\n\nWhether you agree or disagree with the changes, ultimately I think it's just the ever-turning wheel of balance and gameplay improvement shifting what is strong and what is weak.\n\nYou can point to things and say, \"I knew this would happen I posted about it on the boards and argued against it!\", and all that good stuff, but hindsight is 20/20 and I don't think riot should be discouraged from experimenting and adding interesting gameplay changes.\n\nHowever, again I don't disagree, they are powerful, too powerful, and I fully expect them to be nerfed. Thing is though knee-jerk reactions and band-aid fixes are not good for the long-term health of the game, and any time they have done it in the past it has made far greater problems crop up in the game, in my opinion.\n\nIt's an annoying meta, but at least the meta shifts quickly relative to some other games, and Riot has for the most part done their part to keep the wheel turning.\n\nEdit: I think the biggest issue with ADC's right now is they are scaling too quickly, power spikes for adc's are coming in a lot earlier due to censor + shiv, or you know, censor on its own. I think they need to take longer to take off, personally.","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2017-08-23T15:25:29.843+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sifting through the forum and balancing off of that is exactly what Blizzard did with Overwatch when they completely destroyed Roadhog.

It isn't that support items are too strong (although some are, it's still quite scapegoaty), it is that ADC itemisation is broken beyond belief.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2017-08-23T03:19:27.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Poppy has never had a winrate above 49%.
