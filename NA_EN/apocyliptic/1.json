Considering this is 30-40% of the playerbase, it&#039;s not surprise Riot has brought ADC as a role so extremely far into the Broken zone, but this also highlights a major problem with gameplay balance boards when it comes to League of Legends.\r\n\r\nThe only board I&#039;ve ever been to that values a higher elo players opinion more than someone who is silver or gold is Reddit&#039;s summoner school. On that site, they have flairs designated to the right side of your name stating your elo, which helps filter some of the lower elo bullshit from the actual reality that is League of Legends. They also try to avoid throwing rants around in place of actual gameplay discussion. For example, if some silver 4 player starts ranting about how Yi has no counter play, the post would be deleted for not following the sub reddits rules. If, however, a silver 4 player asked &quot;how do I beat yi,&quot; or a Diamond League player made a post saying, &quot;how to beat yi at lower elos,&quot; it would stay up.\r\n\r\nThis is why &quot;circle jerks&quot; (I hate that term, because it&#039;s only used on a post you disagree with) get so massively upvoted saying blatantly untrue things. On these boards, a Silver players upvote and Thread has the same visibility and power as someone who is Challenger. There is no way to discern who&#039;s who without copying and pasting their name into a third party source, which most people don&#039;t have the time for.\r\n\r\nAnd for everyone&#039;s inevitable, &quot;Bronze opinions matter to!&quot; I will tell you first hand, I understood so much less about this game when I was gold and below. There&#039;s a threshold in this game, right around high plat that changes it drastically. All the sudden the meta game starts to effect you. There are no more Yasuo, Darius, or Yi bans. It&#039;s all going to revolve around who the strongest objectively is, and those that you play against are playing what is good and nothing else, unless they are some one trick. Your gameplay knowledge increases and you begin to look at the game from a more logical point, and everyone who hasn&#039;t BEEN up here will never understand it.","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2017-08-30T15:00:35.928+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"And I've noticed elo elitists tend to target \"everyone below me\" and ignore the diversity of opinions of those above them.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-08-30T16:38:52.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Precisely, the problem runs both ways.

I guess I can give some credit since you aren't just mindlessly saying that absolutely everything happens because ADCs are OP.\n\nSupports are a giant stick of stats? Well, that could be fine and balanced, but with how strong ancient coin is in terms of gold generation, and the supports who typically work best with coin also working great with ardent, you see picks like Janna and Soraka being low risk and high reward. Unless you are just a better player and can punish them with a playmaker, there's no real way of beating that.\n\nTop lane is a lot more diverse than people give credit for. You see bruisers, duelists, carries, and tanks within the top 10 pickrates. \n\nJungle currently has very low gold income, and lower XP gain. It's very hard to outscale a tank jungler, since tank-support itemization is inherently very strong in a low budget environment.\n\nSince tanks right now are much more focused on CC/engage/peel, as opposed to earlier this season when tanks could just fight anyone, assassins are punished much harder. It's even harder to outplay a Janna or Raka as an assassin too. That said, Talon, Fizz, and Kat seem to be doing just fine in Solo Q, with Kat and Talon nearing 54% winrates each. They're relatively more versatile in design, which makes them more adaptable. \n\nAs for ADCs, people don't seem to understand how itemization buffs work. The fact that they are building crit instead of lethality is what's important. The fact that Energize has been changed and now people can stack RFC and Shiv is important. However, IE being a little bit better isn't really that big of a deal - IE has always been built when crit is built. So I really just have to smh when people propose nerfs like IE only critting for 205%.
