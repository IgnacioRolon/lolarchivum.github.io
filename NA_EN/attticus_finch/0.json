They then tried buffing her in these little ways that didn't directly add damage, primarily her W, but that didn't work that well, either.\n\nThe reason she was so tough at first was because her cc is very conditional.

If you R, like an assassin currently, that engaged on your adc, you have to insta E them afterwards after the untargetability, expending all your of direct hard cc on a single target that most likely won't kill them (and if you didn't have it, all it meant was the assassin would disengage/ complete the kill), and now with this change, ulting an assassin will mean that the assassin dies before they hit the ground. Which means your adc lives. Which means you win the teamfight. Which means you win whatever objective/the game.\n\nIt also lets her play as an engage tank since it means that doing E->R actually has follow up since the enemies not being untargetable means your teammates can actually land cc skillshots on them as follow up instead of being too afraid to because the untargetability can easily waste their important cooldowns.\n\nRight now, poppy's ult is used positively for like 2 reasons:\n1.you are getting ganked so you channel it and knock who ever's \"catching\" you away  from you before they can apply cc/kill you.\n2.during a messy team fight you break out near the beginning cc storm/mosh pit and ult an important carry away. If your ult hits a tank, you've wasted it and there's a fair chance you lose. If you ulted the Orianna, then you probably won that teamfight. This play is extremely risky to do by the way since you need to spend 1-2 seconds channeling that could've easily been disrupted/bodyblocked in that cc moshpit and therefore been wasted (and have no effect beyond expending an enemy cd).\n\nIt also just makes here way easier for new players since Poppy's ult as a whole in it's current state is REALLY PUNISHING IN THE WRONG HANDS. The untargetability and required target selection can easily throw fights. Hitting a tank doesn't do anything beyond give their frontline invuln, while the enemy backline pelts you for free damage; you are NOT going to move forward because the untargetability is short enough that moving your team forward would get them grossly mispositioned and killed. A more common scenario that will happen in soloQ, is an assassin jumps on your carries and you channel your ult and then use it on an assassin, and if you are too slow (aka you used your ult reactively), then you lose that fight because the assassin most likely killed your carry within the channel time and then they got a get-out-of-jail free card from your ult. With this change, all that's required is E->R on the shaco and you can maybe win.\nShe's still going to be one of the most difficult new player champs one could pick because of the nature of her W requiring extreme amounts of game knowledge surrounding what dashes you can block (a common new player match up, master yi for example you cannot block, nor can your W do anything against garen), knowing _when_ your opponent would dash in the context of a fight (xin zhao vs lee sin vs renekton dashes are quite different in when they dash) and also just having the reflexes/anticipation to use it at the opportune time or otherwise it being a dead skill.\n\nedit:also forgot to mention that it means hitting level 6 gives you an actual power spike now in the 1 vs 1. Her ult is deadpan useless in a 1 vs 1 (beyond running away), the untargetability doesn't help you win the fight at all, it merely delays it for some very negligible amounts of damage. being able to throw in an auto on a knocked up target (or _gasp_ have your Q trigger it's 2nd dmg instance during the ult) actually helps her a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Zoezy","date":"2018-04-18T07:58:22.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with these changes as well because like most people here have said, it makes her CC less situational.
