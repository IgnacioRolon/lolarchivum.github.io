You go in blindly with 4 other players in your region and hope they are all competent. However, what happens when one of those players decide to flame the entire team and choose champions that don&#039;t reflect their lane, or refuse to go their respective role because they were autofilled and simply &quot;don&#039;t want to&quot;. The issue here is that those summoners negatively impact the entire team since we are forced to play a game with someone like that. And if we dodge during champion select to avoid a scenario such as the one i described earlier, we get penalized with queue timers, losing LP, or worse in losing a game during promos. There needs to be a way that this can be avoided; especially in ranked games where people are trying to climb ranks and are potentially held back by players of this negative caliber. There could be a voting system implemented into champ select to kick players where if they receive 3/5 votes in solo queue (since they might be queued with a friend), and 4/5 in flex queue. This way the negative players are forced to leave champ select and suffer the consequence of delayed queue time, rather than an innocent bystander that does not want to play with the &quot;troll&quot;. This mainly occurs in bronze and silver (low) elos and seems to occur frequently. I understand that this could be manipulated and abused, but I believe that this will decrease toxicity in the League of Legends community and will make people play with integrity. This system would be most important in ranked queues, since most people use normal games to learn champions or try new team compositions. I hope this at least helps create ideas to improve the community, as I personally am tired of people being allowed to make ridiculous picks that literally lose games and enrage all people involved in the mess.","replies":[{"poster":"tnwsbtuiynomuykg","date":"2017-09-11T00:11:45.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with OP, being able to boot someone who is already making the team miserable in champ select would be a nice feature.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BubblyRainbows","date":"2017-09-09T02:54:46.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with your suggestion is this part: \"negative players are forced to leave champ select and suffer the consequence of delayed queue time...\" So what's to stop a team of 3 or 4 trolls from just kicking people from their games over and over to ruin someone's day with automatic punishments?

This scenario makes no sense. And even if such a crazy thing happened riot can simply make a timer on the \"vote out\" system. So a team or player can't initiate a vote out more than once an hour.","replies":[{"poster":"BubblyRainbows","date":"2017-09-11T02:11:01.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd think that, but there are people who play a full 30 minute game just to troll their teammates and lose on purpose. You don't think people would troll with the potential to cause people a queue dodge timer + LP loss in a fraction of the time?\n\nEdit: Plus, even putting that aside, this would be a tool for people to hold champ select hostage. \"We have Yasuo mid. If you're not going to play a champ with knockup, we'll boot you.\" Waiting 5 minutes to get into another game because I want to play a non-meta champ or because I don't want the rest of a team dictating what champ I play and/or where is beyond unfair.\n\nWhat would be the harm in making it so that a person who is booted from a game suffers no penalty beyond getting put back in queue? You think someone is trolling? Boot them, and everyone goes back into queue. Seems fair to me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Green Spade","date":"2017-09-09T01:57:56.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats all legitimate supported gameplay to be doing anything you've described.\n\nI don't agree with it, but riot seems to think any gameplay is legitimate gameplay as long as its not int feeding.\n\nIn fact, if you speak out verse what they are doing to try and correct it or bring attention to it so they can do something about it then you'll most likely be punished yourself for attempting team communication since riot has a war on team communication, nearly anything you say can be taken under the blanket term toxic and negative since they are both undefined so they can apply it to anything.","replies":[{"poster":"The Turdinator33","date":"2017-09-09T02:05:48.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your point and how from a \"lawyer\" perspective you are correct.

They just added ping mute... add ping mute with regular mute... how do you communicate? You don't, they very effectively removed all team communication in support of griefing and trolling action players protection so they can grief or troll in peace without having you talk to them to convince them otherwise (mute) and if they mute you, then they don't have to see you spam question marks around them in attempts to make them question what they are doing so they smarten up. If they want to troll and grief your game they should be able to do it in peace without having you make them 2nd guess themselves with ping or talk them out of it with chat.\n\nCuz words hurt more then any players actions when it comes to team gameplay.
