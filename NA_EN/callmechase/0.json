I played 2 games about a week ago. The first game was fine Perfect FPS and everything. Second game my fps wouldn't go above 30. The next day after champ select I would get the dreaded BUGSPLAT going into the loading screen. I've tried renaming the Logitech files and still nothing. Before league was working fine and I never really had any problems unless my internet was poop. If anyone has had similar problems please let me know! I've read about the bugsplat like this from 2011-2015, but still couldn't find any info. Also I've reinstalled League and it still didn't help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T02:50:59.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be caused by the Windows Game Bar which was recently updated by the Anniversary windows updates to perform *Game DVR*.
