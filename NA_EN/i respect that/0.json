I have tried it on multiple servers, KR, EUNE , EUW.  My cursor shakes and it started after my Mac Sierra Update. Is there anything that can be done for Mac Users. Date today is Feb 28th 2018.   Please help me. I hope Riot reads this and fixes the problem. My mouse works fine on other games, I have reinstalled the game and restarted the computer. I'm not sure what else I can do. I reduced the resolution also. Nothing has changed. I wish I didn't update to (Sierra).  I would really like to play again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-17T04:00:07.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running a Mac or Windows PC?
