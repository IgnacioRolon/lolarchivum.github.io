This has been a repetitive issue and usually the message should say \"Fail to Connect\" with an option to retry or cancel. Please note that I am using a Macbook Pro 2011, and usually the problem isn't this serious. This time, even when I was returned to the reconnect option it would not allow me to rejoin my ranked match. Instead it opened three different League of Legend Client with a pop-up message as mentioned above. By the time I quit and restart my client, the timer in the game exceed the 3:30 checkpoint for champions who have not connected. Thus I was put on a 20 minute leaver buster warning, and I'm sure it's going to be the 5 game 20 minute wait time. I understand that there are other people who are experiencing the same problem and maybe it would be unfair to remove the LeaverBuster. However I feel this should be addressed asap!\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI was going to play Kog'maw jungle, it was going to be epic...\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNA Bronze Player","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T15:45:19.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble connecting to the game servers, which could be due to a connection issue or your Mac.  Leaverbuster is not something that is removed because all leaves cause a negative experience for players.  As Rineyy suggested, the connection issues guide should get you fixed up for good.  Make sure that you select the Mac options for instructions specific to your OS.  Let me know if you still have any issues!","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-26T10:37:16.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[]}]}
