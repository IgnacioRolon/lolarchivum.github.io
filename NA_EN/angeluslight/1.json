'Siel' means 'Soul' (Afrikaans).\nRaisiel = \"Lightning soul\" )\n\n---\n\n#Lore\n\nMonster. Demigod. Fiend. Demon. Such words were used to describe the powerful being that terrorized Ionia for generations. Raisiel, the golden fox that commanded the power of lightning to wreak havoc across species she thought to be beneath her feet, especially humans. Towns would find a quiet day turning into devastation faster than the blink of an eye.\n\nMany attempts were made to appease the fierce deity with treasures and statues in her honor, with careful detail to her tails that she prided over. Such propitiations were short-lived as lightning would soon strike again and again.\n\nDesperate for hope of survival, remnants of previously destroyed villages collaborated their efforts with those who have yet to taste destruction. A powerful spell was discovered in a crumbling tome; magic just powerful enough to work on Raisiel's race, but only under the condition that the spell's mark have under six tails. Time was very short as the lightning kitsune was nearing the end of a 1,000-year cycle in which she would claim her 6th tail and gain a thousand times her own power.\n\nOn the eve of her sixth cycleâ€˜s completion, Raisiel found herself bound by a spell almost as old as she. Before her stood an old man that had lost everything to her might--his family, his friends, and his home. Around them, the entire gathered legion of Ionians lay dead. Expecting her own demise at the hand of a creature she looked down upon, she angrily glared at the man, hearing his words like thunder.\n\n\"A thousand years--over one hundred mortal lifespans, is what time you have left to learn the verity that has eluded your ages of wisdom, O Great Fox.\"\n\nThe man placed a paper seal across her lips, and a few mystic words followed, completing the spell that had bound her. The sacrifice of all the mortals surrounding her was signified in a mythical display in which all the bodies lain around her transformed into pure magical energy, visibly gathering into her prison. Locked tightly in great discomfort, thick tree roots wrapped around her, permitting virtually no movement. Runes were etched along the bark, glowing brighter as the life force of those she had slain poured into it. As the last particles fell into place, an even brighter light flashed between the cracks of the roots imprisoning her. Her sixth tail had come, and her power multiplied, but alas, it was not enough to undo what had been done. She was now alone in the dark night as the cold rain pelted her.\n\nOver 900 years went by as the kitsune remained isolated from all but the nature around her. A new sound reached her ears--a pattern of noise she had nearly forgotten. Bipedal footsteps crunched the grass as they approached closer. From the bushes came out a young boy, venturing the depths of the forest neighboring his village.\n\nStunned at the curious sight he stumbled upon, his hazel eyes met her ruby red eyes. At first, frightened, the kid hesitantly and cautiously approached Raisel. The golden fur of her tails and ears shone brightly in the sunlight that peered between the tree branches above them.\n\nYears passed, and the boy visited every day. Through rain or snow, he always showed up at the same time to tell her about his life and to play a song; attempts to comfort the young woman trapped by a spell, unable to speak or move. She watched him grow into adulthood as his stories changed from his time with other kids to tales of his wife and children of his own.\n\nKeen ears fell to disappointment and worry as the footsteps one day ceased to approach. Feeling lost and forgotten, the seasons continued to roll by as Raisiel remained tethered in seclusion. She had counted for each day since her imprisonment, and at last, the final day of 999th year was about to end at midnight. She tightly braced for her demise.\n\nUnder the moonlight and stars, the silence of night was broken by footsteps once more, much slower and uneven than the times before. An elderly man limped out of the shadows and sat in front of the trapped demigod. He apologized for his absence and told of his kids' passing from disease, his wife's murder, and his own declining health.\n\n\"I have lived a full life, as happy and sorrowful as it has been. My only regret is that I could not help you live yours.\"\n\nHe pulled out the simple, crudely carved wooden flute he had on him the day he had found her and began playing . The only friend Raisiel had in the world spent part of many days playing the same song to her on various instruments he was able to bring with him, but this one was her favorite by far. The boy she had watched grow up used the last of his breath to finish the song before joining in the silence of the air around them.\n\nTears clashed with the dim light of her binds as Raisiel was overcome with flooding emotions of helplessness, longing, sorrow, and regret. Feelings a powerful being like her never thought would encounter.\n\nTo her surprise, she felt hands wiping her tears. Opening her eyes, she realized they were her own. The constriction around her had dissolved.\n\nWas this the end of the spell? No...the timing was off. Something was missing.\n\nTears continued to stream until they were interrupted by a surge of light and power. She looked over her shoulder to see her seventh tail glistening. After a thousand years, she finally realized what her captor had meant. A new emotion was born inside of her. Love...for humanity.\n\nAs the sun rose, the dawn's light shed on the grave in front of her; the very spot she spent her captivity, now a memorial to her friend. She made a vow to use her power to protect the species she had placed beneath her for so long. No longer the same person she once was, she set off to find a way to atone for her past lifetime. It didn't take long for word of the League of Legends to reach her. There, she now fights to protect the most precious gift of all: life.\n\n***\"Life is much like lightning. It can end faster than the blink of an eye...but can echo long past its duration.\"***\n- Raisiel\n\n\n---\n---\n\n#Abilities\n\n\n**Passive: Ancient Electrocutioner**\nRaisiel's abilities apply a stack of Electrocution (1 per hit) onto enemy champions that lasts 5 seconds before disappearing altogether unless refreshed by another ability. Raisiel gains 1.5% movement speed for every active stack of Electrocution within 1000 range of her.\n\n---\n\n**Q: Tri-lightning** (Skillshot/AOE) --\nRaisiel calls lightning from the sky to crash down on a targeted area. This ability can be cast up to three times within 5 seconds of being activated. On the third strike, lightning silmultaneously strikes her foe(s) and herself, briefly encasing both in a field of electricity for 1 second, damaging enemies that come into contact. The delay between each cast is decreased based on movement speed.\n\n1st and 2nd strike: 20/30/40/50/60 (+30% AP) magic damage\n3rd strike: 30/40/50/60/70 (+40% AP) magic damage\nAoE strike range: (125)\nCast Range: (770)\nElectric field magic damage: 10/20/30/40/50 (+20% AP) [1 hit per enemy. Fields do not damage their own carriers]\nElectric field range: (175)\nMana cost: (70/75/80/85/90) [first cast only]\nCooldown (starts on first cast): 12 seconds\nDelay between casts: 1.25 seconds ( - .25 seconds per +25 bonus movement speed) [Max reduction to .25 seconds delay]\nDelay before strike on target area: (.25 seconds)\n\n\n* This ability does not interrupt Raisiel's movement\n* Tri-Lightning will not reset if another ability is used after casting this skill.\n* Tri-Lightning's 3rd cast strikes her to give her the electric field, but does not damage her\n\n---\n\n**W: Supercharge** (Self-cast/counter) --\nWhen activated, the electricity coursing through Raisiel's tails flares up as she prepares to counter. If Raisiel is hit with an eligible CC ability within the next 4 seconds, she negates the ability and becomes immune to all eligible CC effects for .75 seconds. Within 1 second of countering, this ability can be activated again, teleporting Raisiel up to 300 units behind the caster, striking them with a bolt of lightning and dealing magic damage.\n\nEligible CC abilities (for activation and immunity): Snares, stuns, knockups, knock-backs.\nMagic damage: 50/75/100/125/150 (+75% AP)\nMana cost: (50/60/70/80/90)\nRange: (1100)\nCooldown: (20)\n\n***If the enemy champion that cast the ability that triggered Supercharged dies, becomes untargetable, or is out of range before the spell actually hits her, Raisiel will teleport behind the nearest enemy champion within range. If no target is available, Raisiel will negate the spell, but simply not teleport.\n\n---\n\n**E: Jolt** - (Omnidirectional leap/Autocast AoE) --\nRaisiel somersaults in the air as she nimbly leaps to a target area and shoots a bolt of lightning through all enemy champions in range as she lands. The lightning continues trailing through all enemy champions within proximity of a struck champion. This ability cannot strike the same target more than once per cast. Raisiel gains 15% movement speed for each champion struck that decays over 3 seconds.\n\nMagic damage: 70/85/90/105/120 (+60% AP)\nLeap range: (350)\nAoE range from Raisiel: (400)\nAoE range from effected enemies: (300)\nMana cost: 55/65/75/85/95\nCooldown: (12/11/10/9/8)\n\n* Much like the Statikk Shiv, but a mage version!\n* The speed buff gained with this ability is visibly shown by electricity flaring around Raisiel's feet with each step.\n\n---\n\n\n**R: Indignation** - (Target Cast/Circular AoE) --\nRaisiel targets an enemy and channels currents of lightning through her seven tails around herself for .5 seconds. She then teleports to her targeted position with an enormous lightning bolt crashing down with her, creating a powerful explosive wave of electricity over an area, dealing magic damage to all enemies caught inside. The effective range of the AoE increases based on how many different enemy champions have at least one stack of Electrocution. Enemies take additional magic damage according to how many stacks of Electrocution they have on themselves. All stacks of Electrocution are consumed.\n\nMagic damage: 200/300/400 (+50% AP) + (15% AP per stack of Electrocution on individual targets)\nCast Range: (675)\nChannel Time: .5 seconds\nAoE radius: (500) units (+ 100 per Electrocuted enemy champion aside from target) [900 max radius]\nMana cost: 110\nCooldown: 105/90/75 seconds\nWave speed: 2500 (full 360 circular wave, but NOT a projectile)\n\n-----\nWhat? A mage with no CC? That's right! Raisiel is a tanky-ish CC-less caster designed for lightning-fast action, making use of movement speed and HP/AP items. Got what it takes to keep up with her?\n-----\n---\n\n#Q&A's\n\nHere I will try to answer questions you may have about Raisiel's before you even ask! Clarity OP. Of course, if you still have questions, feel free to post them.\n\nQ: First thing's first. TWO foxes in the game?\n\nA: To be fair, we have multiple yordles and humans in the game! I don't think it will do harm to have two foxes in the game while having some interactions with Ahri, a popular champion that could use a little attention/expansion in this way. They're still quite different enough from each other in many ways for this to be a major concern, in my opinion. Their races, although very similar, are also different as Raisiel is a Kitsune and Ahri is a Gumiho. The more you read, the more you can see the differences between them.\n---\n\nQ: Does Tri-Lightning proc one stack of Electrocution total or one stack for each hit?\n\nA: Each hit! Tri-Lightning can proc up to 3 stacks on a single target. Even more depending on how Electric Fields land.\n---\n\nQ: Could you clarify Tri-Lightning's Electric Field effect?\n\nA: Of course! On a single target, Tri-Lightning does 3 attacks total, but makes an enemy hazardous to his own team for 1 second with the Electric Field from the third strike. Other enemy champions that come into contact with said Field take damage and a stack of Electrocution. Because Tri-Lightning is an AOE, it can hit multiple targets at once, thus being able to proc Electric Fields onto several enemies! Enemies with a Field around them can take damage from others, but not their own. Enemy champions can take damage from multiple fields, but never twice from the same one.\n---\n\nQ: Supercharge. How do we counter this counter?\n\nA: As it states, there are eligible CC's that Supercharge can proc off of, but five types of CCs are not labeled, and thus, are ineligible. Silences, taunts, fears, suppressions, and slows. Abilities with those effects will bypass and not trigger Supercharge. The first activation functions as the spellshield concept this ability is inspired from. Upon being hit by an eligible CC effect while activated, the entire ability becomes null and Raisiel is granted temporary CC immunity to all eligible types. Raisiel can then activate Supercharge again within 1 second of nullifying an eligible attack to teleport and deal damage to an enemy within range.\n---\n\nQ: Indignation seems pretty straightforward. Any details not written in the tooltip?\n\nA: Indignation is a target AOE that does not follow its target. Why doesn't it follow, you ask? It gives a very small window of escape, but moreso, it's to keep this ability in check when it comes to teamfights. It can already become wide enough to hit an entire team if used to max potential, so it should simply be enough for Indignation to hit the ground it was targeted on. It's a bit different from other abilities in that aspect because it's the halfway point of a free-aim skillshot that can hit the ground and be missed, and a never-miss target skill. This keeps her from having inescapable/un-catchable mobility--being forced to use this ability on a target instead of free-aiming it for escapes and such. Make use of her AOEs to maximize Electrocution output and set Raisiel off in a deadly lightshow!\n---\n\nQ: Do these stacks of Electrocution have to be within a certain range of Raisiel to effect her ultimate?\n\nA: Nope! Whether that may effect the AOE of her ultimate during the animation or not, I have left it so that it doesn't matter how far Electrocution stacks are because she doesn't have any CC abilities and needs to make the best use of all of her skills as is. It does not matter where her enemies are...all that matters is that they are electrocuted!\n---\n\nQ: Okay...Now tell me...why didn't the kid in Ionia get help for poor trapped Raisiel!\n\nA: Because of reasons! Reasons that would be explained in her Judgement Tail. Yes, I may or may not write a Judgement for her and yes, I did just make that pun.\n---\n\nQ: Are Raisiel and Ahri related?\n\nA: Nope. They are both foxy, but not of the same blood. Raisiel refers to Ahri as \"cousin\" as seen in her quotes, but that's because they are similar species.\n\n*\nI hope this conversation with myself answered some questions you readers may have.*\n\n---\n---\n\nThis is a shorter version of the original post. If you want to read even more, including her quotes, details on her appearance, skin ideas, etc., [here is the link](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4802115) again.\n\nIf you like Raisiel, perhaps you might like:\n\n* [Ephrial, The Blazing Swordsman](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/dEnNWeRQ-champion-concept-ephrial-the-blazing-swordsman)\n* [Messora, The Reaper's Shadow.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/FNgdbPnZ-champion-concept-messora-the-reapers-shadow)\n\n\n\n---\nFor the picture, I had the idea of using the character creation section of a MMO (Blade and Soul) to help show what she might look like since I can't draw.

Aside from the hair color, number of tails, and dress apparel, some of the other features include lightning designs on her tails (as shown in Zeddicus4's artwork), the lack of whisker markings, the ear shape/size/poof, lightning sporadically flickering here and there, eye color/pupil-type. In general, she is supposed to have a similar appearance to Ahri, but it really ends there. This is a spin on the whole \"new champion archetype with new(ish) skillset\" by changing it to \"similar champion archetype with a unique spin on a role (movementspeed + CC counter mage).\" Who wouldn't like another fox to tear the Fields up with?\n\nYeah, I let this lore just flow without cutting much of it out. The way the story came to mind was very sudden and if I were to cut it short, it would not have the desired emotional effect. My other two champions' lores were sized to the typical amount, but Raisiel got the exception. Better than a 2-sentence lore anyway, right?\n\nI'll look into my previous thoughts when I reworked Supercharge recently. Lots have been going on, so I haven't had a chance to polish as much as I wanted to. I don't know about increasing the mana cost as this ability already has a long cooldown and is highly circumstantial. It's not a typical spellshield, so it won't proc on just any CC ability. Some champions, such as Malzahar, won't trigger it at all, making her count that much more on her speed. I might lower the activation window to 2.5 seconds or so, but I think the mana cost and cooldown are in a good place. Remember, her Q is the only attack skill she has that doesn't necessarily put her at risk.\n\nThis was another thing I have to polish out. I'm thinking mainly on the scaling of the damage per stack of Electrocution. This is a skill that requires a lot of commitment when using, though. In order to get the best of it, Raisiel must carefully time and land her skills on different champions to increase the range and keep stacks active. That, and she puts herself well in range of attack. Unless enemies cluster too much, she's not really going to be able to ramp Indignation up to the full range.\n\nGlad to see the Q&A section is holding up its purpose, and I'll be sure to pass on the word to Zeddicus.\n\nThanks for the review and I'll take a look at one of your champions next chance I get.","replies":[{"poster":"Bourmegar","date":"2014-10-05T22:16:41.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well a good lore is a long Detailed one :)\n\nalso, if you are going to check [Mila, the stray](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/REVHERFj-champion-concept-mila-the-stray-light) out:\nwould you like to keep in mind that she is currently being Reworked, but that I am currently on a writers block on her kit. so if you have any Ideas for her Kit, would you like to share them with me if you do?","replies":[{"poster":"Angeluslight","date":"2014-10-05T22:34:50.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but the challenge is not to make it too long.

I'm assuming there is no travel time for this ability. (The animation is instant, and the ability will strike the target area exactly .25 seconds after cast.) For a low cool-down, lowish mana cost ability, that rather powerful and enemies would have an extremely hard time dealing with that in lane. I am just saying that most abilities in the game that have low, near .25 second cast times, or instant casts usually have an animation effect to them that helps make them more dodge-able. (Lux binding, Morg binding, Blitz Hook, etc...) Riot uses animations like this in order to keep themselves from breaking some of those core-gaming philosophies things they like to talk about.\n\n* My only other observation is about her W. If her initial target becomes unusable, she will then find another enemy target within range to teleport behind. (If I understand that correctly) I just think that could be extremely dangerous. Our little lightning fox could wind up in some rather sticky situations if the enemy team was able to find a way to exploit that. If they played it correctly, they could ensure that only one target is within range, and thereby know exactly where she will teleport to. That, or she could end up travel over walls and terrain when she really doesn't want too. Personally, I think if the initial target becomes invalid the teleport aspect of this ability should just be terminated and maybe half the mana cost refunded or something.\n\nThat all said though, this is still a really neat idea. I love her ult, and I love your art. /patpat\nalso if my critiquing sounded dumb because I didn't understand something about your champion that is, or should have been obvious to me, Let me know. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Angeluslight","date":"2014-10-13T23:11:56.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I'm glad to hear that.\n---\n\nWhen it comes to Tri-lightning, no there's no travel time as lightning is pretty instantaneous. The delay is what sort of plays that role, kind of like Syndra's Q. Near instant, but you have a warning at least. Now one thing to keep in mind is that it's a 3-step ability. Unlike Lux, Morgana, Blitz, etc., the full damage potential is split over 3 parts instead of all at once.\n\nThis comes from the idea of making something like Riven's Q, or even Yasuo's own 3-part Q to an extent, into a mage ability. So although Tri-lightning would strike again and again, the individual strikes aren't as powerful as the bindings you brought up. Also, it's not tied in with CC in any way, so it has to keep on going because so will her enemies.\n\n---\n\nWell, a similar case was brought up in a previous version of Supercharge in which she had no capability to choose to teleport or not once countering. That was far more deadly. As it is now, it's up to the player to keep a keen eye out to make such a decisive decision. Remember, she's also quite mobile, so she's still capable of getting out of danger, but this is a necessary risk put into her kit because of all that mobility.\n\nAt the same time, it could be very useful to catch weak enemies from afar if the champion that triggers her counter is invalid for whatever reason. Supercharge is a trickster ability, so it hosts creativity. For instance, she can use an enemy Caitlyn trap to prime Supercharge's teleport counter on an enemy 1100 range away from her, either to catch up to them or cross terrain and catch them completely off guard. Caitlyn can be dead or nowhere close, but that trap can be turned into Raisiel's advantage against one of Cait's allies. Sly like a fox, right?\n\n\n---\n\nI didn't really do any art. Well, other than using a game's character creation system to design her looks, which was good enough to get exactly what I pictured. The sketch done in pencil was done by a friend under the username of Zeddicus4, so I'm sure they appreciate your compliment.\n\nYour critiquing didn't sound dumb, and I'm someone that seems to create unconventional-yet-effective kits that may come off confusing or have hidden uses because they're different from most things in the game. So that sometimes creates confusion, but I don't have a problem explaining things that one may not understand or see.\n\nThanks for taking the time to look and comment on Raisiel.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Angeluslight","date":"2014-10-10T00:28:54.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.

Going from the malicious \"yako\" type and transitioning into the \"zenko\" 'good fox' type.\n\nHm...technically, Raisiel is a lot more powerful than Ahri (kitsunes are viewed as being wiser and more powerful than gumihos), and willingly nerfed herself a lot to join the League (never got around to writing Raisiel's judgement to explain that), however...since the League doesn't exactly exist in the lore anymore (sadly), Raisiel wouldn't need to do that.

My reaction was \"what???\" until I realized he was used as a variety of metaphor.\n\nI'm not sure about Irelia, but I was thinking last night that I would import her quotes and expand on them more here on this post. Which, thank you for visiting her original post and reading more details on her, by the way.\n\nI'll be looking at champions with quotes that Raisiel can taunt them with in a punny way. That's part of her character as a playful emphasis with her foxy nature (instead of playfully seductive like Ahri) and it's also a more \"friendly\" way as she doesn't have a history of interacting with others (mostly humans) in a pleasant way. This is her still learning to interact with others on a friendlier level as you can sort of say she's \"socially awkward\" because of her solitary past and \"shyness\" off the battlefield. That would have been more emphasized on her Judgement, but with the forced change to the Boards, I'm going to have to make it an attachment/link of some sort of I were to write it and post it here.\n\nBack to Irelia, I'm not sure Raisiel would have any really good interaction potential with her. Perhaps something pertaining to Irelia's \"living blades,\" but even then it might not be deep enough. I'll try, but definitely no promises on that. However, I do have a champion concept that does have a couple of interactions with Irelia as he's linked to her brother, Zelos. He's sort of a bridge and deeper expansion to the Noxian-Ionian conflict, so while he may not interact with all Ionians, he's somewhat distantly tied to a few with common enemies and being half Noxian and half Ionian himself. So if you're looking for something like that, you might enjoy [Ephrial, The Blazing Swordsman.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/dEnNWeRQ-champion-concept-ephrial-the-blazing-swordsman) I put a lot of work into him, so there's no shortage of reading his original post if you find yourself that interested in him lol\n\nThanks for checking out Raisiel and I'm glad you enjoyed her joke lol","replies":[]}]}]}
