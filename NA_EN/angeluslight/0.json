So now that the Boards are officially taking over, let's give this one last shot.\r\n\r\nThis has 15(+1 or 2) upvotes from [here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4897044)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore I get down to business, __allow me to clarify that this thread is not just another thread to dump complaints in__, but to initiate some sort of compromise and suggestions to fix what has been needlessly dismantled. So feel free to speak your mind, but please be civil and try to add suggestions of your own if you have any.\r\n\r\nThere are a handful of topics that need to be touched on, so I will divide them in as orderly of a structure as possible as well as try to keep things brief. So please bear that in mind if it looks like I've left something out. Everything will eventually expand in the comments as this thread (hopefully) grows with attention anyway.\r\n\r\n----\r\n**TL;DR** The first sections deal with what you may have already read from various threads pertaining to the lore changes, so if you've read enough threads like that, you might not have to read them. They define some aspects in question and drive to my main point that you can skip down to if you choose, which is a suggestion to resolve the major changes in progress to the League's lore.\r\n\r\nSo, if you decide to skip down, look for the section labeled \"How do we get the Institute of War and Summoners back into the League?\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n**First, let's define a few things:**\r\n\r\n_What is The Institute of War?_\r\n\r\nIt is the foundation, both literally and figuratively, of the game itself and all of the (now former) lore.  It gives \"League of Legends\" its very name and basis of all things incorperated into it, right down to the community itself as Summoners. In short, it's the core of what started the worldwide sensation, from memes to World Championships. It should go without saying that there would (and should) be no \"League of Legends\" without the \"League.\"\r\n\r\n_The importance of the Institute in the lore:_\r\n\r\nIt's the epicenter of how all these unique people/monsters/yordles/etc. meet and interact with each other, not just by beating the stuffing out of each other, but in amusing special interactions. The main objective of the League is to keep Runeterra from total destruction by reckless wars, mainly such destruction from the Rune Wars’ devastating magic. It is a place of enormous influence, where politics and wars are condensed to keep the peace. Many champions have their whole lore based on the sole existence of the league, and many more rely on it as the catalyst for the continuance of their story. Yes, this is all stating the obvious, but this is to get mindsets in focus here.\r\n\r\nAs everything in the game was intended to revolve around the League, it created something rather unique--a place where more than one “super conflict” meets, while still keeping things separated enough. What I mean is that there are different wars going on in different regions with each of them having their own hidden plot that threatens more than each individual piece of land. Demacia and Noxus are locked in everlasting conflict, with Ionia thrown into the mix, and it looks like the Black Rose, or something even darker, aims at undermining the war for their unknown cause. The Freljord is home to several opposing factions with a plot by Lissandra to revive the Watchers and overthrow more than just the frozen mountain range. Then there’s the Void, with very little known about it, that may host the greatest threat yet to be realized.\r\n\r\nThe Institute of War successfully put all these massive plots into one battleground, keeping conflicts still separate, but having champions from all around Runeterra and other worlds meet each other, creating some interesting rivalries and friendships. This is a very unique aspect I don’t believe I have seen before, and I think this is the seed of “magic” that got so many people invested into League of Legends’ lore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**What are Summoners?**\r\n\r\nThey are YOU! All that play the game, both Riot staff members and average players alike. This furthers the unique essence of the game by connecting the players right into the world of the League itself. Of course, for players that don’t care about storylines, it probably isn’t much of a concern to them. However, on the other end, it gives even more for players that want a game with depth to it.\r\n\r\nSummoners in the lore itself are simply powerful magicians. They are by no means invincible or infallible. There are Summoners that have died to champions like Nocturne, Summoners that have failed to wield their own power such as Lee Sin, and even top-tier Summoners that have been fooled or snuck up on like in Vayne’s Judgement story. What does all that mean, exactly? It means they are not an obstacle to the progression of the lore! Most champions seek and abide by the League of their own accord. Summoners aren’t puppet masters, but divided alliance members of their own.\r\n\r\nThe Champion-Summoner relationship is consensual for most cases, and the whole point was that they NEED each other to be each others’ representatives. Summoners need champions with specific causes to speak their voice on the battlefield in combat, and champions need Summoners to participate and gain the League’s political influence for their endeavors. It’s quite a unique way of making champions all the more deserving of being called “Legends” by having heavy weights on the shoulders of a few, and allowing the players to be a part of that.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have those things summarized, let’s get to the important crisis at hand here. It’s not too late to bring the Institute back!\r\n\r\nFirst, allow me to make a few points before explaining how the League does not stop the lore’s progression.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Let’s talk Shurima.**\r\n\r\nIt’s a topic that has been talked about a lot already, so I’ll try to keep it extra short.\r\n\r\nFrom everything that has been revealed to us, which isn’t much, it’s nothing that that can’t be patched to the existence of the League with some rather minor add-ons. I’ll leave that for perhaps another thread to focus on as much can be said about that, but it looks far from an impossible thing to do.\r\n\r\nNow, when you mess with a character’s story, you are changing the characters themselves. Just because the champions look and fight the same, it doesn’t mean they are the same person; or in this case, legend. For instance, in the original lore, Cassiopeia was the “charmer” of her noble family, serving with her prowess of intelligence-gathering. She was then cursed and transformed into a being capable of joining her sister in bloody combat. Now, she is far from what she used to be, and comes off as ambitious for her own desires and simply hires and betrays the mercenary Sivir. There’s no more real definition of her character, nor any direct words that tie her to sister, Katerina, and the rest of her family.\r\n\r\nNow the Shurima event is over and we’re delving into Noxus, but Amumu and friends are left with no story and no character. And for some odd reason, Skarner is now completely different with no explanation and absolutely no need.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do we fix this? Bring their old lore back! Now, obviously you’re not going to be willing to undo lots of cinematic work. The thing is, you don’t really have to. With a little work, Sivir, Azir, Xerath, Nasus, Renekton, and Cassiopeia can keep the same story you changed, but keep some of their basic familiar past. It could take some effort, but I think it’s very possible to do that while trying them to the League. This way, there will actually be lore progression rather than an incomplete rework that has left far more questions than we had with the original lores. It probably won't satisfy everyone that got upset over the changes, but we have to compromise somehow.\r\n\r\nAs for Amumu, Skarner, and other champions effected by these recent changes that have been left completely undefined so far, I would say they could have their lores completely reverted back. They weren’t even mentioned in the cinematics. As far as progressing their lores with the current Shurima changes, Amumu could be hinted as being Azir’s servant or even a past pharaoh with thousands of subjects of his own that he once considered his “friends,” expanding Amumu’s own character. As for Skarner…let’s let him have his own thing in the Crystal Scar like he used to. Not EVERY champion has to be directly tied to a huge plot. That would take their charm away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**“Reborn” and Future Updates**\r\n\r\nWe’re now entering some changes to Noxus’ history, which don’t seem to necessarily conflict with the lore we already know and love.  In my opinion, that’s how it absolutely should be. It fixes up one champion instead of changing a bunch at once, and it doesn’t seem to be such a drastic change so far. We’ve yet to see what lies ahead, but as I said before, it’s not too late to preserve the League. There was not much wrong with all of the League’s original lore. All these changes were sparked by complaints of some stories not being good enough, or one champion’s lore conflicting with another’s. But let’s not forget that many of these things could have been easily fixed and patched up without completely changing everything. We wanted to see what happens next, and even some of what happened before. Not a completely different universe that has left us with a multitude of questions. Wouldn’t you agree?\r\n\r\n----\r\n----\r\n\r\n**How do we get the Institute of War and Summoners back into the League?**\r\n\r\nAs I said, this thread was about compromising, between both Riot and the players that made the game what it is. And I come bearing a suggestion on how to tie things together!\r\nHere is my idea on how can we tie the game itself, the lore, and the Institute + Summoners back together while leaving room for expansion:\r\n\r\n**Story:**\r\n\r\nThe institute of war severely malfunctions due to an attack by an unknown source. Champions lose contact with their Summoners on the Fields of Justice and all of the nexus start combusting on their own. Some champions get teleported back to the Institute while others scatter across to their native homelands. What’s going on? No one knows. And there is no time left to ask the questions “who, what where, when, and why” because chaos has already heightened another level.\r\n\r\nThe dangerous creatures held captive within the League’s binds are close to breaking free! Nocturne, Shaco, Fiddlesticks, the monsters of the Void, and more are slaughtering all those in their way from breaking the thread that holds them to the Institute’s grounds. The only thing keeping them and their destructive powers limited, just barely, is the Master Nexus located underneath the Institute itself. The core of the Summoner’s magic powers and the main connection router between their Champions is barely holding up.\r\n\r\nThe creatures draw closer to their objective. The only things standing in their way are a team of champions and Summoners that can still hold their links to them, if only by a minimum. It’s up to these heroes and villains to set aside their conflicts to hold off darkness from destroying them all.\r\n\r\nLittle do they know, this is only the first of many crisis at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Gameplay:**\r\n\r\nOf course there has to be some sort of event for this kind of thing. I was thinking of a survival mode. Consistent action like in the Ascension event, but purely defending an objective under pressure.\r\n\r\nYour team defends against Nightmare versions of the evil creatures imprisoned by the League to keep them from killing and destroying everything freely. These enemies would be very much like the Doom Bots of Doom; extremely upgraded versions of themselves as the story itself implies that much of their power has been regained with the weakening of the system that binds them.\r\n\r\nKayle fulfills her role to the League as a very powerful enforcer and bodyguard by taking the place of the two nexus turrets that would normally stand tall in front of the map’s main objective. She pushes her power to the limit by consistently shielding the Master Nexus with her ultimate. Her Righteous Fury is also always active, attacking any enemies that come in range of her as she stands stationary in front of the nexus. Depending on how chaotic this game mode would be, she could also heal allies in range of her with an AOE version of Divine Blessing every so often, allowing things to be as difficult as they can be without being impossible.\r\n\r\nIf Kayle falls, her shield that protected the nexus disappears, leaving it vulnerable. Since it’s already weakened and in “the red zone,” it wouldn’t take much damage to destroy it for the enemies to win. It would have just enough health to leave room for a comeback, but Kayle does not respawn.\r\n\r\nFor the players to win, they must keep the nexus alive for 20 minutes. Why 20? Because it’s a reasonable time for a small map and it makes for a lot of BotsSurrender@20 jokes. Storywise, it’s because that’s when reinforcements arrive to restrain the creatures and imprison them once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I haven’t thought of how *everything* in the gametype would work yet, but it’s something we can all collaborate on. Please, state your opinions on such a gametype and, by all means, pitch ideas on how to complete it.\r\n\r\n- One thing I'd like to address real quick is the concern that was brought up some time ago about how many League matches played by players don't make sense because of allies fighting each other and so on. I always thought of them as \"Exhibition\" matches, per the Institute-Champion agreement. The Institute has quite a lot of influences and popularity as people spectate these battles, right? Well, it had to have gotten all of that somehow. And such a place needs funding of some sort, so my reasoning was that those matches were all set up for the League's benefit to maintain itself and grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**What does this idea accomplish?**\r\n\r\n-Lore expansion without replacements! Using the original lores of champions, it expands their individual characters and roles.\r\n\r\n- ”Near-destroying” the League preserves the existence of Summoners and the Institute while giving plenty of room to expand on the individual wars and stories going on in Runeterra and beyond.\r\n\r\n- Summoners claim a deeper importance and relationship with their champions in the times to come thereafter.\r\n\r\n- Provides a major plot point without disrupting much of the surrounding existing plots. Yes, there is a common enemy between most of them now. However, with the League currently in shambles, there’s nothing to stop the wars that it interceded with anymore! Every region will be back in arms once more, this time on their own fields. Some paths will cross, others will remain distant. Interesting relationships develop and all stories move forward. Remember, this is only the beginning of ONE plot.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Looking toward the future**\r\n\r\nI believe this idea can pave the way for a multitude of interesting story developments with new gameplay that actually acts as part of the stories. Not so much as Ascension where it’s about the current theme, but that “this is what actually happened.” Sure the champions used may vary, but that’s the important part where story and game divide while still being so close. Players have fun using their favorite champions in a scenario that may or may not have included said champs, but players would probably still be happy to be a part of the story one way or another.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when it comes to Summoner-champion relationships, Summoners are there to ally themselves with champions for an agreed upon cause, right? Well, why not have events where players can actually influence the progression of the story by playing certain champions against the current plot’s characters? Something of the sort with the event between Riven, Tryndamere, and Diana with their respective icons where players had to vote for their favorite. But instead of fighting with votes, players fight with a certain roster of champions to gain influences for them! Because in my scenario, the League isn’t currently functioning as it once did, the influence I am talking about is in real life, where every win for your champion in a featured game mode is a point for their side.\r\n\r\nI think all of this can really solve this issues based on the misconceptions of “invincible puppet master summoners” and “the Institute standing in the way of story progression,” while strengthening the players’ involvement in League of Legends as a Summoner.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hope that, despite how big this post is, this will reach many fellow players as well as multiple Rioters so we can work together to put the \"League\" back in \"League of Legends\" once again.\r\n\r\nYou promised to be more interactive with the community when it comes to the lore, Riot. Please, let's get some dialogue going on how we can work together to make things right. Let's not throw away years of interesting lore and Judgement tales that made the Champions of the League legendary.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-10-09T11:14:44.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I just considered rivals fighting alongside eachother as non-canon. You can tie in your gameplay and lore, but you can't necessarily expect everything you do to be canon. \n\nI do agree with Riot that the old IoW was overpowered. They shouldn't have stopped the Kalamanda war like that, it felt like a huge anti-climax to me. However, at its core, the idea of a political nexus where the champions can also fight eachother on the fields of justice was an awesome concept and hasn't been done much. Various factions waging war on eachother and all trying to take over/destroy the world has been done silly amounts of times though. \n\nAlso, the lore no longer reflects the game in any way, causing a severe disconnect (though the game still reflects the lore). There was a whole system set up in the JoJ for faction wars as implemented by factions, but Riot never even tried to use it. It would've been perfect for featured gamemodes, fight for your faction and influence the story (Dawngate, anyone?) because *you* are part of it.\n\nRemoving the IoW also brings another issue. It didn't just inhibit certain stories, it also allowed for others. Independent champions like old Trundle now need to be retconned so that they are related a political power, either in a friendly or hostile way, or else Riot can't write stories about them. Ahri is entirely irrelevant at this point. Rengar is only relevant if Kha'Zix does something, which means Rengar will show up on the side during a void event. \n\nIt also sets a precedent. Riot is entirely willing to overthrow the very premise of their lore because it fits them better. They're even willing to retcon entire characters because it fits them better (Trundle). I can't invest in a lore where the latter is the case and I can imagine many can't invest in a lore where the former is the case.\n\nI think Riot should've handled this retcon much more delicately and told us the entire reasoning behind it. Somehow they thought the benefits outweigh the downsides. I haven't seen any benefits that could possibly outweigh the reputation hit Riot takes from retconning their premise and I have barely seen Riot themselves bringing arguments why it does. All I hear is \"trust us\" while I do the polar opposite, for I have reasons to distrust them.\n\nYour solution sounds a bit contrived, but with the proper build-up would make an epic story. Wouldn't be what I'd go for though.\n\nPersonally, I would retcon the institute and keep it mainly as an institute dedicated to stop the use of runemagic in wars. To do this they try to get the help of champions and they offer the big factions an alternative to war altogether: the fields of justice. They don't stop wars in any way, they just hunt down anyone that uses runemagic for destructive purposes (or rather, get a champion to hunt him down for them). This keeps the story benefits that the old League gave us and removes some of the downsides. You still need to tie in every champion to the institute, but without it you need to tie in each champion with political power.","replies":[{"poster":"Angeluslight","date":"2014-10-09T14:40:53.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for adding to the conversation.\n\nAs for the enemies fighting along side each other, my suggestion of counting them as \"exhibition\" matches kind of does exactly that by disarming the importance of the fights, as they would be just to fuel in Institute's influence and funding, which explains how the Institute got so much power and so many powerful artifacts (items from the store).\n\nI agree with a lot of your points, however, I don't quite agree with the focus of the Institute of War having much less influence as you described, as that's the main premise of it entirely. There are major wars that have been stopped, but the people that love war and power never stop, so they are always directly or insinuated as willing to abide by the Institute *\"for now.\"*\n\nNow, I'm not sure if you remember that a lot of important and powerful figures disappeared, such as General de Couteau,  or even Ashram, the leader of the Institute of War itself, potentially ultimately being the best case to disillusion the misconception of Summoners being all powerful. Something dark has been at work for a very long time, whether Ashram, Couteau, and others were \"taken out of the picture\" by such a threat, or they went underground as a secret order that precedes all nations to protect them from this mysterious enemy, and are now waiting for the right time to make their move against it.\n\nThe institute of War is more than a political power, it is a very seat of power itself. It could not have stopped so many wars and kept them halted without major power, magic in this case, to back it up. The institute has an armory of ancient artifacts; the very items that champions buy and use on the Fields. Items themselves used to have lore behind them, too. Because they have the influence and power to obtain such powerful relics, they have to have a vault of secrets they keep to themselves, right? That itself is a major plot-point that can be directed in a number of different ways.\n\nSo with that in mind, it makes sense that someone or thing has to be scheming to take the Institute's power for its own? Or, perhaps it's to destroy the foundation of it and thus destroy the political influence it has that keeps wars at bay, allowing chaos to consume the land once more? Or maybe it's a mix of both, creating a veil of chaos to conceal the darkest plan of all by who knows what? Whatever the case, the current conflicts still exist and are very prone to start up in full-force once again if the Institute falls like in my suggestion.\n\nSo with the mystery behind certain important and powerful figures' disappearances, and the full take of what the Institute of War is and can be, I can't really see how you think of my suggestion as contrived or forced in some way. It sounds like it was waiting to happen all along. And while I only posted the start of it, I have a lot more that follows, including keeping existing conflicts very alive so that no champions lose their origins, character, or charm. That includes independent characters by giving them a deeper character as the story goes on, such as Ahri like you mentioned. Additionally, Summoners have their own roles as they could very well divide amongst themselves. Lots of chaos, lots of different stories, yet what makes them so uniquely capable of being separate and yet brought together at some points is the existence of the Institute of War and its Summoners. I'd hate for that to all be destroyed.\n\nThis suggestion is based on an idea I've had growing for a long time as I worked on my main champion concept on the forums, so I have a lot of plot and story in my head following the suggestions I posted. I'd rather not spoil much of it, nor do I want to impose so much and practically take over Runterra's lore, but I do have further ideas to follow through with this suggestion if needed. Right now, it's all about waiting and hoping for Rioter responses/support.\n\nAnd hopefully they will enter the conversation, because I'm pretty tired of this \"trust us\" bit, too. Trust cannot be earned through silence, nor by undesired forced change.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-10-09T22:56:01.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like your story would take months more of build-up to get to the point of breaking down the very core of Valoran. It would make for a truely epic story, literally, but the build-up would probably focus on the institute almost more than the champions. I feel like it would be forced as in it would feel like they just wanted to get rid of the institute. I felt that way about the entire build-up. They were building it up well though, so I'm not complaining about that and probably shouldn't have called it contrived. It's just my personal opinion that it feels a bit forced into the lore to get rid of the IoW in a proper way (instead of retconning, good job Riot -,- ). It would make for great stories about the relationship between a summoner and a champion and all these independent champion wouldn't have to be retconned.\n\nI feel like all Riot is doing right now is stories about the champions and the world just has to accomodate for whatever they want to tell about the champions. If they want to tell a story about war, they'll just create a war. If they want one about a journey or hidden temple, those can easily be arranged for the champion. \nI don't like this focus on champions only, but for this purpose I think my suggestion might be more convenient and also puts more focus on the champions within the institute than the summoners.\n\nDang we created some walls of text.

I mention that not just to say where the ideas I have came from, but to also point out that one of the top major focuses of my champion was to serve as a sizeable lore expansion. Thus, that essence is reflected in ***all*** of my take on the lore with the idea of a story arc I have in mind.\n\nTo brief it up, yes, it would probably take months to get to the very core that ties it all in. But that's actually a good thing because that's part of the whole point. Those months of story development would actually be involving all parts of the already-existing lore, because all of those parts need to be expanded on. My story idea may follow on character (for the most part, at least), because I'm just a single person to write such a thing, but the story ties in champions and summoners together while keeping each major conflict/war seperated in their own respective plots. For instance, while Ashe may be aware of who Ammumu is because they had to have fought on the fields with/against each other at a point, they wouldn't really see each other as Ashe would be currently busy trying to keep the Freljord together with the conflict against Sejuani. A frozen plot that would get icier as Lissandra would later reveal her ultimate plan, based off of her quote: \"This is but a battle. I have already won the war.\"\n\nThink of all of these current wars that involve different lands as separate plots of their own with their own conclusions, but also as pieces of a puzzle of a large superplot that takes things to a whole different level. During all of those months of story development, champions' characters become further expanded and even dynamic, Summoners are involved more than in just behind the scenes, and many opportunities are opened up for events we can play in-game to feel like we're seeing part of the story unfold ourselves.\n\nIt would be much easier for me to write it out than explain it all, because I have a lot of ideas of character development, storylines, and even some ways to make some champion skins canon to the story, but I don't want to spoil too much. Ironically, I probably won't write it because my champion has a near-impossible chance at best of being put into the game, so no one would know who the heck I'm writing about as the story goes on lol\n\nJust to be clear, as much of an impact he would have in the story, he is not involved with every single plot and is not a \"spotlight thief,\" meaning all champions have their own moments. Basically, one would be able to rewrite the same story following different champions to follow different events that the original wasn't even in, and ties it all together for one epic story. Just stating all of that to get rid of any possible notion that my idea for the lore is not at all based off of a \"one person solves it all\" deal.\n\nSo yeah, a whole premise of taking nothing away from the original lore and only giving more involvement all around, from Summoners to champions of each land. Something I wish Riot would trust ***us*** to help them on.\n---\nWalls of text indeed. All welcome for the sake of progressing with this idea and inspiring more. While I have my own ideas in mind, I can always just (maybe) write a long fanfic of it over time. Right now, I'm just hoping my ideas can inspire Riot to give us back the lore we know and love.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Durmeth the Vile","date":"2014-10-07T03:00:35.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I very much like your ideas OP.

The only thing keeping them and their destructive powers limited, just barely, is the Master Nexus located underneath the Institute itself. The core of the Summoner’s magic powers and the main connection router between their Champions is barely holding up.\n> \n> The creatures draw closer to their objective. The only things standing in their way are a team of champions and Summoners that can still hold their links to them, if only by a minimum.

I believe the original reasoning was that having to tie every champion to the league was restricting from a storytelling perspective, and I can see that to a degree, the institute is a fixed location in this world that every participant must have been in contact with at some point, which is a little silly.\nAnd yet not a single piece of new lore really defines the need for the removal, sure there's conflict -Building- in freljord and i'm not really even sure whats going on in shurima.. Azir was revived, ascended, raised his empire from sand.. and just went around making sandcastles I guess? It's not exactly specified where Renekton or Xerath went or their intentions, if the league still existed it would be quite apparent where they went, wouldn't it?\n\nThere's an easy way around this I think. Perhaps the league and summoners could be removed from Runeterra, but not from the game universe entirely, although early on it was used a crutch, cross dimensional summoning is still an existing element. So perhaps the summoners exist in a different world from that of Runeterra? Their influence is less direct on Runeterra, but champions are still summoned to fields of justice to fight and interact with eachother, because without a consistant location the vast majority of champion interaction is reduced to 'fanfictiony' 'What if' scenarios which can't exist in context. How can Skarner and Taric possibly be friends if Skarner is guarding something beneath shurima and Taric is who knows where?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angeluslight","date":"2014-10-08T00:19:29.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the supportive upvotes so far.

No matter how much people beg for clarification, they just refuse to say anything. I personally dont care what they do with THEIR VERSION of the lore, as I'm likely to just make up my own story If I don't like it. But saying that they will communicate with the community, and then flat out ignoring them is wrong.\n\n I've supported Riot in a lot of their decisions so far, Including all of the reworks (Cassiopea is the first one that actually bothered me). They need to give clarity and tell us what is going on. Just a simple \"Good Idea\" or \"interesting\" would be great. But right now, its just silence.

Or was.\n\nRiot claims that \"voting is the best thing you can do here,\" yet all the downvotes on all their posts dealing with the lore and the Board transition don't seem to have any effect. Right now, I think the best thing for *them* to do is freeze whatever they have planned for a bit while they conduct some polls or surveys on what the community wants to see in the future, and how they want to see it. Coming up with big changes out of nowhere that no one wanted is an awful way to go.\n\nIt's time for Riot to get back to the basics and re-engage us, the community, on *our* level, and quit the extreme silence that is only seldom broken with vague responses that tell us nothing. Currently, it's not too late to fit in the existence of the old lore along with the Institute and Summoners, as well as for Riot to redeem themselves, but they must be willing to face the storm they created themselves.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2014-10-05T22:18:06.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how you made my main so important.\n\n<3\n\n\nI agree with you man.

They took the personalities out of the characters and changed them into something else, like with Cassiopeia. Amumu, Skarner, and friends (I say that as a pun to Amumu), are left with absolutely nothing. There clearly wasn't a plan to the end with Shurima. Just a hole they stuck themselves into.\n\nMy post suggests to mend their characters by giving them all their base traits from their original lore back. It may not be 100% the same with all of them, but it's better than making everything so off-putting.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2014-12-31T18:12:44.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what is going to happen to Fiddledticks and Nocturne?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2014-11-17T17:13:19.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always thought that the characters needed more **Character.** i have made multiple posts to request more audio from champions, it feels as though a **Large** portion of champions do not have a solid personality to actually run off and assume what they are actually like.
