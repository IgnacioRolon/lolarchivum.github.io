That&#039;s why Reddit is the better place to even talk about league because they know how to bitch and have fun at the same time. All I see on the boards is bitching. I wish there were more thoughtful posts on here instead of the same old boring shit, the same old nerf this and nerf that, with flawed reasoning behind it and no one even appreciates this game. The boards should be better than this cause as of now the only reason you have to choose the boards over Reddit is Moody P.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2018-12-31T04:20:49.828+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not meant to be fun.","replies":[{"poster":"SunDragonz","date":"2018-12-31T18:11:24.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah ik but all that's on the boards is whining. You can whine and praise the game at the same time but any praise is downvoted to hell or passive aggressive (EG- The art team of riot is so good but the balance team is garbage) It's boring and there is nothing of importance to say on the boards anymore.
