All these people saying winrate doesn't matter do have some merit in their argument but when it's this bad, it kind of becomes void. Is there any valid argument on why Akali is even getting more nerfs when she is already a trash champ.\nEdit: For those saying she is good when mastered, the winrate is still in the low 40s in PLAT+. It's been months since she was reworked as I said and she isnt so hard as to have kept this winrate for the longest time. Sure she is annoying but if you know how to adapt to the matchup, you cool. You just gotta understand she isn't a champion without her shroud and if it keeps getting nerfed true stealth won't matter anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"hoganftw","date":"2018-12-14T05:37:51.592+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":5,"body":"Nobody enjoys playing against her.","replies":[{"poster":"SunDragonz","date":"2018-12-14T08:58:49.822+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":20,"body":"Alot of people don't enjoy playing against champs like Darius either.

I think no, but maybe.\n\nRyze also needs something. only a very small amount of really good players can make him work but that isn't saying much since if youre that good at ryze at that high of a level you can make ANYTHING work. Again, if you check ryze on say, champion gg, and look at win rate by games played you see he isn't even that extravagant there either.
