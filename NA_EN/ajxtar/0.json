They quite literally phased out part of the support gameplay, and phased in the kind of gameplay that allows the support to carry/control the botlane. \nRather than the former macro strategic position of a player who doesn't have to put as much emphasis on the enemies immediately in front of them during the early-mid game (even though in the greater context mid-game has in itself completely changed in parallel).\n\n> I'm glad supports can actually...\n\nYes, now to all of the supports have had their preferred role stripped from the game to cater to players like yourself who's play style better melds with a position like mid or jungle by virtue of the map design allowing for maximum influence over a single lane without having to be as involved in the laning phase.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonscourge","date":"2019-01-02T00:26:05.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they are fun and strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UF Dan","date":"2019-01-01T08:40:17.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lucian: Because Crit item sucks\n\nThresh: Because he's the fan-favorite.

Essence was and is always bought exactly because it gives CDR albeit the passive synergy with his ult is a nice bonus. Black Cleaver also synergizes with Second Shot since he can proc the armor pen quickly. This is why Lucian does not rely on crit items.\n\nLucian buys Blade of Ruined Kind not for the lifesteal, but for the passive, which synergizes with second shot because it procs on hit effects doubling BOTRK's passive effectiveness.\n\nYour last sentence proves my point that Lucian was bad under Crit meta since I was arguing that your original claim:\n>you do realize even if crit items didn't suck, lucian would still be number one.\n\nwas wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AjXtar","date":"2019-01-01T09:04:27.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, please.

Take a look at Akali as well, high banrate for her okish playrate and low winrate. Pyke, coming in second place for playrate as support, has a 48% winrate. Thresh has a 50.38% Clearly there's more than a champions' viability that's going into champion pickrates. You can't tell me Thresh hasn't been a staple support since his release whether he's op or not. And thresh will continue to have a high playrate regardless of the meta because he's just a well designed champion.\n\nRegarding Lucian, there's a reason the top 3 adcs right now are Lucian, Kaisa, and Ezreal. What do they all have in common? A lack of reliance on Crit items. And considering there's a crit rework coming for this same reason, it's pretty reasonable to say that Lucian thrives in this meta specifically due to the lack of viability of crit items.","replies":[{"poster":"AjXtar","date":"2019-01-01T09:49:44.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"zed low win rate\"\nhttps://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Zed/Middle/ 50.5% win rate and 12% pickrate.
