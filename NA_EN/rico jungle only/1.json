A lot of her power comes from strut and double up being quite limiting in their functionality beyond laning phase. Theoretically you can roam with strut, but most times the passive is just a balancing pain because it provides extra poke potential in lane to Miss Fortune's already strong early game. Past her laning phase, both strut and double up just become mediocre tools (double up is usually just an auto attack reset that doesn't bounce in dueling situations), so I am thinking these two need their design more heavily shifted from early to late game to fulfill the marksmen dps role more reliably than her current iteration. \n\nMy thoughts:\n\nReduce her early game lane bullying potential by removing the current strut passive. The current passive does not fulfill any fantasy other than running faster to objectives and giving early game bullying so it is a difficult balancing issue. Tweak the current passive strut by shifting the impure shots passive on-hit magic damage to the current strut passive: the caveat being that strut only turns on once Miss Fortune can reach full stacks on an enemy champion. By cutting some of her early poke potential with constant strut movement, Miss Fortune can trade for better kiting and chasing so she can continue to hunt down her bounty with the fully stacked bonus damage and speed. The change grants her a much needed end game fantasy too since she can hunt down targets.\n\nSince her lane bullying is reduced, double ups functionality should also change to be geared towards better mid to endgame scaling and bounty hunting fantasies. Add a self-buff to impure shots that briefly modifies the double up functionality from a bounce to a heavy damage single target cast which she weaves in-between autos - essentially two quick shots from each barrel - that have above average base damages and do not crit. Again, the current iteration of double up feels very underwhelming outside the laning phase, so adding the impure shots interaction to alter functionality to better fit the situation would make her feel better. The new function of double up increases late game scaling, which seems an appropriate trade off since the removal of potential strut poke in lane. Overall, Miss Fortune should be a stronger mid to late game duelist while reducing her early game bullying with the adjustment to strut.","replies":[{"poster":"Rico Jungle Only","date":"2015-05-31T03:22:24.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"me likey. have that with improvements on her E....maybe being a double charge Make it rain with a shorter cast time, and you have me sold! <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosmo732","date":"2015-05-31T12:11:15.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"All they need to do is fix her scaling since her magic damage abilities scale off AD and her attack damage abilities scale off AP.
