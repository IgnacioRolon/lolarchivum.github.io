No amount of technical jargon can tell us otherwise.  When we say we want solo queue, we mean *we want solo queue.*  No more unbalanced matchmaking in DQ, no more premades, and no more boosters.  If your fan base steadily decreases, you can bet your asses, that it&#039;s because you are trying to tell us that we like something.  Blizzard did that, and look how well it turned out.  Just because a guy with a psych degree says, &quot;People want this.&quot;  Doesn&#039;t mean we actually do.  He was wrong, that&#039;s okay, as long as you acknowledge it.  You can&#039;t tell us, &quot;You don&#039;t want solo queue, you think you do, but you don&#039;t.&quot; We know what we want Riot, please stop kidding yourselves.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-19T15:21:48.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, this fan base has no clue what they want.  I don't want solo queue. I like dynamic queue. And who the fuck are you to speak for the community?\nThe vocal minority is called that because they yell a lot and they are in the minority.  \n\nAlso I'm pretty sure its not the guy with the psych degree saying that but rather the guy with the business degree saying it.  Solo queue and dynamic que can not be implemented at the same time.  It straight up would not work.  Dynamic queue may not be ultra competitive but it is competitive enough for most people (even the ones who want solo que).  \n\n\"You don't want solo queue, you think you do, but you don't.\"","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-05-19T16:32:29.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure it does. dynamic queue coincided with evidence consistent with a decline in userbase and inconsistent with growth in userbase.
