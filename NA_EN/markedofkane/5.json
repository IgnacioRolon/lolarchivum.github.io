The actual model and animation update is really cool and I like it, but his texture for this skin just doesn't fit.\r\n\r\nThe deep green glow look of his old skin was really cool, and how it had those dark metallic colors. His skin tone was also darker giving him a more menacing look rather than someone who looks like they really need a tan.\r\n\r\nI think his skin should be changd a bit, to keep it more close to its original look which is what people like it for.\r\n\r\n-Change the light gray of his helmet and shoulder spines to a deep metallic blue\r\n\r\n-Make his shoulders less than the bland color you get when you mix green and white\r\n\r\n-Make the tentacles of his kilt a sharp glowing green, maybe with a darker background.\r\n\r\nThough this will probably make the skin cost more, maybe make his purple void particles a deep green or maybe a deep blue color.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really like his current skin's look and I feel that the new texture is more of a down grade(Especially after his gameplay downgrade). It is okay for a skin to have a shiny look riot, why not keep it?","replies":[{"poster":"SlackerboyTC","date":"2015-03-01T20:27:42.623+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Eh, you wont be able to enjoy kassadin anyways, who cares?","replies":[{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2015-03-01T20:28:57.849+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"He might as well look nice when he makes his appearence once every hundred games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainTatertits","date":"2015-03-01T20:29:48.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"ALL of the visual changes are to lower the polygon count and bit depth.  the game looks liek shit now.  complete shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-01T20:34:41.794+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I on the other-hand think totally opposite.

I honestly cannot see any positive side.

Technology has existed for quite some time now that allows a game engine to render shading, textures, and effects at much higher resolutions than the polygon count would traditionally allow for, and doing so increases performance while maintaining and even improving graphics.\n\nHowever, in spite of all that, they still managed to make this Kassadin VU suck :(  I mean nothing new? Really?  He's been one of the least visually appealing champions since... well since he was put in to the game really.  The best compliment I've ever heard him paid is that he looks like a half-dressed Darth Vader.

But this time I think he's not making a comeback. Kassadin's ultimate has always been a main issue in balancing him, I feel that reducing its power was necessary to change other parts of his kit, but it was nerfed a little too much. Maybe increase the range by 100 and change the mana cost back to what it was.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-01T20:34:16.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this so much better.","replies":[]}]}
