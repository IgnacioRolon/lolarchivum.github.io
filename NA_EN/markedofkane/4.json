Ezreal just gets recolors for some of his abilities. Since Ezreal's main thing for this skin is evolution, make his abilities, jokes, taunts, dance and recalls change as he evolves. Add different and more powerful sounds as he evolves. Give him quotes in different stages of his evolution.\n\nHere are my concepts for making him better.\n\n\n**Passive**\n\nThe cannon barrel glows brighter the more stacks he has.\n\n**Q**\nStage 1- His current Q\nStage 2- His current Q with a blue ring around it. Makes a clack sound when fired\nStage 3- His current Q with 2 blue rings around it and a shorter tail. Makes a heavier clack sound. He holds his cannon and recoils it into the air after shooting it\nStage 4- His current Q with 3 blue rings around it and a shorter tail. The projectile flickers. He holds his cannon but tanks the recoil into his shoulder\n\n**W**\nStage 1- His current W\nStage 2- His current W with the some of the little blue particles dropping out behind the projectile\nStage 3- His current W but a little more dense looking\nStage 4- His W is now a small crescent. Like his ultimate but just smaller\n\n**E**\nStage 1- Current E\nStage 2- Current E with more particles\nStage 3- Leaves an after image (But it is obvious that is isn't him actually standing there)\nStage 4- Jumps through a portal and jumps out of one. Makes a smug comment like \"Too slow!\" or \"Hah-Ha!\"\n\n**R**\n\nStage 1- Current ultimate \"Full power!\" \"Here it comes!\"\nStage 2- Crescent is a little more sharp(still rounded) and the tail is longer \"Take this!\" \"Time for a light show!\"\nStage 3- Shoots a blast akin to the Kamehameha Wave \"Goodbye!\" \"Try and block it!\" \"Unlimited power!\"\n\n**Taunts**\n\nStage 1- Extends cannon out \"I always wanted a Guinea Pig!\" \"How about a demonstration?\"\nStage 2- Casual stance, shakes head \"Still living in the past huh?\" \"This'll be easy..\"\nStage 3- Flexes cannon arm and points other arm \"Dont look directly at the blast!\" \"How about a lightshow?\"\nStage 4- Shoots a beam like a flare upward \"Now this __ Is superior firepower!\" \"Be a witness __ To perfection!\"\nTo Yi- \"I hope those aren't nightvision goggles\"\nTo Jayce- \"I am the defender of the day after tommorow!\"\nTo Jinx \"Ballistic weaponry? HA!\"\n\n**Jokes**\n\nStage 1- Old jokes\nStage 2- Old taunts\nStage 3- Makes a beam come out of the cannon like a light sabre \"I, am your father! Ahaha, just kidding!\" \"Haha, welcome to the pulsefire age!\"\nStage 4- Looks his suit over \"Chicks dig the suit...Right?\" \"Gah! Scratches!? Dirt!? Where!?\"\n\n**Dance**\n\nStage 1- One tone beat(music)\nStage 2- Two beats(music)\nStage 3- Three beats(music)\nStage 4- Four beats(music)\n\n**Laugh**\nStage 1-3 standard laugh\nStage 4- Snicker\n\n**Recall**\n\nStage 1- Normal\nStage 2- Blue rings consistantly appear\nStage 3- Hovers off the ground, then ascends into the sky \"Time to go.\" \"I'll take the high road!\"\nStage 4- Kneels on the ground before blasting off into the sky at an extreme speed \"I'll be back\" \"Time to break the sound barrier!\"\n\n**Killing an enemy champion**\nStage 1-4- \"Easy come, easy go!\" \"That sure brightened up their day!\"  \"Lights out!\"\n\n**Summoner Icon**\n\nWhy not make it have a glow animation?\n\n\n\n*Thank you for reading this post.*","replies":[{"poster":"Reynard the ƒox","date":"2015-02-18T21:53:21.076+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":4,"body":"Still mad that Riot made us pay $25 for the Udyr visual update.","replies":[{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-02-19T02:21:12.018+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Muh it's a different lore perspective, muh Lore.\n\n*Lore*\n\n**LORE**\n\nShould they even be talking?","replies":[{"poster":"Reynard the ƒox","date":"2015-02-20T18:55:25.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The funny thing it it's not even a different perspective.
