The choice is there because of the healing requirement (90% energy or higher, meaning 180/200 or higher.)\n\nHer Q's default cooldown is 1.5 seconds (every second is 10 energy back, meaning 15 energy back with no CDR.) It starts with an energy cost of 100, reduces to 80 at max rank. Either way, let's stick to the important part here: it's an artificial cooldown.\n\nAssuming a Q at max energy, you have to wait 8-10 seconds early game before recasting it to heal again, instead of just spamming it whenever you get the chance for waveclear (this reduces to 6-8 seconds late game) and this value is unreduced by CDR. This gives Akali a cooldown she can't change, and one the enemy can see.\n\nIf Akali gets shoved under tower because she uses it too sparingly and only for heals, she'll likely miss out on quite a few minions as a result, unless you get pushed off because Akali went aggressive. If she uses it too much, meaning spam for clear, she has no sustain and is much, much easier to take down. This gives the Akali a lot of agency to work with as a result, again, being either spam to clear waves, or save and heal. Whichever you value more, you have to wait for the energy accordingly. \n\nAlso, her W really doesn't make her untouchable. Yes, the whole \"can't be targeted\" thing, but keep in mind a lot of champions can simply ignore this (things like thresh's E or Q can still hit her) and you still AOE her just fine, just can't be directly targeted (autos). I played against a malzahar earlier today, and he would ult me as I revealed myself in the shroud; I would proceed to take the AOEs that they had while invisible. \n\nThis is coming from a currently M6 Akali? I think I'm at least decent enough to be saying stuff like this, but \"just AOE her\" and all the other excuses for the shroud are just annoying to hear, overused, and quite frankly I think they could hit the re-entry time into the shroud to make it easier for her opponents. But yeah.\n\nTL;DR: Q heal is to get her through aggressive enemies and to give her a bit of thinking on how to use her Q other than \"just spam it for waveclear\" since she's an energy champion. The energy cost becomes an artificial cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-11-15T16:17:22.085+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, when Akali uses her shroud it forces enemies to afk right in the middle of it so then they come to the conclusion that she's overpowered when they die","replies":[{"poster":"Noor Sakata","date":"2018-11-15T17:18:12.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali is SO HOT,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4hf6MlzZ,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2018-11-15T16:17:22.085+0000)\n>\n> Actually, when Akali uses her shroud it forces enemies to afk right in the middle of it so then they come to the conclusion that she&#x27;s overpowered when they die\n\nDafuq dude , can you defend your main a little ? cmon you gave haters nothing to complain about LOL","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-11-15T18:55:03.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eggs dee","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-11-15T03:46:11.416+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"because she was created for mid lane gameplay, where she would be matched against ranged champions that constantly poke at her, and nobody asked what would happen if someone just took her into top lane.\n\nthis is just another symptom of ranged abilities and auto attacks not having a counter mechanic in this game. we dont have turn rates, so the only way to deal with range in league of legends is to outstat or outsustain.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-11-15T23:24:43.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where she has been played for like years....
