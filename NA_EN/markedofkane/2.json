As I don't play it, I can't say with absolute accuracy- but don't bounties work differently/tuned for the smaller team, specifically that information is going to be a lot harder to find but I did find this:\n\nAverage is determined by dividing the enemy team's minion and monster gold by four, rather than five, based on the four sources of income on Summoner's Rift (top/mid/bot/jungle). Modes with smaller teams divide by the number of champs per team instead (ex. 3 for Twisted Treeline).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cynikul","date":"2018-11-21T02:56:27.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~I can only assume you're referring to your last game, no one that you killed had a 5 kill streak, nor really did anyone for that matter~~ must mean different match/account\n\nRe- Edit: Also a simple search would tell you shutdown gold is still a thing, and may even tell you things you did not know about how shutdowns function.\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Common Satyr","date":"2018-11-21T02:31:34.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you even read patch notes?","replies":[]}]}
