Zac's old Q was a reliable poke and aoe for wave clear, so that he could function in the role where he had his highest win rate, which is top. Second, he was never a tank.

You were clearly never a Zac main. \n\nIf his new Q and R are so much better and more fun, then why did he go from 2% play rate pre rework all the way up to 2% play rate post rework?

They just traded a small group of Zac mains for a different small group who enjoy playing a sub 50% jungle only support.\n\nZac has almost always been building heavy HP items, and while his AP scalings were decent, the sole reason his W is %HP damage and not flat damage is so that he could build tank items and not be required to build AP items in order to be a functional threat. Just because he doesn't have armor, shields, and damage mitigation doesn't mean he's not a tank. That's not actually what makes a tank a tank - they are supposed to be huge bodies that disrupt and CC the enemy team, and survive so that they can't be ignored. This is where Zac's healing blobules come in, as well as his built in GA. He very much IS a tank, so I have no idea why you are sitting here trying to claim he isn't.\n\nDarius isn't a tank. Garen isn't a tank. Mordekaiser isn't a tank. Vlad isn't a tank. Swain isn't a tank. They're all bruisers, because they have extremely limited CC and their main function is to deal heavy sustained damage to their enemies. Zac doesn't fit in this line up because the majority of his kit is CC peppered with %HP damage - something you'll also notice bruisers don't have on demand.\n\nAs for his old Q, it was garbage. There is no other word for it, just plain garbage. He shot his arm out and slowed you, dealing insignificant damage and not even a significant slow. His new Q not only slows, but it has the added bonus of hard CC'ing enemies too if you can catch 2 of them. That alone improves it - because let's face it, Zac has never used his Q for wave clear, it's always been his W, since it deals better damage and is on a shorter cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"nGio","date":"2018-11-13T16:59:36.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gEy0J3eY,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2018-11-13T15:15:14.170+0000)\n>\nThis is where Zac&#x27;s healing blobules come in, as well as his built in GA.

Builds health, multiple forms of cc, and % HP damage doesn't make you a tank. Zac's highest win % build included old Liandry's both in the jungle and top lane, and it was his core damage item, like Black Cleaver was for AD bruisers. There was probably a place deep in the wood tiers, where he didn't build Liandry's.\n\n> \n> As for his old Q, it was garbage. There is no other word for it, just plain garbage.

He also became a balance nightmare, after years of being at 50-51% win rate, with 1-2% pick rate.\n\nThe day that the Zac rework went in, I was Plat with Zac being my most played at 68% win rate. Was Zac your most played too? No, he wasn't.
