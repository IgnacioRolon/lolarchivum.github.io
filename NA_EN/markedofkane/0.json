Not talking about projectile stuns like TF gold card where you can just dodge but point blank things like Blitz E. I think the technical term for it is disjointing, if I'm not mistaken. Basically, cast times are uninterruptible, or for some spells at least. Once it begins, nothing you do can stop it so the spell will go through while you're being CC'd, even though theoretically you shouldn't be able to cast while CC'd.\n\nCome to think of it, I think Tristana W works the same way, and it's also why people can flash out of Garen's ult for the sword to drop on them over the wall anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-11-06T02:53:14.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More or less yes. Cast times, so far as I know, are only interuptable by death. So that's why sometimes you will see lux ult and it will fizzle because she dies. It's the most notable because her ult is one of the longest cast times in the game. Channels however can be canceled by hard cc. (anything which prevents casting spells) so basically what's happening here is that things get placed on a 'stack' as they are casted. And then they resolve at the speed of the spells. So singed and voli flips have a certain cast time that the game takes into consideration before the flip actually resolves. Basically it matches the time they stand still. If Warwick passes through the range and loses unstoppable before the flip resolves then it simply cancels Warwick's ult and flips him. \n\nThere are some exceptions such as riven's 3rd q iirc. Because it's coded as a dash and suppression stops dashes in their tracks her third q won't knock up because the dash won't complete. (I think if you time the stun 100% perfectly and get lucky with latency you may be able to stun him out of it tho.)\n\nBut ya, that's exactly how trist jump and ezeal shift work to allow them to buffer their jumps over cc and escape. It's far easier with them due to the longer cast times on their spells (.25 for Trish jump and .75 for ez shift iirc)  but you can do it with kassadin and katarina as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2018-11-06T17:00:46.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwiftKitten88,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=37RGuGqK,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-11-06T01:01:42.527+0000)\n>\n> yeah well so is {{champion:19}} \n> \n> hence the giant text that says &quot;cant be disabled&quot; _while_ I&#x27;m being disabled\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peCarUtL--g\n> \n> riot cant code... i posted this bug..
