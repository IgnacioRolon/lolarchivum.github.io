Tentacle Slam would slam the enemy into ground to make them unable to dash or blink. Would make her a little less completely raw damage.\r\n\r\n3. {{champion:57}} \r\nLikely on his E. It would help Maokai against ganks since his E could Ground them upon exploding, giving him time to run from the gank.\r\n\r\n4. {{champion:78}} \r\nMight be overkill with her W, but I think it would be cool if we pushed Poppy into the &quot;Anti-Mobility&quot; niche with her Q applying Grounded.
