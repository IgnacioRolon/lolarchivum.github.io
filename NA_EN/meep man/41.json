However, here a few reasons you should buy it, especially with the recent top tier Juggernaut picks and such, mainly because of what QSS removes. Here are reasons you might want to actually rush a QSS in this meta.\n\n{{item:3140}} removes:\n\n- {{champion:122}} Hemorrhage stacks so he can&#039;t get tons of AD and/or do tons of damage with his ultimate\n- {{champion:82}} ultimate so he can&#039;t get his ghost\n- {{champion:72}} ultimate so he can&#039;t drag you into his team\n- {{champion:114}} ultimate so she can&#039;t give her team a huge heal and probably kill you\n- {{champion:67}} to remove Silver Bolts from you and unstun you from Condemn in a crucial fight\n- {{champion:103}} so she can&#039;t charm and all-in you all the time\n- {{champion:429}} so she can&#039;t deal 1000 damage with Rend (needs testing on my part)\n- {{champion:412}} so he can&#039;t hook you during that needed fight\n\nThe list goes on. Basically everything you find annoying is usually countered by Quicksilver Sash. Getting a Banshee&#039;s Veil with it when you can can also help. Just a reminder that Quicksilver Sash is incredibly good in the current meta of champions who usually rely on debuffing their opponent to win trades. Also, yes, I do believe it also removes TK passive stacks (but dont do that because I want to win with him ok guys?).\nThe main downside of Quicksilver Sash is it is limited to AD users if you want to make full use of it for the entire game. However, if you are AP, getting Zhonya's can be a decent substitute, although this is still overall better. As a Tank, you are out of luck since the only thing you got is Banshee's Veil. Then again, your purpose as a Tank is to absorb crowd control so an item that makes the enemy not want to do that might be bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Acadiaum","date":"2015-09-13T14:22:35.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna build this on Darius if I ever get a mirror lane again, instant removal of stacks would be a win o.o","replies":[{"poster":"Commit Sudoku","date":"2015-09-13T18:45:02.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=acadiaum,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=MVhxq08j,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-13T14:22:35.670+0000)\n>\n> Gonna build this on Darius if I ever get a mirror lane again, instant removal of stacks would be a win o.o\n\nexcept Darius passive deals physical damage now so you lose toooo much combat stats. In a 1v1 situation you would still probably lose if you are going even. Because they will probably have stats that actually help them in the fight whether it be armor, hp, or ad.","replies":[{"poster":"Acadiaum","date":"2015-09-13T19:24:02.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Left for Zed,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=MVhxq08j,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-09-13T18:45:02.623+0000)\n>\n> except Darius passive deals physical damage now so you lose toooo much combat stats.

He loses his passive and ult damage, now I have a chance to finish my own passive and still have my ult damage\n\n\nAt level 6 if I can get stacks I'll gain 45 damage + double damage on my ult also, not only that him seeing the stacks poof will make him panic if I get mine.\n\n\n\nDid the basic math, if they land every hit QSS Darius would be at 267 health and Damage Darius would be at 368 health, but because QSS darius cleansed the stacks he isn't taking extra DoT from bleed and now has all stacks and has access to full power ULT.\n\n\nWhile damage Darius is still bleeding and his ult can only do about 160 true damage.\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Commit Sudoku","date":"2015-09-14T00:42:02.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=acadiaum,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=MVhxq08j,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-09-13T19:24:02.526+0000)\n>\n> I'd be willing to lose some short term damage for long term in lane, imagine hes got me at 4 stacks and I have him at 3 I QSS.
