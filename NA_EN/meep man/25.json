{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-04-26T16:54:10.790+0000","title":"We Need More Champions Like Draven","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":121,"down_votes":15,"body":"And no, I&#039;m not talking about the personality. I&#039;m talking about his design. Draven has this special way of playing called &quot;Juggling&quot; that makes him a lot different than other ADCs. It makes him difficult to play, but it pays off so much with that 85% increased damage at Rank 5. Some people like &quot;Juggling&quot;, while others don&#039;t. HOWEVER, it isn&#039;t that they don&#039;t like it because it&#039;s clunky or bad or anything like that. People don&#039;t like it because they just don&#039;t like it. They don&#039;t like the juggling movement pattern and attack pattern and such. They want something else.\nThis is what should be wanted in every champion. A kit that DOES NOT appeal to the grand majority, but a smaller minority of players. A kit that plays differently from every other champion in the game and has a different style of play. Not a kit that doesn&#039;t appeal because it&#039;s strange or clunky, but because it just doesn&#039;t fit what the player wants to do in the game. That is exactly the type of champions we need. We need more Dravens.\n\nEDIT: I think people are a little confused about what I'm saying here at times. I want champions to accomplish their goals in a different way from everyone else. Because they do this in a different way, they can be unappealing to other players who DON'T want to accomplish their end goal in that way.\nFor example, say the end goal for two champions is: Deal Damage to the Enemy Team. Now let's get more specific. Say they are both ADCs and want to deal damage. The goal is for them to be different. So, let's say we make Champion #1 deal damage by shooting the enemy, but has limited ammo. Let's say this is Jhin.\nNow, we have to create Champion #2. Champion #2 deals his damage in a unique way from Jhin, even though Jhin is unique still. Champion #2, let's say, has a passive that splits himself into two separate units with different spells. You have to micro manage these units to deal optimal damage. This might not be what people want to do to achieve their goal, and some of those people will like Jhin.\n\nBasically, in this game where there are 130 champions, each champion should be unique enough to really CLICK with one certain person and no one else. This way, everyone has a champion that fits their play style EXACTLY, but is likely not a champion others can play. Every player needs a champion like Draven who clicks with them, but is not popular mainly because players outside his player base just don't like how he plays.","replies":[{"poster":"underscores222","date":"2016-04-26T18:29:31.215+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":1,"body":"New champions that come out usually have something different about them.

Aurelion and Kalista are that in between for me, where they are kind of half way unique to where they have a lot unique about them but they aren't just super, extremely different playing than others. They don't play entirely differently over others of the same class.\nI disagree with Tahm Kench though. He adds a new mechanic, being the Eating of course, but does he just play extremely differently from other champions? Not really, especially with recent changes adding more and more \"Build the 3 stacks\" mechanic. Not quite anywhere near a Draven to me.\n\nThe main point I was trying to make was you SHOULDN'T be able to jump into a champion and within 2 games know their play style from playing a different champion.\n\nEDIT: I change what I say about Kalista, she is up there now that I think about her link mechanic and everything.","replies":[{"poster":"OneSmoothDude","date":"2016-04-27T16:27:46.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"GP has his barrels.

Only GP has the barrel minigame to interact with his opponents on.\n{{champion:157}} Yasuo is another half-way thing for me. The fact that I can take what you said and put it on someone else means Yasuo isn't unique enough in how he does what he does. Lee has his dashes. Renekton has his dashes. Give me a reason I can't apply to others.\n{{champion:111}} While unique, it's not a big enough reason to say he is unique. It's a small, yet satisfying part of his kit. Needed, but not the reason you pick him.\n{{champion:86}} This is another one, but is less visible. Garen plays a lot differently than others (usually) since he has to hunt a target determined by the game. Garen falls into a category of various niches I call \"Hunters\". A lot of champions these days, actually hunt a selected champion. It's just how they do it that makes them unique. Garen is not like other Hunters, so he is unique. Could be more unique, 100%, but he is unique.\n\nI think people are confused about what I'm saying. Not mechanically hard, but different. A champion doesn't need to be hard to be different, but that sometimes comes with it. Draven is a lot DIFFERENT from other ADCs. Therefore he is unique.","replies":[{"poster":"XxXGwanXxX","date":"2016-04-27T19:28:28.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is the only Champ that is permanently in URF mode lol.

You enter a game and you have a role. Whether that be Tank, Fighter, Mage, etc.\n2. You look at your champion and know what you want to be doing. This should be a lot easier to do with Subclasses. (Side note that they need to add the unique classes of Ganker and Pusher IMO)\n3. From there, you see how exactly you will be doing what you want to do.\n4. Do that.\n5. If what you did can be directly compared, even slightly, to any other champion in the way you did it (and not outcome, but the process itself), this is not a unique champion (and therefore not a Draven)\n\nZiggs, for example, is different now. Before, his objective was really just push waves with spells and then use his passive to deal more damage to a tower. He was a pretty generic Mage Pusher. Now, this method can be a lot different. Instead of using his spells entirely to push the wave, he can now do something unique, being executing towers.\nZiggs can now HIT AND RUN towers so to speak. His W new mechanic is powerful and unique enough to warrant a change in play among Ziggs to become perhaps a dedicated Pusher mage. Before, it was AoE Mage. Now it is really Pusher Mage. I want Riot to continue this trend and maybe even expand upon this with Ziggs, giving him more potential Pushing mechanics.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-04-27T04:57:41.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to cackle like a madman when she becomes fotm...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZeeWolfZ","date":"2016-04-26T19:26:57.476+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Champions that take skill?
