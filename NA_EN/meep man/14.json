Tf is not an assassin. Assassins are supposed to go in fast kill a target and go out. Tf pokes from the range of a fight, maybe goes with ghost halfway in. He can catchup with his ult but never starts a fght with it cause it takes to long, he cant escape after that and can be easily catched by any ability like a morg stun. Nida is more of a hybrid with an artilerypoke ability on q and a diving tool on her w cougar form. Eve and Ekko are more like divers considering their builds are even good with tankitems. they dont burst you down, ekko stays on you and gows back with ult if he drops low. Eve and akali can be build hybrid. while you can choose on eve ad or ap you go like hextechgunblade on akali (akali and fizz tankbuild cause they are divers possible too). And than last considering their diffrent playstyles and needs for builds like kassadin neads much mana, lb still some, fizz less, akali eneryg and kata nothing, its hard to make an ap assassinitem that suits all and is good for all of their earlys. even duskblade is not so good for all ad assassins, the only good is the armorpen. like rengar and kha how they are at the moment kill their targets before duskblade reacts. But all Ad Assassins build nearly the same, most time armorpen and lifesteal, shaco and actual rengar going for crit too(or rengar offtank trinity and titanic). And than we have fizz and kassadin (kass with roa too) with lichbane, akali gunblade, kata ludens/mejas, lb like no diffrence to a normal ab build. I said half of them needs mana. Considering an item that all could use beside lb would be an magicpen/cdr item which gives no mana, but what shoud it do? jsut a passive item? an ap version of duskblade? Than it would take same problems that other champs can use it too, like duskblade actual jhin and mf can build it and the ap/cdr/pen item nothing would stop players to build that on kennen, vlad, heimerdinger even. The Ap assasins have diffrent builds and are maybe equal to count with ad assasins, but ad divers are more likly with at least the same first 1-3 items like divers than ap assins with ap divers, which are together with ap burst, poke and support in all items (rabbadons/zhonyas) in msot items. Ad champs take crit on adc, armorpen and lifesteal on assasins, one of that and tank on bruisers or attackspeed(trinity), offtankitems(BC,Titanic,Steraks). So ad assassins are rly an own class with own items, hard to say that on ap assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-08-12T19:08:48.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, paragraphs.

I think Riot needs to create a totally new stat for them to try and differentiate them so their items don't affect mage balance.","replies":[{"poster":"HÃ¤xel","date":"2016-08-15T03:13:56.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try my best.\n\nYea i dont know if they rly need a new stat. I think mana/manareg more of an stat already assassins cant rly use cause not needed (vlad and kennen dont use it either i know) and for this i seperate melee and range assassins. Lb building Mr/Roa and all other items like a normal mage, maybe more tending to build ludens as rylais, is i think ok.\n\nAssassins and Mages in the Jungel like Fiddlesticks(kinda assassin), Elise and Nidalee are building not direct manaitems for manaproblems, they build runic ecos and a lichbane maybe and dont need more to go through the jungel, the lichbane is like main item for melee assassins cause they work even most time much with autoattacks(except kata) while Lb even with the range advantage is all about short mageability combos.\n\nAnd the Melee assassins outside of going into jungel like Katarina(resourceless), Diana, Fizz and Ekko Mid dont need rly manaitems beside the lich. A Morellos can be build by playing agaisnt champs like vladimir or mundo, so you get 20 cdr and a strong passive in exchange for the mana while in normal matchups the with his passive is ok, but it gives better choises cause like i said, you dont rly need the mana. Nashors could be build on Diana for example, but she can be palyed without it too adn the other ones dont need it.\n\nOnly actual Problem is Kassadin who rly needs actual rly much mana but autoattacks too, like he builds Roa and Lichbane. He needs more mana as some mages like Heimer, but still has to work with his basics cause one ability is even an empowered basicattack. But im not here to discuss if Kassadin needs to be changed and how.\n\nSo Melee Assassins in the past got like nearly no Cdr cause it was combined with Manaregitems. Now it gives Cdr in Defensiveitems and even if Riot has maybe already thrown to much cdr on items, i see still Assassins in a Problem: They can maybe give Assassisn shorter Cds to exchange the trait that they normaly cant stuck as well cdr.  But it ends with People still building Cdr to be even more effective with Abilitys, so Assassins like fizz can jump all time with qe and Adc is dead. But without building morrelos you need to build as an assassin defense items, which is a twist cause as an assassin, you normaly want or should as the description of an assassin just build damage. And with Mages who can build Morellos and either Zhonyas or Abysal for 30Cd while an Assassin needs 3 out of Zhonyas, Abysal, Lichbane and Protobelt for being equal, the mages win with one item more for actualy solo dmg. \n\nSo what would be good is an Ap Item what Mages dont rly want and dont gives Mana, but gives Cdr and much Ap like a Morellos. I think rly a good start would be a Morellos with same passive, they share it so that does not stack, and Assassins dont need to buy Morellos against Vlad/Soraka/Mundo while mages dont build it cause they go normaly Morellos. And  that Mages building Roa or Tear, while tear is like everytime build together with a catalystitem, dont se item too, it could be have the same passive from the ane as the catalys without be build out of one (cause assasisn as mentioned dont want the mana). I said i want a full dmg Item so Health would be maybe bad, penetration would be better. But if the Passive would be half of the catalystitempassive like \"everytime you spent mana you regenerate 20% of mana spent as health\" without the other part getting Mana while being attacked, roa users cant use that item either.\n\nIf other items are needed than it would be maybe rly an ap duskblade. Assassins as mentioned use basic attacks and for procing a Duskblade it would work after some basicattacks.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-08-15T04:30:36.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has stated they don't want CDR to be easily accessible.
