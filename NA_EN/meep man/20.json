That would kind of be disappointing in my eyes since I don&#039;t like it when a species of mythical being is introduced to a game and the first iteration of them is some &quot;ugly duckling&quot; iteration of them. If we are going to get a dragon, I hope he lives up to their MASSIVE personality and lore, otherwise I will be kind of sad. In my honest opinion, if he is a big dragon, he almost NEEDS to be the biggest champion in the game off the bat.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-02-20T22:46:09.732+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Inept Maverick,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UBW7zh4Y,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-20T19:30:22.610+0000)\n>\n> Im hoping this guy is really huge and not some little baby drake thing.\n\nDon't quiz me for details (I'm not allowed to share the ones I know, and I know so few!), but I don't think Aurelion Sol will be very baby drake-like. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-02-20T23:18:05.085+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the love of god give him an Ao Shin release skin...\nThe reason I want this might be a little different compared to others,\nhttp://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/3229/7419/original.jpg\nThis just made me too damn sad, let him live on! ._.\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-02-20T23:30:04.653+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwHc Fenris,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UBW7zh4Y,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-02-20T23:18:05.085+0000)\n>\n> For the love of god give him an Ao Shin release skin...\n> The reason I want this might be a little different compared to others,\n> http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/3229/7419/original.jpg\n> This just made me too damn sad, let him live on! ._.\n> {{summoner:31}}\n\nI saw that - and it brought a single tear to my eye as well.
