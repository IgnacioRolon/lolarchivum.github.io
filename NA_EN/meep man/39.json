You can't do anything; inane impractical Q and R, rest of his kit is dragged down into obsolescence. Did they even test out this travesty in applied gameplay or just fold their arms and say AAAYYYYYYYYYYYY wacky Zac thematic clarity!!! \n\nWorst champ in the game now.","replies":[{"poster":"Jerry Temporary","date":"2017-05-13T23:04:46.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It reminds me of king dedede in smash 4.  I love that character but he is bottom tier for a reason.  Much like new zac, much of his kit is highly situational and even if he could land his attacks consistantly, he is fairly undertuned as far as numbers go.   Tbh i think dedede is a much more undertuned dude than zac but they both need more numbers and better framedata.  Zac feels impractible possibly more because of the low numbers and moves taking too long to come out.  The new stretch seems weird anyways, but if his new ult didnt have such a delay before the good part it might be alright.  Just like if dedede got the startup frames on  fsmash and dspecial reduced he probably wouldnt need a rework like some have start believe.\n\nTbh idk if is really is a good contribution to the thread.  You just triggered a thought i had had to share.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-05-08T00:55:41.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't feel like this stat shift was thought through very well","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-05-08T01:27:08.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it was thought out, but Riot's complete and utter refusal to do any preemptive balance changes was not.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-05-08T01:31:32.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even barring these champs who specifically work well with health, majority of tanks and bruisers valued the higher HP values and were balanced around that being the primary defensive stat","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2017-05-08T05:46:44.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, these champions were balanced around health first and resistances second since the shift in defensive paradigm back in preseason 3. That means, they've been balanced around this concept for 4.5 years, more or less.\n\nI really don't think you can expect a shift in the paradigm that fundamental to immediately come out completely balanced. Hell, it took Riot the majority of S3 to balance the previous paradigm shift.\n\nThe other issue for tanks currently, especially in top lane, is the nerf to Sunfire Cape. This nerf was long overdue (at least since mid-season 6), but now tanks need to find other build paths to work in the top lane. And players as a majority won't immediately do that after a patch, even if the patch notes suggest the necessity of it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jerry Temporary","date":"2017-05-13T22:45:11.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an Alistar main and yeah.  The hp nerfs really suck where i like to focus on hp since my ult gives me giant resistances.  I certainly didn't get the worst of it, but it would be nice to have that hp back.  What i want in future updates is to further reduce damage (very slightly for now) and buff tankyness again.  I wouldnt mind it if items damage could scale off of damage built.  That way full tank builds have their tankyness but you dont get your damage unless you build it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2017-05-08T05:48:31.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A big part of the issue for tanks currently, especially in top lane, is the nerf to Sunfire Cape.
