The Time to Start a Game CAN Be a Lot Shorter**\r\nIn Dota 7.00, the game itself loads WHILE you perform champion select. You can get into a match in about 3-5 minutes time minimum and 6-7 minutes maximum. Meanwhile in LoL, it takes MUCH longer to get into a game since the game itself DOES NOT load behind the scenes. In LoL, you use about 5-6 minutes in champion select before waiting about 1-3 minutes for loading. This is bare minimum unless everyone in the match has amazing computers and all select characters very quickly. This makes the minimum time to get into a game in LoL about 6-9 minutes compared to the new Dota&#039;s 3-5 minutes.\r\nBasically, what I am saying is that LoL could be a LOT more refined and swift with getting players into games than it currently is.\r\n\r\n**2. The Actual Champion Select Could Have More Elements In It**\r\nIn the new Dota 7.00, you purchase your starting items and predict enemy lanes before you start the game (as well as some Dota specific stuff but whatever with that).

Battle Passes also usually allow for the community to vote for certain heroes/champions to be given a new skin or get a VU. Basically, Battle Passes are everything a LoL player would want if it was put into LoL.\r\nThe Battle Pass would be a.) a way to more quickly gain IP for runes, rune pages, and champions, b.) something to do while waiting for a game that is within the client, and c.) a way for the community to interact with Riot&#039;s design process by choosing which champion gets a VU/VGU (or whatever) next.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-12-12T22:40:23.244+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":1,"body":"i have one problem with your post\n**\nit's dota 3 not dota 2**\n\nThis dota has nothing to do with the old one, and every streamers/viewers are calling it Dota 3, the entire game literally changed, you take dota2 heroes and put them in a new game\n\nJokes aside, this is a good post","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2016-12-12T22:42:04.821+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":0,"body":"but valve can't count to 3","replies":[{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2016-12-13T01:55:31.343+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"DotA 2 Episode 2","replies":[{"poster":"doombotMECHA","date":"2016-12-13T14:48:00.348+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"DotA 2 Act 6 Act 6 Intermission 4","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"doombotMECHA","date":"2016-12-13T15:01:41.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh please it can't that ba---\n_googles the patch notes_\n_takes off sunglasses_\nMother of God......","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2016-12-13T16:19:48.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.pcgamer.com/why-dota-2s-700-update-is-such-a-big-deal/\n\nit's literally dota 3, valve used 6. something for 10 years, and suddenly it goes from 6.88 to 7.00\nit's dota 3 but they don't want to use the number 3 because they aren't allowed to do so\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtLrYAK6hw8\nwe will miss old dota","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-12-13T01:46:52.188+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, especially as a Techies player, who is now a shit ton less frustrating to play against in my opinion since infinite duration Land Mine kills can no longer come out of the blue and now have a delay when stepped on.

I would imagine that there's _some_ of this in League's code, yes, but only as far as simplifying how Riot themselves can add new content. And it may not actually be set up in such a way that, say, allows Ashe to have a different Q than her main game Q in any sort of elegant way.\n\nPlus, take this from someone who actually mods DOTA 2. It's really, really not a good feeling when you have to work around new features that weren't properly integrated into the modding API, and that's happened quite a lot with Valve.
