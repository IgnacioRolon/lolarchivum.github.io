An idea that could be tried is making his passive tower drain a portion of it's life every time it fires a bullet (like 3% or so per attack, would require fine tuning) so the tower does gradually kill itself, but only when it is in use and being assaulted. Just having it passively kill itself off encourages the opponent more to just roam elsewhere momentarily (especially with the gold reward changes) since they know it's only a temporary obstacle that will die off in a minute. The only time the current tower is a real threat or even decent obstacle is if it is spawned in the middle of a team fight, upon which there really isn't any difference between it and a Heimerdinger turret other than being restricted to where a turret has died.\nThis is especially true in your own base for defending objectives since Azir's turret itself doesn't prevent damage to structures behind it last time I checked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2016-12-08T03:14:20.804+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about something halfway?\n\nSay the closer he builds the turret to his nexus, the better the turrets are. On an enemy inner turret, it would degrade even faster than what we have now. However, this gets better and better, until you finally reach the inhib towers, where they won't degrade at all, or just very slowly. You could also possibly add in an interesting buff to his towers if built on a nexus tower, since they are the closest to his nexus, like increased damage or fire rate. \n\nI offer this idea because in several other games where turrets are used (i.e. Overwatch), the character using them is predominantly defensive. Sure, they have offensive uses, but they really shine in defense.\n\nIn my opinion, this could give Azir an interesting niche, and possibly even tie in well with him being an Emperor. The closer you get to his home, the better he can defend it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2016-12-08T21:34:56.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8KyxxvEy,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2016-12-08T02:17:52.170+0000)\n>\n> Non decaying passive towers are something we&#x27;ve tried, both during Azir&#x27;s original development and again during the 6.24 development cycle.

Would tethering the tower's usefulness to Azir's presence be more impactful when he's trying to hold a position, but also eliminate the scenario where Azir can create a turret for his team to fall behind if they're getting rushed/need to retreat? \n\nAs a trade-off to this power, wouldn't it make sense to limit him to a stationary role when he's using it? Just trying to spitball ideas here since Azir's been on the backburner for a long time, and the core idea behind his design was for him to be a zone-control mage, with the turret being one the strongest form of zone control in the game.\n\nOn another topic; has the team looked into removing Azir's Q's damage in favour of gearing it towards more of a re-positioning tool so that Azir's DPS is more closely related to how effectively he can use his soldier's AAs? A bit problem that has been expressed by both Riot and players is how effectively he's able to burst opponents from a quick Q -> AA, AA. With Rylais becoming considerably less effective on the Emperor, might it be a good opportunity to shift more power from the Q into the W to make his pattern more counter-playable?\n\nAs an aside, this would also make him more distinct from Orianna who relies on passing the ball through enemies to deal damage - whereas he would rely on hitting as many AAs as possible to maximize his output.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2016-12-08T05:28:45.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder about tying the strength of the tower in relation to Azir's allies, himself, and the such.
