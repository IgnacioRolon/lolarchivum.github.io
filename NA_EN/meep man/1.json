I think it would make you feel a ton more powerful/important if your giant character had really big and heavy sounding footsteps when they were running down a lane to initiate a fight. Characters this could apply for are: {{champion:12}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:154}} \nMaybe {{champion:75}} and {{champion:58}} while they have their ultimate abilities active as well to make them extra intimidating in a fight.\n\nI just feel like something like this would help with someone playing these champs feel more powerful while playing. Sion already has something like it on his ultimate, why not have it as a feature for others? Besides, how much does it take to record footsteps that match-up with each champions walk cycle? Just speed up the footsteps with the same percentage multiplier as their movement speed increase.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2017-06-09T15:57:33.458+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this is actually sort of an interesting creative question in League. A few of our sound designers like Utora and ChefSpecial have done some really great foley and foosteps for champs like Kled and Warwick, respectively. They sound GREAT to my ears. They add a lot of life.\n\n_BUT_\n\nGood feeling sound and game clarity don't always work well together. Footsteps might feel good and add life to a champion between 00:00 and 02:00, but once you start laning and teamfighting, they turn into noise that's not really that important for gameplay. So it's a question of allowing a player to focus on important moments. Most current in game foosteps are aural cues that are attached to a specific player choice (bloodhunt, or Sion Ult as you pointed out).\n\nFor now, League is largely footstepless, but who knows what the future may hold!","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-06-09T16:30:41.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, the future is an enigma to us all. I think just making footsteps have a more quiet feel or just making them fade out in combat would be nice. The main time you would appreciate the feeling for them is out of combat and when you are chasing someone down anyways. Also, just making them able to be toggled would be a good feature since, if the player thinks to themselves, \"Man, these footstep sounds are nulling my senses to avoid damage or deal it,\" they can just toggle it off in a similar way to shadows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2017-06-09T16:28:07.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be curious about how problematic a 'out of combat' walking sound might be that fades/disappears when combat is entered, or enemies are nearby. Sort of reminds me of a 'the sounds of nature quiet in the woods when danger is near' a bit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moogle890","date":"2017-06-10T11:57:21.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're not giants, but i'd like to hear maybe the clicking of heels for champs like {{champion:28}}  and {{champion:21}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-06-09T03:12:51.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how'd you forget {{champion:79}} \n\nyou should hear this guy before you see him","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-06-09T14:17:27.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, haha! I mean, I feel like you want to limit it to ACTUAL ginormous dudes though so you don't open a huge can of worms of \"Hey, this guy has it but he doesn't!\" I get that Gragas is a ginormous dude, but is he a giant monster or is his head piercing the clouds? Is he a giant golem made of metal or is he carrying an anchor? You get what I'm saying. If we put footsteps on Gragas, it might just turn into adding footsteps for every champion, which wouldn't be bad really, just a little too time consuming in my opinion. Doing it for just the REALLY giant champions likely wouldn't be too over the top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2017-06-09T05:29:28.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The footsteps, the chugging, or the cheeto crumbs in his beard rubbing against each other?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2017-06-09T03:11:57.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, like Skarl does right now?","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-06-09T04:10:09.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, kind of...","replies":[]}]}]}
