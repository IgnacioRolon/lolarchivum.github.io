Gutting a Champion Is Never the Answer**\nGutting someone as in making them weak and underpowered. This is never the answer. I don&#039;t care if you hate the champion because there is someone out there who loves the champion. Hate Yasuo? Tell that to the Yasuo player base which is huge. I don&#039;t care if he is hated by many, someone loves him and making him unarguably unplayable is not the way to make this game better.\nEdit: And by gutting, I mean make the champion completely unplayable by any means. In the past, Riot would make a champion relatively underpowered intentionally if their kit was flawed, but they were never unplayable. No one, even if everyone told you otherwise, was an instant lose upon locking them in.\n\n**2. We Cannot Buff Champions That Are Currently Balanced Without Other Negative Changes**\nIf someone is sitting at a 50% win rate and has their dedicated player base, unless the buff is something so minor and/or more of a QoL change to make playing them feel a little better, you can&#039;t just buff a champion because they aren&#039;t seeing frequent play in the meta, are countered by the current meta champion, etc... That is exactly how some new OP rises up and kills everyone. Then they become the ones complained about. If someone gets a buff while balanced, they need to get nerfed somewhere else or they will become overpowered. That should be obvious.\n\n**3. Details Details Details When Telling Why a Champion Needs Nerfs/Buffs**\n&quot;This champion is extremely broken because I hate them. Fire the balance team. Gut this. Gut that.&quot; No, we need details. If you can&#039;t come up with an argument other than &quot;I hate them&quot; then chances are you just got whopped by them in-game and are angry you lost. Furthermore, don&#039;t close yourself off from discussion in the thread. If you don&#039;t want to discuss something like a human being, don&#039;t post something on a forum. A forum is a place for discussion, not baby talk. Act like a baby, and you will be met with other babies and be treated like one.\n\n**4. Insulting Others During a Balance Discussion Helps Nothing**\nI don&#039;t need to explain this point. If someone is insulting you, try to keep your head. Likewise, however, if you start throwing out insults, don't expect the other person to treat you like a king or even a respectable human being. If you sucker punched someone, don't expect some free cake in return. However, all in all, just don't fight. Control yourself and act mature.\n\n**5. If a Champion Is Reworked, There Was a Reason**\nTry and learn what these reasons are before speaking. If you don&#039;t come in with all the details, you will just sound like someone who is ranting and doesn&#039;t know what they are talking about. Also, please try and understand the reasoning behind the rework. By all means, if Riot decided to rework someone because &quot;they felt like it&quot;, jump on them and tell them why this rework helped nothing. However, if Riot has a reason that is valid, please understand that the charm you saw in the champion was likely very annoying to everyone else... or you were a very small minority and if a champion is only played by like five people, Riot will likely try to expand that number.\n\n**6. Don&#039;t Discuss the PBE Like It is Law**\nIf you see a change on the PBE, do not treat it like it WILL happen. Several changes are constantly removed from the PBE, so if Kha&#039;Zix got some insane buff that seems strange, chances are it will be removed if it really is that bad. Likewise, do not treat changes on the PBE like they aren&#039;t there. If Malzahar is OP and Riot nerfs Malzahar on the PBE, please don&#039;t continue to ask for Malzahar nerfs on the Boards when they are already coming. Also, if you really don&#039;t like a change on the PBE, you can definitely voice your opinion, but please abide by the other rules listed here and don&#039;t overreact about it.\n\n**7. Stats Are Not the Full Picture, But They Are a Great Guide**\nIf someone on multiple sites is sitting at a 50% win rate, a 4.5% play rate, and maybe a 5% or so ban rate, don&#039;t deny these stats like they don&#039;t exist. There clearly isn&#039;t as big of an issue with this champion as you think there is. Chances are you just got hit by a OTP that has mastered the champion when they stomped you last game. Just respect that the opponent was good and move on. Learn from your mistakes and become a better player.\n\n**8. Read and Analyze All of a Post**\nDon't just assume something ab[o](https://media1.giphy.com/media/xT9DPwKoIuCCHBdoeQ/giphy.gif)ut a post before you read it. Be sure to analyze all of a post and read it all before passing a judgement about it. If you don't have all the information, you could end up just looking kind of dumb and asking questions the person you are discussing with has already answered. Furthermore, don't continue to ask the same question after someone gave you an answer you don't like. You have to change their opinion somehow before asking again, so just spamming someone won't get you anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2018-01-23T16:07:40.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":19,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2018-01-23T17:19:43.201+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"u need to be reworked too","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2018-01-23T19:40:01.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ichoes","date":"2018-01-23T21:25:49.427+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You forgot rule #3","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-01-23T16:38:23.092+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"Excellent points!\n\nI want people to keep #5 in mind today, in particular.

Gutting a few particularly problematic champions will barely affect the player base.  In fact you could argue that it might improve it.  Players have a limited amount of patience for broken balance and mechanics.  Certain things just aren't fun to play against. \n\nAs for the kits being gutted, the balancing process isn't as simple as you're making it out to be.  Sometimes the champion design is so broken on a fundamental level that tuning passes just won't solve it.  It's not always about balance either.  There are plenty of instances where \"balance\" is objectively fine but the gameplay is unhealthy.  Rather than devoting unreasonable amounts of resources to something that just doesn't work very well is therefore not a good solution.  When a champion gets \"gutted\", the goal is almost certainly an eventual rework.  When a champion is extremely unpopular, however (like in Urgot or Yorick's case), that rework could take awhile.  Someone like Yasuo, however, might be more of a priority. \n\nI hate Yasuo though :P","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-01-23T20:36:45.829+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'll repeat myself, it absolutely matters how many champions we are talking about.\n\nif we are talking about just 1-5 champions then the impact isn't so bad.

And it's not good for the boards or for the game when players like that come on here and demand gutting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2018-01-23T21:40:55.445+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":">Riot left some champs in the garbage on purpose,\n\nYeah\n\n>Yasuo and Lee Sin need the same treatment.\n\n\nno","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-01-23T18:52:25.544+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mostly spot-on, but:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdeArIzp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-23T15:39:07.264+0000)\n>\n> **1. Gutting a Champion Is Never the Answer**\n> Gutting someone as in making them weak and underpowered. This is never the answer. I don&amp;#039;t care if you hate the champion because there is someone out there who loves the champion. Hate Yasuo? Tell that to the Yasuo player base which is huge. I don&amp;#039;t care if he is hated by many, someone loves him and making him unarguably unplayable is not the way to make this game better.\n\nUnless you're {{champion:37}}, in which case it's the only answer. (only sort of kidding)\n\nLess farcically, it does seem like Riot has no interest in keeping all champs viable at all times. And I don't mean in the sense of being \"in meta\" or \"flavor of the week\", I mean that champs get hit with the nerf bat hard enough to make them not viable for most players, after which they get a rework.\n\nSo gutting a champion is sometimes the answer Riot gives us.\n\n\n> **6. Don&amp;#039;t Discuss the PBE Like It is Law**\n> If you see a change on the PBE, do not treat it like it WILL happen. Several changes are constantly removed from the PBE, so if Kha&amp;#039;Zix got some insane buff that seems strange, chances are it will be removed if it really is that bad. Likewise, do not treat changes on the PBE like they aren&amp;#039;t there. If Malzahar is OP and Riot nerfs Malzahar on the PBE, please don&amp;#039;t continue to ask for Malzahar nerfs on the Boards when they are already coming. Also, if you really don&amp;#039;t like a change on the PBE, you can definitely voice your opinion, but please abide by the other rules listed here and don&amp;#039;t overreact about it.\n\nAt the same time, a number of really shitty changes have made it through PBE over the years, to the point where it's caused people to question why the PBE is even P if feedback is to be ignored. As an example, people were calling shenanigans on {{item:3504}} in 6.22, it got buffed directly twice in S7 (arguably three) before finally being scaled back in 7.21, enough for it to be a game-changing item at LCS.\n\n \n> **7. Stats Are Not the Full Picture, But They Are a Great Guide**\n> If someone on multiple sites is sitting at a 50% win rate, a 4.5% play rate, and maybe a 5% or so ban rate, don&amp;#039;t deny these stats like they don&amp;#039;t exist. There clearly isn&amp;#039;t as big of an issue with this champion as you think there is. Chances are you just got hit by a OTP that has mastered the champion when they stomped you last game. Just respect that the opponent was good and move on. Learn from your mistakes and become a better player.\n\nSo that means {{champion:67}} and {{champion:142}} are issues with their >50% banrates, right? Wouldn't the ban rate be more evenly spread in a balanced game where there are aren't OP flavors of the week? That banrate tells me that most people hate dealing with this champ, which if I were the designer or a balance team person, would give me pause.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-23T23:54:08.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well to be fair, every champion is banned a lot following their release, and Zoe came out soon after the 10 ban system, giving her an even higher ban rate than normal.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-01-24T00:42:39.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone who usually does not ban new champions when they come out, I am in favor of banning Zoe usually.

Gutting a Champion Is Never the Answer**\n\nThis is perhaps the only point I do not fully agree with, in part because this is a strategy Riot has used in the past. For sure, far too many players on here demand champions to be gutted when much more reasonable nerfs or changes would suffice, but when a champion is proven to be severely unhealthy for the game, as was the case for Poppy, Sion and Urgot prior to their VGUs, or Kassadin in his >90% ban rate days, I do think it is appropriate to intentionally limit their presence by making them underpowered (but not to the point of being useless either). With that said, because Gameplay often tends to be hyperbolic in evaluating the brokenness of champions, there are also far too many champions on here who are complained about as if they were the absolute worst thing that ever happened to the game, when in reality they're not as awful as they're said to be (even though some of them are indeed in not-so-great shape). Because of this, while I think making champions deliberately underpowered should be a viable option _as an absolute last-case, urgent and *temporary* solution_, I absolutely agree that it should never be the _first_ answer to any kind of champion-related issue, as is all too often the case in this space.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdeArIzp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-23T15:39:07.264+0000)\n> \n> **2. We Cannot Buff Champions That Are Currently Balanced Without Other Negative Changes**\n\nThis I completely agree with, though an issue I've often run into is also that a lot of players on the Boards tend to not factor this in when arguing _against_ power shifts. There have been many times where I made a comment about giving some kind of QoL buff to a champion that was already strong, then getting downvoted and criticized for wanting to make that champion broken, even as I explicitly said _in the very comment those users were replying to_ that that champion should also lose some power elsewhere to avoid becoming too good. The same has also happened when I suggested nerfing weaker champions in some aspect, while also buffing them in another. As players and members of a community, we need to be more conscious of the bigger picture here, and not tear each other to pieces just because we only bothered to read through half of what a person was saying. If a person is explicitly saying that a strong champion needs even more buffs, as is sometimes the case here, then sure, they should be made aware of the fact that they can't have their cake and eat it too, but otherwise we should assume that people arguing for the improvement of a champion's gameplay are genuinely trying to do just that, and don't have some sort of hidden agenda for making them OP.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdeArIzp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-23T15:39:07.264+0000)\n> \n> **3. Details Details Details When Telling Why a Champion Needs Nerfs/Buffs**\n\nI completely agree with this, and I also agree that the presence of immature, low-effort and whiny threads are likely causing some of the greatest harm to Gameplay. Riot themselves have told us time and time again that the most efficient way of giving feedback is to provide a problem statement, cite examples, invite others into the discussion, and so on, yet as players we're still all too often content with parroting the same few soundbites and giving them far more visibility than much better-written discussions. To be fair, I don't think this is entirely the community's fault, as a large part of the problem comes from the voting system, which rewards low-effort, repetitive threads that touch upon whichever hot topic _du jour_, and tends to bury more substantial threads that give players more things to disagree upon. We certainly have room to improve as a community, though I also think Riot needs to meet us halfway on this and implement structural changes to the Boards that would avoid warping incentives as they do now.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdeArIzp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-23T15:39:07.264+0000)\n> \n> **4. Insulting Others During a Balance Discussion Helps Nothing**\n\nAgree 100%, and I think this much should be obvious to everyone. Personal insults are the worst mistake one can make in a debate, and generally belie a less-than-civil atmosphere up to that point. Too many people on here are focused on either venting their frustrations onto others or \"winning\" arguments at all costs, usually by angering their opponent until they leave or say something that can get flagged and punished by a mod, and those are exactly the kinds of attitude that have no place in an online discussion forum. As with the above, many more people here need to remember that they should be entering this discussion space with respect towards others, including (and especially) those who disagree with them in a civil manner, and that in spite of our differences we're all on the same side, and fighting for the same cause in the end.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdeArIzp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-23T15:39:07.264+0000)\n> \n> **5. If a Champion Is Reworked, There Was a Reason**\n\nThis I agree with, and unfortunately I've seen quite a few players who opposed a rework purely because the champion ended up being different from their previous iteration, regardless of the issues they had before or the improvements the rework brought with it. For sure, I think some reworks were unjustified, or should at least have been done differently, but that process of evaluation should come from a solid analysis of what needed to be reworked and what didn't, and how the rework achieved its goals. As individuals, we all too often tend to fall into the trap of demanding reworks on the spot for champions we dislike playing against, but then become far too reactionary when it comes to implementing even slight balance or gameplay changes to the champions we play. Because this kind of attitude is obviously not mutually compatible when it's present on players for literally every champion, there often ends up being some level of unjustified complaining on here at any given time (even though not _all_ of that complaining is unjustified, obviously).\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdeArIzp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-23T15:39:07.264+0000)\n> \n> **6. Don&amp;#039;t Discuss the PBE Like It is Law**\n\nThis I largely agree with, though I also have mixed feelings for it because Riot has largely treated the PBE like a showcase for upcoming content, rather than a place for experimental changes and testing. I think it varies from designer to designer, but there have often been instances of absolutely ridiculous changes popping up on the PBE, those getting dismissed or downplayed because \"it's just the PBE\", with the presumption that those changes would get pulled or at least adjusted in the near future, and then those changes hitting Live untouched, and wreaking havoc in spite of feedback given even on the PBE Boards. The AP Galio buffs are a prime example of this, among many others. We should definitely not treat changes on the PBE as if they were on Live already, but we should still take PBE feedback into account when criticizing those changes, and we should also expect more flexibility in how PBE content gets adjusted and developed over time.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdeArIzp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-23T15:39:07.264+0000)\n> \n> **7. Stats Are Not the Full Picture, But They Are a Great Guide**\n\nI agree with this, though I think the deeper problem is that, as a community, we're actually pretty terrible at reading statistics. If a champion has something like a >53% win rate and a >10% play rate, that's usually a reliable indicator that they're too strong, but when suggesting balance changes, it's important to consider how these win and play rates change across elos (if these stats peak at the highest elos but aren't so bad at lower MMR, making these champions more difficult to play will only make matters worse, for example), how that champion's win rate evolves across game time (it should be normal for, say, an early game champion to succeed more at a time when the early game is more important), and who that champion's fighting against: if a champion's counters are popular, or if that champion often gets matched up against champions they counter, their win and play rates will reflect that, and balancing them purely on win rate alone risks making them immune to their lane counters, or incapable of properly countering their more favorable matchups, and thereby worsening their balance just a few months or weeks down the line, as has happened several times before. As a community, we need to look at the balancing of champions over a longer period of time, and not just on a per-match basis.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdeArIzp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-23T15:39:07.264+0000)\n> \n> **8. Read and Analyze All of a Post**\n\nFully agree on this. I've seen far too many potentially healthy debates spiral into circularity simply because people refused to listen to each other, and end up producing nothing positive because everybody stuck to their guns, and refused to make even the slightest effort of understanding where the other person was coming from. Part of the problem I think comes from the fact that people generally don't like admitting to being wrong, or even questioning their own assumptions, because they think it'll make them lose face, which is prevalent across the whole internet. Because of this, I think we might need to enforce stricter standards for participation on Gameplay, in order to keep quality of discussion equally high.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-01-23T22:00:55.434+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say for the \"Gutting is never an answer\", he means more for discussion.\n\n\"Gut (x) because he's op!!!1\" is completely worthless as discussion. The only time Riot even considers that is when a champion's inherent kit is so flawed, so problematic, that said champion can *never* be balanced in the game's current state. They do it from time to time, but only to shut down a problematically strong champion that fits the criteria of \"Literally impossible to *balance* with numbers right now\". Such as the champions you've mentioned, or Kalista (who's starting to be semi-balanced in lower tiers due to subtle number shifts, and runes).\n\nBut, back to the main point: It's a completely and utterly worthless thing to say in a discussion. \"Gut Vayne\" is not a balance post, it's a borderline spam post. Even if Vayne *needs* to be gutted, saying \"Gut her\" is pointless. Riot'd have already thought of that if it was needed, and it puts literally nothing new into discussion.
