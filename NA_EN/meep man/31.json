It's like having an item already strapped onto your kit that boosts your damage, so you if you wanna have a balanced build, you will get a defensive item on top of it.\nChampions who have flat damage won't scale with their enemies' defenses. Therefore, they need to rely on ratios and therefore bonus AD and AP to have their damage remain effective throughout the game.\n\nRemember this when designing and playing new champions. If you want someone to be a Bruiser, give them % based Anti-Tank options and a few moderate ratios to make them build majority tanky. If you want someone to be a pure Tank, give them all flat damage, but absolutely no decent ratios to discourage them from building damage. If you want someone to be a Assassin/Damage-Based Mage, give them flat based Anti-Tank options and good ratios to make them build majority damage with a small amount of tank, if any at all. If you want someone to be a Marksman, give them a tiny bit, if any Anti-Tank options and great ratios, but make sure they have sustained damage, in order to make them build full damage to make sure their DPS remains consistent throughout the game. If you want someone to be a Support, you will have to go kit to kit and inspect what exactly they need to make them be built Support.\n\n**NOTE:** I'm not saying DON'T give someone % Health damage or DO give someone % Health damage. I'm just saying be prepared for what USUALLY comes with it. I'm also not saying that IF a champion has % Health damage, they will build tanky. It will just push them in that direction unless something else forces them or provides a better reason to build damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-05-18T17:12:48.653+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well...some champions have % Damage to prevent them from bursting someone to quickly, like with Evelynn, while she is getting a rework her ultimate used to do Flat Damage, but it's done max HP damage for a long time, she still builds full AP by the way. \n\nOr for Kled, who's W and Ultimate have percentage HP damage, if they made him do flat HP damage he would litterally yolo dive your AD and one shot them, he can still kill someone though but it's much more difficult and he builds full damage. \n\nFiora, same thing, she builds full damage and was giving % HP damage so she wouldn't be massively oppressive with flat damage auto's early game and so that we would have 1 of 3 tank shredder's to help keep the game in line. Vel'koz, full damage, vayne, full damage two more examples. \n\nIt's actually pretty rare that them having % HP damage actually results in them building tanky, the only two cases that are actually worth noting are of course Ekko and Fizz, their damage didn't go down if they built tanky due to their high damage on % HP and for fizz it's his W currently. But it's not just that, their stickyness and escape ability triumphs over tanks, meaning the tank can't do anything and ekko and fizz tank builds dominate. \n\nOther champions such as Poppy and Sion are given it so that they can do a little bit of damage and actually fend of other top laner's properly without, again, being able to burst squishes to easily.\n\nPersonally i'm ad advocate for percentage HP damage, usually only on someones ultimate but i prefer the %HP damage over flat damage in many cases for balance purposes. It helps keep A LOT of thing's in line and many champions would be way more oppressive with flat damage than % HP damage.
