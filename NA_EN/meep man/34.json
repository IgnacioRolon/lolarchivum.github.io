But I'm tentatively interested in the Swain VGU. I absolutely love military heroes and generals. Currenrly Swain takes the narrative space of a master general but has absolutely 0 abilities that actually seem like a commander. He's just a creepy bird mage that has a VO that basically randomly shouts \"Tactics!\" \"Flanking!\" \"Strategery!\"\n\nWhich doesn't interest me at all. I'm also pretty sure I'm going to be disappointed when his update comes. In my head he's basically Grand Admiral Thrawn the Noxian. But I'm pretty sure once he gets reworked he'll be a bit of a commander but most of his plans will involve the weird magic stuff I just don't care about.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-10-20T22:21:58.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Swain will probably keep the same general feel (especially ultimate), but will be better overall.

Unfortunately, while generals and commanders really interest me, weird bird mage doesn't interest me at all.  I just hope they get a different commander-style champion again sometime, that isn't really just a bird mage like both Azir and Swain are, for some reason.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-10-20T12:43:02.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's too bad their VO's are terribly outdated if that is so","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlashNeko","date":"2016-10-20T03:15:05.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems like it would be {{champion:7}}  bread and butter, given what we know about her. \n\nAdditionally, given the one new scrap of characterization we got from her recent short lore story, {{champion:28}} seems like someone who'd play around with someone's head a lot too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2016-10-20T00:53:00.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reworked Talon","replies":[]},{"poster":"pandorahearts330","date":"2016-10-20T18:17:28.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:35}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-20T16:28:22.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tahm?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-10-20T16:13:56.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath insults a lot and make them question their power level, same for Aurelion Sol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killstrado","date":"2016-10-20T12:48:34.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nunus counterjungling, even if you never gank you will tilt the enemy jungler so hard they'll go to lanes and feed your teammates because they have no gold or farm, or nunu bot and lulu laugh spam","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeroineSam","date":"2016-10-20T02:50:24.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally Aurelion Sol","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-10-20T00:59:45.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lux laugh is on par with jokers imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"I hate my ADC","date":"2016-10-20T00:53:06.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric makes me question myself about my sexuality, but aside from that, I don't know of any champion that does what you say.","replies":[]}]}
