In comparison, a total of 4 champions were updated individually in 2016, being Shen, Taric, Ryze, and Yorick. There was also the Mage Update and Assassin Update, but it is safe to say that SOME of the champions updated there are still in this list and were more made better to make them not quite as bad during the wait for their updates. What I&#039;m saying is that, with this speed, champions aren&#039;t getting updated fast enough and more and more champions will begin to fill this list. More and more will need updates until League of Legends will look like a Frankenstein of varying art styles spread out over many years of development. It will look really bad.\n\nRiot Games, you need more teams designated to Champion Updates. The list above doesn&#039;t even include some of the ones that MIGHT need a VU since they have aged relatively well. Currently, it seems you have 2 Champion-Up teams. I think that number needs to be doubled or at least be bumped up to 3. The list is getting larger by the day and we already have about a fifth of the roster here. Slow down new champions until the rest of the game is out of the Ice Age.\n\nEDIT:\n\nVGU LIST:\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:39}}  {{champion:10}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} \n\nGU LIST:\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:157}} \n\nVU LIST:\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:26}} \n\nSome of these are strange even to me, but have been stated by Riot to be on \"The List\". This is the likes of Cho'Gath, Rammus, Teemo, Volibear, etc. Some in the VU department may also questionably need a GU as well, such as Vladimir and Nocturne.\nP.S. The reason Rumble is in the VU is mainly due to his \"rig\" still making it insanely hard to make skins for him.","replies":[{"poster":"DaNinad","date":"2017-01-05T15:48:19.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"What's wrong with veigar?","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2017-01-05T15:50:16.969+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DaNinad,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KqzIQ8GX,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-01-05T15:48:19.068+0000)\n>\n> What&#x27;s wrong with veigar?\n\nDisgustingly old particles, current voice needs to die, model needs an overhaul\n\nEdit: To everyone who replied, I understand you love his voice, and by god you are some patient saints for not having that voice drive you insane.

How long have WW and Galio been in the works? The better part of a year, in the werewolf's case. That's too long, considering the list of champs that need modernizing is only going to get longer as the months go by.\n\nUpdates need to either be quicker, or there needs to be more champs getting updated at the same time.\n\nFor me personally, I would _gladly_ sacrifice new champs to update older ones quicker for a season or two. The big reworks tend to end up being a practically new champion in the end, so I don't see the downside here.\n\nWell, I **do** see the downside here. Lots of players already own the champs getting updated, so there's not going to be that RP splurge that comes with the debut of a new champ if a large portion of your playerbase gets it for free. Yes, selling the reworked skins can bring in some money, but I'd be willing to bet Riot didn't make half the money off the Yorick rework than they did Camille.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2017-01-06T00:48:00.563+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The downside is when they mess up a rework it takes away a champion that a lot of people have put hundreds or thousands of hours into.\n\nThey have been getting better at reworking champs, but if they rush the reworks too much and start throwing new/un-experienced development teams into the mix, they risk breaking the game for a lot of people and losing customers for no gain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2017-01-05T16:20:50.638+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:51}} is fine tbh, I don't really think she needs to be reworked, she just needs some nerf on her E and less zoning with her W.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-01-05T16:21:43.775+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should have separated this list into different categories.
