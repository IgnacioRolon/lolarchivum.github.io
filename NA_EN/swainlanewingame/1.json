The problem persisted now for about 12 hours -- the whole day -- and not once was loss prevention enabled. Some players even still have issues connecting to games.\r\n\r\nWhere is the compensation for those of us who had our time and efforts wasted and lost a lot of ranked game progress due to an error on your end? Even if you cannot modify the LP of accounts, the very least you could do is compensate all these players with _something_ -- say for example some loot crates/keys -- it would go a long way toward alleviating all the frustration and anger. Who knows, it might even be an incentive for some to _buy skins_, or at the very least play more league.\r\n\r\nAfter all, you want players to play _more_ League and not _less_, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-14T02:02:26.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You may be onto something here! I'm not able to make this kind of call as far as compensation goes, but this _is _ something I would encourage you to post in the Miscellaneous Boards in order to get some proper feedback on your idea.\n\nIf there's anything else I could help out with, feel free to hit me up ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"SwainLaneWinGame","date":"2017-03-14T02:51:02.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you be so kind as to pass it to someone that _can_ make this type of judgment call? Something is better than nothing, and shows Riot actually cares about each player whenever a big server crisis like this comes along. \n\nSo far, Riot support has essentially stated that everyone who has experienced loss of LP/Leaverbuster penalties/etc **before loss prevention was enabled (in this case most of the day), are \"shit out of luck\" (not their words, obviously, but the end result is the same).\n\nI was told it's not \"fair\" to compensate those of us who have lost LP versus those who never were affected after the fact (loss prevention enabled), which quite literally makes **zero fucking sense**, because the literal dictionary definition of \"fair\" is for _all parties to be treated equally_.","replies":[]}]}]}
