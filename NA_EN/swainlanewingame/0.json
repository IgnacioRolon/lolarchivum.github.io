This wasn't an ISP issue, but an occurrence more specifically with our game servers.  Some players did get penalties like Leaverbuster, and it's feedback we'd like to collect.  If you were impacted by the server issue via leaverbuster, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). I can't make any guarantees, but we're happy to consider all things.  That said, bear in mind that we literally have no ability to adjust game stats or LP.
