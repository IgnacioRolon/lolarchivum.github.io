Yesterday, I came back to League of legends to discover that my username doesn't exist anymore, my account compromised/hacked, and unable to recover the account. I have tried recovering the username and password and nothing happened as I check my original email used to create this account. The way I checked if my username doesn't exist is by using the sign up page and verifying if my username is available which it clearly is. What's odd is that my League of Legends summoner name is still the same. I've been gone for 2-3 years now and this is quite unfortunate for me. I don't know if the hacker who gained access to my account used my influence points that I saved up (Over 100,000 IP was unused) and did a name change but I doubt that. I still have access to my support login which contains my past tickets for my account that was compromised/hacked.\r\n\r\n https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index?realm_key=na\r\n\r\nI have submitted a ticket which no reply for the past 6 hours. If anyone can help, please refer to my ticket # 23166108","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T17:23:08.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're pretty slammed with support tickets at the moment, but I can assure you that our accounts team is going HAM and will get to you as soon as possible.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
