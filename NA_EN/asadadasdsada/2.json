I'm not 100% how long its been since my account was hacked unfortunately. I requested that they change my summoner's name but they refused. I also requested that the charges made on my account refunded and they also refused. I had about 8k-10k RP and 130k IP that I worked so hard for and this person just used it all. It's very sad that riot games is unable to do anything about a compromised account. \n\nThe reason why was because the account changes happened more than 90 days ago and no where in the fine print stated that it had to be less than 90 days.\n\nLink to the article: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694\nMy Summoner name was changed! Will this be reversed?\n\nFor most cases, yes. Once your account is recovered, please let us know about your Summoner name, and we will be happy to change it back to what you had previously.\nWhat do I do if unauthorized charges are being made from my compromised account?\n\nPlease let us know during the account recovery process! If the charges were made on your credit card, specify any charges that you noticed, and we will be happy to further investigate the issue.\n\nIf you find monetary purchases on your account that you did not make, and were not charged to you, it is still vital that you inform us, as this may cause future billing issues for your account.\n\nRequest #23653965","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T03:47:17.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine the changes to your account were not fulfilled due to our [**Refund Policy**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ) stating transactions outside of *90 days* are not eligible for a refund.\n\nIf you have any further questions about this specific recovery and the actions that we chose to take, feel free to follow up on your [support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-09T22:03:10.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that's their way, that the way it is.
