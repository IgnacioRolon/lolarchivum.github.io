The same username and password that I've been using since 2010. I decided to try to sign up for a new account using this link below: https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index?realm_key=na and noticed that the username is available to sign up for a new account.  \r\n\r\nIt seems that my account was compromised or hacked and the person who is in possession of my account has \"changed\" the username, password, and e-mail. The hacker must've contacted customer support to have the username changed to something else.  I've been playing this game since 2010 and used the same username to login for 5 years consecutively. The email that I used to sign up for the username that doesn't exist anymore is registered to a different username. So as of today, It just doesn't really make any sense. When I us I have record of over 3,000 matches in Summoner's Rift and Twisted Treeline. All that time you spent on League of Legends... gone. \r\n\r\nThe bad news is  I have submitted a ticket regarding this matter but they seem to not be helpful in any way. With the necessary info that was provided to them, I was unable to prove that I was the owner of the account. So that means the person who gained access to my account, successfully changed the username, password, and e-mail has successfully secured their account and there's no way of me recovering the account again. The username that I used to log in my League of Legends account for the past 5-6 years doesn't simply exist anymore.  \r\n\r\nI am the original owner of the account that I am recovering. I have several e-mails regarding tribunal bans and tickets submitted through the riot support page regarding my account with the username that doesn't exist anymore. What's weird is when I log in with my new username to go to the support page which is linked to my sign up email still have all my old tickets when I still had my old username. I don't recall ever using my new username to log in for support or the forums. I've always used my old username (doesn't exist anymore) for the forums and support page but some how, it was changed to this new username.. Its kind of funny because the new username I'm using to log in the support page has several tickets regarding my League of Legends account. In those tickets, it would say that my username that used to exist but when you try to create an account and use that username to sign up, it would say its available. This is proof that my username was some how either \"deleted\" or \"changed\" by someone who had access to my account. Why would I be making tickets regarding a league of legends account for a username that doesn't exist anymore? \r\n\r\nIf you are any help of recovering my account, please refer to the ticket # 23165309. \r\n\r\n\r\ntldr;\r\n\r\nThe username that I used to log in for the past 5-6 years does _**NOT **_ anymore. I used the sign up page to check if my username is unavailable but it is available.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T16:37:12.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usernames cannot be changed, as they're part of the account for life, so that's definitely strange that you could create a new account with the same old username.

But the e-mail linked to that username was changed along with my password without authorization. I didn't get any e-mails regarding any e-mail/password change.","replies":[]}]}]}
