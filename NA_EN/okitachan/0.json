It helps to mute players instead of arguing, and focus on your own game play. We should be very focused on gameplay and writing in chat takes away from that. Even if you are simply responding to someone else being toxic, we shouldn&#039;t respond negatively. It&#039;s also a good time to stop and evaluate if your chat is adding positivity.\r\n\r\nResponding in anyway to negativity leaves your account open for review. \r\n(05:01:05 AM) Okitachan: what about you look where you see he asked ppl you report me \r\n(05:01:09 AM) Okitachan: that would be fair right \r\n(05:01:11 AM) Okitachan: look at that \r\n(05:01:49 AM) Opti: i can look into him no problem \r\n(05:01:54 AM) Opti: we do that a lot \r\n(05:01:58 AM) Okitachan: no the problem of you looking into him \r\n(05:02:01 AM) Opti: i can&#039;t tell you what actions are taken \r\n(05:02:06 AM) Opti: but it doesn&#039;t matter \r\n(05:02:08 AM) Okitachan: where i took it into my own matters of saying i was reporting him and ignoring him \r\n(05:02:12 AM) Opti: you are held responsible for what YOU say \r\n(05:02:16 AM) Okitachan: and then punishing me for doing the adult thing is insane \r\n(05:02:42 AM) Okitachan: I DIDN&#039;T SAY ANYTHING TO ABUSE THE KID \r\n(05:02:50 AM) Okitachan: I SAID I WAS REPORTING HIM AND MUTING HIM \r\n(05:02:52 AM) Opti: i understand \r\n(05:02:53 AM) Okitachan: I TOOK THE HIGH ROAD \r\n(05:02:55 AM) Okitachan: NO YOU DONT \r\n(05:02:58 AM) Okitachan: OBVIOUSLY \r\n(05:03:28 AM) Okitachan: Like to say you understand is isnane \r\n(05:03:30 AM) Okitachan: if you understood \r\n(05:03:30 AM) Opti: you didn&#039;t take the hide road though, you made a few last comments. you were negative. \r\n(05:03:43 AM) Okitachan: remove my punishment and give men back the honro 3 \r\n(05:03:53 AM) Okitachan: NO i wasnt negative \r\n(05:03:54 AM) Okitachan: i legit said \r\n(05:03:55 AM) Opti: i understand that you feel wronged \r\n(05:04:04 AM) Opti: but what you said was not okay \r\n(05:04:09 AM) Okitachan: and considering what you p[osted was w/e im reporting you and ingorning you \r\n(05:04:14 AM) Okitachan: it was completely ok \r\n(05:04:20 AM) Okitachan: i didnt say anything to abuse him \r\n(05:04:23 AM) Okitachan: i said my intent \r\n(05:04:27 AM) Okitachan: i never harassed him \r\n(05:04:28 AM) Okitachan: etc \r\n(05:04:30 AM) Opti: i never ever said you abused him \r\n(05:04:37 AM) Opti: at all \r\n(05:04:38 AM) Okitachan: then why am i reported for verbal abuse \r\n(05:05:06 AM) Okitachan: i STATED my intent \r\n(05:05:07 AM) Okitachan: nothing more \r\n(05:05:12 AM) Okitachan: and im allowed to state my intent \r\n(05:05:23 AM) Okitachan: so remove this false report from this account \r\n(05:05:26 AM) Opti: its written as verbal abuse. but in reality, it is negativity and arguing. \r\n(05:05:31 AM) Opti: and it is not okay \r\n(05:05:33 AM) Okitachan: I didnt argue at all \r\n(05:05:37 AM) Okitachan: i stated my intent \r\n(05:05:45 AM) Opti: im sorry to say, but my job is to give you context \r\n(05:05:47 AM) Okitachan: just like stating im going to a cop to report someone \r\n(05:05:48 AM) Opti: and that&#039;s what ive done \r\n(05:05:50 AM) Opti: at this point \r\n(05:05:52 AM) Okitachan: your context is ass \r\n(05:05:56 AM) Opti: im going to need to close the chat \r\n(05:06:01 AM) Opti: unless you have other questions \r\n(05:06:10 AM) Okitachan: no \r\n(05:06:16 AM) Okitachan: you either need to give me a contact info t \r\n(05:06:20 AM) Okitachan: to talk to someone higher \r\n(05:06:27 AM) Opti: there is no one higher \r\n(05:06:42 AM) Okitachan: There is someone higher then a support desk at side place \r\n(05:06:45 AM) Okitachan: i have done your job \r\n(05:06:53 AM) Okitachan: Give me your supervisor \r\n(05:07:52 AM) Opti: Me and my team make up the Player Support team.

The fact you kept arguing in a video game was unacceptable. What they meant by you misusing the chat is the fact that you didn't use the chat as it was intended to be used. Instead, you argued with a teammate, creating a negative experience for your team. This game isn't a chatroom. Regardless of your intent, you do not argue in a video game. Go to a chatroom or a forum if you want to go into a debate with someone. But if you're going to play the game, play the game and do not abuse the chat. Do not type back to any negativity or any toxic players. The only thing you are obligated to use the chat for is strategies, tactics, and friendly constructive feedback.

Asking for a supervisor doesn't ever really do anything besides you being told the exact same thing over again (if you even get a supervisor). Most of the time a supervisor won't take the call, because they don't have to, if something is against the company policy and proven to be correct they won't even take the call, and if the \"agent\" or player support still forwards the chat or call to one they can get in trouble for doing so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2018-01-11T03:16:05.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem like the morons who would call into the call center I worked at and asked \"why do I owe you $500?\" and the answer is that they haven't paid for 4 months, then they demand a supervisor and get told the same thing again.
