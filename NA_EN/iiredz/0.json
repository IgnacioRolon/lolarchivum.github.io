One thing that could be blocking that from happening is your firewall. Try going through [this step](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3) on the connection guide and see if that helps first.\n\nIf you're still having issues getting through authentication, you might have to either switch to public DNS or flush your DNS, another step that can be found on the [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5). \n\nThose two steps, along with the rest of the connection guide, are a good start to troubleshooting what's going on when logging in. If you still run into issues, our Tech team can take a look at it when you [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nLet me know if you need anything else! :)","replies":[]}]}
