I recently got my fiance to join the game and once he became above level with enough champions he decided he wanted to experience a ranked game. Talk about toxic. New players will never be able to experience a good game play with such toxic players. You get in the game and automatically all they do is flame you for anything they can find. One mistake and your report worthy and worthy of being completely flamed by everyone including the opposite team. I have yet to play a ranked game where I didn't have to mute EVERYONE in the game due to the fact that I wasn't \"Skilled\" Enough. Ranked is how many people learn how to play cause normal game mode is easy compared to rank. Its filled with people who know how to play against people with more experience. Riot has seemed to fail us when it comes to the reports we do. I personally have been chat restricted due to telling someone to start pinging or stop tower diving, but someone who is telling me to kill myself and other such things gets nothing done to them. I don't understand where the loyalty of riot lies. With those defending themselves and punishing them for doing so or those who start shit and have nothing done to them about it. Rank amplifies the abuse ten fold and wish something would be done about it. It doesn't help new players just starting the game want to continue.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-21T01:55:33.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have never had to do this and encounter as few toxic players in ranked as i do in normals.\n\nNew players should start with fairly neutral MMR, you have to tank yourself really hard to end up down in the trash pit.. It is a horrible place, but you cant get there without deserving to be there, at least at the time you started ranked..\n\nI guess the moral is you should not try to play competitively in a game you are totally new to?","replies":[{"poster":"Rose Thôrne","date":"2019-10-21T19:22:21.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing for almost three years and I still cant play competitively due to the difference in the game modes.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-10-21T21:18:01.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play until you reach a rank where every is as good/bad as you are.

I also play flex ranked (for the victorious Orianna chroma) purely solo and I get put with pre-made pretty much every flex ranked games (sometimes even double duos).  I don't really experienced as much toxicity (that does not mean I experienced no toxicity...) as most people claimed.  That's just my personal experience of course.  If you go into games accept that you'll win/lose 40-60% of the time and a loss is inevitable, you'll find that it'll be okay to lose some games even because of afk/inter/troll/etc.  Go into games prepare to use the mute function, but only when things go south.  Respect your teammates and don't full mute before they even say anything.  That's my ways anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-10-21T02:40:12.254+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> I personally have been chat restricted due to telling someone to start pinging or stop tower diving\n\nNo, no you did not.\n\n**HOW** you say things matters just as much as **WHAT** you say.

You get chat restricted for barking orders and being a jerk.","replies":[{"poster":"Rose Thôrne","date":"2019-10-21T19:20:57.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of the game in my opinon","replies":[]}]}]}
