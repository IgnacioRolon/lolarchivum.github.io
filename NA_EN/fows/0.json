My friend, Asiana Jones on the NA server is level 10 and has the same issue.  He only has 1 summoner spell on summoner's rift and cannot change it or the empty slot spell in champ select.  The empty one just shows as a blank box.  He made the account a long time ago, stopped playing, and just recently started playing again.  Reading around, it might have something to do with the removal of Clairvoyance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fows","date":"2017-08-09T06:06:41.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I re-installed + did the client repair thing in the settings. \nI can't play ranked or draft.\nWhen I play blind pick I can pick my summs normally. \nThis bug just happened randomly one day, I have no idea how to fix it.
