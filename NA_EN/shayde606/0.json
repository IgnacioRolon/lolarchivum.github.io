This is my first official forum post so I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries or making this post too long, but I'm sick of these connection issues I've been having and want to know if anyone knows of any way to remedy the situation. \r\n\r\nSo I'm currently writing this whilst waiting for my first 20 minute timewall to finish. This isn't the first time I've been \"busted.\" Have I deserved it in the past? Probably during like, S2 or S3 when I wasn't as serious about League and still new to the concept. But now it seems that I'm only getting Leaverbusted for issues that are beyond my control, whilst fighting tooth and nail attempting to connect to my games. \r\n\r\nDoes this chain of events sound familiar to other players or am I the only one experiencing this issue?\r\n\r\n-Start me up some League; prettypumped.jpg\r\n-Queue up for some ranked, trying to claw my way out of bronze\r\n-See a prompt: \"Connection Error, Connection Timeout: The request to the PVP.net server timed out.\"\r\n-Check my internets; full bars\r\n-Reset router, just to be safe\r\n-Letsdothis\r\n-Continue seeing bs connection error screen into pregame lobby, occasionally causing me to miss my pick or ban. (Today I saw a Leona on my team still locking in with 0 seconds left talking about an Ahri on the enemy team who hadn't even locked in yet on my screen)\r\n-w/e, I was first pick. Already grabbed Rek'sai so I figured I was safe from queue dodge penalties\r\n-Prepare yourselves! The match is about to begin!\r\n-Sweet\r\n-Prepare yourselves! The match is about to begin!\r\n-OK, let's go\r\n-PREPARE YOURSELVES! THE MATCH IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!\r\n-tripledots.gif\r\n-Reset client fast af\r\n-You have left a game in progress. Attempt to reconnect?\r\n-omfg yespls\r\n-Reconnecting to game, 88% connected when I get pulled out of the connection screen to see \"your team has remade, you've been placed in a lower priority queue for 5 games due to recent AFK activity\r\n\r\nAnd here's where the rage and feelings of utter defeat settle in. This has happened to me more times than I can count on both hands. Do I blame my team for remaking? Absolutely not; it's ranked. Do I blame my internet for dc'ing me? No, my connection never skipped a beat. Do I blame myself? Do I blame Riot? Do I blame Teemo? Wtf do I do in this situation?\r\n\r\nJust finished waiting the 20 minutes. While searching for a game I got the \"Connection Error, Connection Timeout\" screen and it kicked me from my queue and I have to wait the 20 minutes all over again without it counting towards my total lower priority queue games. I am not okay, send help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T17:38:54.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm happy be one of the first to welcome you to the boards (though I know the circumstance isn't the best)!  It definitely sounds like you've been through a lot, and I'd like to help.  To be totally honest with you, it seems clear to me that your network might be failing to maintain a stable connection which would cause you to both lose sync in champion select or not at all to the game servers.  Even though your internet might be fine elsewhere, you are specifically having connection problems reaching us.  I highly recommend that you go over each step of our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to troubleshoot this and get it fixed for good.  \n\nI also recommend downloading our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help automatically configure some of your settings, like your firewall which could be blocking communication.  Hopefully this will get you fixed up; though, let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
