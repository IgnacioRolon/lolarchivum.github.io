Waited out the penalty just to have the same thing happen again. After the half hour wait time, I finally get a functioning champ select screen. Go through a tight ass game and come out victorious just to realize that it didn't even count as my third series game, but  instead I have to work my way back up to it again now; after losing out on 20 LP, my series as a whole, and 35 minutes of my time due to client issues that Riot even acknowledged. I wasn't even aware that queue dodges would cost you your series. AFK'ing I understand, but dodging; especially when there's a technical issue like this involved, I don't understand why it even counts towards your series.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-04T20:01:10.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaving champion select during your series counts as a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) which is an automatic loss.  It sucks to hear that happened to you, and we do have a workaround for this issue.  Collapse your friends list groups before queuing for a match-\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wMLOFya.png\n\nIt's also okay to use the legacy while the updated client is in testing as well.  Sorry again that happened to you, and while we can't change game stats I hope that can help give you a boost.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Escru","date":"2017-03-06T03:32:32.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People take ranked seriously, please either fix the client/champ select function or make queue exit/dodge not count as a loss for promos.","replies":[]}]}]}
