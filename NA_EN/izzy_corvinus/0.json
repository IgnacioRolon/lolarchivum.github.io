After reading through a bunch of other posts with this issue, it seems that the uninstall doesn't get rid of the screensavers that have actually been downloaded. I scrubbed through my computer to find them, and finally found C:/Users/[UserName]/AppData/Roaming/LolScreenSaver (it's hidden behind at least one hidden folder, may need to turn on visibility of those). \n\nI deleted that entire folder, uninstalled, reinstalled, and now the screensaver shows up for me! After those steps I'm able to see static and moving images, as well as add new ones to existing playlists. I do want to caution that I have no idea what all of the actual effects of deleting that folder would be, but my screensaver is back and I'm happy! Good luck all!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Izzy Corvinus","date":"2017-02-16T10:47:23.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a fix to this yet as I really miss my screensaver","replies":[]},{"poster":"theangryasianguy","date":"2017-02-24T19:41:13.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also wondering if there's a fix yet.

The current fix would be to reinstall the screensaver.  Hopefully that won't be too much trouble, though, I hope it at least clears things up.
