The promotion starts off with the quote:\n\n> Earn a special summoner icon by bringing Xayah and Rakan together _**on the Rift**_\n\nBut then also \n\n> Any completed normal, ranked, or bot game mode will count (custom games excluded)\n\nIs the \"on the Rift\" just fluff verbage, or should the second quote also say \"on Summoner's Rift\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-25T21:00:10.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~As I understand it, the messaging meant any matchmaking mode for Summoner's Rift.
