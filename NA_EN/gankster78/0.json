I place wards. I prioritize turrets over kills. I have vast and intimate knowledge of the games mechanics and all of its champion&#039;s. I do not consider myself a genius but I have an excellent memory. All that being said again I consider myself and average player of average skill.\r\n   I recently went on a winning streak with Cho&#039;Gath. A champ I try not to pick simply because his kit is extremely unfun to play against and I am not the type of person who relies on guaranteed mechanics in order secure my lane. I like to actually play the game not abuse Riot&#039;s abuse riot&#039;s flawed balancing method.\r\n  During that winning streak I noticed something. I was being q&#039;d with people in silver and gold, on the enemy team. It was as if they were trying to serve us up to the &quot;skillful player&#039;s&quot; so that they could have some easy wins. In one game, A gold 3 Renekton could not even fathom how I was dominating him with Cho&#039;Gath because I was bronze 3 or 4 at the time and he was Gold 3. In the end as I ate his nexus he typed into all chat, &quot;Your not even good Cho, you just spammed R to make yourself unkillable.&quot; \r\n  How does one make it to Gold 3 without knowing how to beat a Cho&#039;Gath at the HP stacking game with a resource-less lane bully? I can tell you how. Riot is making an &quot;artificial skill gap&quot; and they are using a combination of match making higher ranked players with more games under their belt against people with less than 200 games on their account&#039;s AND reworking certain champs to make them a solo q nightmare for the teams that do not understand how to work together well. As an example let us consider the Malzahar rework in the typical Gold Versus Bronze games I&#039;ve been in lately.\r\n  I have no trouble with Malzahar because I understand that he has been reworked in such a way that I must play defensive unless I have the proper spells to remove his new shield and do respectable damage without losing the trade. I am well informed and come prepared to play in ranked q. However my team mates do not seem to understand that their amazing fizz mechanics are not going to help them much if they do not buy some items to tank the guaranteed damage they are going to receive as soon as they attempt to do what all bronze fizz players do(All in, All the time, Even with no HP. sigh...). On the flip side I have never had a Malzahar on my team that did not get counter built and then stomped into the ground being able to build 1 item by 20 minutes do to the ammount of time he spent in the grave yard....\r\n   Normally I would just ban Malzahar, accept I can&#039;t because this is bronze and I have to waste bans on champions like: BlitzCrank, Annie, Tahm Kench, Yasuo, Malphite, Karma(LOL No one can stand behind minions and ward bushes in bronze, it&#039;s impossible to do these things if you main adc and support and are bronze at the same time it seems) Fizz, insert any champion with any cc skill or true damage skill...\r\n  I am convinced that there is a conspiracy to create an Artificial Skill Gap in order to make the game seem more appealing to those who place in gold and to keep the carrot on the stick in front of those who place in bronze DESPITE GOING 9 AND 1 IN PLACEMENT MATCHES.... \r\nI am an average player of average skill. I cannot carry my team versus opponents of equal skill because I play tanks because I like the teamwork i like to peel and make the enemy team suffer for trying to dive the backline like some kind of crazy kamikaze pilot. And quite frankly it should not be upon me to secure a win for 4 people who do not care enough about winning to do some research and play better. Every game is carry or lose this season and I am convinced that my circumstance is a product of the conspiracy.\r\n  The only time I have ever hit silver is by spamming talon and roaming botlane and killing the enemy over and over and over and over so that they could never build the items to be able to take my team&#039;s turrets. I had to use terrorism to get out of bronze last season. Terrorism Riot? That&#039;s what you want from me!? Well I won&#039;t do it again because it might get Talon nerfed again... \r\nSpeaking of talon, The issue is and always will be that he is designed to kill squishies. Not a Silence that allows me to use my kit properly and kill 1 guy before I implode. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: Click the &quot;back&quot; or &quot;X&quot; button on your browser window.
