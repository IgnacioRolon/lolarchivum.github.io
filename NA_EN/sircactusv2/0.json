The only way for me to fix is by restarting my computer, which takes about 5 minutes. I'm wondering if anyone else is having this issue, and if there's a way to fix it.

I've sent bug reports to riot and they've literally done nothing about it. I mean you submitted this 10 months ago. The rioter who replied was completely unhelpful and just ignored us afterwards.

We clearly stated that our network is working perfectly fine on everything else that requires it. It seems that most of us experiencing this problem are playing on a mac so I'm positive that it is an issue with the mac client. Can you please get someone who works on it to have a look into it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alexmipego","date":"2017-01-13T23:54:38.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a network issue, tested on multiple places.

I'm still looking for the problem, but a way I've found to get rid of it is to press the shut down button on the back, not long enough for it to shut down, but almost as if you are putting it on sleep mode. Doing it a couple times did the trick for me.","replies":[]}]}
