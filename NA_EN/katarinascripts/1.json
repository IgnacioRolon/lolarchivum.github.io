Anyway, let me keep this simple.\r\n\r\nHave **YOU** ever had someone go **AFK** or disconnect in **YOUR** ranked game? You then proceeded to see the ever so dreaded however common: \r\n**&quot; Defeat ( - 20 ) LP &quot;**\r\n\r\nIf **YOU** lose a matchmade ranked game because someone or several people were inactive for the majority of round then could Riot create a system where you lose** less** LP the longer the game progresses:\r\n\r\nThe total amount of LP lost by the Leaver will have a percentage rate placed on it. So let&#039;s say the person would lose 15 LP for being defeated in that match, then they leave for more than or equal to 6 consecutive minutes after the 3 minute remake timer elapses, then no matter whether they lose or win, they are deducted that fixed amount of 15 LP. But their unfortunate teammates who held the game out for 30 minutes or more have to lose MMR for something that is completely out of their control. This can be compensated by a system where let&#039;s say for holding a game until 20 minutes gives you 25% compensation, 30 minutes gives 50%, 40 minutes gives 75%, and 54 + minutes gives you 100% compensation.\r\nSo what happens when you reach a certain time threshold? Basically, this rate is now applied to how much LP the Leaver lost ( take for instance 20 LP ). So you and your three teammates are able to stall the game until 38 minutes. You reached the 30 minute threshold, and your whole team has received a 50% compensation reward. Now the leaver who would lose 20 LP loses 20 LP and that&#039;s done. But for the rest of you that 20 LP number is multiplied by 50% to equal ( 20 x 0 .5 = 10 ) then the 2 closest numbers that are divisible by 4 ( 4 teammates ) are 8 and 12. This system always rounds up so 12 is chosen. Now 12 divided by 4 ( teammates ) is 3. So now, whatever amount of LP each person would lose ( ex Caitlyn ADC will lose 17 League Points ) but now that player will see &quot; Defeat ( - 17 ( + 3 ) ) LP ( - 15 LP ) &quot; instead of the inconsiderate &quot; Defeat ( - 17 ) LP &quot;\r\n\r\nFAQ&#039; s:\r\nQ1. What if there is more than one summoner on your team identified as a Leaver?\r\nA: Then the leaver that will have lost the most LP will be the person on which the calculations will be conducted. Also, the other leaver ( s ) will be excluded from the LP compensation reward calculations to really exemplify and acknowledge the work of the other team members ( give them more LP ). This will encourage a structure of teamwork and playing with hope while making players continue with the intention to win throughout most ranked tiers.\r\n\r\nQ2: Can this be exploited?\r\nA: I don&#039;t know, you tell me lol.\r\n\r\nQ3: Um, I think you&#039;re forgetting about promos?\r\nNo, this will still apply to anyones teams, even if they are in promos, but the LP compensation reward will only be given to the person in promos if they lose that game and are knocked out of the series. However, if they lose a game but are still in the series then they are included in the calculations to get LP but receive no rewards ( rewards as in LP since they already at the 100 LP maximum ) Maybe they can add it so that if you drop out of promos and one of your games in your promos had an AFK&#039;er then when you drop down to your base LP right out side of the promos zone ( ie 75 LP, 86 LP, 99 LP, ect ) then the reward that you should have recieved in your promo game that had a leaver ( s ) could be added to this amount.\r\n\r\n&gt; Btw, I&#039;ma post this in Concepts/Creations for more finer editing, exploitation spotting, and correction of any errors in my logic or reasoning.\r\n\r\n^ I said this in my original post which did not draw much attention to the whiners of ranked in Gameplay even though this directly benefited them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, low and behold the LP compensation system! There may be less people saying &quot; GG ff at 20 &quot; in game now, after Yasuo gives first blood to the enemies Soraka mid...\r\n\r\nTL;DR \r\n\r\n&gt; An LP Compensation System that punishes no one and allows the leaver to know that even though their computer may have disconnected, or their was a power outage, or their internet connection suddenly slowed down, maybe they were even hacked, DDossed or effected by a virus - they know that if they put forth the effort to help their team in the early game they can make sure their team loses less LP. The leaver ( s ) lose the same amount of LP as if they had lost the game ( no escaping punishments { leaverbuster } ) while the rest of the team can lose less LP by stalling the game thus encouraging a more active and action packed gameplay experience while keeping League&#039;s competitive and** &quot; very highly positively sportsmanlike community &quot;** at bay...         \r\n                                                 \r\n**Thanks** for spending **YOUR** time reading this long mathematical article that I have written, hopefully Riot might recognize this and possibly consider it in a future update to the ranked system if enough of the community agrees with this** idea**...","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2018-11-27T21:48:24.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pls add this system Riot{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]}]}
