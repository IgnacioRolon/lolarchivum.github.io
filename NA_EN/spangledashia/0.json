This is something I have been actually thinking about for a while as there are several champions that become nightmares with out taking ignite.  The problem with Executioner's calling is it didn't supply the stats to really warrant an ADC picking it up.  On the flip side could you imagine the nightmare it would be to have a high stat item with grievous wounds on it that fit into an ADC profile. The could supply large amounts of damage from the back row to several targets while prevent any recover from that damage.  The point of creating team, both in lol and outside of, its to have various players filing different roles and supplementing other members short comings.  Thats why I think the best place to look to adding a new grievous wound item would be a melee damage item for tanks.\n\nOften jungle and top lane tanks are limited in the number of damage items they can really take while fulfilling the role.  And I believe this is a good thing as damage should be left to an ADC (not necessarily a ranged carry but an overall AD carry).  Tanks already have several damage items that help fulfill this role and tackle strengths of the other team.  The opposing team has a lot tanks pick black cleaver, your facing heavy ap well grab hex drinker, getting kited grab frozen mallet, and the other team takes top aatrox and jungle warwick well... him theres nothing to grab to stop that life gain.","replies":[{"poster":"Traptintime","date":"2015-10-22T20:50:54.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologize for the long comment.  Sure to briefly finish up I think there should be a damage item for melee tanks that has both health and damage stats in a similar profile to those above mentioned items that applies grievous wounds.  Maybe something along the lines bami's cinder + phage = burning hammer.  Burning hammer +500 hp, +40 ad, Unique passive - on hit \"ignites\" enemies for 2 seconds dealing 5+(lvl) magic a second and applying grievous wounds while ignited.  (the two unique passive from the previous items get merged into a new singular passive) I originally said true damage on the ignite but I figure that would bring the item too close to the black cleaver's profile as an item for ignoring resistances.  \n\nAn item like this on melee champs means that they have to get into range of the target to apply the debuff.  So adc can still kite and life steal in team fights and it will be hard for the tank to be both a front liner for their carry and run around applying the debuff to everyone.  Thus not only creating unique decisions trees when itemizing against an apposing team but also in team fights on what your role needs to be with this item.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2015-10-22T21:23:07.883+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You say Grievous wounds is fine on assassin champs, yet it was intentionally removed from Fizz and Tristana.

As the stats it gave were not worth the passive. I feel the grievous wounds can be shifted to a new item altogether or shifted to a weaker item to give it power and make it a better pick. Maybe towards a lifesteal oriented item to improve your sustain while simultaneously hindering enemy sustain in certain situations?  I'm not sure. just spitballing here. but thank you for the reply and in put.

(gaining slow reduction for every % you reduce to the enemie HP)\n\nThe prob whit low% hp Grievous wounds is that it only good to conter whene the enemie is low hp and ... the prob is that they heal themself so they are alwas almost full hp...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinista Blade","date":"2015-10-26T21:06:09.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooo got a SUPER important question!

Grievous wounds used to stack and champions like tristana could ignite you and use her Explosive shot to reduce your healing to 0.\n\nI think the issue wasn't that grievous wounds was easy to apply, its that it was too impactful for how easy it was to apply.  The approach of making it harder to apply i think was the wrong direction when instead of reducing its uptime you could have reduced its effectiveness.
