It's a crash report and it asks me what happened before the client crashed and it also asked for my name and email but that was optional. And it has Ziggs in the banner of the window. What's also annoying and dumb is that I get a penalty for leaving and dodging a queue which imo is r%%%%%ed ffs at least make it a 10 min probation not increasing the minutes every time you leave. I want my LeaverBuster thing removed because it's preventing me from playing games. Ign: ItsJustAPrankBrv \r\nAnd does anyone have a solution for the crash problem I have? It didn't happen before but after the 6.9 patch it started happening. I didn't bother repairing because I saw others saying that repair doesn't fix the problem I have and I checked my specs and it was all good. Time by time Riot doesn't fix their game and doesn't change their shit launcher ffs.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T20:54:58.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are experiencing what's called a BugSplat error.

This seems to be happening a lot in the past few days. Have you guys looked into it? I mean i was fine all yesterday then suddenly had this happen to me last night.

This gives us a fairly good high level view if a lot of players are experiencing a specific issue, and how we can fix it.  As of right now, there hasn't been an increase in the number of BugSplat errors being reported.  Because of this, we first want to eliminate as many root causes as possible before digging deeper.\n\nIf you do get this error at all, make sure to try the steps in the BugSplat Article to see if they will be prevented for the future!","replies":[{"poster":"Zinski","date":"2016-05-21T19:06:32.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having the same problem lately too. My client crashes whenever I start a game. I do not get any form of bug splat error just a windows pop up screen that say that league of legends has crashed pr stopped working. Then sometimes my screen will go full screen then exit out and say the game has crashed on my client and when i try to reconnect I get the same problem. I would very much appreciate it if you can fix this problem and please remove my leaver buster for these problems because it is not my fault that I have been having these problems. I was able to play games before 6.10 but since the new update came out all I get is \"League of legends had stopped working' every time I start any game mode.IGN: Zinski67","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Esaul","date":"2016-05-10T21:26:02.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this issue since the patch dropped.
