Even if they can't fix it, they can often be pointed in the right direction. If you would have come here with any other ISP you probably could've gotten it fixed; several volunteers help out many in this way on the H&S board.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ictus","date":"2016-01-26T04:16:21.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like clockwork now that its past 8 my ping is fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sontorn","date":"2016-01-26T03:43:23.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so happy to see someone post this here. I've been having the exact same issue with only League for the past few weeks. I also have Frontier and it happens to me from roughly 7-10 pm Eastern. I'm right by the League server (Indiana) and normally get 17-20 ping. But at this time it's at a steady 100+ and remains constant until after 10 then goes back to normal. Internet is fine and the traceroutes I run points to the address that I'm pinging (league's). Every other game is fine. In the tracert, only the last line is the issue, every other hop is ~15 ms.\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/9uwodv","replies":[]}]}
