I am an aatrox main, everything has been fine since now, aatrox is one of the most underplayed champs in the game so i dont understand why you are trying to make the rest of the aatrox players stop playing him.  It is very hard to play as this champ as is but now that you have created the bramble vest it is a struggle and a half to play him at all anymore, because everyone builds this item.  I played a match the other day where the whole team built thornmails tell me how does one counter that broken item.  The item makes sustaining literally impossible i invested lots of money in this game and now not being able to play the champ that i love is making me want to stop playing the game.  please riot fix this \r\n\r\nthanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T03:37:22.239+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyyyy an Aatrox main! Y'know, I personally still really love that champion as well, regardless of how good he is in the current meta ^_^!\n\nWe'd love to hear some of your ideas for making Bramble Vest or Aatrox work a little better! I could discuss it here, but Help & Support isn't necessarily the best place to talk about design changes. Hit up the [**Gameplay **](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)boards with this idea and you're much more likely to get more and better feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2017-07-17T15:16:01.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys need to make self-healing stand apart from lifesteal/spellvamp and healing from outside sources.\n\nIf you just make it so that self-healing that's built in to champions is not affected by Grievous Wounds, you can balance it by the numbers it needs.\n\nOtherwise you have these extreme cases where \"slowing down the carry lifesteal\" does serious damage to champions like Aatrox or Yorick who absolutely need the pittance of self-healing they have access to, while *not* affecting those champions like Illaoi, Darius, Vlad and Swain who are far more problematic than Aatrox, since it only procs on autoattacks. \n\nRecategorize self-healing into something unaffected by Grievous Wounds. Give Ignite the ability to reduce that self-healing in addition to Grievous Wounds, and give it ONLY TO IGNITE, for the same outplay potential that Exhaust has.\n\nThen work on champion healing numbers and balance them around what the champions need.\n\nAlso--just a side note, could Exhaust also affect healing/shielding numbers the same way as damage?","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2017-07-17T15:24:08.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easier solution than that is create an effect called true healing. Which can be applied to abilities at Riots discretion and ignores all reductions to healing. Because creating the change you are stating would need to make on hit healing immune to GW, you stated it as self healing which Darius, Swain, Vlad, And Illaoi would under your definition also be immune to GW as they are not based on SV (only morgana has Spell vamp in kit) or lifesteal (all of their healing is via built in kit abilities not auto attack healing)","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2017-07-17T15:28:31.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. Yeah it would.\n\nBut I'm not a fan of arbitrarily handing out \"superior\" healing to X or Y champion. Sets a bad precedent.\n\nI'd rather them sweep through and make all self-healing the same, and then balance the numbers on each individual champion's self-healing. So if Vlad's healing for too much, bam, they reduce the numbers and it's fixed. No need to think about whether to buff Grievous Wounds up to 60% reduction in the hopes that that stops Vlad and cause them to have to reassess a dozen other champions in the aftermath.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dont fuq with me","date":"2017-07-17T03:41:18.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yah lol i didnt know where to put this","replies":[]}]}]}
