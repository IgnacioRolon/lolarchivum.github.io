The amount of games lost due to someone going straight tilt over what they think was a KS.\n\nWhat led me to making this post wasnt even a kill I got. \n\nBackstory: Our team was getting wrecked. Other team was in our base. Me (Voli) and Chogath was in a tank fight with the other teams very tanky Malphite. We was 2v1 but he had 6 kills and 10 assists and was very farmed up for the time the game has gone. We were fighting him for a least a good 40 seconds..........all the sudden our top lane vayne came running off the fountain, while we were still fighting him she gets 2 or 3 shots off before he died to Chogath. Then the Vayne types...&quot;pls dont ks me.&quot;\n\nWTF??????\n\nYou come in when someone  is just a few hits from death and call ks after not just 1 but 2 people were fighting him for over half a minute?\n\nTo me there is only 1 true KS. It is when you are 1 v 1 with someone and you clearly have the kill in hand. other person is almost dead and you are nowhere near death.......and then someone else just comes up and kills them.\n\nIf you are 1 v 1 with someone and im the support or any other role and it looks like you are about to die...you better believe im going to kil them if i can before they kill you.\n\nBut to me it seems some people would rather die to get a kill than to live and take a assist.\n\nAnd the worst KS call i see a lot of babies cry over is the &quot;KS&quot; IN TEAM FIGHTS.........if it is a team fight how can you really call &quot;KS&quot;\n\nJust fucking kill them and go win the game.\n\nIll gladly take a win in a game i get 0 kills in than to take a loss in a game that im just worried about getting the kill in.","replies":[{"poster":"King of Mongoose","date":"2016-06-21T12:19:39.505+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":134,"body":"if i'm playing draven and you ks me i am going to suicide under turret.
