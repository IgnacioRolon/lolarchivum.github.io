If Taliyah uses Q to destroy the minions, she won’t have it available to hit you. The cooldown is too high at its early levels for it to be up that fast.

If you are moving so far away from your minions at lvl 1, you deserve to be hit by every single pellet of a Taliyah Q. That’s what we are both saying. Either she uses her Q to kill the minions, in which case, it’s on cooldown until the next wave comes or she waits to try to get a good Q on the enemy, in which case they will probably take one or two hits before retreating back behind minions. The instant bonus move speed has nothing to do with it, especially not at early levels and before Rylai’s. It’s incredibly easy to retreat behind minions unless you overextended when you shouldn’t have, in which case any opponent would be able to get a good punish off on you; not just Taliyah.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-09-08T02:00:32.062+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Except said worked ground also locks herself out from said Q for like the next 3 minutes?","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2016-09-08T03:06:31.688+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"She gets a weaker, lower mana cost Q.

Reaction speed is how fast information get through your sense organs into your brain. Combos is different thing - it's signals coming out from your brain not into your brain.

But I&#x27;m sad because it took so much time.\n\nHer design wasn't even that bad on release. 6.10 Taliyah was the most balanced she'd ever be because she had to work for her roams. She couldn't just spray Q all over the minions and call it a day. She had to interact with the lane opponent with E and W. The Q hotfix was definitely necessary because it ate up her mana pool early on with little payoff.\n\nRemember Lockout? A mechanic that basically balanced her? Us {{champion:163}} mains had to work with that shit and we were happy with it. Guess who asked to remove it. That's right. The people who were against the mechanic were people who didn't even play her. Guess when she became imbalanced.\n\nWe didn't give her any time. I can name a few solid counters off the top of my head and it becomes ridiculously easy to beat her if you know what she does. {{champion:91}}, {{champion:238}}, {{champion:25}}, {{champion:63}}, {{champion:85}}, {{champion:43}}, {{champion:127}}, and a good {{champion:55}} are all solid counters against her. {{champion:77}}, {{champion:48}}, {{champion:57}}, {{champion:60}}, and {{champion:33}} are good Junglers against her. What do these champions have in common? They do not have gapclosers that are affected by her E.","replies":[{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2016-09-08T02:15:07.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Solid what?

Sorry but I don&#x27;t see in your list guys with global ult to stop her.\n\nShe couldn't just use Q for farming because she'd lose all her poking power and a fair amount of presence in lane. And remember, it didn't have the 50% bonus damage when she was balanced, so it's even worse. Worked Ground balances her Q's ability to fire 5 projectiles at once. If she can't push out and is stuck in Worked Ground, she's going to be in a lot of trouble. She can risk draining her mana pool by using her subpar E and W or get pushed in and wait. Her E and W are no where near safe compared to someone like Lux or Orianna. Now people can just dash straight through her E and kick her ass with no repercussions.\n\nAlso, you don't need global ults to stop her. You need pink/sightstone/blue wards, team presence, game knowledge, and eyes to stop it. If you see her missing, it's clear she's going to ult down to bot or top. There is a chance she's going to cheese you by blocking you off, but it can kill her in the process. Play well, buy MR and you can basically ruin her entire laning phase. Get your team to place a few wards and she's basically non-existent.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
