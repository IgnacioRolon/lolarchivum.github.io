You Call This Support?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I legit just spent 10 minutes typing out questions and problems about multiple things in a support ticket. All legit questions. I go to submit the ticket and I have to pick something out of the category drop box. The closest thing in their limited options that made sense was \"Gameplay\".  Soon as i selected gameplay it just immediately routes me to the forums. I hit the back button and of course everything i just typed is gone.\n\ngreat support there. \n\nNot everything can be solved in FAQs or on the forums. I personally dont care if it takes a week for a response. Stop being lazy and actually support rather than just pass people on to the next man. im so tilted by this im not even about to try to submit another one. Maybe thats what they want.\n\nI mean if anything let them look over the FAQs and when they see it doesnt help, let them still submit the ticket...dont just wipe out what they typed.","replies":[{"poster":"God of League","date":"2017-08-08T17:42:14.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"killer61099","date":"2017-08-08T16:52:45.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you the same thing just happened to me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T00:08:35.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be a little weird that some of those options can direct to one of our Knowledge Articles, but those FAQS contain most of the first touch steps that our support teams might first try. They're meant to be a way that you can find the answers to your issues yourself instead of needing to wait for a ticket response. \n\nSome people are perfectly okay with waiting on the answer straight from the horse's mouth, while others like to try and find the answers themselves. Different strokes for different folks I guess!","replies":[{"poster":"FlyingRoboticCow","date":"2017-08-11T15:56:52.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what hes upset about (as was I when i did it) is that he was attempting to submit a ticket and then simply by selecting a category for his ticket instead of submitting it it deleted it and sent him so a page he would have looked up had that been what he was looking for. He was very clearly attempting to submit a ticket for help and sending a person to a page that might have fixes is nice but you may want to have that pop up after they have a submitted ticket instead  of submitting their ticket because that's infuriating.","replies":[]}]}]}
