It doesn't make you right. LCS has done plenty of things that would have been considered troll picks, if i wasn't for the fact that LCS was doing it. \n\nOr back at the end of S2 there was proxy singed where the whole point was to fight behind enemy turrets and die while forcing 3+ to fight you.\n\nYour definition of trolly doesn't make much sense is my problem.","replies":[{"poster":"bill84","date":"2016-05-02T01:37:08.878+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have some good points.

I think it's okay though if you do it, with the intention of doing well and winning. I saw an AP caitlyn and an AP lucian do well before. Do I think those are good builds for them? No. But I'm going to reserve judgment til after the game, how they did, and how they ACTED which I think is most important.

They all say \" I can pick whoever I want, or let him play whoever he wants\" but yet they cry for more bans. How about you let your enemy team play their best champions and what they want huh?  Lets remove the banning process.\n\n\"Let him play what he wants, it's just norms\" apparently now everyone is saying on this thread \"let him play what he wants, it's just RANKED\". Lol... people make up your minds.\n\nI just had the most toxic game in my life today. I banned someones champion, and it was a  4 man premade that all reported me, but they made sure to go Janna top, soraka mid and so on and gave Yasuo a quadra kill before the minions spawned. The kill score was like 100-3 with me having the kills lol.... They kept purposely feeding just cause I banned one of their champions. It's funny how everyone is so toxic in league.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2016-05-01T22:01:10.453+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"71 to 11.\n\nHeh, Rengar had 32 kills that game.

Literally got 4 man premade trolled cause I banned someones champion that I didn't feel like playing with just cause I wasn't feeling it. They instantly said enjoy 20 minutes of your life wasted and constantly  talked smack. Was hilarious tho, I recorded some of the footage with fraps. I was simply placing smiley faces and being nice lol in the game too.\n\nI couldn't CS cause everyone was so fed, so I didn't bother jungling, why should i? Anyhow, reported them all for intentionally feeding, and being toxic, they won't be banned. Since they were a premade, they convinced the whole other team to report me, luckily I did nothing wrong, so not gonna be punished for it. \n\nAnyhow, worst toxic game I've seen so far. And yeah I just been playing normals and waiting for solo que, i tried the DQ and lost a ton and went from like Bronze 1 to B3 all in one period cause I didn't want to stop and refused to let DQ win although it did... So I'll just keep the low win rate in ranked for now. In normals my MMR is probably around 1500 assuming cause  if you go to lolking.net i consistently get paired with golds and some plats. The MMR-com website had me at 20% better than silver 1 players until today it dropped to 18% better than Silver 2. Owell, assuming my correct rank is around platinum level, it's just a matter of going back to rank play sometime which I don't want to currently.","replies":[{"poster":"LiveYiOrDieHard","date":"2016-05-02T11:12:20.759+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Best EV3R NA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6pxpELjH,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-01T22:09:10.827+0000)\n>\n> Oh yeah, they had a couple kills because the other team felt sorry and let them kill them since it was game and started fountain diving for fun.
