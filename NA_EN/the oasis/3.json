It seems like the only points of interest in the world are Moblin camps where I break a couple weapons to unlock chests which contain other breakable weapons, and the trials which wouldn&#039;t be so bad if they were a side dish rather that some of the major meat of the game.  The rest of the wide vast world so far has basically been random monsters and dead space.  It also takes forever to get through all the dead space even with a horse (which I can&#039;t access atm because I had to leave it behind).\r\n\r\nAlso these combat controls are bleeping awful.  I can&#039;t count the number of times I&#039;ve pulled out magic when I needed my shield, accidentally crouched when I needed to maneuver, or done nothing when I needed the shield but had the bow out.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t understand how this got 4.5 and 5-star reviews.  Do gaming journalists only play these games for a half hour, does Nintendo pay them off, or does the rest of the game give some meat to the advertised &quot;exploration&quot; theme?","replies":[]}
