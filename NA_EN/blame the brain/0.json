If anyone else has any recommendations I will add them to this post when I see them.\n\n-Itaniindahood\n\n\nEDIT: So upon this new patch the files libcrypto-1_1.dll, libssl-1_1.dll, and zlib.dll all break and you have to follow the same steps but the files that aren't broken have changed positions. The files that aren't broken are going to be found in the deploy folder of the folder 0.0.0.92 and then you just copy them and paste them into the league of legends folder by replacing the ones with the same name in that folder. I will continue to update this patch by patch adding the files that need to be fixed and where to find the ones that aren't broken. Hopefully Riot will fix this soon and this thread will be come irrelevant, but until then keep checking back if your RADS folder or league of legends folder breaks you will most likely find your fix on this thread if not somewhere else!

The quickest fix for these RADS errors is typically to setup your [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) again. Giving this a try could be worth a try as well if permissions don't seem to help!","replies":[]}]}
