Even rioters use this argument. When it goes against their argument, you can't use the argument. When it is in their favor, the argument suddenly becomes valid.

The system can't be perfect unless it prohibits and bans non-pro level meta play. I could pick Soraka ADC and troll just by doing that. Only way to fix that is to ban non meta picks. I could build rabadon's on Zed to troll. Only way to prevent that is to ban all zed's who build an AP item. Suddenly the game becomes some authoritarian platform that rigidly enforces one meta, but at least it's impossible to troll. \n\nThe system goes for unnecessary verbal toxicity and blatant gameplay toxicity. And rightfully so. Your friend was 100% toxic the first game, you said so yourself. Out of frustration, sure, and does everyone do it sometimes? No. I don't, and that's why my highest ever penalty was one 20 minute wait period because once I was playing a steam game while in queue and just kept missing the queue, even after the 5 minute penalty because League wasn't tabbing me me out when it popped. It's possible not to be toxic, but toxic people seem to think that emotional outbursts are a given and excusable. Control your emotions. It may be an excuse in real life, I understand. Heat of the moment, someone calls you a retard and punches you in the stomach, you aren't expected to wait, think it through, and decide on a better course of action. You probably get angry and attack. But over the computer, he had to pause his gameplay to type something out, thinking it out before hand even if slightly. That's not him forced to be toxic, that's him wanting to be toxic. Emotionally driven, but still not an immediate, uncontrollable reaction. \n\nSecond one you seemed to have worded very....nicely. Expressed his feelings of victory. Now to me, and to many others I'm sure, this means something along the lines of \"GG, we win!\" or \"GG ez\". You know? You won, you feel good, you had to make sure the enemy knew you won. But, I think I say ggez about every match I win to be honest. I haven't gotten so much as a warning. This leads me to believe that your friend may have used some stronger language, also unnecessary? Maybe along the lines of \"You're all trash, I'm better.\" \"Uninstall\" etc. It's not that these words are hurtful. It's that there's no reason in saying them besides being a douche and that deserves a ban. He won the game, good for him, he gets NOTHING from letting the enemy team know that he thinks they're bad. \n\nAnd reported for lag? Doesn't happen.
