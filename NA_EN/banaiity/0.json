I also increased the quality to its maximum and even then the ping and FPS were pretty standard though the jumping seemed alot more severe. \r\nRead that it could potentially be packet loss? Not really sure and what else to say,\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T02:18:07.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm you may be onto something with that packet loss suspicion. Let's test for that really quickly by using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) first. Use the game logs that had that weird lag, take a screenshot, and post it here where I can go over it with you!","replies":[{"poster":"BanaIity","date":"2017-06-20T14:14:00.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for lateness of reply, took 3 screen shots of the logs, 2 games played recently and one maybe a month or two ago (if it's worth mentioning a month ago I was living else where with a different internet provider which was much better 19ms where as here its often around 30ms, though even with this higher ping I never noticed such harsh jumpiness) :\n\n2 recent games with jumpiness:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/G0uzD\nhttp://imgur.com/a/3kH1t\ngame where I was living else where:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/PBV0C\n\nNeed to know anything else please let me know or if you need more logs\n\nCheers \n\n\nEdit: Just played a game with probably the most noticeable lag/glichiness but I frequently checked the FPS and ping and they remained within my usual ranges of about 70-90 FPS and 30ms ping. This game was weirder though, I was able to move my character and see every other character move but I couldn't see any abilities, and if a minion died, the health bar disappeared but they were still moving and fighting, after a few seconds suddenly all the abilities could be shown and the minions without health bars suddenly died...\n\nThe above mention game:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/LmCsy","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-22T22:45:44.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaa it looks like that packet loss is most likely what's getting in the way here. Most of the time this type of lag is centered around your ISP, but there's still a few things we can check on your end.
