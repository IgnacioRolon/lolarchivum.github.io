I hear you! But think again... The game is FREE to play so the toxic offenders can just make a new account, and that&#039;s exactly what they do.","url":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/EHx76RN4-the-truth-about-perma-bans-ands-chat-restrict","image":"https://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":21,"body":"I recently made a post on this forum regarding Riot&#039;s money making tricks when it comes to permanent bans. The TLDR was that I had suggested permanent chat bans instead of permanent bans. \n\nApparently Riot has tried permanent chat bans before with no success. Some people had some very good points and my post was downvoted into the land of the unseen. \n\nBut I have one final question or suggestion for those claiming Riot isn&#039;t out for money with permanent bans. If Riot really just wants to clean the community and doesn&#039;t care about money, then they should refund all the money (or half of it?) that the player has spent on the banned account. As I mentioned before, people spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on these accounts.\n\nIf Riot returned the money spent, then that would prove to me that they aren&#039;t just out for cash with their permanent ban system. It would have no negative consequences from the people who want toxic players removed from the game. I know that this is possible with both PayPal and credit card (for most credit cards) transaction.\n\nTLDR If permanent bans are really not about Riot&#039;$ love for money, then they should refund the money spent on banned accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"The Cream Reaper","date":"2017-12-22T10:43:43.726+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"reading that i'm realising that you still haven't read the ToS which is kind of sad tbh\n\n>4.3.

There was also a more fair banning system and not this \"auto ban\" after X reports. I know of two cases where the user was banned immediately after finishing a game with the ban message also confirming this by including the chat for that current game. Sure they had chat restrict before, but the punishment jumps up from a chat ban to permanent ban because some players are too pathetic to hit the mute button and have to hit the report user at the end of the game. Over the last 7 years the league community has gotten so soft that it can't handle being called \"trash\". Oh wow the word trash was said. Let's all overreact and ruin someone's years of work and money. Riot is definitely trending this game away from adults and catering to the 13 year olds. \n\nAlso if you watch any streams on Twitch that are high ELO, there is a lot of chat like this, but people are probably more mature as they are master players. A good example of this is \"Hashinshin\". I see the chat in those games, and it doesn't even phase me for a millisecond.\n\nIf you can't handle adult chat, use the mute button instead of reporting/banning people. You are ruining lives because some random person on the internet called you bad at a video game in chat. \n\nI'm going to open myself up to major downvotes here, but this is my personal chat log from my permanent ban (1 SIDED ONLY OF COURSE):\n\nGame 1\nThe Spin Slicer: rofl\nThe Spin Slicer: leave it\nThe Spin Slicer: ;et ot reset\nThe Spin Slicer: let it reset\nThe Spin Slicer: or you can push

but none of you are good people\nThe Spin Slicer: none of my team are good poeple\nThe Spin Slicer: not one\nThe Spin Slicer: they all think like kda is everything and dont understand what really happend\nThe Spin Slicer: cant watch the replay for proof\nThe Spin Slicer: see\nThe Spin Slicer: now he tries to verbal you guys\nThe Spin Slicer: so BM\nThe Spin Slicer: they all tilted the shit out of me\nThe Spin Slicer: whole team\nThe Spin Slicer: ill bet if any of them watched the replay\nThe Spin Slicer: theyu would feel bad\nThe Spin Slicer: hes toxic is why karma\nThe Spin Slicer: maybe now you see\nThe Spin Slicer: my whole teams verbals me\nThe Spin Slicer: then wants to report me for tilting\nThe Spin Slicer: gotta love\nThe Spin Slicer: league\nThe Spin Slicer: all of you deserve

good\nThe Spin Slicer: right\nThe Spin Slicer: exactly, because i was doing an impression of your gameplay\nThe Spin Slicer: exactly my point\nThe Spin Slicer: but when i do it instead of you it looks different?\nThe Spin Slicer: im glad riot's automated system looks for words you are using\nThe Spin Slicer: for my report\nThe Spin Slicer: report xin verbal\nThe Spin Slicer: \"ur trash\"\nThe Spin Slicer: 1/9\nThe Spin Slicer: wonder who is getting the report\n\nAfter reading this I am surprised even myself that my chat looks so much worse, but with all the other people included in the chat log it would look so much different. I was getting blamed for the loss by EVERYONE else. I was taught to stand up for myself, and I'm probably much older than your average league it's so very very hard to resist that urge. I grew up with a free speech internet, and this kind of chat is what I've been used to in gaming communities my whole life playing online games.\n\nI would also be willing to bet that the \"system\" missed banning the other people who were ruining the games to begin with before I started chatting out of frustration. I get that there's a \"be the bigger man\" situation going on here, but is this chat really so unbearable that it deserves a permanent ban and loss of thousands of dollars? I would bet only the people who are 15 or younger would not be able to handle this chat. Like i said already, when other friends and myself first signed up to league, you had to be an adult to make an account.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"The Cream Reaper","date":"2017-12-22T16:17:35.418+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">There are many people who clicked \"I agree\" back when the League community had more adult rules about what you could say in chat. \n\nand both back then and nowadays, very few of them actually bother to read what they are agreeing to and then, just like you, come on the boards to complain about how much riot is unfair\n\n>There was also a more fair banning system and not this \"auto ban\" after X reports.

Access to a new skin for one game is worth the sticker price of RP. Every use after that is just freebies. So, if you buy a new skin, play one game, then get permabanned, you aren't technically being denied any of the access you paid for.\n \nAlternatively, Riot could institute a pay per use system. Here, you would spend a small amount of RP every time you wanted to use a skin. Then there is no way to feel like you've had anything taken from you after a permaban. This system would be more true to what is actually the case.
