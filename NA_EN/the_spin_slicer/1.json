I hear you! But think again...\n\nThe game is FREE to play so the toxic offenders can just make a new account, and that's exactly what they do.\n\nNow the situation has just gotten worse, because this same toxic player has gotten right back into the community. Think of all the streamers like Tyler1 who just keep on playing and making new accounts, and then other people you read about on Reddit or the LOL forums. It happens frequently. This makes the situation even worse, because now this person is likely not at their proper MMR (match making rating) anymore, and they will proceed to ruin more games by either being too weak or too strong from where they are placed. It can take many many games for the average player to be placed in the proper ranked division. This is not a 1v1 game, so winning or losing games by being more skill or less skilled is not as likely; There is the luck of your other 4 players, and team comp, etc. The other issue here is that the player can continue to be toxic in chat or in game on the new account.\n\nNow Riot has another great idea already implemented: Chat Restrictions! This is a great way to deal with toxic players, it severely limits the amount of verbal abuse they can do in chat, and keeps the player in the game rather than arguing or other toxic behaviours like being AFK just because they are typing. Also /all chat is disabled, which prevents the inevitable \"report my team\" or early GG messages that give the other team the confidence to wipe you out.\n\nSo why would Riot ban an accounts you ask? MONEY! Even though the game is free, they know that these users will dump more cash into the League of legends store for skins and even just champions to play the game.\n\nSo my solution: Just keep using chat restrict and keep extending the chat restrict punishment after each toxic offense! Eventually the chat restrict could last a very long time and every player in those games will be happier with the results of a chat restricted player, than have another toxic \"Smurf\" in their game with full blown /all chat access.\n\nI'm a reasonable person so please comment below if I'm missing something or there is any other creative ideas that I might not thinking of.\n\nPS. Riot bring URF back forever ;)\n\nTLDR: Riot only uses perma bans to make money! An improved \"Chat Restrict\" is a much better solution\n\nEdit: added tldr","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2017-12-20T14:36:00.263+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"They actually tried this already.

There could have been a time in a person's life where they just having a hard time or going through some serious life issues. Not an excuse I know, but maybe a 1 year or 6 month ban would be more appropriate. A person can change a lot in 6 months.\n\nI also still hate being matched with toxic people (or people that are not at their right MMR) in my matches. I also think a lot of you are not realizing how easy it is to get a level 30 account that is ranked ready from 3rd party sites. I do not advocate using these sites but they exist and it's only about $25 for a ranked ready account unranked.\n\nI would still love to hear any other alternative ideas to the permanent ban, if anyone can think of one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-12-20T14:43:36.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tyler1 had what they are calling an ID ban.
