And I won my match and realized I didn't get promoted and didn't get my free win. \r\n\r\nIs it because I got demoted at some point since than and that's why? After I reached the promos and lost, I got demoted and than immediately promoted back into Gold IV.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-07T20:28:07.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be the reason. Promo helper will only stick around for one promo, so if you demote, it will apply to the promo to get back up to where you started.\nAlso, make sure not to dodge in any promo series. Doing so will not only count as a loss in your best-of, but prevent you from getting promo helper should you fail to promote!\nSure you'll make a come back though, dood! :D I got faith in ya!","replies":[]}]}
