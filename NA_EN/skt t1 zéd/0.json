As well as with my notifications I get no sound or alert for them.\r\n\r\nIs this suppose to be intentional with the client, and is there a way for me to fix this so I can freely use Messenger calling while playing a match?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-08T20:33:40.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds super frustrating and it's a crappy situation when you're in a call and it hangs up on you, but we don't support third party messaging applications!
