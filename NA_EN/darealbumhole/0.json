Which means if the product hasn't been used I'm entitled to a refund right? Riot seem to think they can get away with not letting my get my money back for this. And upon U.K law I'm entitled to a refund. But Riot said that their will be consequences If I charge back.\r\nJust wanted some thoughts on this and If anyone can help.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T22:02:33.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I cannot give you any advice or suggestions here on the Boards.

Your bank/credit company would be the one to ask about chargeback eligibility.  Riot's answer to that question will be obvious (and irrelevant).\n\nRiot employees are likely to, at least initially, point you toward the Terms of Service.  Riot will try to claim you agreed to waivers of liability or property interest by accepting ToS.  However, ToS can NOT supersede your chargeback rights or other consumer protections.\n\nWhy did you get banned?  Riot can NOT permanently deny access to virtual goods or currency solely because you have a potty mouth, or you disappointed a premade in ranked, went afk, etc.  At most negative chat warrants a partial or total chat restriction, bans are an excessive and escalatory response to negative chat.  Other players could have just muted you anyway...\n\nAFK's may warrant game restrictions or temporary suspensions, permanently banning an account associated with a purchase is still excessive.\n\nIf you were hacking or cheating, you will be much less likely to prevail in a chargeback dispute.\n\nBut if it was minor like using offensive but non-threatening language, then permanently banning an account associated with in-game purchases is totally inappropriate.  Riot may try to argue the supremacy of their special ToS regarding refunds.  Let them try to make that argument to your bank or credit card company.","replies":[]}]}
