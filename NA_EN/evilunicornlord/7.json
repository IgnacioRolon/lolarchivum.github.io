Top lane bruisers had a fair complaint that if they weren't allowed to absolutely bully tanks out of laning (and too hard of lane counters are unhealthy), then they shouldn't be invalidated by being outscaled so hard by marksmen, resulting in no strong enough phase for bruisers in the game to compete with tanks providing a stronger team role after laning.  Nerfing marksmen would have tipped the pros and cons of a tank vs bruiser top lane back into balance, since teams require sufficient follow-up damage output in order for tanks' CC to maximize its value and marksmen shouldn't ever be allowed to monopolize the role of a lategame carry on a team.  Bruisers still had an advantage (albeit less of an advantage than in other metas) vs tanks during laning and could take down tanks at any point of the game if it weren't for marksmen shredding them far too quickly from the back-line inflating the value of the tank's CC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-08-13T09:58:18.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"except riot did nothing to fix that except give them more scaling damage which didnt change the base damage problems but people stopped playing those bruiser builds anyway because 'it wasnt good anymore'","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-08-10T21:14:21.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, even Riot admitted that the flag carriers of the last tank meta, seju and Zac, were poorly done rework wise which made balancing them difficult, and all that comes with that.\n\nDoesnt help that enhancer supports were OP at the same time which added up to make any kind of diving/assassin champ useless,  and while marksmen were strong it wasnt as obvious because hypercarry builds with rageblade were the most played if i recall right.\n\n\nSo a good chance exists that even if tanks come back the meta will never be so stale as it was under season 7 post the class rework.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"destroyer22719","date":"2018-08-10T21:50:11.426+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":" One of the FEW times a good bruiser is in rotation {{champion:114}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:39}} I play top.

The scenario is a ranged top laner meaning that there are at least 3 range champions on the enemy team most likely (top/bot/support) with the ranged top laner most likely still being the split pusher meaning it isn't like you are going to be able to get them while you protect your towers either. The only way you are getting Grasp procs assuming this team comp is off your ulti engage which, as I said earlier, is better off with Aftershock anyway since it does more damage and makes you bulkier, which you will most likely need help with, since you are most likely behind since Malphite gets rocked by ranged champions until at least 1 item (even worse if it is Kennen since MR doesn't go as far).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2018-08-10T21:24:24.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar isn't a tank.","replies":[]}]}]}
