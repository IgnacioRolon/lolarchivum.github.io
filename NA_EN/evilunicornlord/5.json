Best thing ever riot. We were getting wrecked, but because we were &quot;against bots&quot; we didn&#039;t flame each other we were like, okay guys we cant lose to bots. We came back to win, just to see that the other team thought they lost to bots and were saying how embarrassing it was. Such a team building experience when you didn&#039;t read about it before it happens to you. hahaha.\n\nNow I wish my computer wasn&#039;t broken (posting this on mobile) so I could have joined the event.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ALjv1X7.png?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-04-03T02:17:52.332+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find this magic change more drastic than any rework, jungle change, or class update:\n\nAll chat being disabled. Not only do I feel more at ease without that lv 7 yasuo going \"ez\" every time he gets a gank, but I also feel less incline to /all bm myself or my team. \n\nOverall, I realised through this experiment how much of a difference all chat makes to the community. It only exist for salt.. like seriously less than 1-100 games all chat used for a good reason.\n\nKinda disable that in my client settings actually.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-03T02:41:48.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disabled /all chat in my game ever since I started playing SMITE and realized how much better the games were (there's no all chat there).
