Knowing full well that I could not buy the skin on any other day, I decided to purchase the bundle despite not owning many of the champions within.\r\n\r\nIncluded was {{champion:117}} and her Wicked Lulu skin.\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Lulu_2.jpg\r\n\r\nI decided &quot;Why the heck not?&quot; and began playing Lulu.\r\n\r\nShe was fun. Her character was very likable and helping people out in her role was, somehow, unlike any other support/mage I&#039;ve played. I wasn&#039;t the greatest Lulu played of all time, in fact, I was rather mediocre.\r\n\r\nThat didn&#039;t stop me from buying Dragon Trainer Lulu when it went on sale.\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Lulu_3.jpg\r\n\r\nI figured that was enough skins for one champion...\r\n\r\n...Until Winter Wonder Lulu showed up in my Teemoing shop.\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Lulu_4.jpg\r\n\r\nI couldn&#039;t help it! It had snowy particles, a new recall animation, and who doesn&#039;t like poros?\r\n\r\nAs if that wasn&#039;t enough, Pool Party Lulu went on sale.\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Lulu_5.jpg\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I got that one too.\r\n\r\nSo there, I admit it. I love purple. I&#039;ve been jumping at every opportunity to fulfill my passion to purple.\r\n\r\nAccept me or deny me, I just had to get that out of my system.\r\n\r\n######And I also wanted an excuse to use this GIF again:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iyu9UQ4.gif?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"Otter Fire","date":"2016-11-09T22:12:43.020+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got Zillean and loved his movement speed and clutch Chronoshift plays","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2016-11-09T22:32:59.043+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpe-JoGyPsY","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-11-09T23:00:53.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No matter how many times I watch that, if it appears in front of me, I will watch it again.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2016-11-10T01:32:16.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It never gets old.\n\n######Pun absolutely intended.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Otter Fire","date":"2016-11-10T12:39:29.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There it is.
