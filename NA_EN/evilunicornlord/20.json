While sometimes Teleport does sometimes open up cool and unique lines of play.  But at the same time it shuts down other lines, simply by the threat of an enemy being able to appear from across the map.  I know i have had many pushes / tower sieges broken by an enemy starting to teleport in and then canceling when we backed off.\n\nImagine the nerf never happened and teleport was a thing everyone took.  Winning lane is now WAY harder since enemies only need invest a few seconds to recall and buy items before popping back to lane.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-08-31T07:21:57.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding to this comment\n\nThis is the reason why Teleport got nerfed in the first place a couple seasons back.

A world with 5 ignites is better than a world with 5 teleports. If everyone could carry teleport then it would make macro meaningless. Everyone would be too intimidated to make a play because it suddenly just turns into a 5v5 clownfiesta. The whole purpose of outpathing the enemy jungler or something small like that and being able to take enemy jg's blue buff or even just a wolf camp would be nullified if everyone plays accordingly. Competitive would be a standstill every game for a good 30 minutes if you just give everyone global threat. That's why the more teleports there are the less it serves its intended purpose. That is to proactively or reactively make plays around the map. Can't do that if nobody is making plays. At least with 5 ignites you see more individual plays. Ignite is not, at all, overpowered. Its buff has hardly made any sort of relevant changes to the game. It dictates how 1v1s play out. But the only people who can dictate whether or not a 1v1 even happens are by the players. If you can't 1v1 someone then just don't! It's that simple. As long as it's that easy there's no reason to even suggest ignite is overpowered. It's just dumb. TP does literally everything while ignite does 1 unreliable thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kosm1K","date":"2018-08-31T08:08:06.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or, just buff tp back up, the recent nerf wasn't necessary","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-08-31T11:21:10.683+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kosm1K,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TYzuVARK,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2018-08-31T08:08:06.016+0000)\n>\n> or, just buff tp back up, the recent nerf wasn&#x27;t necessary\n\nThe ignite buff wasn't necessary to begin with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-08-30T22:14:24.957+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"505 True Damage on click","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dingding123","date":"2018-08-31T00:21:37.391+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EvilUnicornLord,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TYzuVARK,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-30T20:40:09.635+0000)\n>\n> You're really killing it for us objective-favoring people who like literally any other summoner.\n\nftfy","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-08-30T21:43:38.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"BURN THEM","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Kill","date":"2018-08-31T13:52:43.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, ignite dealing ~1/4 of a squishies max health in true damage after midgame while at the same time reducing heals by 40 or 60% or however much it was along with true sight is kinda broken, but riot doesnt really care about balancing summoner spells {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:1}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Kill","date":"2018-08-31T13:53:29.504+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"raise your hand if youve unironically taken cleanse more than 3 times in your life in summoners rift 5v5","replies":[]},{"poster":"50Shades0fTrynda","date":"2018-09-05T14:48:18.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just a quick question... how much damage did ignite deal in the past?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sektah","date":"2018-08-31T02:13:44.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ignite is a very niche SS late game, its only good purpose late is to decrease healing, its supposed to be oppressive early","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2018-08-31T02:36:38.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not supposed to be a \"free win if your lane opponent didn't take ignite\" though.\n\nI like options and this meta does not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fury Reaver","date":"2018-08-31T00:35:43.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leave ignite like that, revert the useless tp nerf instead. if adc's abuse it, then nerf fkn adc's. the heal nerf also got reverted, like why is tp still nerfed?
