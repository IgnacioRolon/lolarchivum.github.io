I understand that people were still having some issues with receiving their season rewards along with a \"service status\" message stating there were some issues within the store currently. Could we by chance get any more information as to whether or not the transfers are included in that \"store issue\" category, or if there is an underlying cause aside from the previously mentioned barring this asset returning?\r\n\r\nI have recently moved countries and would love to transfer my account over to my new location, and have been waiting nearly 2 months to do so now. A simple update in the timeframe or situation would suffice.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\n{{summoner:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-22T21:58:22.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I wanted to offer an update.

I understand things are generally hectic for you guys around patch updates, but this is really getting a tad bit irritating. Its not so much that myself and others are mad about the fact that they're not up, but more so that absolutely 0 information has been relayed to us as the consumers as to what the issue is. Im not asking for the situation to be fixed or updated instantly, all I want is to come out of the dark as to JUST WHY this hasn't come back up. \n\nI do understand there is a bit of confidentiality when it comes to what is in the works for you all, but judging by the amount of posts and complimentary posts and replies on said topics, your player base seems to be getting restless. I, and I feel I can speak for many others,  just want information.\n\nThank you for your hard work, hopefully we will be able to {{summoner:12}} again soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnarticuno","date":"2017-11-22T02:34:45.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cry everytime","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ÑiGhT CrawleR","date":"2017-11-22T10:00:59.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"open transfer tokens please !!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kirijyma","date":"2017-11-21T22:37:02.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 11/21/17 Edit - Due to technical issues, we're unable to turn server transfers back on at this time.

(It's a super old account originally created on NA) Don't want to make a new account because my current has riot points and Blue Essence on it. \n\nHoping this is one of your top priorities as it's putting quite a few people off from playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AquaB0ii","date":"2017-11-21T18:23:41.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is trolling..... everyone has their rewards should be no reason that transfer shouldn't be up right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GettemClone","date":"2017-11-21T13:41:27.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can we pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase transfer servers riot ?","replies":[]}]}
