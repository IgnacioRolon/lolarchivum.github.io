I went downstairs for a while,   but when I came back the downloading should have ended ages ago: but instead the MB goes way past the MB the client was supposed to fully download at. \r\n\r\nI dont really know if I'm making sense at the minute, so I have included a picture along with this. I would really love if someone helped me understand why my client download is doing this.. **Would really love to get back to enjoying league. c:**\r\n\r\nPS - My internet is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T02:04:48.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That usually happens when your network has some kind of a hiccup and it isn't actually downloading 100% correctly anymore.

Fortunately, it finished downloading however now that I have opened the client, for some strange reason I cant press play as its downloading whilst the client is downloading.\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/htsh4k","replies":[]}]}]}
