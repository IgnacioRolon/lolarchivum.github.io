For the last, I&#039;d say, 8/10 ranked games, I&#039;ve won my lane, roamed to helped other lanes, tried to drive team strategy, focused on objectives, and tried to do everything I can to help the team push for a win. The issues is I haven&#039;t been winning, and don&#039;t understand why. It feels like team mates are never cohesive, other lanes always fall behind, and honestly like I&#039;m playing with folks who are fresh level thirties against seasoned vets. Elo hell comes to mind because I&#039;ve heavily tuned my gameplay over the last few months and always do well early/mid. Than, the team has to come together and things fall apart.  \r\n\r\nObviously every loss or bad play isn&#039;t entirely my teams fault; I&#039;m not the perfect LoL player. So I&#039;d like some pointers on how to better control late game since that&#039;s where things tend to fall apart.","replies":[]}
