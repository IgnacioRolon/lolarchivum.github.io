Everything else works on the client but when I go through champ select I cannot connect to the actual game. I get the \"couldn't connect to server retry or cancel\" message and it never connects. My internet isn't the problem and I have gone through the repair twice and nothing has changed. Just wondering what I can do to fix it so I can play a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-28T04:48:05.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I understand you believe this isn't an issue with your network, however, based on the symptoms you've described, it sounds like you're not able to establish a good connection to our game servers. This is generally caused by specific network configurations that conflict with League, so I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure that isn't the case.\n\nLet me know if you continue to experience these issues after you've taken those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"AWESOM O 2000","date":"2017-03-02T02:25:53.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have tried a few of these connection problems out and none of them seem to be the issue. Not sure if the issue is Legends related or an issue on my laptop anymore. I have tried on different wifi and it doesn't work. I have used my old laptop on the same wifi and it works on that laptop just not the new one. This problem occurred after I had already been playing a few games and haven't been able too connect to the game server on my new laptop since. I have also been receiving bug splat errors a few times when I try and connect. After deleting and re downloading Legends I got errors trying to update to the new client and more bug splats. I am not sure what to do from here in order to play on my new laptop.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-02T23:25:41.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I recommend working through that guide in its entirety to ensure there isn't a bad network configuration on your laptop that would cause the issues that you're experiencing. If you're still seeing bugsplats and failure when updating the client afterward, let me know where exactly it's failing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
