Thunderwind Yasuo or Lightingwind Yasuo. Normal Yasuo skin but with a lot of electricity. For example in 1,2 Q parts Yasuo hit te enemy and a big lighting from the sword goes through the enemy/enemies. But best ex. would be at the ult {you know Yasuo hits the enemy 3 times in ult and the third is the one which deals damage} the third hit when the damage applies , a big lighting or thunder to hit the enemy from up and make a big electricity waves around the enemy when it goes down on the ground. Hope you like the idea cuz as i imagined and desined a little bit the skin , would be great. Oh and to be a Legendary one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SillyGiraffe286","date":"2019-06-01T12:24:54.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is fire","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evíl cookie","date":"2019-01-15T16:05:48.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pls no yasuo skins.
