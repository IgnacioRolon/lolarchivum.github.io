I chose to re-login and see if that would make any difference.  \n\nNow when I open the client, it says that it has been reverted to an older version and that it would update (no visual indication that it is doing so).  When I try to login, it says that my password or username combination is incorrect.  I'm sure that it's correct since I was able to login to this website.  I even tried changing my password and try again but it still doesn't work.  \n\nI'm currently uninstalling/reinstalling league.  If this doesn't work, is there a solution to this problem?\n\nUpdate:  Problem solved, just had to uninstall re-install league.  Hope this works for anyone else having this problem!\n\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"The Post Officer","date":"2017-05-19T02:16:59.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing happened to me.
