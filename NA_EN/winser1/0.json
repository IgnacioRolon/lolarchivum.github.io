After looking through other forums, I discovered that I needed to resize the client. Problem is that the settings is not on my screen. I tried moving the client over, but every time I make an attempt, that area of the client disappears. I think this happens because the client is trying to resize itself, but it renders me unable to do anything with my friends list or the settings. Anyone know a solution? I have included a link to a picture of my client. Unfotunately the &quot;add link&quot; option is not working, or I did something wrong, so sorry for no hyperlink.\r\nfile:///C:/Users/Winser&#039;s%20PC/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot%20(1).png","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T01:00:28.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I can't see the picture you tried to link since you just posted the directory rather than a direct image link to an uploaded file. You should be able to resize your client using **CTRL** **+** or **CTRL -** at any time. Give it a go and let me know if it worked for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Winser1","date":"2017-01-24T05:48:48.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Odd enough the day after I posted this, the league client automatically resized itself, but thanks for the help anyways.","replies":[]}]}]}
