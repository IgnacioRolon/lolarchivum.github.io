It sucks.  You can’t go near him.  He will bully you... and that’s it.  He falls off a cliff.  Same with J4 or Gnar Mid.  The hard part is psychologically accepting that this lane will be boring if played perfectly and punishing if ever misplayed.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n1) Stand outside his Q range unless he’s just used it or is busy.\n2) Push the wave with basic attacks and abilities, forcing him to use Q on the wave.\n3) Poke him or shove extra hard while he’s trying to keep the wave under control.\n4) Let the wave bounce back and then just sit outside turret cs’ing.  Give up some last hits to avoid Q poke.\n\nJust don’t let him get that first kill.  Your mental will boom because you lost to a rock, and he will know better how to handle 1/0 Malphite than you will.
