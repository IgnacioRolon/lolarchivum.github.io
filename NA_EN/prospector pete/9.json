The thing is, champions don&#039;t _need_ to be aggravating to play against in order to introduce new mechanics to the game. Take Bard for example. Bard is an incredibly unique champion that introduces a new and interesting mechanic with each and every one of his abilities. However, unlike champions like Yasuo or Zoe, Bard is fun to play against for the enemy as well. Bard has clear counterplay in many of his abilities and he also doesn&#039;t get a safety net - if he screws up it can actually cost him or his team greatly.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts on the subject. I&#039;ve always like Bard due to how he&#039;s unique and fun to play against at the same time, something that unfortunately CertainlyT&#039;s champions haven&#039;t achieved.","replies":[{"poster":"rayzo","date":"2018-07-27T16:49:02.645+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard is CertainlyNotT","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-07-27T17:39:52.679+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed, he is a good example.\nLike his tunnels, which let everyone in his team get through walls, which is a new mechanic. But **enemies** can use the tunnel, too, so the new mechanic doesn't just benefit him, but the enemy team (even if obviously less than his own team).\n\nMeanwhile CertainlyT, if he adds a new mechanic, then it is absolutely onesided for the advantage of the new champion. Like Zoe, who can use your summoner spells against yourself, so not just is she using summoner spells more frequently than anyone else, she actually **weakens** the enemy use of summoners because she can turn them against them.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-07-28T00:51:26.723+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly, the difference between Bard and CT's champions is that Bard's design knows how to share. Meanwhile, champions like Zoe, Yasuo, Kalista, even Thresh innovate in a way that not only exclusively benefits the player playing them, but strips others of agency as well, including their own teammates at times. It's an incredibly selfish design that tries to maximize the enjoyment of one single player (and thereby likely sales and play rates of those champions), to the detriment of everyone else. This is also why I dislike the whole argument that \"Yasuo is one of the most popular champions in the game\", or \"CT makes champions so fun to play\", because those arguments focus on just one side of the entire picture, whereas champions like Bard are fun to play, play with _and_ play against.\n\nI think the core of any champion design in League is that they should aim to maximize positive gameplay on three fronts: for the player (i.e. gameplay), for the player's opponents (i.e. counterplay), and for the player's allies (i.e. teamplay). In this respect, Bard is probably the gold standard for this, because he feels great at all three. He's proof that counterplay can be _fun_, not just bearable or within some arbitrarily acceptable level of frustration, and that a kit can be fun, and quite powerful too, without that fun automatically incurring a cost to the fun of others (which is an argument many Rioters have pulled out to justify unhealthy designs).\n\nAs a side note, I also think two-sided effects are phenomenal design that deserves to be used a lot more, especially on support kits. The problem with so many enchanters right now is that most of their gameplay boils down to pressing a button and applying pure power directly onto their allies. This is fine in small doses, but when practically an entire champion's kit boils down to this (e.g. Lulu), that champion becomes boring for many to play, and not particularly interactive. By contrast, if some (and some, not all) enchanter abilities applied the same effect to allies and enemies, perhaps via a kiss/curse effect that carries both an advantage and a disadvantage (e.g. Bard's ult), or some purely beneficial effect that both allies and enemies could access, they could afford to have much more power, and much more interesting mechanics, while also providing more interactivity. Lulu in particular I think could be a beneficiary of this, as she's supposed to be this unpredictable, mischievous fairy yordle, yet has a _very_ predictable ability set, one that applies very reliable effects that do something different, and very one-sided, to allies or enemies.\n\nWith this in mind, and going back to CT's champions, I feel applying the above kind of philosophy to at least some of his champions could perhaps make them feel a bit better to deal with:\n\n* If Kalista's ult signaled to her Oathsworn that it was ready, and that they could activate it, or if the Oathsworn themselves were given the ult entirely (e.g. by clicking an icon above themselves or Kalista, or their Oathsworn tether), it'd give much more agency to Kalista's ally. In general, her kit could use a redo where its Oathsworn effects truly add gameplay to her ally, and not just herself (e.g. her Oathsworn could add spears on each attack, she could have some effect that'd give them some of her mobility, etc.).\n* Thresh is in a more okay spot than the rest, counterplay-wise, but if his lantern could be picked up by _any_ champion, including enemies, that would make for much clearer counterplay than just sitting on the lantern to block its retrieval, and could genuinely give his opponents options to punish him (it'd also give him the option to trick and bait opponents as well, so it'd work better for everyone). In exchange, this could probably allow him to have some more power, e.g. a shorter base cooldown on his hook instead of its CDR on impact.\n* This philosophy probably won't apply to Yasuo, because the champion is extremely selfish by design and doesn't really extend any opportunities for gameplay to anyone else, so much as make everything all about himself. He'd likely need other changes instead.\n* If Zoe's E rendered targets immune to damage and CC until the bubble popped, and for a short moment after, instead of causing them to take amplified damage, she'd lose one of the unhealthiest parts of her gameplay, as her E would no longer be a guaranteed death sentence with her Q. Similarly, if her Q were visible at all times to all, even through Fog of War, people would be able to play against her artillery-ranged Q one-shots, since they wouldn't be coming from out of nowhere. In exchange, she could gain some _big_ buffs, namely to her Q damage. This wouldn't make her entirely healthy, because her passive and W are still a thing, but that's likely something only a full rework may be able to address.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-27T17:39:12.373+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say Bard is FUN to play against as he can be quite annoying, but I believe he is balanced and a health champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2018-07-27T23:39:25.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally every champion is annoying to play against if they're able to do what they were intended to do.

I don't find him SUPER useful as a pick in soloQ (your E isn't really considered) and he doesn't have any great matchups that make him a counterpick so he's a little meh for me to play, too. Comparatively I'll have way more fun games on Thresh, probably because all of his spells are interactive- and using Bard tunnels gets a little old. Landing a 'THIS BARD!!' ulti tho... especially with a team on voicecoms, makes up a good part for it tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2018-07-28T02:05:17.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard's one of the biggest victim's of damage creep in the game tbh. One auto + Q procs electrocute, and deals around 50-60% of an enemy adc's health at level 1, which is kind of absurd. As a dedicated Bard main, I'd love for them to tone down some of his early game damage and look at giving him buffs to his other aspects.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2018-07-27T15:29:06.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"If all people cared about was counterplay we wouldn't have many complaints at all. Bard doesn't do much by himself due to his support nature and only having 2 spells that can even effect enemies involuntarily. His heal is cool but really there isn't much to do when he sets them under his tower or just point and clicks it. When bard hits me with anything I don't go oh fuck I am dead I think damn I hope bards team isn't there to actually make this matter. Where as most of the champions we complain about from CertainlyT are made to be relevant on their own except for thresh and even them most of the big hitters that those champions have come with the same counterplay bard has dodge the skillshot. Even in yasuo's case if his ally lets you ult him it's almost the same as bard utling you and his ally killing you off of it. Another champion had to help you do something which adds a nice teamplay element. Off the top of my head Kalista, Yasuo, Zoe, and thresh all have elements that your teammates can or in kalista's case are forced to contribute to your champion.\n\n Counterplay isn't the problem it's their power in general when you actually know what you are doing as outside of their auto attacks you can dodge most of what they do the numbers on their kits are the balance teams problem though not the champ design teams.","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2018-07-28T02:00:21.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This man has clearly never met a fed Bard.","replies":[]}]}]}
