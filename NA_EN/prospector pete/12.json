And I still had almost 17k IP left to buy champs.  If I had chosen to play support champs with either the AD or AP rune setup (which isn't uncommon), I would have had another 6k IP for champs and would have only needed 2 rune pages total.\n\nThere are 12 450 IP champs, and 8 of them are picked in more than 6% of games, with 5 of them picked in more than 10% of games.  With 17k IP, you could get Annie, Garen, Yi, Sivir and Ashe and then get 10 1350 champs.  You can even get Tristana and Alistar for free (well, Garen as well).  If you don't want to give away access to personal information on Facebook/Youtube/Twitter, you could create a throw-away account on those platforms just to get those free champs.\n\nWant a couple of 6300 IP champs?  You probably won't have enough IP to have 16 champs for ranked by level 30.  But you would only need another 7k IP or so after hitting 30 if you got 2 6300s, 8 of the 450s, and 6 of the 1350s.\n\nCan you get 16 6300 champs by the time you hit 30 without spending any money on RP?  No.\n\nI'm not sure what you personally consider an \"average\" champion pool.  If you mean a champion pool comparable to the average player, then the answer is you're not expected to have that by level 30.  And it's unreasonable for a new player to expect to have the same champion pool as an average player by the time they first hit level 30.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-09-07T21:53:58.128+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":11,"body":"it is called spending money.","replies":[{"poster":"Prospector Pete","date":"2015-09-07T21:54:42.683+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't buy runes with RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Bergk","date":"2015-09-08T06:22:07.612+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"there is a reason you can buy IP boosts, no point in spending RP to get IP other than runes.

Hence, I prioritize champions. The game can be played decently well with only the two beginner rune pages and generalized runes but a lot of champions and roles will be poorly optimized. Runes aren't necessary, but they are preferred. \n\nA large champion pool, on the other hand, is almost required for ranked. If the enemy picks something that's good against every champion you own for that role, then you're basically screwed unless you play something off-meta. There are also times when you get forced into a role that you don't play and therefore don't have champions for. Having a bigger pool just provides many more options than having more rune choices. I can't really justify spending IP on runes and pages given their absurd costs.\n\nNone of that really has anything to do with my post though. My main point was that \"endgame content\" shouldn't take four years to achieve, and that's being generous with the numbers. [One of the estimations for ALL of the content is 7+ years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2gof61/about_the_ip_system_how_long_does_it_take_to/) \n\nTo respond to **Bergk** again... Riot isn't Blizzard, and League isn't World of Warcraft. Just because Blizzard runs World of Warcraft a certain way doesn't mean Riot has to run League the same way. Saying that League shouldn't be any different is just ignorant.
