God forbid that marksmen can&#x27;t invalidate entire classes that people have been maining for years anymore.\n\n1. I never told other players to just adapt when their picks were bad. I've never seen the word \"adapt\" thrown around from anyone before the nerfs to ADC which means the only people saying it now are top and mid mains who have no idea how bad the champions in this class are and have no idea how vastly different the playstyles these champions have are from every other champion in the game. In fact, when jungle got nerfed into the state it was, no one told junglers to adapt and stop whining; everyone was upset for junglers. Maybe everyone should get over the dumbass double standard. \n2. Marksmen have not dominated the game. They have the least agency over their own games and the three roles that have the biggest impact, at the end of the day, are jungle, mid, and support. This has always been true but its particularly bad for the last few seasons. A fed marksmen literally means nothing if their team are a bunch of apes who pick bad fights. They can't solo push; they're weak and squishy so they fall prey to everything else in the game so they're literally at the mercy of whether their support is smart enough and good enough to keep them alive. They dont get to solo carry like other roles; too many games have I left bot lane 5/0 but the rest of the map had already inted 20 kills and the strength of the bruiser top or the mage mid or the assassin jungler on the enemy team matters a million times more than my own strength. Its demoralizing and extremely frustrating and obviously not my fault that the enemy mid is two levels higher than me and can one shot me with the same amount of items and gold. Marksmen have always had next to zero solo carry potential and are so dependent on how skillful their support is its painful. How many games have I lost bot because my support can't land skillshots or dodge a hook and is 0/3 before I'm even level 6? And then it turns around and is my fault somehow that the enemy ADC has a full item and I have only half of one, despite 0 deaths and the same number of farm. How many lanes have I lost because the jungler tucked up a gank or chose a terrible time to come? Or how many times has there been four people in my lane and even if I don't die, it doesn't matter because they just got first turret and the rest of the team is just jacking off?\n3. Marksmen have always been a staple of the game and have always been bot but so have mages, assassins, and bruisers, just with every single other position in the game. People still played mages to great success in Assassin metas, bruisers were still decent picks in tank metas, and assassins have always had a niche as well. And all of these classes have had multiple positions and places by which they could actually go. Mages could go mid and top, assassins and bruisers could go jungle, mid, *and* top. Marksmen, however, weren't ever allowed to go anywhere beyond bot. Yet everyone is crying for diversity diversity diversity while shoving marksmen out of the one position they've been balanced for. And riot is literally making no moves this season to rebalance marksmen so that they could go to solo lanes and play somewhere else. So apparently diversity only matters for bruisers, mages, and assassins. Marksmen aren't allowed to wish for equal lane diversity. Instead they have to sit bot and keep relying on their team. \n4. Marksmen have never invalidated any class in the game.That would imply that they were ever on equal footing with any of the other classes or that they were ever allowed to other lanes. Marksmen have never prevented people from being able to play assassins, mages, and bruisers. Assassins have invalidated mages but no one talks about that. And bruisers have invalidated tanks but no, that's not worth talking about either. Marksmen have never invalidated any other role; instead, I'd hazard that they have been the ones completely invalidated by this asinine and lazy patch from riot. \n5. Even if any of your points were ever true, they dont make the fact that marksmen are garbage now okay. You openly admit that they were over nerfed and that isn't okay, no matter what bullshit circle jerking you made up in your head might tell you. It is never okay to alienate groups of people from a game or social event just because you have some personal, unsupported prejudice against them. Marksmen are garbage and its not acceptable that riot has done this to them nor that they have 0 intention of fixing them nor that they seem to have no intention of opening up lane diversity for these champions or providing them with any form of ability to solo carry like all of the other champions in this game. This is all unacceptable and screams intense laziness on the part of the balance team.\n\n\nIn short, its intense bullshit what they've done to the class and playstyle of champions I enjoy and if I'm opting not to play because I'm unsatsified as a customer then that's my prerogative. I did, afterall, spend money on this game and have every right to expect the devs to make it enjoyable for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ceazaru","date":"2018-06-17T23:01:39.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OtterlyLost,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dgNgV3Ah,comment-id=000000040000,timestamp=2018-06-17T22:10:34.628+0000)\n>\n\n> 4.

Marksmen were literally mandatory to play in bot lane because literally every other class couldn't compete. Now that there is more bot diversity marksmen mains don't like the game. No, you guys like going against the same thing and building the same thing all season that's why you guys are now in full panic mode because now you finally have to learn how to play against other classes than just marksmen. Every lane has had other than bot has had to deal with multiple classes being able to play in their lane. Top lane has tanks, bruiser,mages,assassins and even some marksmen. Jungle has Tanks, assassins and bruisers. Mid lane has Assassins, Mages and even some marksmen. What has been able to be played bot until now? nothing but marksmen. Marksmen forced every other class out of bot lane because they couldn't compete with the safe poke, consistent damage and scaling of marksmen.","replies":[{"poster":"OmegaNITRO","date":"2018-06-18T12:18:52.710+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason most other champs didn't go bot before was because most other classes value experience more, gold less, and do not need a lane partner to survive being engaged on. \n\nSo it actually made no sense for them to sacrifice solo exp for a support.\n\nThe other champs were not weaker laners than marksmen, marksmen did better with sacrificing level advantage for item advantage, and worked optimally with a support that could help them sustain and zone their lane.\n\nThat style isn't optimal for other classes.\n\nThe reason those other classes are in a lane that doesn't suit them NOW is because even with less exp and an enemy support they still shit on marksmen and can power spike and end the game before marksmen can do anything about it.\n\nIf other classes couldn't compete with marksmen in lane, marksmen would be good in solo lanes.

Why do they need to own bot lane as well when they already own top, mid, and jungle and even sometimes support? In what universe is it okay for people who dont even play bot lane to decide what should be viable in it? Clearly there are players who play marksmen who dont want diversity, who are happy playing just marksmen bot lane. This is supported by the fact the role overall is just played less and more people are getting autofilled into it. Bot lane players are abandoning it in droves.

The only enjoyable thing about marksmen was eventually getting to teamfights where your major DPS would make you feel amazing and you'd finally feel impactful.

Do you remember that literally when adc were able to 2 shot squisies and melt tankier champs at 2 items. What this sounds like to me is that adcs are extremely oppressive when strong and “trash” when they finally get nerfed. Sounds like a class rework is needed to me. maybe it’s a bad thing to have a class that out scales everything and has unavoidable damage because it’s primarily through ranged auto attacks or point and click abilities and no other classes do not out scale marksmen they just power spike sooner a lot of these bruisers, Assassins and mages are at their peak strength during the mid game but marksmen totally out scale them in the late game. So essentially it’s the same as every season before season 8 when you had to stall the game till the marksman was fed enough to be effective only difference now is that they have to deal the classes that power spike before them. To that I say it’s about time marksman learn how to play around the other classes just like every other role other than marksman/support has had to do for years because no other lane was class exclusive. \n\nYes this was copied and pasted because I saw a similar argument from another person who I replied to.","replies":[{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2018-06-19T12:54:11.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ceazaru,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dgNgV3Ah,comment-id=00000004000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-19T11:30:40.184+0000)\n>\n> So basically your argument is essentially the same argument that every other class has had when talking about marksman this season.

To that I say it’s about time marksman learn how to play around the other classes just like every other role other than marksman/support has had to do for years because no other lane was class exclusive. \n> \n> Yes this was copied and pasted because I saw a similar argument from another person who I replied to.\n\nNo, my argument is essentially that Marksmen are the weakest late game carries with the least possible solo carry potential in the game and in order to feel impactful, need already several factors outside of their control making the current shit powerspike feel terrible. You'd know that if you'd read and responded to my post specifically instead of just assuming everything I had to say was the exact same as someone else's.\n\nWhat the boards likes to ignore and fails to realize is that right now, in these games, 20 minutes is considered late game. This is supported by *other late game carries* such as *Jax, Yi, Irelia, and Fiora* getting their power spikes at *1 to 2 items*. It baffles me that the boards thinks its fair for these right clicking late game carries to be strong at 1 to 2 items while getting to 1 shot squishies and melting tanks but not for ADCs who are more team reliant, squishier, and give up far more for their power than these other carries. \n\nADCs are full damage, glass cannon champions; they don't have the luxury of sacrificing their damage for tankiness and anytime they find a way around this particular weakness, Riot guts it and forces them back to a full build of squishy items. Any class of champions that gives up their own safety and well being to build full damage should be doing substantial damage at the relative late game stage(which is, again, 20 minutes right now; games aren't lasting to 30-35 minutes anymore). And even then, I have never seen an ADC 2 shot a squishy with just AA's unless it was extremely late game and they were full build or if they were extremely fed and had a full item or two over said Squishy. In both cases, I don't see an issue; they have earned the right to do the damage they're doing and it makes perfect sense *for* them to be doing the damage they're doing.\n\nAnd, as my post said, they literally give up all of their agency and all of their control over the game for their builds. An ADC can be fed but it won't matter in teamfights if their team isn't doing things to keep them alive. Even an 0/5 Assassin can 1v1 an ADC if the Assassin has at least one completed item. Or they can't do anything if their team is too far behind and can't stand up to the enemy team. They can be kiting beasts, they can orbwalk perfectly, and position perfectly and keep their CS up to an LCS standard and even not die themselves in teamfights while putting out as much DPS as possible but at the end of the day, that won't matter if their team is too far behind and dies every teamfight. Because as a class, unless the enemy majorly screws up, they can't solo fight. \n\nAnd also, there's that fucking argument; just ADAPT. No. That's a bullshit argument and the board knows it. Especially since none of them can answer why Mages/Assassins/Tanks/Fighters should be allowed to go bot lane when ADCs aren't allowed to go to other lanes and be solo laners. Why should ADCs *have* to share the one lane that they're allowed to go into? Every other class literally owns the rest of the map and ADCs have this one goddamn corner that is theirs because Riot can't get off their lazy ass and give *them* lane diversity. \n\n\"Adapting\" is what top laners should have had to do the few times there were ADC's going top lane; yet they didn't and they still, to this day, come onto this board and whine about the one time they got \"oppressed\" by a Vayne top without even mentioning that they probably still won the game by tower diving her over and over again. \n\nWhy does no one have to \"adapt\" for crit ADCs but crit ADCs are magically intended to adapt for everyone else? Get that nonsense out of here and, honestly, until Riot \"adapts\" the marksmen class for solo lanes, get your Mages/Tanks/Assassins/Fighters out of bot lane. Because no, that's the *only* lane that many marksmen can go to; they shouldn't have to share it with every other champion under the sun just because every other champion under the sun isn't satisfied enough with having Top, Mid, and Jungle.\n\n\"Diversity\" my ass. Its \"diversity\" when Crit Marksmen aren't the only class that have just one lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Ceazaru","date":"2018-06-19T19:13:04.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OtterlyLost,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dgNgV3Ah,comment-id=000000040000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-19T12:54:11.415+0000)\n>\n> No, my argument is essentially that Marksmen are the weakest late game carries with the least possible solo carry potential in the game and in order to feel impactful, need already several factors outside of their control making the current shit powerspike feel terrible.

Fighters were uselesss didn't have a keystone for months until conqueror came out. It's like marks men needed to build defenses because all you guys need was a Janna, Lulu, Karma etc to click on you and place a giant shield on you when an assassins engaged on them. Mages and assassins have been getting blown up by marksmen for months with no way of countering it. You complain about getting one shot by an assassin/mage/fighter combo let me tell you these classes have to take risk to even think about doing their damage, Fighters have to deal with diving into the middle of the enemy team with no real great way of escaping and if you getting cc'ed to death, Assassins are squishy burst damage dealers who have to get in and get out fast or they just die. Mages are completely useless if they can't land all their skill shits and abilities. What risk do marksmen take? oh right the risk of having to nothing but stand behind 2 or more tanks who cc anything that tries to kill you and a shield the nullifies your weaknesses and any damage done to you so you can just stand still and 2 shot anything that moves. That's some really high risk game play, yeah no. I find it funny that you just admitted that you don't like champ diversity and having to adapt meta changes or new champs. You just like same boring meta that we've had for 3+ seasons where you can just pick {{champion:51}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:15}} etc and do nothing but farm for 30+min then just be able to kill anything effortlessly while standing behind some tanks and an shield support while having the entire game decided by you because everyone else has no choice but to pick some that can protect the adc. I know tough it's having to deal with the fact that you aren't needed to even have a chance at winning anymore. Your going to have to get used to it because no other subclass has been mandatory to have a chance accept marksmen and if you refuse will then go ahead quit it's not our or riots fault that you can diversify your play style and can only play one type of champ while everyone else has to rotate their champs because they become viable and nonviable with every change.

Riot doesn&#x27;t have build their game to accommodate for entitled crit marksmen mains who thinks their champs should always be meta because they have been for 7 seasons.\n\nYou have reading comprehension problems. But before I address that, I will address your statement that fighters were \"useless\" for the for months, which is bullshit. They didn't have a keystone but they still saw plenty of play. I saw Jax, Yi, Yasuo, Fiora, GP, and J4 very regularly; the fact that they just moved from top lane to the jungle is irrelevant in the face of they were played and still viable. There was also Kled, Gnar, Kayn, Olaf, Rengar, Warwick, Wukong, Lee Sin, Camille; they were all viable and played regularly and they are all listed under the \"fighter\" classification. So clearly, they weren't as useless as you seem to believe. I agree that they did go months without a good keystone but now they have one of the best keystones in the game and they're the only class that can affectively make use of it. :/ And as a result of this keystone, they have completely neutered tanks and made the class nonexistent in either top lane *or* jungle. \n\nAs for mages and assassins getting blown up for months, that's also BS as I pointed out in my previous post that if an ADC was \"blowing\" anyone up, it was because they were ridiculously fed and had a full item or two over the individual getting blown up or they were late game and full build; in either case, they have earned the right to be blowing up champions. You can't expect a class that *literally* can only build full damage to not randomly do damage to a group of champions just because they're squishy. Why shouldn't they be doing lots of damage if their entire build is *full damage*. Assassins can buy into health, have extreme mobility, and have items that give them resistances; they should, by all rights, lose some damage for getting to be marginally tankier. Mages get a lot of health and have access to some of the best defensive items in the game(Zhonya's and Banshees?); they should also lose some damage for getting over all more utility than either Assassins or Marksmen get and also having access to more CDR and defensive options. \n\nAnd Assassins and Fighters taking risks to get their target is literally their own draw back and they usually either get tankier or have some kind of durability spell in their kit(fighters) or have extreme mobility and burst damage(assassins) that greatly reduces these \"risks.\" Just to name a few examples: Irelia has a damage reduction in her kit and extreme mobility. Yi has his Alpha Strike that lets him become invulnerable and an ult that prevents him from being slowed in either MS or AS. WW has a damage reduction ability that transitions into a fear so he not only takes less damage when he dives but he also CC's people after that period of damage reduction is gone. Kled has a second health bar that after a certain amount of time fighting will reappear and give him a huge heal. Gnar can stack up his rage and mega gnar out for a huge boon of health and resists. Fiora has extreme mobility, in built heals, an ultimate that AoE heals, and a reposte that blocks CC and damage coming in. GP doesn't even *have* to dive; he can stack up barrels and do massive amounts of damage from a range that I feel is longer than most ADC's and he has a free cleanse and heal with his orange.\n\nNeed I go on? The risks that fighters take when they dive is honestly pretty goddamn minimal if they're not diving stupidly and they haven't fed their ass off the entirety of the game. Or if they're Irelia. Because Irelia can feed and then turn around and pop off.\n\nAs far as what risks do marksmen have to take, just being in the fight at all is a risk. Have you ever looked at the range of most champions dashes? Most champions have a dash range longer than ADC's AA range. If they don't position perfectly in a fight, they will literally get jumped on and blown up because they don't get all these nice resistances or health items that other classes get. Tristana at level 18 has the longest AA range in the game at 661. That's *only* at level 18 and this is in a meta and game where going past 20 minutes is rare; she usually finishes games at level 13 to 15, which means her range maxes out most games at 645.\n\nThat is tiny compared to some of the dash ranges that certain bruisers or assassins have access to. Diana isn't a great example as she is in a terrible spot but even with her awful position in the meta, her ultimate has a range of 825. At Rank 1. Her Q has a range of 900. She literally can land a random Q on a Tristana at the back of her team, Dash, and then dash again when Tristana tries to jump away. Or even interrupt said jump midair with her own E and the dash a second time if Tristana tries to flash or ult her away. And this is with Tristana at the back of her team behind those two currently nonexistent tanks(because really? no one is playing tanks right now). And if this Diana isn't grossly behind, she's likely going to kill the Tristana before the tanks or the support will be able to do anything.\n\nAnd this isn't just Diana. *ALL* of the biggest and strongest fighters currently have extreme mobility and reach with their dashes. Irelia's Q is 625, Jax's 700, Yi's is 600, Zed's 650... \n\nSo yes, I don't know what risk Marksmen would ever have with so many champions with dashes that literally out range their AA's as champions who generally have no escapes and are extremely squishy without rushable defensive items. \n\nNow finally to your extreme lack of reading comprehension. I never said I didn't like diversity or that I hated it. I did, however, say I hated *fake* diversity. And that's what this current meta is. Its *fake* diversity. Its not any champion going to any position they want. Its Marksmen going bot lane while bruisers/mages/assassins/tanks get to go any position they want. I admitted to feeling like Riot was fucking lazy as shit with 8.11 and instead of making it one big patch where they rebalanced lots of champions to open up lane and positional diversity for ALL champions, marksmen included, they just murdered the marksmen class all together and still expected them to go bot lane.\n\nExpecting me to adapt and be okay with this is like expect me to be okay with the military coming in, breaking my legs, and then giving my house to some random strangers with no promise appropriate health care or even to find me a new house. No one would be okay with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Ceazaru","date":"2018-06-20T17:42:17.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OtterlyLost,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dgNgV3Ah,comment-id=00000004000000000001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-20T03:07:34.409+0000)\n>\n> You have reading comprehension problems.

All I know is the only people who seem to hate this new meta is marksmen mains who never took the time to diversify their play style and did nothing accept one trick the same 5 champs that do basically the same thing and I get it. You never took the time to learn anything else because in these past 8 years your champs were the most powerful champs and in the game and if not thet were still a very good/reliable pick. Now that you deal what every other player has had to deal for years. which is learning how to play something new top laners have never had the luxury of playing whatever they wanted all the time even though top lane has the highest champion diversity in game. Yes top lane is primarily fighters and tanks but even some assassins,mages and marksmen( {{champion:133}} {{champion:17}} ) can go up there. There we're times when tanks just destroyed fighters. Hell divers type fighters were weak at times and what are going to say to Juggernaut mains their champs accept maybe Darius who hasn't been that until recently with the addition of conqueror have been trash since they were nerfed after the jugg rework/updates back in season 5 so they had to learn how to play other champs who were better. Jungle is a never ending rotation tanks, fighters, assassins and even some marksmen ( {{champion:104}} and {{champion:29}} ). Mid lane is constantly rotating between Assassins and Mages hell maybe one marksmen in{{champion:81}} can go mid. Why does bot lane have to the only lane where only one subclass can go while every other lane has champions from every class that can go there and be effective. Yes riot can probably give marksmen a small buff where they can healthy enough to spike quicker but there is no justification for the subclass of marksmen who have historically been the late game carry to be able to out due all the other subclasses who are supposed to be strong or spike in the early early or mid game. marksmen should only spike during the mid to late game like they always have. The only bad in that is that riot seems to keep making games shorter and shorter and i will agree that it doesn't give marksmen enough time to hit their spike and that riot should work extending the game times but to do that they'll have to buff turrent durability  to where they were back in season 5-6 which i think they should. If riot can extend game times and maybe help marksmen out a bit without killing the current bot lane diversity then we could have a perfect meta where almost every class of champ can be effective and an environment that will  allow players more creativity with team build by allowing non marksmen comps and marksmen comps compete on almost an equal play field.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Triumphant Mind","date":"2018-06-18T00:24:32.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ceazaru,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dgNgV3Ah,comment-id=0000000400000000,timestamp=2018-06-17T23:01:39.450+0000)\n>\n> Oh really then tell me why have marksmen until now made every other classes nonviable in the bot lane.

The entirety of 8.11 was half assed and lazy on the part of riot. Sure they're buffing some of them now but honestly  the changes aren't worthwhile or good. They're actively making tristana's early game even worse by nerfing her E's base power and changing the scaling on it. This does literally nothing to help her as a champion. And they didn't even address the problem of two zeal items being a waste of 1200 gold with IE because for some reason they didn't change all zeal items crit chance to an even 25% and instead left them at 30. :/ they flatly dont care about ADCs.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-06-19T17:11:53.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I kinda feel bad for enjoying the chaos of the new \"meta.\"","replies":[{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2018-06-19T17:20:04.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IcyPepper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dgNgV3Ah,comment-id=00000004000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-19T17:11:53.441+0000)\n>\n> Now I kinda feel bad for enjoying the chaos of the new &quot;meta.&quot;\n\nBah I dont fault anyone for enjoying it; if you actually like playing all of the other champions bot, kudos. I just hate how the boards expects everyone to like playing all of the new champions when there are people who just like to play marksmen and want to play have them still be viable options. Like I really personally dont mind the new match ups. What I mind is that I can only play bot lane with the champs I enjoy and the new match ups just inherently shit on the champs I enjoy making them unenjoyable to play. It's nothing new or enjoyable for me either; I dont get to take tristana mid now instead. Or play Ashe top. I just... sorta get to sit bot and get dumped on by bruisers and mages who spike earlier and have base stats intended for solo laners.

This whole idea of \"adapt\" is literally just \"play a completely different set of champions you may not have otherwise touched because it's meta.\" Granted, I beat a Camille/J4 botlane as Lucian this patch, but someone telling me pre game to play Renekton (who I've really only played in ARAM) is not adapting; it's a full on change. And when I go 0/20 on someone I don't play in your ranked promos, I don't want to see your flame.
