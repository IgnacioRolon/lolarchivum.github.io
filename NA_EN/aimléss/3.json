realize there's offensive and defensive tanks,yes,Ornn can deal a lot of damage in a teamfight while throwing CC everywhere,but he can't do what Shen does,he cant give your team mate a shield and teleport to him from anywhere on the map,he cant taunt that enemy to attack him and then block his attacks.\n\n Its the same with ADCs,they are at their BEST late game when they have six items due to how crit scales with other items,but that doesn't mean they should automatically be weak and useless early,i mean they still have a lot of disadvantages even late game,building full damage makes them the squishiest champ on the team,having no inbuilt resistances or shields (except Kaisa ) also doesn't help,along with the fact that they usually have some soft CC or no CC at all and that means that they are trading quite a few things for that damage and usually means they have to be protected in order to be useful,i think that's enough of a trade off,no need to make them useless until 70 minutes into the game.\n\nNot to mention how many people argue that they shouldn't be mobile,shouldn't be able to 1v1,should instadie to anyone who catches them,shouldn't have access to lifesteal,and finally shouldn't have crit,it should be deleted,if this looks extreme to you then you're normal,cause i'm not making this up,i've seen a lot of people request a lot of these things and get up voted. \nIts like they don't understand that a class of over 20 champs needs diversity,not every ADC should look and play exactly like Kog Maw,a turret adc that needs to be protected by 4 people in order not to die and deal damage,some are duelist,some are artillery mage/adc hybrids,some are even assassin hybrids,some are AD casters etc.\nEvery one of them has a distinct advantage/disadvantage,i mean Vayne has a good 1v1 and mobility but if your team protects your ADC perfectly then i see no reason to pick her over Varus that can also root an entire enemy team basically while also poking and bursting down people with his abilities and making picks with his ult","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-05-10T21:35:54.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I honestly think its a

that seemingly implies that all champs in the role are the same and anything that breaks past the norm of say a tank being able to soak damage and CC is OP or overloaded.\n\nI´d personally find this game quite boring if all champs in a class were essentially the same but with different themes and nothing more x)\n\n\nAnd while on the topic of role diversity, some  marksmen actually prefer the early or even the midgame over the lategame, but that does of course not mean that their late is weak, its just not as good as the truly dedicated ones like kog.\n\nIf they snowball it will still feel like a lategame champ got ridiculously powerful even early, Lucian is a perfect example of this.\n\n\nAnd while i do find it annoying that some people seem to think that things like Ashe≈MF≈kog≈vayne etc i still think that there needs to be a basic floor at times......for otherwise the disparity in performance will just be too great.\n\nFor instance, there is basically no comparing a MF vs a Varus/kog in terms of tank killing ability even at 3-4 items.\n\nKog/varus will melt the tank in about 7 seconds, MF will at need anywhere between 30-50 seconds to do the same if they dont facetank her entire ulti.\n\nAshe would at 3-4 items need about 20-40 seconds depending on which tank.\n\n\nSuch large gaps in performance are also in a way harmful when looking for diverse picks.....but at the same time that difference is also what makes those picks diverse in the first place.\n\n\nDiversity is a difficult thing at times i think
