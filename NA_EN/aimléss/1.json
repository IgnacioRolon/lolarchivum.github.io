I&#039;m G4 atm, and just played with a terrible Zed player yesterday who went 4-13-1, as disgusted as I was, I decided to look him up and he was G5, with over 500 ranked games played so he wasn&#039;t just placed there. I looked at his KDA&#039;s and they were abysmal. Each of his top 4 most played champions had KDAs between 1.4 and 1.6. Just Horrible, yet somehow he still climbed his way to gold. Even sadder, he had a KDA of 5-7-5 on Jinx, while mine is like 7-5-8 yet he actually had a higher win % with over 50 games played on her. I know KDA isn&#039;t everything, but how do you have a 53% winrate on a champion with a 1.5 kda?That means you&#039;re getting carried nearly every single game (And rarely are you ever the SOLE REASON FOR THE WIN). I&#039;d understand if he was one of those players who dies a lot but gets kills so he still carries with a lot of deaths but just has a bad KDA, but he plays like trash most games and has been constantly carried till he got gold. \r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t want to believe it, but it&#039;s true, luck plays a bigger factor in this game than we thought. Challenger, Master, and Diamond players most likely belong where they are, but by this logic a lucky low-gold level player can squeeze into plat or a lucky low silver, (or maybe even  high bronze) level player can squeeze into gold because he gets good teammates 60% of the time, while someone who&#039;s actually good is trapped in silver with bad teammates because he gets good teams only 40% of the time. So if you&#039;re a gold or plat player who may struggle more often than not in games, but still try to tell yourself that you belong there and are better than those below you, think again, you&#039;re probably just a lucky bastard lol, stealing the good teammates away from someone who actually deserves your rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2017-03-01T16:47:21.066+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Games like that aren't bad luck, they're your failure to win faster than your teammate loses.","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2017-03-01T17:00:01.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a good one!\n\"You just need to win faster than your teammates lose\"\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2017-03-01T18:34:08.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's true though. I realized this watching my own replays - every game where I felt my teammate fed too hard for me to do anything, I was able to identify multiple opportunities to secure my own early advantage that I either messed up or didn't see while I was playing. If I acknowledge that I missed my own opportunities to win, I can't blame my team for losing.\n\nA lot of people seem to think as long as they weren't doing the worst, they're entitled to win. That's not how life works.

There's games where I got fed AF but didn't really felt I was being skilled, rather just lucky in situations. Meanwhile some other times I feel im playing to my best and my score doesnt reflect that.\n\nLots of times Ive got most damage without having most kills (by far).\n\nYou do have bronze mentality if you think too much about your KD ratio.\n\nThe more ranked games you have the less luck is a factor, mathematically you cant always have good or bad teammates. \n\nMost of the time when I see someone getting a great game, S rate, they act super cocky as if they were cut off from a different branch. Sometimes i check their match history to ease my soul and see that 0/7 somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Aimléss","date":"2017-03-01T16:50:40.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played with this Zed, and he was not very good at all. KDA is not that huge of a deal, but when it is as bad as his, he's doing something wrong. He is practically a non factor on his team most games. His deaths are usually around 7, thats not even that high its just the fact that he has almost no Kill participation on carry champions. He's not a top laner, it doesn't make sense how he's winning on carries without carrying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2017-03-01T15:58:31.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe he is queing up with someone and getting carried. In any day I will say how many wins i get is luck as much as it is my preformance. Like carrying {{champion:21}}  with less dmg than your support with a essence reaver rushed is hopeless. But over 500 games the law of averages applies and random teams can't be credited or blamed.","replies":[{"poster":"Aimléss","date":"2017-03-01T16:45:03.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even 500 games can still be skewed enough to make a bad player climb. If you are lucky it is entirely possible for you to get great teams 275 times out of 500. That alone is 50 more games that you'll win compared to a guy who had only 225/500 games with good teams. Giving you a 10% advantage over him. Just because you play alot of games doesn't mean luck isn't a factor, it becomes less of a factor, but it is still a factor.\n\nOf course the good player is gonna win games with bad teams and the bad player is gonna lose games with good teams because one's better than the other, so that 50 gap turns into an even W%. However the good player is better and should be higher.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-03-01T16:18:14.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"With promo helper, getting to gold is pretty much a matter of just spamming games tbh.

The game is decided by the worst player, not by the best.\n3. That means if you can constantly outperform your peers you will eventually climb.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\nYour KDAs may suck, but as long as you don't suck during mid/late game in your positioning/objective control, you will win more games than you lose. Look at me, my KDAs suck as well. Yet I manage to climb to Platinum season after season. This isn't luck, it's just me being a Platinum level player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Korijenkins","date":"2017-03-01T15:48:42.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think theres just a middle ground.

That means that temporarily, you are at least similar to him.\n\nThe skill difference between silvers and low golds isn't that big tbh. The skill gap gets exponentially bigger over time where d5 to d4 is like going from  bronze to gold. Even going from plat 5 to plat 2 is like going from silver to gold, the difference is that big.","replies":[]}]}
