I know none of these are final yet, and I don&#039;t want this to seem like a knock at the devs when these numbers were probably just thrown out there, but wouldn&#039;t you rather bring this up rather than risk nothing being done? With that out of the way let&#039;s start with probably the worst rune. \r\n\r\nEyeball Collection: Champion take downs(so I&#039;m assuming no assists) and ward kills grant the user either 2 AP or 1.4 attack damage (halved for ward kills) So let&#039;s go in depth about this. In the average game, you&#039;d likely have about 2 kills at the 10 minute mark, and have maybe killed 2 wards, assuming you&#039;re going out your way to do so. In return you&#039;re getting either 6 AP or 4.2 AD. With Gathering Storm you&#039;d receive more than that for doing nothing, and those 2 kills would also have given you a total of 11% AS with Alacrity. Okay maybe it scales well right? So let&#039;s assume at 40 minutes you have 15 kills, and 15 ward kills(That&#039;s A LOT!), you&#039;re given 45 AP or 31.5 AD, where Gathering Storm would give you 80 AP or 60 AD, again, for doing nothing; and Alacrity would be giving you 20% attack speed, and likely would&#039;ve stacked 10 minutes ago lol. Eyeball Collection either needs a special ward related passive like the others or a stats buff. Since it should likely stay with the theme of the other 2 rather than be a damage rune, maybe when you or an enemy champion you kill/assist on dies, they leave behind a floating eye which reveals the area for a while.\r\n\r\nhttps://image.ibb.co/gEGsKQ/Runes_2.png\r\nDark harvest: You gain soul essence that lasts for 20 seconds from champions (+20), minions(+1) and monsters(+2), and your next attack against a champion or tower deals bonus damage plus how many soul essence you&#039;ve collected. Another rune that requires you to make an effort to stack, but doesn&#039;t give nearly enough reward for it. That being said, this rune is a bit confusing because if you only have to pick up one soul for the base damage to proc, and there is no CD afterwards then never mind, don&#039;t buff this, it&#039;s broken lol. \r\n\r\nBut assuming that isn&#039;t the case, when compared to Electrocute https://image.ibb.co/nnQGDk/Runes_3.png\r\n(based on a lvl 1 champ with 70 AD 0 AP) Electrocute would do 105 damage and Dark harvest would do 70.5 base, now assuming you killed a minion wave in the last 20 seconds, you&#039;d gain 6 additional damage, so that would be 76.5. The only way to get benefits out of this is to take maybe 2 souls from dead champions in a team fight and deal 110 additional damage, which is pretty lackluster for something that will happen, maybe a few times per game. Now I don&#039;t know if this has a cooldown, but if it doesn&#039;t then yeah, it&#039;s broken don&#039;t buff, but if it does then the only thing it has going for it is that it procs on towers. And I don&#039;t know if 70 to 100 bonus damage on a tower is worth it over the consistent damage of Electrocute. I think either giving more essence for champion souls(Making it a team fight rune), additional damage to towers(Making it a tower slayer), or an extension on the time limit before souls expire (for a lane buff) would be great, giving the rune an identity and not letting such a cool concept go to waste.\r\n\r\nhttps://image.ibb.co/ghxcm5/Rune_4.png\r\nBloodline: We all know life steal can be frustrating to deal with, but you got to look at this without bias. Alacrity and Tenacity each get a 5% start, and I understand that 5% life steal at level one could give too much lane sustain, but this item can&#039;t even give more than 5% life steal overall? You can gain 30% tenacity from items and the rune can give 2/3&#039;s of that(20%), most AS items give 30% also, so Alacrity is giving 2/3&#039;s of an item when maxed too. The average item gives about 15% life steal, so why does Bloodline give 5% total, on top of not having a base amount at that? I think it should give 2% per kill, maxing at 10%. That way it will give 2/3&#039;s of the average life steal item like the others. \r\n\r\nhttps://image.ibb.co/mNVxm5/Rune_5.png\r\nLastly, we have Scorch, which does 10-40 extra damage over time when attacking champions 20-8 second cooldown. Now considering the tiny amount of damage, I&#039;m assuming that this is an early game item for poke champs like pantheon in the laning phase, therefore I don&#039;t see how the 20 second cooldown at level 1 is really necessary. 10 extra damage, every 20 seconds is unnoticeable even at the early levels. Being beside a late game rune (In Gathering Storm), and a circumstantial rune (In Water  Walking), I would expect Scorch to be the early game king, but the minuscule damage at every stage of the game coupled with its hefty cooldown early on just seems kinda weak to me. The cool down should be a static 8 or 10 seconds, or it needs a bit of a damage buff to be worth getting over the others.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-27T07:01:32.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assists are takedowns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2017-09-27T07:07:54.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Harvest is pretty good.

So it's good for a burst of damage in a team fight, the only problem is you're gonna need at least 3 champion souls in 20 seconds to do a bit more damage than and in that case is it even worth it? Unless it's CD is far less than electrocute.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2017-09-27T15:25:19.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No talk about river rune?? 10% of a map is river.

And I thought about but couldn't talk about the river rune because idk where the starting numbers lie. If it starts off with +10-15 ad/ap early then its gonna be great early game. Electrocute is fine cause it should be stronger than thunderlords its actually what most keystone runes should be compared too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue Mystified","date":"2017-09-27T03:39:39.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"keep in mind these might be designed for supports.

The MR shield in the same spot in sorcery as overheal is likely far more practical. Warlords is back the same and it's unlikely the other two keystones will compare to fervor of balance though the attack speed spike will probably be good.\n\nSorcery as a whole looks amazing. Likely far too amazing. MR shield/cdr/tons of scaling stats good keystones. Resolve is solid but nothing amazing and I suspect tanky dudes will just spec into the very powerful \"forward\" bonuses in trees like sorcery or inspiration or domination while building their tanky items. Resolve is solid but kind of turtle ish that a playmaker will take advantage somewhere else and making plays is what most tanks are expected to do.\n\nDomination also looks solid and the ward stuff is cool to encourage any kind of domination character. It's likely they are superior to the small seeming eye collection boost in a high skill low kill meta (unless you are a backline support champ). The wolf hunter keystone rune looks like it'll be so meta on absolutely anything that roams/engages though to the point something will have to scale back to not stagnant the game.\n\nDefinitely a vast improvement on our current mastery system [which is pretty sad state atm]. But is it a vast improvement on runes and masteries combined (ignoring the grind factors). I'm sure it is. I'm happy to see these masteries. They have so much potential already","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze GOAT","date":"2017-09-27T01:19:53.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, Scorch and Eyeball Collection are definitely bad.","replies":[]}]}
