As you may already know she's pretty bad in soloQ (2.2% playrate and 49.7% wr), she barely sees any competitive play and most importantly she doesn't feel nearly as fun anymore. I made a little comparison between her old and current kit in order to explain why the new one feels clunky and how she could be fixed.\r\n \r\n* **Her strengths** : The dagger mechanics with the Shunpo reset and outplay potential/mobility it offers. With this new passive she's less reliant on her ultimate to dish out damage.\r\n* **Her weaknesses** : She doesn't feel like an assassin anymore: her daggers are very predictable and easy to dodge or play around and limit her own ability to dodge unpredictably. Also, pre lvl 11 her shunpo cooldown does not feel intuitive to play with as you often have to wait for it to come off cooldown to perform a combo, time during which you end up wandering around without doing anything. She relies on Gunblade too much because you NEED that item in order to combo properly.\r\n \r\n**How to fix that ?** Some ideas.\r\n\r\n1. **Revert Katarina**. A lot of Katarina mains that I know really enjoyed the smooth gameplay of old Katarina. It was easy to play but hard to master especially in high elo. Ward jump was great, her build was really flexible even for her abilities, she could go W max vs melee or Q max vs range. Of course she wasn't perfect, she had the same issues as current Katarina : situationally bad in teamfight, countered by CC, bad in lane etc... She also was hard to balance since her abilities were so easy to hit.\r\n2. **Fix her current issues**. Reduce waiting time for the dagger to land, maybe with a scaling on lvl for the delay to improve her late game teamfight. Reduce Shunpo CD in early when picking up a dagger and remove small cast time to make it more reactive, make her less Gunblade-dependent, give her the ability to ward-jump again.\r\n3. **Give her the Ryze treatment**. Rework her AGAIN ! I don't have anything in mind but it's an option imo.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, let me know what you think and please answer the poll on the post, I'm curious to know what you guys think. {{champion:55}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dat Kat","date":"2018-09-30T22:41:31.319+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":30,"body":"I've been asking for a revert on the boards for a long time on every katarina post, and every time I got downvoted for god knows why.

She wasn't broken at all. Her rework served no purpose as intended what so ever.\n\nHer rework served the purpose of giving her multiple options of things to do in a fight, giving her multiple ins and outs, as well as making her actually able to be competitive at higher levels of play. Her and MF were both reworked for the same reason. They were pubstompers at lower levels but at higher levels they were unplayable. Now both are actually making their way to higher levels of play. I'd also argue that new Kat is a lot more fun to play than pre-rework Kat. You only had one thing you could do, and people knew exactly what that was: Q>E>W>walk away or stay and ult.\n\nNew Kat imo is by far more fun than old Kat and her new kit only needs some QOL changes, not any significant buffs or anything. She also feels really similar to old Kat. She still has her old W(in fact she can do it twice now), she still has her E, Q, and R. The only difference is her Q now gives her a second W instead of amping damage on anyone you auto attack or W. Her W now gives her instant movement speed with a delayed Sinister Steel, and her E can be used multiple times regardless if you get a kill. Personally I think Kat's rework is probably the **second most similar** to the champion any rework has done. The first being Warwick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unvictus","date":"2018-10-01T04:00:02.109+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":8,"body":"Riot: “we are slowing down assassin’s burst windows” \n\nYou: “her combos are slower”\n\nAlso you: “her rework didnt serve it’s intended purpose”\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nI understand how you feel, I really do. I liked old graves a lot and whenever I had to play adc he was my go to pick. Now, I never play him.. I understand if you think her old kit was more fun, but myself and many others think her new kit is more fun. Fun is such a objective term. Not everyone is gonna be happy. When it comes to a gameplay standpoint however, we have to look at which iteration is better for the game health. Her current kit is much healthier for the game than her previous kit. Ward hopping was never good for the game and only caused frustration for enemies cause Kat could misposition and just get out of jail for free as long as she had a ward. Her old kit had no skill involved other than general game knowledge, literally no skill expression when it came to her kit itself. Not to mention how bland and binary her kit was. Riot said her W was an uninteractive and boring ability which lead to them changing it. I understand your frustration, I really do. But I don’t see Riot ever going back to her old kit, not with all of the issues that it came with.\n\nPersonally, I hope Riot understands that Kat players are a little upset and take what they deem the appropriate action. I think tuning her dagger drop rates and removing the E cast time is the right call and will make her feel much smoother to play.

Like I wish they'd reduce her dmg, that she doesn't even have anyways. But atleast make her cd's somewhat relevant to her kit, she's so slow in every way. Specially early, this is how you play katarina early, stay under turret and pray for your jungler's attention. Period. Her rework is a total failure.

Everything that had to be said about new kat is told. I am also so happy that at last a post about katarina is so upvoted. Here is my opinion about katarina: i am a kat otp started to play in the end of s6. I managed to play old katarina for 3 or 4 months. I was firstly main garen but he wasnt really my playstyle i wanted someone who has mobility and does more damage and has a excape. So i was searching for champions with that and i found katarina. And ty god i did i really enjoyed her she was great. With the time i was struggaling but i learned what to max. Like q vs range and w vs melees. I also learned wt runes i had to take with katarina. I had many choises full ap or full mp and scaling health. And at last when i was actually starting to know how katarina was working i was so happy. I was wining most of my games it was awesome. But then rito decided to slow down assassins and they reworked her. I had to learn katarina all over again. And with the time i eventually did. To the point that i actually have 2.5 million mastery points on her. New kat is cool and so mobile. But since they nerfed the hell outta her i realized the problem with her kit. I liked new kat bcs she was broken i mean cmon who doesnt likes op champs but the nerfs came and yea they had to ofc . And i started to remember how old kat was working. She had terrible laning phase and laggs mobile but she was so smooth and a lot more fun to play. Also u could build whatever u prefer now u are so restrictee to gunblade in order to be relevant altho even if u get gunblade now u just have a bit more kill pressure u are still doing bad dmg intill u get ya shoes. U just have to be so fed to actually do something now or wait for ya teammates to get enemy low and just ks lol. She doesnt feels assassin anymore its more like mage. Yes old kat has her problems but at lest u can feel a lot fun playing her so smooth and the resets.... . So my point is new kat- mobile and cool but not fun and clunky, old kat- less mobile but feeling smooth a lot of fun playing her. I have so many mp on new kat but watching old kat plays i just prefer old kat. My ign is The Death Wizard in euw server if u wanna check my m points.

So no, she wasn't a healthier champion previously, but now she is.\n\nThat being said, i'm still not convinced her current kit suits her completely and as you've said, the access to your fluent combo becomes available at level 11 and is too dependent on Gunblade. I much more prefer this version of her darting around the battlefield, picking up her daggers and doing her damage, which means way higher chances of success without being too dependent on her ult.\n\nHer ult needs to have the same mechanic of dropping Kat's daggers on battlefield, depending on how long you've managed to channel it. If i'm already having to stop moving in order to deal AoE damage, i should have to be able to prime the battlefield to continue my combo depending if my ult channel was successful or not. \n\nAs it stands, Katarina doesn't feel as dangerous if people aren't stupid to walk over her daggers but reaching those damage numbers where your dagger pickups start hurting (when behind), is a pain in the ass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÎŢŢΥKÂŢKÂŢÂRÎÑÂ","date":"2018-10-01T08:24:30.765+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":15,"body":"Oh my god another thread about this. i beg of you just stop.\n\nKATARINA IS FINE NOW!\nshe is strong (if u know how to play her), balanced assassin.

No one complained about her when she was pick/ban status in the assassin rework, but after she fell down and now is weak midlane people start complaining.
