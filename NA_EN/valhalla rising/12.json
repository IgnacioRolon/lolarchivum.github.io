The Top/Jungle/Mid/ADC/Support meta is what has been proven to be the best system. The reason why is that ADCs require a lot of gold, but need to not be harassed all game by the jungler. With a Support, you get another person to zone away harass and jungle pressure. Additionally, a support is needed to engage into teamfights. Creativity in LCS is mainly limited to what is used in each of those positions. ADCs are not overrated in pro play. In low-level play, carry top laners are more common, as are carry junglers, making the ADC role less of the full damage output. In pro play, junglers are more support-like, and top laners are mostly tanks. Meaning that ADCs are one of only two main damaging roles, as opposed to 4. \n\nIf you want to be creative, get some friends and try out your ideas.

But as an adc you need as much farm as you can get as quickly as possible so giving up an entire wave or two for no reason other then your support decided to leave lane is very very frustrating to an adc. usually when i support i stay in lane till ive either forced a back or we have such an advantage that a 1v2 should be survivable for my adc then i go out and ward or gank and then immediately recall or return to lane i dont ever spend more than 3 minutes out of lane usually much less. now i can get kills and make plays during this time but you really need to get back to your lane sides if you haven't made a play in that time chances are your not going to and your just frustrating your mid by soaking up xp and drawing jungle attention to his lane. then later in the game you do not have to stay with the adc your responsibility becomes the team overall if the adc is with the team then you need to protect him even wile engaging because as much as supports tend to hate their adcs he is your carry and needs peel. if hes off split pushing you can chose to either stick with him or the team either works but as a support you should never ever be off split pushing it drives me crazy when i see a support do that. \n\nfrom the side of the support yeah allot of adcs suck and flame but you need to realize three things. 1. you might be bad or doing bad   2. if your not and its him stick with him threw lane mute him if you have to but carry is noob ass threw lane then as soon as teams start grouping go with your team and let the adc do whatever he wants. 3. i already discussed roaming and how its a timing issues roaming is fine do it smart i so sooooooooo many bad support roams were they roam for no other reason then there trying to be an all star and just end up hurting the team wasting time and accomplishing nothing so be smart about timing.\n\ntl:dr no your not the adcs muppet however in lane phase its your responsibility to keep him safe/help him get kills (if you cant do this and roam then dont) and after lane phase your responsibility is to help the team your playing \"support\" not \"carry\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-07-28T15:32:59.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adcs think this in low elo bc \"pew pew im carrying\". in high elo they actually understand that they're basically a helpless glass cannon that needs to be constantly babysat by the support. the support, meanwhile, can be effective paired with anyone who does damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-07-28T14:48:01.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put yourself in the ADC's shoes:  you come into a game expecting to 2v2, and instead your support leaves you to 1v2.  Not saying they're right to lash out, but try to understand where they're coming from.  Singling out the ADC isn't very meaningful because this same effect doesn't happen in any of the other lanes.  Mid's never going to be 1v2'ing because of something _their own team_ did, nor will mid or jungle.  \n\nAgain, maybe ADC can solo lane, but if the other support is sticking with their ADC and you leave yours, you're putting them in a different situation than what's normally meant by \"solo lane\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-07-28T13:39:20.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The support's job is to facilitate late game success. It is a broad term... but it's really what supporting is about.\n\nUsually the best way to do in the early game that is to protect the highest scaling member of the team - the adc. Not always, and if you see an opportunity to have an impact elsewhere, then by all means.
