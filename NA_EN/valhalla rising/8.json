You got counterpicked hard and cannot contest your lane, and so you have to start the team phase.  This requires your team to work together and not simply extend the lane phase while abandoning your lost lane.\n\nBasically you have to treat the lane as already lost, and play like that before you've also lost your laner to a massive farm disadvantage.","replies":[]}]}
