Silver? bronze?  What balance changes do you expect will be different than what is currently being done?  \nChampions like shen, kalista, azir might get buffed a little if they don't have to balance for pros but what about diamond and up? Thats still soloque and now those champions are going to be broken. So should we balance for high diamond?  Well no because the majority of the game plays at levels way below that. See the dilemma?\n","replies":[]}]}
