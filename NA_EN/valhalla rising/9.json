Indeed new Zyra has more plants but it feels like she&#039;s on auto pilot, or in perma-training mode with little pop ups saying &quot;cast here&quot;... Dry...\n\nAnd since there are more plants the damage they deal was decreased but that doesn&#039;t matter when she single handedly creates a clown fiesta in bot lane resulting in a very dominating lane phase.\n\nBut then she falls off hard late game which was never an issue pre-update.\nSo now we have this auto-pilot cheese kit that&#039;s only good for bullying as support.\nBefore I could rely on siegeing with Just Q and 1 seed(if I had 2 charges), with the option of going all in with a full combo.\nLess plants but more reward for properly positioning them(vs letting the system dictate that).\n\nFurther points:\n-New plants duration reduced in favor of more plants, which means it&#039;s usually pointless to try to kill the plants because they die naturally almost as fast, and more will grow right after..\n-Q is **HELLA** awkward shaped now, and deals less damage\n-More power lost from old skillshot passive to make room for the gimmicks\n\nBut anyway, unpopular opinions live up to their name and I doubt Zyra will change much if at all from what it is now.\n\nJust curious how other people feel(please think about all perspectives before you post in a fit of rage, i was Zyra main from season 4 until the mage update)\n\nP.s. If there was anything Id keep it would be slightly less damage on plants for a shorter cooldown on the recharge, limited to 4 plants spawned at once, Don&#039;t need the scaling cdr back though.\nThe Passive and Q has to revert for sure though, bring back old circle and damage.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-11-02T12:42:18.070+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't like a full revert, the Zyra rework IMO did two good things, it got rid of her garbage passive and gave her a much needed MS boost.\n\nI think three major things need to change.

While it's true that the new plants do less damage and last less time, that makes it much easier to deal with enemies who quickly kill her plants, as you can replace them more easily (IE, you drop both you plants and morgana casts W under them quickly killing them).  \n\nThe new passive also makes her strong late game when setting up for objectives as she can cover baron/dragon pit in seeds if the enemy lets her, or cover the area around where her team is sieging a tower.  Combined with her ult she has really good counter-engage.  \n\nWhile I liked both the old and new Zyra, I am really happy they replaced the old passive (I'm indifferent about the Q changes, new Q is easier to land for me, but has a longer delay so it's harder to block skillshots with ranged plants).

I have only gotten to play her in ARAMs where she likely shines the most, but that being said I do like a lot of what they did. They took her from a 100-0 mage to a zoning mage that has a much more defined niche IMO. While Q and E lost some of their bite, the plants are VERY good at constantly harassing. I am sad that I can no longer set up bush traps, but what I do now is I constantly spawn one plant at a time with Q and it always hits 1-3 times. Perma-upkeep on this 1 plant ensures that Liandry's and Rylai's is always working and that I am always dealing some damage while I build up a backline of seeds. This allows me to put out some serious counter-engage if they ever decide to go in. (Hence the niche of zoning/counter-engage mage.)\n\nI will agree that her laning is a little oppressive sometimes (I main support, I just don't play AS her). Do I really mind? Not really. Her passive is a ton better now (the old one was clunky) and her Q and E feel a lot better to me in terms of activating plants. Sure, the Q turning into a box is kinda weird, but I make it work. If I had any serious complaints, it would be how much the plants do early on; I could see them having a turret style ramp up over 2 shots so that the first one doesn't sting as bad, but if you keep getting hit they wreck you. Aside from that, I think she could benefit a lot from slightly different itemization than what is available. I don't like the current CDR options past Morellonomicon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-11-02T15:53:23.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, to be honest you do have a point, her old kit used to be more reliable but reliability is but a balance lever.\n\nYou say you've been playing Zyra since season 4, I can't recall when she was released but I can tell you that on release, all she needed was a rod of ages and all hell would break loose, I cheesed that strategy until it was nerfed, mind you... She was a really really powerful mage and in all honesty she is still really powerful with the minor handicap of being forced to position sort of randomly.\n\nSeeds are programmed to follow the patterns of your movements, I've been surprised countless times with a second plant spawn just as I lay down 1 seed, of course at times there's a stray seed that goes from mid lane to the enemy inner turret.. but since it has a really low cooldown it barely even matters.\n\nSeeds are a mechanic for the enemy team to play around as opposed to yours, if the enemy team initiates into a pile of seeds, they'll explode as she casts her full rotation. A Zyra nest is one of the highest damage ones, given of course that the RNG god works with you... A good Zyra player though will kind of predict where their seeds will spawn and will position accordingly, this is now the bread and butter of Zyra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2016-11-02T15:47:13.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Falls off\"\n\nHer effective range with the spitting plants is moronic.
