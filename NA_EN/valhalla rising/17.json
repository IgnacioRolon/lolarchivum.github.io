I can actually beat champs like trynd, fiora, riven in lane with ap shaco.  I frequently do.  That's why I pick him.  I've learned of a few people not to pick him into, but at the same time, I have 5 different rune pages and mastery sets for ap shaco depending on the lane and matchup.  I learned from my bad matchups and used runes and masteries to make my lane a little easier.  People with a lot of sustain give me the most problems in lane.  I can keep trynd off minion waves...but like mundo's garens vladimirs....I usually need ganks for those lanes becaue they just keep healing everytime I poke them.   I also learned to take magic pen runes over ap runes if they have a lot of tanks.  It's really all about learning from your previous games, including losses.  I agree, you should be able to play every role to some basic degree.  I'm a horrible adc IMO.  I avoid it at all costs.\n\n  I didn't start playing AP shaco till I gave up on getting out of bronze this season.  Before that I was maining support, had greats stats with most of the supports, and still couldn't get out of bronze.  Now I just play what I like.  800 games of playing what the team needed and I was still dropping to b5 randomly. No point in trying to climb when I'll just get another \"soft reset\" and start next season bronze.  At this point i'm just trying to get awesome enough with one champ to get out of bronze early next season.  Being able to play Shaco in 4 different lanes makes it easier to get more experience in.  I prefer top or support though.\n\n\nI just think people should know their character...well.  I think 5 champs people know how to play well beats the meta any day.  When those 5 champs fall within the meta all the better.  But what are the odds that each person in a game mains a different lane?  Usually there's overlap, which means someone gets forced into a secondary role playing a character they only play occasionally.  When you have one main champ you can play in 2-3 roles that betters your chances of good games I would think.  I could be wrong.  Call it faulty bronze logic.  Lol.

WITH THE AIM OF UPSETTING SOMEONE.\n> \n> Picking a champion that's considered offmeta!= trolling.\n\nYou know what the meta is, and you deliberately picked off meta, knowing it will upset your teamates.... are you dense or just that stubborn?","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-10-10T19:46:39.386+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could ask you the same thing. Picking a champion that I want to play because I think it's a good pick in this situation is not trolling. In a solo queue game, I don't give a shit what my teammates think of my pick, I'm thinking only of my own personal synergy with my team and the counters against the enemy team. If they pick 5 melees and I want to pick a weird offmeta ranged support to help siege them because we have no siege, how is that a bad pick? Just because some asshole decides that vel'koz/brand/whatever support is garbage doesn't mean it was a bad pick.\n\nI can understand people getting angry over a legitimately bad pick (picking things that don't synergize with your team/have any obvious utility or counters to the enemy team), but if I pick Vel'Koz because they picked all immobile characters, I'm going to destroy them. Complaining that it's \"offmeta\" and that that instantly makes it trolling doesn't make the pick any worse, just your perception of it.\n\nTrolling deliberately being offensive - I'm not picking offmeta to be offensive, I'm picking it because I enjoy it and I think the pick can work. Having the side effect of potentially making people angry doesn't make it trolling, because I'm not DELIBERATELY being OFFENSIVE. Reading comprehension is powerful.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"High5","date":"2015-10-10T18:32:05.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Teemo support is not an off meta thing.  It's not a thing at all.  Don't do it.  People deserve to recieve negative feedback for bad choices.\n\nThere's a line, but this is a competitive game.  Winning is fun.  Losing is not, especially when it's not in your control.","replies":[{"poster":"Koechophe","date":"2015-10-10T19:10:00.764+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly the attitude that's problematic. What is your basis to say teemo support cannot work? He provides unparralleled vision control and can effectively kill 90% of the damage from an adc for 2.5 seconds, as well as having decent poke and great map vision. You probably saw someone do it badly, and decided it was bad. That is not a good premise. \n\nI like unorthodox support picks. I've done support malphite and support galio a lot, both to great success, but often people on my own team end up losing us the match because they troll. They ignore the fact that bot lane is stomping and that team fight impact is huge, and every time I die (which usually is very low) that is \"proof\" that my pick lost us the match.  Keep an open mind, do what you need to do and let others do the same.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikmints","date":"2015-10-10T18:54:51.028+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going to give my experience as Teemo support since I've tried a lot of things support. Sadly his E DoT doesn't cash in on Spellthief's Edge stacks, but your autos still do more damage than most supports so it's still worth poking with it. Having a blind in a lane where the enemy will always rely on auto attack damage is valuable, so long as you keep an eye on your mana to not let it go below half for emergencies. Your mushrooms are a lifesaver if the enemy team has an Evelynn jungle since your sightstone won't help much against her. After your first 3 mandatory items, buying Liandry's then Luden's guarantees that your mushrooms will still deal  significant damage.\n\nNot a support you'd want if your opponent has significant poke as you can't retaliate safely nor keep the damage your team takes minimized by shields or heals. Also worth avoiding if your team relies heavily on peel (either with someone like Kog'maw who needs cc or against a team with assassins). If your team has a significant lack of magic damage, this is one of the few supports I'd recommend as his build lets him get enough magic damage to make it worth itemizing against.\n\nTeemo support can be played poorly, and if so, give them constructive feedback. It can be done right and rarely even be a fantastic pick based on the other champs in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-10-10T17:03:21.389+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see this refusal to teamwork daily; if people want to win by themselves they should go play call of duty or some other lamely made pvp game. \nI agree, spot on.","replies":[{"poster":"Clown Apocalypse","date":"2015-10-10T17:19:53.975+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like the people who throw games because they wanna farm full builds instead of ending the game while they are up.  Or the people who lose lane who spend the rest of the game farming because they are behind, like either they carry the game or it's a loss.  Those are the same people who say gg when they die in lane.  The same ones who go 0-6 in lane and then blame the off meta support for the loss like we had anything to do with top lane during laning phase.  LOL.","replies":[]}]}]}
