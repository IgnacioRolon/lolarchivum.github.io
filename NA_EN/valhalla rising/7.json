You'll notice that almost all of the champions who deal hybrid damage are hamstringed in some sense, to the point where they're viable, but not truly to a point where they could ever be meta. This is because hybrid damage is insanely difficult to defend against. I'm not saying hybrid options shouldn't exist  - it works well on champions like Tristana or Hecarim who can go either way and give up some in one direction to have power in the other - but in general, it's not great for game health. That's why Jax and Corki are barrel scrapers right now, and why Evelynn has had such an awkward kit over the years.","replies":[{"poster":"GrievousFetus","date":"2017-05-15T14:19:47.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"%max HP true damage is perfectly healthy gameplay though :^)","replies":[{"poster":"RuFiot","date":"2017-05-15T14:25:59.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-05-15T14:25:44.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hybrids are hard to balance because they are really hard to itemize defensibly against.  \n\nIn order to balance them riot uses the a two pronged method.

That is to say that AD Shaco and AP Shaco are two completely different play styles. But that in mind, you really wouldn't try to reconcile the two builds, that would just lead to a crap build. \n\nThe weird part about Jax and Kayle is, because they are AA focused, AD is never a terrible stat for them, even if they would prefer AP. And because they are AA focused, they can forgo items that most mages would need. (notably mana itemization) Of coarse if your going to make a new champ similar to that, how would you make them differ from Either Jax of Kayle?\n\nMy main question is Why? Simply to have a Duel scaling champion doesn't justify making one. Their should be a notable reason for making a champion that can scale off of Either stat for different effect. But I don't actually think a champ with both AD and AP scaling (Like Jax) just to make use of hybrid items is really that good. While it will diversify his build options at first, He's going to be balanced around his optimal build. (And any other build becomes sub optimal)","replies":[]}]}]}
