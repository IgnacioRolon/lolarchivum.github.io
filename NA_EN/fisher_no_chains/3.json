If zoe's sleep was instant cc then she wouldnt have time to get a full range Q on you after she uses it and the duration of the cc would be reduced.  But because its delayed she has enough time to literally watch you, wait for it to proc, then start her q and get a max distance hit on you.

The enemy team cant break the cc unless they have {{item:3222}} so they are forced to either abandon that player or they are forced to fight. \n\nThink about malphite ult.
