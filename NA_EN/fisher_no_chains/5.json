Characters in this game can be OP without being changed for a long time or not having a very intrusive design simply because the game around them changes.  Cait got a massive buff last season with her mini-rework as well as Runaans making her passive easier to proc.  That strength never left as everyone else got toned down and there's valid reasons why other carries were nerfed.  She needs to be balanced around what the adc class is, not making tons champ reworks so that they're at least as powerful as Cait.\n\nAlso Cait has been changed all the time.  Her release was weak because they were conservative, they buffed her and she became the best adc due to dominant early game from range and good transition.  They nerf her and she goes into mid to lower tiers of picks, she swings back and is suddenly dominant.  That pattern of balance is very similar to champs like Yasuo or for someone in the reworks category, Ryze might be a better comparison.  Her kit is unhealthy just on the basis of \"I outrange everyone else with my attacks that don't miss\" and they have to balance her around that because its her identity.  She isn't this magic adc that's always been in the perfect position of balance and there really isn't anyone who fits that role, Ezreal is probably the closest and he's still been god tier and nerfed himself in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Parceval","date":"2016-12-17T04:04:16.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"One adc isn't way stronger than the rest.
