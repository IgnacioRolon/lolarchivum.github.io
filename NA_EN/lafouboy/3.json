Everyone was like \"Too muh damage\" and she got nerfed and never seen again. She only started being playd again after the recent buffs and everyone \"OMAGAWD too much damage qq\" while she havent got a damage change, only a mana cost reduction on Q and, oh i forgot, the damage on the 2nd target you hit is doubled compared to before. Like you hit 2 champions in a row ever time you throw a Q....\n\nAnother exmaple, season 4 with {{champion:115}} . I am personnaly a big Ziggs player since season 3, and I got trashtalked alot for picking Ziggs. He got some little buffs, mostly CD reductions on his W in season 4, some pro player picked him \"OMG Ziggs lane bully cant do anything qq\". Well, dodge the Q's would've been a great option. Then they nerfed his ult cooldown by alot in later ranks, and completly broke his Q's hitbox. I dont play him anymore cause I often miss Q's that would've hitted before, and I cant stand that bs hitbox, when the bomb sometimes jump over something instead of hitting something, cause its hitbox is so small. And ofc, Ziggs was never seen again till this day, even after fairly strong Q mana cost reduction buffs.\n\nAnd now Veigar, considered prue trash after his rework. As a skillshot mages mid main, I tried him, cause he more skillshots then before. I quite played him a bit befor, but I found him fairly boring to play. After the rework, he was alot more amusing, fairly underpowered but truly viable. I wrote a topic directly after the rework claming Veigar still is good champ, and you can hit E if you play correctly, but no, the community decided to whine instead of actually trying the champ.\n\nSome buffs later, Veigar still not played at all, one small buff afterwards, still no one playing him. Some days after the patch, some pro played him, carried with him, and suddenly he becomes broken and blame the latest patch. \n\nI mean, if Veigar had no counterplay, I could understand, like LB was forgotten for long but became popular after pros playing her, she was still broken cause of her kit that clearly lacked (and still lacks) couterplay. Sometimes, some broken champs arent just meta but if those were to rise, they would get alot of (this time right) QQ. Swain comes in mind.\n\nBut Veigar, come on, not only you can counter him by dodging his skillshots, you can punish him extremly hard by buying QSS. You can buy it fairly easy without risks, since Veigars early isnt good, so you have plenty of time getting gold to counteritemize against him.\n\nIf that's not enough, you can counter him by buying tenactiy, MR, or going for utility mage items with low AP (Going for exmaple for haunting guise instead of needlessly large rod).\n\n\"Its same with Zed, just get Zhonya and he's done\". How many times people just said that to people that were complaining about Zed when they clamed he was an unfair oppenent (which he is) ? \"But omg, you said I need to get an item to counter Veigar and that hes not broken because of that, but Zed is broken when you get Zhonya QQ ?\"\n\nYes, because first, Zhonya cost about 2.5 times the cost of QSS, secondly, Zed is strong in early, he can tear you apart beore you get your Zhonya, and while you get it, too late, he be feasting on bot lane.\n\nVeigar isnt much of a thread before 6, because his poke is meh before that, and he'll probably farm with his Q instead of poking with it (By a side note, a poke that can be easily dodged)\n\nPhew long post here, hope people finally realise what really a broken champ is and what not.","replies":[{"poster":"Lafouboy","date":"2015-10-17T12:17:09.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This. 1,000,000 times, this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lB2kGRlc8y","date":"2015-10-17T10:01:25.799+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, wood division's most perceptive minds saw that the Veigar that had been forsaken by the LCS gods after his fall from grace had suddenly clawed his way out of the hell that their incredible ineptitude put him in and thought they'd lose the ability to stargaze mid match without punishment.

They're going to Akali/Kha'Zix/Cassiopeia/Kassadin (with his Riftlimp) him. History has shown that if a champion is strong and the community complains about it then Riot overnerfs them to compensate. The problem is that Veigar is not overpowered; there are many ways to counter him. He is flavor of the month. There's no arguing that he is powerful at the moment, but not so powerful that he needs lots of nerfs. They are going to overnerf him, which will send him back to a state of utter mediocrity. They will either do it at a medium pace or they will do it very slowly. Either way, history has shown that the most likely course of \"balance\" Riot will take is over nerfing Veigar, sending him back into the \"never picked for a good reason\" zone.\n\nThis may seem like a little nerf, but it really isn't. It's about a 220 dmg nerf for Veigar's late game considering he will likely have around 1k AP; which is an AOE nerf, meaning it can potentially be a bigger damage nerf if his W would hit more than 1 person. The worst part is, this is not even going to stop him from being a popular pick, meaning that people will keep complaining about him until he is completely killed (or another \"OMG SO OP\" pick takes his place on the \"RIOT NERF OMG SO STUPID! THIS CHAMP IS THE REASON I AM STUCK IN MY DIVISION!!!!!\"), meaning that Riot will keep nerfing him until that happens. He's gonna go through some tough times, eventually becoming around the low 40's winrate again (if not worse than that). Yet again, history has shown this to be true and this will not change for Veigar.\n\nIn essence, Veigar is gonna get killed by Riot and the bitchy community. When it happens, I am going to start another thread and quote this exact post of mine to tell you all that I was correct.. that I am ALWAYS CORRECT (seriously, look at my posts. I have predicted throughout the seasons so many things, such as Support Fiddle being OP, Tanky jungle Yi with Titanic Hydra becoming a thing, I predicted Veigar's E would be able to stop dashes the day before it was announced, that Teemo would be able to throw his shrooms in a future update, and so many more things; I EVEN PREDICTED THAT A BUFF TO VEIGAR WOULD MAKE HIM PICK/BAN JUST A FEW MONTHS BACK).
