BUFF HIM&quot; on the boards to &quot;OMG! HE IS SO OVERPOWERED! HE NEEDS TO BE FIXED!&quot;.\n\nRiot literally only reduced the delay on his W by .25 seconds and allowed him to more reliably get AP (giving him about 25 - 60 more in the late game, depending on how well you are doing). He has not changed that massively. Just cuz you got dumped on by a Veigar because you couldn&#039;t take advantage of his GLARING weaknesses doesn&#039;t make him OP. Those changes were honestly good for him and puts him in a perfect place of power; where he can still fail hard if he gets shut down early game/zoned from his Q farm but do extremely well in the mid to late game if his team is competent enough to peel for the escapeless squishy bastard. He is everything a burst mage should be; he has reasonable trade-offs (his abysmally terrible early game) and specializes in late game damage dealing (along with some battlefield control with his E). He&#039;s not an unstoppable champion, he is practically an AP Nasus that dies MUCH easier (literally, if he doesn&#039;t have Zhonya&#039;s then the enemy team&#039;s assassins will make him regret walking outside that day); his largest counter is an item that is good on every champion too (Banshee&#039;s Veil).\n\nSeriously, leave Veigar alone. It&#039;s not that he&#039;s OP, it&#039;s that the guy on the other team was better than you.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackEyesBlue","date":"2015-09-25T14:05:04.148+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not League unless everyone's complaining about the \"champ of the week\" ! :P","replies":[{"poster":"Carnage","date":"2015-09-26T09:48:08.856+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"true","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saminus Maximus","date":"2015-09-25T16:19:02.721+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tips to counter veigar: \n1 - Pick zed, talon or fizz.
