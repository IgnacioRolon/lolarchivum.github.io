Most staple AP items are going up in price for seemingly no adequate reason, while MR is getting cheaper and ADC items are being created to deal with Mages&#039; burst damage (like Death&#039;s Dance) and CC (Merc Scimitar getting a buff) with reasonable prices attached to them (less costly builds on champs that are purposely fed/farm more than most other positions).\r\n\r\nThe decisions made, with no explanation for &quot;why&quot;, really does get me confused. If we could only get an explanation, that would be lovely.

She gets a decent power spike at 6, but before then, she's nasty mana hungry, is forced to level her W first because it's her only waveclear, and thus can't harass anyone unless they're stupid enough to stand in the low range of her W. After six, she gets enough assassination potential that she can potentially outplay, but if the opponent knows how to position, she won't be able to kill them, and then her power wanes again until 11. \n2) She is reliant on either skill shots or close range to kill. Her Q/ulted Q is devastating, but she can't actually kill unless she follows it up with distortion or chains. Chains can be easily dodged, or blocked, and distortion has an extremely low effective range. \n3) She is severely lacking in AOE. W and mimicked W are INSANELY risky to use offensively because she's just begging for cc if she does, and she's super squishy. \n4) Barely any CC to speak of. She can't ever lock someone down, her E is just way too unreliable to do the job in a team fight scenario.\n5) She's extremely reliant on flanking. The only way you're going to blow up high priority targets is if you flank, which can only happen if you have vision control. Successful warding = unsuccessful leblanc. \n\nLeblanc can do 1 thing; blow up single targets. She can only do that job arguably better than any other assassin, and she has amazing tools to escape, but at the end of the day, there's clear counterplay available. She is killed by zone mages pretty darn hard, and her teamfight damage cannot rival that of other aoe champs (Viktor, Azir, Anivia, etc). Leblanc is all about outplaying your opponent. It feels frustrating when the LB you're up against is good, but ultimitely, if you know how to play around her better than she can play around you, you'll come out ahead. Just learn her power spikes, position properly, and don't go all in for the kill on her unless you have some NASTY good cc/damage or else she blew her W on something stupid and then used a different spell, or else had previously used her ult. Just remember that if LB doesn't kill you in her initial burst, she's out of damage, so kill her instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RyzeRework","date":"2015-11-06T07:50:48.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lafouboy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tR8w9smR,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2015-11-06T07:48:25.709+0000)\n>\n> If you group up, there are many champs that can fuck you up.
