Her Headhunter skin was not even in my list during champ select which was weird. Then when I checked the store, it said I hadn't purchased it yet. I am positive I used it a few times before my break and no one else has my password so there is no way its some prank. Plus even if it was, it would have refunded me the money so I would just be able to re-buy it. I can't check my purchase history because I bought it more than 30 days ago. Can someone please help?  {{item:3070}} D:","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-21T18:02:29.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! \n\nWe'd done a sweep a bit back where we removed content that was gained through [refer a friend abuse](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=684346). \n\nIf you don't think you fall into that category, and think it was an error, you can submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and player support would be able to take a look and see what's going on.","replies":[{"poster":"hjkhjfhhhgch","date":"2015-01-22T03:44:07.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That must have been what it was.
