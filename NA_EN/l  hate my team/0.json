There are only rare games, where i am having some good, fun and nice teamfights. And that&#039;s what i&#039;m missing. \n\n-  You have to play with drunk players.\n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong. But if i am camping my midlaner to 3/0 meanwhile their yasuo is 0/3, and the yasuo still beats my midlaner and wins the lane somehow, what the fuck can i do? Or these players who don&#039;t wanna ff a 20/4 game. You are FUCKING delusionals.  There is nothing you can win. It&#039;s not Season 5- anymore, wtf.  \nWhy should i waste my time?\n\n-  Botlane is having too much impact\n\nI can camp my Toplaner and Midlaner, and make them very fed. But if my botlane is getting stomped, and they are having a good botlane, this game is lost. \nSupports make ADC&#039;s too strong, and support items which are for tanky supports make these tanky supports to TANKS.  There is like no assasin which can  get into a ADC without dying, because the ADC&#039;s has like 1000 shields from his supporter and lifesteal etc. \n\n-  Splitpushing is dead\n\nI really had like no splittpushing toplaner in my last 1000 games. \nSplitpushing was the most solo Q tactic, but if the most solo Q tactic is dead, than this game became too much a team game, don&#039;t you think too?\n\n- Tanks deal very much damage and outscale you\n\nYou can be a 5/0 riven in your toplane, but if the fucking enemy sion gets his 2 tank items, this guy will fucking outscale you in dmg anyways, wtf","replies":[{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-03-28T11:32:56.446+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People actually try to FF in ARAM / Rotative modes, as someone who mostly play these modes, sorry if you aren't having \"fun\" here and want to FF whenever it's possible, just go back to ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fargo79","date":"2018-03-28T10:35:21.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bottom line.. if u dont like it leave... no one is forcing u to play this \"FREE TO PLAY\" game...","replies":[{"poster":"l  hate my team","date":"2018-03-28T11:12:34.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's forbidden to leave critism because its just a f2p game?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-03-28T11:03:55.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. The first point is valid, snowballing is out of control and it has been since the season started.\n\n2. The reason people don't wanna FF losing games is because maybe your team is better late game, the enemies are full AD, or have no tank, etc. There are so many situations where your team can come back from a stomp. Not to mention they might just be having fun.\n\n3. Yes\n\n4. Splitpushing is still very alive. Tell your team to group mid then go and splitpush top, applying pressure. And don't complain about your teammates not going splitpushers, if you don't like what they're doing then do it yourself.\n\n5. Sion's just busted tbh.. Against other champs just try tank shred, depending on what they're building. It can work wonders.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colte","date":"2018-03-28T10:30:58.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"there are so many of these threads but riot seems blind or just doesn't give a damn about the situation, infact i heard they are trying to make snowballing far worse than it already is.. i hate how all my junglers gank top (yep.. gank a 2k hp instead of a 800-1000 hp bot lane, very smart! oh no! the 2k hp tank double kills 1v2!!!)\n\ni feel like i'm forced to play adc or even support, if i play adc i need to hope the support isn't retarded, if i play support i need to hope my adc has common sense or choose to be an aggressive support and carry the game. \n\nit irritates me whenever i run into players that auto lock-in squishy champions and die 7-10 times like a moron in 5-10 minutes without learning from their mistake and ignore the team's advice, i love it when people suggest me strategies or warn me to be wary of this spell so i don't know why they're on a team game playing a brainless singleplayer game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-28T10:10:02.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason we aren't surrendering isn't because we think we can win, its because we re still having fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fargo79","date":"2018-03-28T12:40:41.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its my right to vote no for surrenders.. so when someone gets face rolled in the 1st 10 mins and cries for a surrender cause they arent having fun then maybe they should just go some where else and play a solo game where its their own fault whether they enjoy a game or not.. u can leave all the criticism u want.. but riot wont change it cause some people find it not fun.. i laugh when people rip on other in games modes like ARAM cause they are building wrong or are dying alot..  HELLO its a fun mode.. all the modes are meant to be fun modes until u hit ranked.. then u take it serious... and lets be honest.. u get that many bad players in your games then maybe your own MMR isnt at great as u might think it is..","replies":[]}]}
