Thaumaturgical like Sion, having their conciousness fading, losing themselves, becoming more of a tool than a ~~living~~ unliving creature, while the dark-fantasy type, while being twisted, are pretty much the same person.\r\nAnd the thing that is missing from the thaumaturgical, while being present in dark-fantasy (Mordekaiser and all Shadow Isles undead) is the black smokish substance. So clearly Mordekaiser being made of something so similar can&#039;t be just a comeplete accident.\r\n(While I do realize that Mordekaiser looked like that waaaaay before any black mist appeared in the lore, I don&#039;t think he was meant to be made of black smoke, as on his model you could always see his face - As such I assume him being black smoke is a recent thing.) \r\n\r\nAnd I do realize most of you don&#039;t really care, especially about such a champion as Mordekaiser, but I am super interested in his story so!\r\nTime for the poll:","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-08-25T13:14:50.679+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser is way older than the Mist, he is described in his lore as a ghost of pure malice with red shining eyes.\n\nThere is anyway some sort of connection between those two.

This makes sense when you take into account that the black smoke that makes up Mordekaiser's form has sentience as the Black Mist is also described as having intelligent tendencies.\n\nTo answer the question, yes and no.  Yes, he very well could be made of black mist.  And no, he is not made of The Black Mist as it seems the Shadow Isles mist is the wife of the Ruined King.  They used just the right amount of water on Mordekaiser but the poor woman tossed in the lake wasn't given the same forethought of moderation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-25T12:56:08.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really hard to say but I would say it would be some kind of intangible entity under his armour since his actual body is definitely not what he's using.
