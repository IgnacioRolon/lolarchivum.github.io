Maybe for the last time.\n***\n**Design**\n\nThis time around I&#039;ve taken a much different approach to redesigning Mordekaiser.\nInstead of trying to give off a majestic or regal feel, I wanted to focus on death, decay, ancient age and Mordekaiser&#039;s malice (hue).\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Msfabcd.png\n\nOn his armor the damage from countless battles - Mordekaiser in lore isn&#039;t afraid to take hits and each battle scar on his armor is one more hit to his opponents&#039; morale.\nThrough the cracks in armor thorns grew over the centuries, when Mordekaiser was gone from runeterra.\nSo did the thorns encircle his mace, Nightfall, feeding off of countless souls the weapon took... (What do you mean!? that&#039;s totally how thorns work!)\nHis necromancy red, Mordekaiser&#039;s own soul corrupting the ones he comes in contact with.\n\nNow, enough of this edge. \n\nLet us delve into the **Gameplay**...\n\n***\n\nI always thought that the role of a pretty squishy burst mage doesn&#039;t really convey Mordekaiser&#039;s lore quite right. Mordekaiser is supposed to be this insanely powerful titan - an indestructible immortal.\n\nI see lore Mordekaiser as an AP tank or AP off-tank, that deals damage over the course of the teamfight rather than in a burst.\nThis concept isn&#039;t as alien to Mordekaiser as some may think - during his first Season, back in the day of force of nature that was how Mordekaiser was.\nAs well during the first patches after his rework, when people would rather resort to building tanky items, since the damage from Q was enough even without much AP. \nI want to go back to that... but with some twists.\n\nAgain, I wanted to focus on using decision-making, rather than mechanical skill for these abilities, as it&#039;s most in line with current Mordekaiser, by adding certain_ trade-offs_ to his kit.\n\n_I won&#039;t go into the exact numbers and the nitty gritty of most of the abilities - I will just split each skill into 3 sections: the description, the intended gameplay application/explanation, and the visuals._\n\n***\n\nPASSIVE: **Children Of The Grave**.\n\n> Champions that have died leave behind a highlighted symbol. \n> Mordekaiser can raise a ghost of this champion to fight for him for 20/30/40/50 seconds, by left clicking on that symbol. (levels 1, 6, 11, 16)\n> Raised champions have 40/50/60/70% of the effective stats. After level 16 Mordekaiser also gains 15% of their bonus HP and AP.\n> Cooldown: 150/120/90/60 seconds.\n\nI&#039;ve decided to move Mordekaiser&#039;s ability to raise champions from his ultimate, because it was a bit too limiting. Having that attached to ultimate meant, that the ulti itself could pretty much only be a cursing blast... And that&#039;s a little boring.\nHowever this ability is one of Mordekaiser core features. I didn&#039;t want to remove it completely... Instead, I&#039;ve found it fits nicely into a passive ability... Also yes - it doesn&#039;t specify **enemy** champions. You can raise ghosts of your own allies if they die during a gank or a teamfight!\n\n_Visuals_: Mordekaiser extends his hand to the corpse, causing a drain-like animation. After 0.75 second channel, Mordekaiser clenches his fist and the ghost rises from the body.\n\n***\n\nQ: **Mace Of Spades**\n> Mordekaiser summons a soul to his hand and imbues it into his mace. For the next 5 seconds, Mordekaiser&#039;s attacks will deal bonus, AP-based damage. With each passing second, the power of the buff increases, up to 200% of the original bonus in the final second.\n> \n> Mordekaiser may recast this ability during the first 4 seconds, causing him to charge up a powerful strike over a 1 second channel that cannot be interrupted.\n> This blow will strike in a 210&deg; arch, dealing massive damage and knocking all opponents back. \n\nWhile I like the current Q a lot, it wasn&#039;t exacly suitable for the Mordekaiser I wanted to build. \nThis Q introduces a certain trade-off. Recasting the ability during the first seconds of the buff may make it difficult to apply any of the empowered hits, if the enemy gets knocked back... While recasting it during the final seconds means, you will be missing out on the most powerful part of the buff.\nHe can also use the 2nd active to block an incoming CC, as he is immune for the time. \nThe knockback also ties nicely to our new ulti... But that later...\n\n_Visuals_: First part sees Mordekaiser put a soul inside Nightfall, causing it to blacken, while red spikes appear on the head of the mace.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SMFOfn6.png\n\nDuring the recast, Mordekaiser puts the head of his mace to the ground, wielding it in both of his hands, channeling the power into it and swinging wildly after a second.\n\n***\n\nW: **Creeping Death**\n> Toggle On - Mordekaiser&#039;s health starts being drained rapidly. He creates an AoE around himself, that deals damage per second to all enemies inside it. During this time Mordekaiser also gains two empowering effects:\n> Dealing damage to enemy champions generates shield.\n> Channeling or casting spells gives him a % damage reduction for a brief moment.\n> Turning the ability off, instatly rids you of shields and damage reduction.\n\nThe old name for that ability is back, as I find it more fitting... The rapid health drain means that Death is Creeping for both Mordekaiser and his enemies.\nIn exchange for his health being drained, he gains his old passive back and a little bonus. Comboing this damage reduction with the CC immunity of Q&#039;s second cast can give one a very nice tool for surviving powerful attacks.\n\n_Visuals_: Something simple would probably work best. Maybe something with the thorns? Or just a similar spiraling effect to the current one, but red, in line with the rest of vfx.\n\nE: **Siphon Of Destruction**\n> Mordekaiser summons a quick burst of unlife from under the enemy feet, dealing damage. This blast also spreads to nearby minions.\n> It has a short channel and delay, so it&#039;s possible for a champion to dodge it by using a dash or flash. Works instantly on minions.\n> \n> If a champion has been struck with it they become marked for 3 seconds. Dealing damage to the marked target, will regenerate Mordekaiser slowly. \n\nA pretty simple ability. I&#039;m thinking for it to work a bit like Rek&#039;Sai ultimate - as in, the champion targeted by it can still escape, but the ability won&#039;t hit other champions. I wanted to give Mordekaiser some opportunity to regenerate health, without it being as toxic as current W. \n\nR: _**Nightfall**_\n> Mordekaiser channels for a brief second and creates a zone around himself in a 1000 range radius. This zone shrinks over the duration of 7 seconds to a range of 500 radius.\n> Enemy champions that stay in the zone for 2/1.5/1 second become _marked_. \n> Once marked, they can no longer see anything outside the ultimate area, similar to becoming near-sighted.\n> If a marked champion leaves the area, they regain their sight, but their mark highlights.\n> \n> Mordekaiser can recast the ultimate on any target with a highlighted mark.\n> Recasting the ultimate causes the zone to close, fearing all champions that were still inside, while the targeted champion is transported to Mordekaiser near instantly and slowed. \n\n> Zone lasts for 7/8/9 seconds.\n\n_Note: the in-game desc of this ability could be much briefer, I just wanted to explain it best I could._\n\nNow this ability... It&#039;s where a lot of the previous skills come together.\nIt&#039;s basically a &quot;fight me now&quot; button, that forces enemies to either focus Mordekaiser down, try to escape within the first 2-1 second, or possibly sacrifice one of their own for the safety of the rest. This, of course, means a free ghost for Mordekaiser.\nMordekaiser doesn&#039;t like to fight enemies, that stay out of his range, so instead he brings those enemies to himself. \nAnd if the fighting doesn&#039;t go all that fine - there is still his Q. Mordekaiser can launch the enemies out of his zone, with a near guaranteed hit.\n\nIt&#039;s a tool for both dueling and teamfighting.\nIn 1v1 situations Mordekaiser can force a duel with an advantage. \nIn teamfights Mordekaiser can take enemy focus, while his team attacks enemies from outside of (or within) the zone.\nBut the ultimate still has enough counterplay to be able to go around it. Escaping within the initial 2-1 second (plus the channel), knocking Mordekaiser back, leaving the zone all at once, so once Mordekaiser tries to take one of your teammates to himself you can re-engage and stop Mordekaiser from killing them. \n\nThis is also an ability I find fitting for Mordekaiser. It&#039;s inspired by the 1v1 against the knight in his Short Story. \nMordekaiser likes a good fight and a challange... Doesn&#039;t mind taking hits, as he&#039;s very durable... And also is supposed to be quite a strategist - that aplication can be seen in the teamfight potential of this ulti.\n\nBut enough of boring theoretical babbling... Let&#039;s talk about the most important part...\n\n**_The Visuals._**\nDuring the channel, Mordekaiser stabs his mace into the ground, as a circle of black mist appears on the edges of the zone. The circle starts filling out with spirits, flying through the fog, ready to leap at the enemies. \nOnce marked, the affected champions can only see black outside of this circle, so it makes it look like being surrounded by a massive area of Black Mist.\nOnce the ability is recasted, the circle of Mist and spirits starts closing quickly, gathering to the point closest to the escaping enemy, and launches towards him. The spirits grab the target and either transport him to Mordekaiser via mist or drag him underground. \n\nMordekaiser&#039;s eyes light up with red orbs during this ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Quinzley","date":"2018-09-08T17:33:13.456+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This looks like a great idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skullgetti","date":"2018-09-08T21:41:14.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would add some big iron spikes to the mace, but this looks badass as hell, great job!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pale Mask","date":"2018-09-08T19:45:14.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this original art?

Most of the Shadow Isles characters or effects are the Greenish blue or green-gray/just gray.\n\nThat's the exact reason I didn't go for green or blue.\nI don't like to conflate Mordekaiser with the rest of the shadow isles champions, as he doesn't come from there.\nHe uses them and the black mist, however he orginates from Valoran and at that a place that now has become Noxus.\nI try to tie him to both factions in that way. \nHe is undead so he's obviously tied to Shadow Isles, but his magic is Red - a color associated with Noxian empire.\n\nThat, plus art reasons.\nNotice what colors I was using - Red, orange and brown.\nColors associated with... Autumn. A season of Decay, which is one of the main design directions I was taking with this Mordekaiser.\n... Plus they just kinda fit together nicely.\n\nSo yeah - to stand out, also decay and evil and stuff.\n\n... I guess one could also use that to parallel him and Swain, who also uses red-coloured magic and who is probably going to be his main rival in the future.\n\nEDIT:\nOne more argument for red - lore specifically says Mordekaiser ranks above the other undead in power, so that could be another reason to draw a line between the two.\nMordekaiser corrupting the souls and turning them red upon touch would indicate his power and malice - if his touch alone can taint a soul, how powerful is he?\n\nEDIT2:\nI like my Mordekaiser unique and Red is a color of magic used only by Swain for now. There is obviously Vlad, but his magic is red because of blood.
