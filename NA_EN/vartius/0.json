Do anything during matches.\r\nAnd one quick look at [Champion.gg](http://champion.gg/champion/Mordekaiser/Top) confirms that it&#039;s not just me having a hard time winning:\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DhwG2Wi.png\r\nMordekaiser&#039;s winrate is falling, so is his pickrate. _(47.81% win ratio)_\r\nCurrently he is at 52nd out of 52 ranks in overall role placement based on performance.\r\nHis average KDA is _4.68 / 6.07 / 5.67._\r\nAnd one can see no buffs or changes on the horizon.\r\nI was never the one to ask for buffs, but this is bothering me.\r\nIs there anything in store for Mordekaiser, or will we have to wait for his rework...?\r\n_... After all he must be somewhere there, after Irelia, Aatrox, Akali, Nunu, Kayle&amp;Morgana, etc._","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2018-02-02T19:58:20.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly just looks like preseason settling down.
