It&#039;s already heavily represented in League and there is not much more you can do with it, without making it feel flat or not overly original. Of course it is possible... But isn&#039;t it better to explore more options?\r\n\r\nHis old thing... **Metalomancy**. \r\nIt&#039;s original, or at least not featured with any other League champion, and has a lot of potential... Does it fit though? How would he learn metalomancy? Getting it through his resurrection wouldn&#039;t explain much - necromancy fits much better in this regard (the learning process could be changed though). \r\nIt also doesn&#039;t fit either the tyrant or the death knight side of his theme.\r\n\r\nPain manipulation? It&#039;s interesting, to say the least. Once again - no other champ in league has that (There are sadistic champs who enjoy pain, but none who can controll it).\r\nIt would fit his identity, could be explained through his resurrection. It also combos extremely well with his warrior side and could potentially make for some great abilities. \r\n\r\nOut of the three I have to say I like the third option best... _However. What about different magic types - ones he didn&#039;t have before?_\r\n\r\nLets start with one his ult is most based on:\r\n**Soul Manipulation**.\r\nSoul Manipulation is a lot like Pain Manipulation and Necromancy combined. _Combined_ is the imporatant part.\r\nAs many have pointed out before; Mordekaiser has some serious issues with theme-overload. Making Mordekaiser control both Pain AND use necromancy would add more trouble.\r\nCombining two themes and creating a single one with traits from both removes that issue.\r\nSoul Manipulation would also fit Mordekaiser&#039;s other characteristics, especially that of an Overlord. \r\n***\r\nNext - A theme much less unique and original, but very versatile and fitting both Mordekaiser&#039;s idenity and even moreso his lore.\r\n**Witchfire / Dark Flames / Corrupted Flames** - however you want to call it.\r\nMordekaiser&#039;s body was burned on a pyre. Would be pretty poetic if he used a corrupted version of the flames, which were meant to destroy him. It&#039;d also make for some amazing visuals.\r\n***\r\nSpeaking of Magic birthed from his death and resurrection...\r\nYou know how Morde is made of this **black smoke thing**? How about using that?\r\nThe black spilling out, embueing his weapon and used to damage his foes. Could be used for some extremely cool visuals and abilities.\r\n***\r\nRelated to the previous one: **Black Mist manipulation**.\r\nVisually it would work like the previous idea, but the lore implications would be different:\r\nMordekaiser is shown to be above other Shadow Isles undead, who are controlled by the Mist.\r\nControlling the Mist would fit this idea a lot.\r\n***","replies":[{"poster":"Delarthian","date":"2018-05-10T16:39:37.737+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I, for one, will allow myself to disagree with your propositions, good sir.\nMordekaiser has had many conflicting themes throughout the rich history of league of legends, this man is like Teddy Roosevelt - he did almost everything a human being could hope to experience and/or achieve during their brief lifetime.\nThe past themes, as we all know included:\n- Marvel comics' Magneto.\n- Walking metal referrence.\n- Sexually deprived leatherman.\n- Edgy bodybuilder.\nNow, Mordekaiser was not the 26th president of the united states, but neither was Roosevelt a sexually deprived leatherman, so it evens out and my metaphor holds true.\nWhen going for a new theme fitting a rework, one must pay good attention to the past to make the champ still very familiar to the veteran players and their playerbase all while injecting their character with new and innovative ideas that could allow them to stand out in the ever-expanding crowd that is the league of legends champion pool.\nSo I asked myself, what does a modern league player living in the era of the 8th season think of when you tell them \"Mordekaiser\"?\n\nSo I made a survey, collecting answers from mordekaiser mains and non-morde plebians alike to find some very interesting ideas from the community:\n1. The first thing that popped in our subjects' minds was: \"Morde who?\"\n2. Noone amongst the questioned seemed to particularly care about the lore, metal puns or Adam Harrington's sexy deep voice.\n3. The most well-known thing about Mordekaiser turned out to be the controversial book \"Mordekaiser: A Tale Of Bugs\", a collection of folklore legends telling of times when Mordekaiser refused to obey the code of the game.\n\nAfter procrastinating on r/leagueoflegends for three hours straight, I came back to my study and came to an oddly good conclusion.\nI think Mordekaiser should be an insectomancer.\nWe sure as hell do have bugs in league (Kha'Zix and Azir), but we have no bug-controlling champion.\nAnd so I think that Mordekaiser's magick should focus on the manipulation of bugs, bending the rules of the game to his advantage and bringing pestilence to his enemies.\n\nScreams will be heard behind everyone's computer screens as mordekaiser slowly crawles out of the game to take revenge on the poor souls that dared to click more than once.","replies":[{"poster":"Vartius","date":"2018-05-10T16:47:49.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"...
