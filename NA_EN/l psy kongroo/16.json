However this creates the paradoxical situation of &quot;I need to ward, but our lack of wards makes it too dangerous for me to ward&quot;. Going to ward as a support should not be so risky, especially when 90% of throws happen because people get caught out. \n\nSupports should be rewarded (tee hee, pun) for doing their job properly. So I was thinking, what if Ruby Sightstone, the Sightstone upgrade item, increased the range on your ability to ward by, say, 30%? The exact number is debatable, but the point is warding would no longer be so much of a gamble in an already snowbally game.\n\nAnd for those thinking \"well, this is what blue trinkets are for!\" think again, because supports almost never buy that trinket. They almost always buy the red one in order to control vision for the team, taking out opposing wards around key places on the map.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-02T16:13:03.385+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think that the Ruby should have extended ward range - I would just prefer if the damned wards recharged in the field.

It could help after a small fight and trying not to get caught off, though.\n\nWhat if it was cumulative? The time added onto the ward is equal to the respawn time for each enemy assist/kill. So let's say your wards have 15s left and you get a kill, and they're back up in 10s. Your wards are now at 25s. And then an assist on someone else, another 10s.\n\nThat way it's additive and scales with the time for when the enemy is waiting to respawn.","replies":[{"poster":"volvagia46","date":"2017-01-04T07:58:42.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice age of empires reference","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Adriqnohee","date":"2017-01-02T21:53:47.807+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be very helpful after picks that translate into dragons/baron.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Synnx7","date":"2017-01-02T18:46:43.500+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":21,"body":"Fuck no\nI dont want this cancer {{champion:64}}  to close distances even further","replies":[{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-01-02T18:57:07.128+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"But... he'd be buying less damage and somewhat less tankyness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2017-01-02T19:15:31.176+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"wouldnt he still be limited by the range of his dash anyway?","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-01-02T23:49:21.110+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"His current dash is about 100ish units further than the yellow trinket/sightstone range.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-01-02T16:04:21.394+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then it would force people to upgrade into Ruby, and the benefits from the eye items would be outweighed.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-02T16:09:16.493+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LostFr0st,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Y1nzrWNy,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-02T16:04:21.394+0000)\n>\n> Then it would force people to upgrade into Ruby, and the benefits from the eye items would be outweighed.\n\nThe changes to Face of the Mountain already made Eye of Targon invalid when compared to the double shield of the Face.
