The idea was solid, but handing people champs they don't own and flounder with in any given lane, in this community, usually ends up in the most Sodium Chloride inducing toxic games I have ever had the displeasure of crawling through. The games take a long time because nobody can decide who to give, the champs have been quite unknown, and everything feels like it is in slow motion for ninety percent of the team with the other ten percent being those that actually know the champ they got. I know the point is to try to screw the team to the wall with bad picks, but on this scale, it just isn't fun. The better choice would have been The Twisted Treeline for this mode in my opinion because it would have allowed for people to break up into groups they thought could work together while also bringing the scale and average time of the game down.
