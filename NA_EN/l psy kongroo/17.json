Like a certain famous Italian plumber bounces off his enemies. \n\nIt&#039;s not a very large distance, but I think it would be a neat buff to let Teemo use his shrooms as escape trampolines. Shrooms last a while, so he could, for example, drop one in a bush where the enemies have no vision, bait someone into chasing him towards said bush, then secretly bounce over a wall, making the enemies think he stealthed inside the bush instead. \n\nThe downside would be that if an enemy saw Teemo bounce, they&#039;d know where his shrooms would be. But that&#039;s why I would make it so he only bounces if you activate his W beforehand, so you could still run over shrooms without bouncing if you needed the damage. It makes logical sense too, since Teemo would need the extra speed to perform his leap.\n\nI dunno, I know Teemo&#039;s not a popular champion to want to buff, but I thought it might be a fun thing to add.","replies":[{"poster":"BestPudgeNA","date":"2018-11-08T21:33:20.819+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow just what this game needs more mobility.
