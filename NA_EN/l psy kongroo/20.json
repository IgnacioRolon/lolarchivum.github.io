Furthermore, since both classes are in the same game it is a completely valid argument to ask \"what about adcs that can simply right click without running out of their 'resource'\".  \n\nMages are not a problem in League of Legends right now.  A mage is not picked in every single game, but an ADC is chosen virtually every game by both teams---sometimes more than one per team.  This should express a fundamental problem with the game when the most dominant class for the last 8 seasons has been relatively untouched, while others receive constant tweaks/nerfs/changes, etc.  \n\nIf I said \"sure, you'll nerf mages but what about Blue Essence\", well, that would be a bad argument, but when one thing directly impacts another, it's valid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2018-04-19T02:32:13.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol.
