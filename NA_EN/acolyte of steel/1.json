His R is his namesake; its what he lived and died to achieve as a Harbinger of Oblivion.\n\nWithout global VO on his ult, you no longer get to revel in the sense of utter condemnation - of knowing an all-powerful Lich from the beyond wants nothing more than to see your flesh wither away, and your soul depart from all that you love, *with* or *without* your permission!\n\n\n\n* You lose HP constantly, but this - this is a blight upon humanity... This is the definition of an accursed soul. This is a *hex* targeted at your *very living*  ***breath!***\n\nListen, and feel the *malice* in the very marrow of your bones! \n{{champion:30}}  [\"Feel the frailty of Life!\"](http://puu.sh/gp9d0/b9c107f6f2.mp3)\n{{champion:30}} [\"Listen, and rejoice in death!\"](http://puu.sh/gp9oR/27a4573011.mp3)\n{{champion:30}} [\"Gaze upon me and despair!\"](http://puu.sh/gp9ez/1f601fba75.mp3)\n{{champion:30}} [\"Behold, your undoing!\"](http://puu.sh/gp9cl/cf30df5385.mp3)\n{{champion:30}}  [\"Cease to be!\"](http://puu.sh/gp9t8/a457597699.mp3)\n{{champion:30}} [\"Sing, with your final breath!\"](http://puu.sh/gp9zI/9931b6ae23.mp3)\n(All are working now lol)\n\nWhen you R as Karthus, you should be able to feel the fear glowing off of your enemies; when you're rooted to cast your blackened, necromatic magick upon all who dare to defy the purity of Undeath, at the least they should be allowed to hear their final ultimatum! Let their hearts *sink* as their souls are set free from their frail, fleshy prisons! \n\n*No one* escapes from the purging release of Death. No matter who or where you are, the Harbinger of Oblivion's words will echo through all that lives and dies on Runeterra! Such is the mere nature of Death and Demise...\n\n\n...\nhttp://th02.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2014/187/9/d/pentakill_by_gido-d7pkhpf.jpg\nAt the very least, can we all agree it's not metal enough?\n**I don't think it's metal enough.
