Maybe I&#039;m wrong but this seems like something that would fall into the category of little to no counterplay. Trading in lane against a garen as a melee bruiser basically reduces your entire  HP amount by ( ~ X % ) because let&#039;s say someone&#039;s ult does 25% Max HP as an execute  / {{champion:86}}  {{champion:555}}  / than if my HP is at 2000 that means I really have 1500 HP when trading with them specifically, because once they push you below that HP threshold and cast their ult you are deleted if you don&#039;t have Zhyonas, Guardian Angel, or well timed Stopwatch. Plus this only becomes stronger with the Coup De Grace rune.\n\n{{item:3026}} {{item:3157}} {{item:2423}} \n\nOf course to identify a problem without proposing a solution is pointless, so I would say that maybe these % abilities should be converted to flat damage amounts. I was initially going to say increase their flat damage and remove the execute factor but I would want to + AD or + AP in this burst meta. \n\nThere is always another fix towards an issue so I might be looking at this through a bias perspective since I was 1 v 1&#039;ing a Garen in lane once and once we were both low I completely forgot about his ult and BAM! His damage was too consistent. The same situation with pyke because I was deleted by a 0 /4 pyke simply because it didn&#039;t matter how much he farmed or was ahead, it was simply whether I was below a certain amount of HP","replies":[]}
