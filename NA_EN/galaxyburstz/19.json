However, it wouldn't be as great as possible if I didn't share it with you, so here I am to explain to you what I found.\n\nIn League there are 8 different boots to purchase\n{{item:3006}} {{item:3117}} {{item:3009}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3020}} {{item:2422}} {{item:3111}} \n\nBut actually there are 9 !\n\nYou see, the new footwear I will call Adaptive Runners\nWhy do I call it that? You might ask... because these boots give you the following stats depending on what type of damage your champion has more stats of either AP or AD\n\nAdaptive Runners [ Boots Item / Limit One ]\n\nStats:\n- 20 Ability Power or 14 Attack Damage [ Adaptive ]\n- Unique Passive: + 45 Movement Speed\n- Unique Passive: Reduces all summoner spell cooldowns by 10%\n\nHow do you unlock this item? Well it actually requires a series of steps, cheat codes you might call them.\n\n1 You must take the Sorcery Rune as either your second or first pathway\n2 You must take the Transcendence Rune\n3 You must enter a Summoners Rift or ARAM match and obtain at least 30% CDR through items without any boot related items [ Can take 2 - 3 Items ]\n4 Reach Level 10 on your champion in the match\n5 Purchase Ionian Boots of Lucidity\n6 Enjoy your hybrid adaptive damage boots","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Shabbos","date":"2019-06-16T01:13:32.525+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ionian + Shard + Transcendence + Blue Buff = %40 right there.

So none of that is effected. The extra 5% you'd need comes with the rune.","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-04-22T05:12:23.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, you're right there ( I read over the rune )\n\nI guess I'll edit that  out of the steps ( ty 4 advice )","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
