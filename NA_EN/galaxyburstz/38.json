You attempted to exert control over other players because of a ban you didn't like. He then did the same to you when you appeared to be displaying toxic behavior. If you believe the other person should be punished, then so should you. \n\nThe other thing you could have done is communicate with that player in a mature manner. If they did indeed prove to be toxic, then you report them at the end of play for any number of options.\n\nYou're going to find players that do this. That's what the report system is in place for. Ultimately, it's not going to impact your placement very much, as you will climb only up to where your skill level caps out. One game out of 10 you had a negative experience. I say that's not half bad in a community rife with toxic players. You just learn to shrug it off, take a break, or become toxic yourself. Hopefully, you don't fall into the latter.","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-02-03T04:27:22.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the response.

I don't think you understand what he was saying. You really don't understand what the other player was doing. Perhaps he bans Xin most games, and didn't want the other team to pick him first. Perhaps he's really good at Soraka jungle and has stats to back this up. The point of the post is that you don't really know and are just making speculation based on minimal information. Both Xin mid and Soraka jungle are not meta, and thus are typically called troll picks. In higher elo, both can easily be punished. He was using sarcasm to show that you were just speculating.\n\nOverall, it's not worth getting this upset over. People are going to troll. People are going to dodge. Best just to move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-02-03T05:01:06.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I checked their op.gg beforehand and they were an absolute feeder.
