But the message really brightened up my day just because of the acknowledgement of my successes. This is especially true when I just lost a ranked game duo to the usual afk support at 4 minutes and the inting top / adc duo. It just isn't fun getting 29 kills and solo'ing baron 6 times and then losing after 50 minutes of highly invested time. \n\nSo, I just want to say **you're welcome Riot, you're very welcome!**\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}
