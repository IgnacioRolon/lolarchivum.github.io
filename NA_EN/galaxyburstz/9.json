It is a great passive that works in unison with  many champions kits, especially the jungle and top lane rosters, because of the waveclear and survivability stats that are provided in both the basic and upgraded items, it has become a staple item purchase for most tanks and some bruisers.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n{{item:3751}} \r\nUNIQUE – IMMOLATE: Deals 6 − 23 (based on level) magic damage per second to nearby enemies. Deals 「 100% bonus 」 magic damage to minions and monsters (325 range).\r\n{{item:3068}} \r\nUNIQUE – IMMOLATE: Deals 26 − 43 (based on level) magic damage per second to nearby enemies.

Deals 「 300% bonus 」 magic damage to minions and monsters (325 range).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are certain downsides to purchasing {{item:3751}} , similiar to those of buying a {{item:3077}}, which include uncontrollable waveclear which can cause loss of wave management/manipulation when positioned within a specific radius of minions, or by simply drawing aggro from epic monsters, minions, champions, jungle camps, and turret structures. I was wondering if we could give the items non-aura AOE passive a toggle feature ( that could possibly be level locked for utilization compensation ) to give more variety to the play styles of champions who benefit from this.     \r\n\r\nI recently noticed how a Poppy player hit the blastcone into the elder dragon with low HP, but her sunfire cape drew Dragon aggro and slowed her just giving the enemy Kha'Zix enough time to leap over and finish her. Maybe she could have switched off the aura and survived; the same thing happened to a Mundo recently who was attacking the enemy turret but hadn't realized that the tower had targetted him since an enemy came into range.\r\n\r\n: )","replies":[]}
