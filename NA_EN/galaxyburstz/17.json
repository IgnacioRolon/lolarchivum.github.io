Q Blinding Dart = E Condemn ( Both can apply effects Blind/Stun )\n\n2. W Move Quick = Night Hunter Passive ( Both grant an MS buff )\n\n3. E Toxic Shot = W Silver Bolts ( Both are passive abilities )\n\n4. Camouflage Passive = Ultimate Stealth on Q ( Both grant a temporary stealth form )\n\n5. They are both insanely popular and notoriously hated when selected in the top lane and have very similar kits which can be considered to be very irritating to play against...\n\n6. They both synergize with and gain from items that apply on hit effects and give MS boosts ( {{item:3153}} {{item:3124}}{{item:3094}} )\n\n7. Teemo was designed by a group of Riot employees, primarily 3 Rioters, all led by Riot Ezreal. Meanwhile Vayne was crafted by the senior designer Riot Volty who also made 11 other champions for all roams. These two were released separately by 2 different Rioters, and even though it was likely that they worked together it seems doubtful to myself that they would intentionally release the two with such similarities and no underlying cause in the lore...\n\n8. Before the Teemo test rework was released on the PBE, about a month or two ago, it was rumored that they would change Teemo's movequick passive ability into a short range summersault like a single rotation Rammus Q or a cute baby armadillo. Although this was not the case upon his reveal, it would've been pretty astounding to see Teemo with a tumble - like W spell...\n\n9. Are typically fun to play as, but quite a fair share of people tend to hate to play against them in most circumstances...\n\nI don't know, I'm just pointing this out to give a more outside - the - box perspective on the gameplay and League's lore aspect of the game; what are your thoughts on this? Do they have a unique relationship like Kayn &amp; Zed or was this completely coincidental? Separated at Birth? Could Riot build a narrative out of this? This isn't anything serious but is just something that caught my attention recently...so take it with a grain of salt...","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-03-22T15:03:03.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the dumbest thing","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-22T15:58:05.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rathar Dashing,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=dBIyykgQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-03-22T15:03:03.683+0000)\n>\n> This is the dumbest thing\n\nHow? Explain how expressing my thoughts isn't quite the intelligent thing ty\n\n1. TL;DR Vayne &amp; Teemo are quite similar in playstyle and kits, could they have been taught something or learned something from a similar source? ( Kayn and Zed, have a primary AOE ability, have a single ability that is launched in a straight line and deals damage to all those in that target range, and both of their ultimates grant temporary invulnerability, and their both assassins, have been played in the midlane by proplay, they have damage and assassination potential, have a built in ability that allows them to cross terrain, not to mention that according to lore and a few posts in Story, Art, &amp; Sound quickly after the lore between Zed and Kayn was confirmed it was said that Zed saw himself in Kayn and is now his master / coach / trainer / teacher / instructor, while Kayn is his current apprentice, so they have similar playstyles and a unique relationship between each other that only a few other champions have {{champion:498}} {{champion:497}} or {{champion:99}} {{champion:517}} or {{champion:236}} {{champion:412}} or {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}}  and many more complex family structures in the game... )\n\nJust wondering why this can't happen between Vayne &amp; Teemo, would like a short concise explanation / response in preferably 5 words\nTy","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-03-22T17:15:09.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is Game Theory level of stretching the facts.\nKai'Sa and Vayne have more in common than Teemo and Vayne.

In fact Riot hasn't specified that they are not related to each other so we are both on an equal level I guess.  I'm just theory crafting -  not stating facts.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2019-03-22T13:05:49.830+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice shitpost.
