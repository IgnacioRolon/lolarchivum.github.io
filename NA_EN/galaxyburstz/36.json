Anyway, I bought the mastery upgrade and said I will grind M7 over the next week or two.\r\n\r\nTurns out it was much quicker than that, just woke up and played all my first 3 games of the day as Riven, got my 3 level 7 mastery tokens, and yeah now that I abused her for some easy mastery points I can say that she needs a bit of fixing, don't know how to adjust her I just know that some adjusting needs to be done.\r\n\r\nYou know a champ is good when you go M5 to M7 in less than 10 games, meanwhile Katarina took me 1 months of infrequent gameplay and learning how to cs on her. I was highly opposed to her getting nerfed but now I'm wondering if anyone got tickets to the \" Riven is Broken Train \" or if that ship already set sail.","replies":[]}
