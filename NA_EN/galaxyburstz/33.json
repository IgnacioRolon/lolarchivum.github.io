We have a Jax Top vs Shyvana Top, a great counter to her AA's is his counterstrike. Anyway I gank top 4 times as Poppy while she is literally attacking our tower and Jax is literally last hitting minions next to her like she is not even there. She didn't have flash ( Smite / TP ) and had 90 C's at 10 minutes while he had 29 cs at 12 minutes and was 3 levels behind and was 0 / 7 ...\r\n\r\nEventually Shyvana 8 / 0 with 176 cs at 19 minutes has destroyed her entire lane and took the inhibitor solo because we couldn't even 3 v 1 her. I camped bot and had to sacrifice my Triforce rush for a ZZ Rot to hold top then rotate a siege with portal on botlane. Our ADC popped off however and we won a 4 v 5 team fight at around 45 minutes and let my team run down mid as I took all of bot immediately following the ACE ( 4 v 5 since Jax was taking gromp on the other side of the map )\r\n\r\nAnyway, just seems a little suspicious that the one player with a should - be dominant lane, 0 - 7 at 10 minutes, and 23 cs at 10 minutes, and non team fighting would show up in my promos...\r\n\r\nIn the end, this game + my free win made me happy and got me promoted, and maybe it was just a test to see if I really deserved to win and go up\r\n\r\n\r\nOh who cares, I'm just another bad Iron player...\r\n\r\nIf you actually read my post this far than ty and have a great rest of your life...","replies":[]}
