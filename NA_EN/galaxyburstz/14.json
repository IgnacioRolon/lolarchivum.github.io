The developer said they messed up and released the weapon too soon and without good counters. It looks like Fortnite's Infinity Blade is not so infinite after all.","url":"https://www.altchar.com/games-news/583785/epic-remove-the-infinity-blade-from-fortnite","image":"https://static.altchar.com/live/media/images/625x416_ct/11843_Infinity_Blade_Fortnite_30e5fe7e3e2fd3e544062b74a199588e.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fortnite&#039;s Infinity Blade removed, Epic says it &#039;messed up&#039; \nAfter days of fan outrage, Epic rethinks its strategy toward the item...\n\nSeems like Riot could learn a lesson from the company of a highly successful game that stole half of its streamers, of course all of these games are being governed by the same parent company ( Tencent bought a 40 percent stake in Epic at a valuation of about $825 million back when &ldquo;Fortnite&rdquo; was still in its early stages of development, and Tencent also owns Clash of Clans, Ubisoft, Supercell, Clash Royale, Rainbow Six Siege, PubG ) ...\n\nI have only been playing this game for 2 years and actually believe that it has been the most fun game I have ever played as well as the most tilting thing I have ever continued doing after being provoked to quit several times... maybe if damage is too high all champions and items should have damaged reduced by the same % to completely balance out the whole game...","replies":[]}
