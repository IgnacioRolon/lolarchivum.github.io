But one day we were renovating and lost the speakers connection cord. Ever since 3 years ago I have played the game in complete silence which has helped me focus and learn more about this MOBA quickly. Anyway, last night we found the missing cord after years of searching and it worked perfectly so we set it up and listened to some music. Little did my family know that I had more than just music on my mind, I wanted to hear the sounds of the Rift once more, the satisfaction from hearing Everybody Dies; Some Just Need A Little Help, was what I wanted.\r\n\r\nThe second I heard the Queue waiting resonance, the Click or Hover sound, the Match Accept button, Welcome to Summoners Rift, and the Ocean Drake roaring I was overfilled with Nostalgic emotions and felt amazed.\r\n\r\nI eventually just turned the volume off completely though since I found it very distracting and difficult to not be confused by the audio effects like pings and voice lines, just a short story I thought I would share.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else not play with their volume on?","replies":[]}
