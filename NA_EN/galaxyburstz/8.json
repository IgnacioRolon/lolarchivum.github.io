I was top lane against an urgot blah blah blah\r\n\r\nAnyway at 16 minutes as I am recalling under tower Urgot begins to TP back to lane and my computer screen freezes. I immediately realize that if I stand still or am afk he will poke me with q and eventually ult me and put himself at a lead, so I unplug my computer and restart it. After 7 anxious minutes I finally return to the rift, my team has 31 kills, they have 7, we end the game simply by running down mid after I solo splitpushed bot lane and took both the inhib tower and inhibitor. We run  it down and end it with much of my help. \r\n\r\nWhat I hadn&#039;t realized was that by ending the game quickly I was harming myself for the sake of my team and was put on the 5 game 20 minute queue time suspension and the victory was counted as a loss against myself. \r\n\r\nW: 0\r\nL: 1\r\n\r\nGive me back my win, I did not int or be toxic or intentionally leave the game and was punished for doing so, I have already had a 2 week suspension on my account 3 months ago but that was because I was intentionally stalling a game to get 60 kills, which I came so close too, now that I have reformed I am expected to do the opposite to avoid punishment?\r\n\r\nOr maybe I&#039;m just wrong...do I really deserve this?","replies":[{"poster":"Gilgayu","date":"2019-01-30T01:50:59.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I was harming myself for the sake of my team\n\nIf you helped your team win, were you actually harming yourself? According to what you said, it was possible that you lost that game if you never reconnected.\n\nTrue, the afk penalty isn't what you deserve, but it was what you got. The system isn't perfect, nothing is. What if another person had the exact damage output, damage to turrets, kda, etc. but he raged quit instead of sacrificing for his team. Then he came back after 7 minutes, realizing the awful thing he did...\nDoes he deserve a higher queue time? I would argue yes. \n\nRiot can't tell things like that from simply in-game stats. This might be a \"bug,\" but it isn't one that can be fixed even if you give Riot another decade.\n\nNo, you don't deserve that lose whatsoever. You did the right thing, an honorable thing. But think about it another way:\nBecause of your action, you granted 4 wins and got a lost.\nBecause of your action, four other people can enjoy that game and type ggwp.\n\nBecause of your action, you got an unfair punishment\n__But it's okay__\nNothing is perfect, what if this thing was to happen to someone else, but probability landed on you?\nThen it would mean you granted 9 wins and got only 1 lost.\n\nHeck, worth it.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-01-30T06:52:33.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but when I disconnected my team was 30 vs 7, and my KDA was 0/0/0, however I won the next 7 games in a row with Xin Zhao jungle but only climbed to Iron 2 ( 100 LP currently ) \n\nThat first game was a deciding factor between myself being 3 ranks higher and it really set me behind even though my team won I still get a loss for a 6 minute DC lol \n\nAnyway, thanks for the feedback, I'm not gonna send this to Riot Support since they talk like robots, and I'm just going to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Gilgayu","date":"2019-01-30T12:12:57.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm currently b4.
