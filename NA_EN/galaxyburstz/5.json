If we did receive this possibility  through whatever means are taken to achieve it then there might be some more issues created, or we may simply run into a continuous paradox. \n\nFor solo carrying to be possible in a MOBA, you must be a better player at decision making, hero/champion mechanics, timing, reaction speed, itemization, shot calling, vision gaining, team utility, landing abilities, farming/ acquiring gold income / resources, pathing, have a balanced/calm mental state, counter picking, making basic logical laning plans, foresight to some extent, positioning, environment awareness, game knowledge / sense, understanding of synergies, and many other skills. It is because of these talents that people can be considered a better player than another person who plays the same game, mastering certain abilities can have a more profound effect on the outcome of your ELO in contrast to another skill, like how a support is more likely to be considered a better support player if they have mastered the art of gaining, removing, and scouting vision for their team over last hitting minions, a skill that they may have to use but no as much. \n\nAnyway, many claim that the reason they cannot climb is because feeders on their teams prohibiting their successful climb to the top, unfortunately in games with an ELO / MMR based system like this, you sometimes need the skill of a player several divisions above your current tier to be able to pull yourself to a certain limit, like swimming against the current. Salmon have to try many times to swim upstream to return home but eventually they either do or die, in the same way Faker can hop on a brand new account and to take it to Challenger Rank while I may get stuck in Silver\n\nMy main point is, if Solo Carrying becomes possible than feeders become more of a problem. If I'm better than the person on the enemy team, but there is a person on the enemy team that is equal to me in  skill than which ever team has the person that gives the stronger opponent resources will throw the game to make it one sided, since the better player deserves to win. This problem may hold both of the players back from climbing. Also some champions will become more problematic than others since I assume that most people who want to be able to solo carry games aren't planning on hopping on Sona as soon as it becomes possible, they are more likely to pick hyper carries and destroy their opponents to smash that LP\n\nI see this happening around me quite a bit, one of my friends mains rammus, thresh, and master Yi. I asked him about how to deal with master Yi because after a couple of items no matter how far you threw him off he can comeback into the game, and he just told me not to deal with it but to be what people have to deal with. Not surprisingly, he played master Yi in his Diamond 1 promos 2 days ago and is Grandmaster 20 something LP now\n\nAnother friend just got his fourth account to Platinum 4 but his first account that he made 5 years ago is still stuck in bronze since he said that he would not just waste time attempting to change the MMR on that account \n\n\n\n> TL;DR \n\nIf you can solo carry a game at an ELO, than the person / people you smash will be considered to be the feeders that are holding back their teammates, in the same way, if you have feeders on your team than the game is more strongly in favor of the enemies since their stronger player will be better than you\n( Many people hate playing one sided games [ where they get absolutely demolished ] with no possibility of a comeback, but sometimes these same players advocate for solo carrying to be more possible / accessible while not seeing the hypocrisy in their statements, other champions will become more seemingly abusable and problematic ) Solo carrying is still possible if you deserve to be much higher, you just have to play the right champions [ the broken ones that for some reason aren't receiving nerfs ], however don't expect the climb to gold 1 to be easy if you only have the skill to reach and maintain Gold 1, you would have the skill of a Plat 3 + to make it there without a lot of effort and grinding  \n\n\n( I'm very open to constructive criticism and I am more than likely wrong somewhere but I aside from that I believe that if games were solo able to be solo carried than we would run into a paradox that would not be healthy for the game )","replies":[]}
