Also, correct me if I'm wrong at all on any fact, I am very open to constructive criticism and it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBackstory: So I started playing League today last year because I was tired of reading those memes and not understanding them, I then leveled up to Level 30 maining Lucian Mid {{champion:236}}, after I hit Level 40 I realized the game is more fun to play when you use and learn a variety of champions rather than a one trick. I played several more mid lane assassins {{champion:103}}  {{champion:84}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}}, I cluelessly played these champions loving how quickly they could delete someone in mid-late game if they properly farmed, killed, and itemized to the enemies team composition (with the exception of Aurelion Sol and Ap Bard Mid). I watched a video and loved how flashy and spectacular Katarina's {{champion:55}}  kit looked and decided to pick her up, play her up to 60k mastery points, buy all of her non-legendary skins, buy Deathsworn &amp; Project when they were in my shop and now I just want one thing: A Level 7 Mastery. \n\nI learned that the way the grading system works is that your CS/minute, K/D/A, objectives taking, vision control, and many other hidden underlying factors give you a grade corresponding to how others do in your role with that same champion. I played Yasuo {{champion:157}} and recieved 2 mastery shard to lvl 6 mastery only 6 games apart (went 40/1/4 504 cs and 35/3/18 with 371 cs) but I'm not upgrading those (yet) as I don't main Yasuo. I went 32/2/13 as Katarina mid with 290 cs at 45 minutes and only got an A + (cs was low but obtaining cs i hard in the early game without constantly being poked by a smart player, just wait until the minions are low and throw a Q then wait for the cooldown and repeat while melee'ing the front non-castor minions. I recently went 21/1/9 and 18/1/16 and recieved an A + in both games, like I'm being held back from gaining those Lvl 6 Mastery Tokens. I am no good player, just popped off in a few games and am not rewarded. I did my research and learned that supports assists count as kills, plus non tank supports and 100% of ADC's have low base health so there are double the amount of people to easily and quickly kill. I know Katarina {{champion:55}} roams to bot lane a lot because she snowballs off of kills, so with my 1000 Bronze 4 Iq I said why not bring her to the bot lane and not have her leave her main lane for some kills. I also learned that since your preformance is compared to other splayers preformance in those roles, than most people would be trolling with Katarina support or ADC. Turns out : No  \n\n29/1/12 as support Katarina with full support item at 45 minutes: A + \n26/3/14 as support Katarina with full support Item at 37 minutes: A +\n\nPlease tell me how a total of 29 + 12 = 41 kills as Katarina support doesn't give you an S +\nOr Maybe Katarina Supports are all just challenger smurfs with busted AF K/D/A ratios, making it impossible to get an S + on her.\nAlso, I know it isn't impossible because I know 4 people who have Lvl 7 masteries on Kat. I just guess I'll have to keep grinding games.                                                              \n                                             {{champion:55}} {{summoner:14}} {{champion:55}} {{summoner:14}} {{champion:55}} {{summoner:14}}{{champion:55}}  \n\nDiscuss.    ^ _ ^","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2018-10-26T21:13:11.218+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know the feel. was trying to get at least S- with {{champion:133}} but every game i did exceptionally well on the grade system just says \"fuck you A+\" so i just gave up on that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PickleLorde","date":"2018-10-27T00:33:03.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also love going 19/3/19 as Jayce and having double the amount of damage of anyone else in the game, then getting A+.

So for example they would take top percentage in the region, and say he's bronze so cs is flexible by a small amount, vision, map awareness, etc. They do this because smurfs are capable of making that top percentage irrefutable and so that if the champ isn't played much in the elo that it isn't just magically easier to create a Smurf account and get m7 on every champ because you will always play better than bronze if you are diamond plus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bløød Zerø","date":"2018-10-27T18:51:49.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh you first and foremost problem I didn't write in my comment was your inability to close the game. To get a good grade they look at the length of the game. If it doesn't end fast enough then it shows you lack the prowess to close a game early despite being very ahead. So the longer the game goes the amount you need to make an s get vastly harder and more intense. But if you could get half your kda you get in half the time you spent playing the game and then end it you would most likely get an s more easily than a 45 minute game...","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2018-10-29T19:34:56.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE:  Yes, I just finished a game in 21 minutes as Katarina with 201 cs and 16/1/5 in lane.

Kat is difficult cus she either does extremely well or horribly bad. So getting an s would mean breaking limits and being better than a plat kat main averaged out stats most probably. Maybe when playing support Kat actually build supporty. Twin shadows, locket of iron solari and then your regular assassin items. Or try jungle Kat and remember to counter if and take enemy camps and scuttles.

Because there are just not that many people playing them, as well as since they are not meta, most people probably don't perform that well on them and so the reference benchmark for S on those champs would become considerably lower.\n\n........\n\nLastly, the system has a heavy CS bias.
