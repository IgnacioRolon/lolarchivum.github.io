Follow the immediate instructions at your own expense\n\n1 Be M5 on any non support oriented champion\n2 Have over 7k BE at your disposal\n3 Have {{summoner:12}}  and {{summoner:14}}  summoner spells unlocked\n4 Have your normals mmr below silver 1\n5 Enter a normals blindpick game and take TP &amp; Ignite summoner spells\n6 Select your champion and take them into a solo lane either mid or top ( only person who can consistently clear the jungle at 10+ cs/ minute is Master Yi )\n7 Attain perfect cs within lane and maintain above 9 cs per minute \n8 only roam to select guaranteed kills and take 2 minion waves and 1 - 2 jungle camps on your way back to lane\n9 whenever you enter a side lane you must fully clear two whole waves and then proceed to shove it completely under the enemies tower, the same applies to when you are leaving your lane\n10 only TP for kills or large minion waves, never for objectives\n11 Ignite to secure kills within the mid game, since you must have over 5 times your amount of deaths as kills\n12 your teammates and objectives don't matter, your kills and farm do, only base when TP is up or to buy boots\n13 your team doesn't matter when earning S's your in game score does so help your team whener you can help both the team and yourself\n14 enjoy your S tokens and chests\n15 thank me later\n\n\n\nI used this method and literally played 5 games in a row after unlocking M5 on Riven, and got M7 4 hours later, the exact same method earned me m7 on Katarina 6 games after since one was remake, I am not going for M7 on Yasuo even though I've probably got 50 S + 's on him ever since M5, literally take TP and Ignite and in my last game I almost reached 400 cs at 30 minutes but the game ended quickly\n\n\nTl;DR\n kills + cs + KDA = S tokens for non support champions\n\n assists + vision score + KDA = S for support champions","replies":[]}
