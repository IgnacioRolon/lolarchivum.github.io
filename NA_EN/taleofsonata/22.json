Up until this point, the complaints players have had haven't been about Aatrox's raw power, but about his feel, as his style of combat right now feels utterly wooden and unresponsive. His E, in particular, very clearly acts purely as a crutch for a defective Q, leading to a playstyle that is altogether janky and reliant on too many inputs to achieve comparatively simpler outputs. Buffing his numbers will certainly increase his win rate, and no doubt increase his play rate, but it won't make his core playstyle any less dysfunctional, which in the long-term is likely to make him suffer from the same issues as Galio, and lose his \"fanbase\" the moment he drops in viability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2018-06-28T13:38:35.371+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there are two QoL changes he really needs: \n\n-A biger window between Qs. Right now, if you get any CC after your first Q, you most likely won't be able to get off Q2 which means Q3 also won't happen, so you sit with nearly all your damage out of the window and a massivie CD. Aatrox should really have more time to find a good position for the next Q, especially since the range also changes with each Q.\n\n-E should not only work duering a specific window of his Q but dueing the full Q, if you use it a bit to fast or to late it fales and that sucks.\n\nAsides from that, i really think his E shouldn't have any offense tagged on, it just messes with it's usecases. It feels like it should be a pure repositioning tool either for map-mobillity by getting over terrain but mostly for landing Qs if needed. The current AD-boost means you deal less damage with Qs that hit anyway and more with Qs that needthe E for re-aiming, which imo is horrible. I think that combat-power should be moved into the rest of his kit instead, especially the ult.\n\n\nBut even then, a 3 part skill that locks you in place at every use, uses sweetspots on the far end for what's supposed to be a melee that thrives in the midst of battle and even changeing the range with each use just feels clunky.\nHaveung a single high impoact move that way would work, but a 3 part combo is just bad.

His Q times out quicker than Rivens, he only has 1 empowered basic attack every 25 seconds, and a steroid that doesn't grant a finisher. His kit also does not allow any double casting or attack animation cancelling. However you can conveniently queue basic attacks and abilities in quick succession.

It's a great goal.\n\nAs Riot said, they wanted him to be a highly skilled melee duelist who works and outsmarts his enemies, utterly decimating them by being a more skilled fighter. Fiora shares a similar fantasy, but Riot has also expressed their failure in her regard two times; her skills are two 'catch all' and there's no real skill involved to hitting weak points.\n\n#Aatrox' kit looks to succesfully accomplish this. \n\nHe's rewarded for dancing into his enemies with his Q, hitting them at just the right moment, and then dancing away from them / toying with them as they attempt to retreat and drawing them in once more. \n\nThis is also why he can't move during the cast animation; he's supposed to predict their movements / force them to go where he wants, and use his small E dash to make that happen. Being able to move at full speed would remove a lot of the 'skill' involved; just get them into the range, press button, transfer burden of skill onto his enemy.\n\nHis entire kit is designed to play around his Q and force enemies to be where you want them to be. His W is a slow and re-yank so that you can pull people into it when they think they've escaped, his E is to help reposition it when they think they're safe, and his ulti lets him get people into his ranged sweet-spot due to increased movement speed.\n\nIs he currently too weak?
