If Nasus could farm freely in lane and that all your harrass would do 0 damage on him while being able to solo kill you do you think it's fun? Do you think that letting Jax free farming without any form or way to shut him down before he gets big?

That's because there is no way to with hyperscaling champions they can splitpush, solo objectives, murder more than 1 champion at time and excel at every skirsmish, that is how strong they are in solo queue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-05-21T08:13:30.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=taleofsonata,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ftP4cOY4,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-21T02:52:09.673+0000)\n>\n> We need oppressive champion in league because there are way to shutdown specific champions.

Oppressive champions are needed in league because of ridiculously strong champions that need to be put on a leash.\n\nWell either your builds are weird enough that you are dealing no damage or you are not playing correctly against them. I have played both nasus and Jax and I have found that literally any champ with a spammable ranged ability/AA is oppressive. \n\nThere is another way to shut down specific champs, it’s called focusing. During a team fight focus that specific champ, and usually he/she can’t escape. ESPECIALLY NASUS OR JAX. Nasus has 0 escape abilities besides flash, and Jax can’t really escape from you in the jungle if he doesn’t have any wards. It is pretty hard to be a late game monster when their entire team CC chains you.\n\nEDIT: sure focusing a fed enemy ain’t the best solution, but it is one none the less.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-05-21T02:41:51.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Poppy, even in her current weakened state, is a bot lane meta defining support who directly makes certain picks/comps near unplayable with her in play.
