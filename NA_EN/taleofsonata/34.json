Compared to other spammable Qs for mid-range mages like {{champion:127}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:8}} , her damage is quite good.\n\nHer W damage isn't low either and has quite a high ratio for it being AOE and practically instant.\n\nHer R damage is quite low, and the ratio is too.  But you have to take into account that Tibbers aura and attacks deal quite a lot of damage, especially early.  Also, her W deals some (albiet small) damage when enemies attack her or Tibbers while active.\n\nAlso, Annie has one of the highest AA ranges in the game and I believe the highest mid.\n\nI don't think Annie's damage is why she hasn't aged well.\n\nI think it's more so that her kit lacks counter play.  Annie's only two strengths are having flash available and her opponents not knowing how to deal with her when she doesn't have flash available.  She can dish her entire combo in 1 second and most of her kit is near unavoidable if you're within a certain range.  I agree, she probably needs a rework, but at the same time, her kit is almost necessary to help keep assassins and divers in check.  Same with Malzahar, Lissandra, and Lulu to an extent with their point and click CC.","replies":[]}]}
