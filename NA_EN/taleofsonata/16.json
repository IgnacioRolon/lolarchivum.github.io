Now she has some AOE damage, more ways to play around her stealth and healthier gameplay overall. No, she isn't what she used to be, no she is not the one shot champion anymore and no they won't turn her rework back.","replies":[{"poster":"taleofsonata","date":"2016-11-11T04:25:41.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well now she is not Healthy for herself aswell as for her Team.

Their job is to 100-0 squishies and then GTFO. They don't provide utility, they don't soak up damage, and they don't mow down objectives. The only thing they provide is the deletion of high priority targets. If they can't deliver that, which for the most part they now can't, then they're useless. \n\nIf you want to make an argument that assassins as a class shouldn't exist, you'd have a point and maybe I'd even side with you. It doesn't feel fair to get deleted and it's specially frustrating to pretty much have your existence hinge on the other people of your team keeping you safe (and we know how reliable your team of randoms usually is). I mostly play immobile ADCs or squishy mages (like Jinx and Zyra) so I know all about that. \n\nBut the thing is, assassins ARE part of the game and Riot obviously wants to keep them in it. They didn't give utility to assassins or tools to contribute to the team ways other than killing people, they just dulled those tools to prevent them from doing their job efficiently. They simply made assassins useless. And ironically enough that hasn't even fixed your griefs about being deleted. Burst mages can and will still 100-0 you as just as much as before, at range, all the while still providing utility in the form of CC and zoning. Do you think being jumped by Akali is bad? Being Tibber'ed by Annie or blown up half a screen away by Syndra isn't that much better. And guess what, assassins were the counter to them. To say nothing of divers. Vis and Dianas are still just as capable of jumping onto and blowing up ADCs as assassins while being tanky enough to go toe to toe with the rest of your team.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-11-11T04:32:14.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"ikr i love hearing people complain about the new rework lol saying it sucks, and i im like whats the matter you cant kill someone in .1 secs anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2016-11-11T04:10:44.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L0ve Is Blue,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NaEgfYN5,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-11T04:09:15.643+0000)\n>\n> U mean old LB and her interactive 0.1second reaction time before you are dead when you see her if she has more than 50 AP? no thanks.\n\nSigh..
