I'm fine with fiora's repost because it acts like a slightly slower siver spellshield, Yasuo's windwall is just weird and should have some of the requirements they put on braum's shield on it.(Blocking in one direction only, only destroying the first projectile) if instead of destroying everything that hit it, it reduced the damage after the first projectile that would be okay, it gives more opertunity for counter play besides having to move around the entire thing, which is really hard to do if its happening in a team fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2015-12-05T03:45:09.804+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait.

In the case of Windwall, Braum E and any other missile stopping effects we might someday do, that meant we needed to develop a set of rules on what they would and wouldn't stop, with the goal of keeping those rules as clear cut as possible. What we ended up with is basically:\n\n* Missile blocking effects will stop all projectiles unless those projectiles go so high they vanish off the top of the screen. \n* Projectiles are defined as abilities or attacks that move between locations with a travel time \n* Units are not projectiles. For things that are around the border between a unit and a projectile (Orianna's Ball, Maokai's Saplings etc) a judgement call's needed, with whether or not the thing has some agency of its own being one of the key tests used to assess whether to treat the thing as a projectile or not. \n\nThat does mean that some things that thematically don't feel like they should be stopped by a wall of wind (Nami ult, Braum ult etc) do still get blocked. That can feel a bit weird thematically, we believe that's a worthwhile cost for the gameplay clarity it offers though. Nautilus' ult is at present an exception to the above, being unaffected by Windwall/Braum E, and that's something we'll change so that it functions like other projectiles.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2015-12-05T06:20:53.303+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":3,"body":"Do you think there's clarity value in allowing things that go 'under the screen' to bypass projectile walls in the same manner that things that go 'over the screen' bypass them?\n\nIt makes sense when it's only Naut being weird to just fudge that into being in line, but if there's going to be a design space for underground projectiles going forward, it would probably be good to start differentiating now.\n\nIf we're talking player expectations, I for one would find it to be more jarring if underground spells were to be blocked by a wall of wind that was clearly placed on top of the ground.\n\nTo address this specific case more, in practice poppy's ult feels like a melee skillshot. My feedback and muscle memory from playing vi and using her charge fist tells me that I just smacked an enemy with the hammer directly and sent them flying.
