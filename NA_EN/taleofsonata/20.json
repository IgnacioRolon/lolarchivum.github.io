She's not perfect because she's volatile. Any change has dramatic effects on her, good or bad. That isn't perfection. Sure, she's unique, but her kit design is ancient, from a time where most kits were still fairly experimental and they didn't have as much grasp on the overarching view of game health. A kit like hers wouldn't be designed today just because of how prone to being godlike or garbage it is. She has to have changes to bring her in line and achieve stability. Her most unique parts of her kit are the passive, W, and R. They can easily scrap the Q (Katarina, Kennen copycat) and E (Karma, Morgana copycat) for better tools that can lead to her being an easily balanced champion.","replies":[{"poster":"taleofsonata","date":"2016-06-26T15:02:43.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins aren't a balanced role and has never been a role.

Leblanc has option to assassinate the priority target, if one of her option is impossible to do she can do it another way. The thing with Leblanc is that her Kit synergize together, nerfing or buffing could make a big change to her. A champion that has a Kit that doesn't synergize together are like Kog maw, Aurelion Sol, Taliyah. Why get Kog Q? while his WER are much more useful to max 1st. Aurelion Sol is just too Ackward to use his E is probably useless because of the Telegraph and the passive on his E is only good because it offers movement speed. Taliyah has a Role problem, is she a kiting champion, a poke champion, a chasing champion? There is nothing that really defines her besides throwing rocks. \n\nI don't Really think Leblanc Q or E are copycats because they do bring unique gameplay to Leblanc, unlike Katarina morgana.\nLeblanc Q, she can decide to Q again W or E.\nShe can E then E to Stun lock a tank charging at your ADC.\nKatarina Q and she goes all QERW full button smashing combo.\nMorgana QW, And then Press R and sits next to you auto attacking you.
