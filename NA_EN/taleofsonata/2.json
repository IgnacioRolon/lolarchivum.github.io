At present though he's got strong burst, strong AAs, good safety, good poke and a bit of utility. He's got a clear niche, but he's also just good at too many different things. We're looking to reduce one or two of those strengths, keep power concentrated. Reducing the power of his AAs is a likely direction for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Gotodead","date":"2016-03-23T19:49:07.797+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"so do you guys see corki as more of a midlane/caster staple then adc? Because this is pushing him away from the adc role and more of a poke down then burst from mid since you're higher level role. He's going to be pretty weak to function as a simple adc without that passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-03-23T19:59:41.278+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"We're happy seeing him flex between positions.

At the same time, the community is crying out for so many answers to what seem like more simple matters. Unfortunatly when it comes to league, almost every thread takes a large quantity of time to properly respond and have proper feedback, but after months of the community speaking out about things like solo queue, it very much feels to alot of the player base on the forums, that the real questions get neglected for seemingly arbitrary questions.\n\njust my 2 cents","replies":[{"poster":"lildyo","date":"2016-03-23T23:23:00.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know man, I check the Red Tracker almost every day and it seems like they're frequently (on a daily basis) responding to important questions and giving detailed explanations.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2016-03-23T23:36:28.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright, let me try this.
