How? Unless you're talking about utility adcs like sivir jhin and ashe in that case every ap champ with a form of CC is relevent when behind..\n\nHave you ever played adc and got behind? Your autos do about 50 to anything with just a bit of armor and you are DEFINITLY not going to win a 1v1 with even the support when behind. \n\nYou also said ''ADCs do more damage'' \n\nHow do adcs do **more damage than mid laners if supports are soloing adcs in the bot lane and guess what these supports consist of mid laners**\nand people are saying supports ARE supposed to be stronger than adcs in the early game.\n\nSo im not sure where you come off with anything of what you said being valid. Literally your whole sentence seems to be coming from an extreme lack of experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Sagaxwiki","date":"2018-01-08T18:34:19.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:22}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:202}}  {{champion:429}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:110}} also have some type of AoE damage in their kit or (in the case of kog/kalista) in their core items.","replies":[{"poster":"Hópe","date":"2018-01-09T02:04:00.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sagaxwiki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rEAxd6Yo,comment-id=000400000001000100000000,timestamp=2018-01-08T18:34:19.355+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:22}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:202}}  {{champion:429}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:110}} also have some type of AoE damage in their kit or (in the case of kog/kalista) in their core items.\n\nYes, some adcs also have some type of AoE damage but he said adcs have better  AOE than ap champs. This is a false statement.\n\nAshes W dravens ult jhins Q and E kalistas ult doesnt do damage Lucians Q varus Q and E tristanas E none of it is more ''aoe'' than any ap champ. None of it.\n\nAlso if you're going to say ''some have aoe damage in their core items'' then that is like saying Shen has wave clear because he gets tiamat. Shen has horrible wave clear.

You are saying that ap's are sharing their lane with assassins,which is true, but there are plenty of ap assassins as well. Also if you think of it the other way, if riot makes mages more broken than worlds patch janna, where are the ad assassins going to go? Zed top lane? Talon Jungle?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
