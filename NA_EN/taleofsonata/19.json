I'm not prepared to do the full thing now but here's a good short summary.\n\nRanged, targeted, infinite, highest dps, essentially 0 downtime => best in teamfights (because tanks), fastest objective takers, & good at seiging. Scales with gold more than levels => great duo laner. If you want optional adcs, something has to give.\n\nBy crit I meant another form of (hyper-)scaling, not the pRNG we have today. That might mean a % damage increase (like Ashe) or %arpen on crits or even utility scaling (also like Ashe, lol). This mostly can't work on adcs because of how reliable aa's are; riot has tried it internally and it makes adc vs adc matchups insanely snowbally. Spells already have more variance and longer cooldowns, so you have opportunities to win fights from behind, so they don't need rng tacked on to their scaling.\n\n---\n\nBefore writing this, I thought it's impossible to make adcs optional because removing crit-level scaling from adcs is too disruptive.

My direct response was that the status of marksmen in League is unique to League, not a problem endemic to the genre. My follow-up, however, is that the status of marksmen in League is also not one based on systems that cannot be changed -- because these systems can be improved, marksmen can become not mandatory, and even without these changes, we're not actually that far away from an environment where marksmen are non-essential, though still valuable.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Hyrum Graff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8nhyv9pX,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-10T02:15:37.351+0000)\n>  \n>   - I am inclined to interpret it a bit more narrowly; although smite is technically a moba, the camera controls make it feel very different to me -- more mechanical, less strategic.\n\nMentioning the differences between individual MOBAs does not automatically make those differences relevant to the question of marksmen. In Smite's case, the fact that it is more mechanical and less strategic would likely make marksmen even _more_ mandatory, as marksmen are a class that are more mechanically than strategically intensive.

Marksmen were still largely essential, the problem just was that marksmen died more quickly if they got caught. The buffs that resulted made them even less fun to play _against_ for everyone else. If there is one takeaway to be had from that period, it is to not give too much damage to champions not meant to deal damage, in this case tanks (a problem that persists to this day).\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Hyrum Graff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8nhyv9pX,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-10T02:15:37.351+0000)\n> \n> This relates to the thing above because, at what point do you say, &quot;you made marksmen fun and optional, but that game isn&#x27;t league any more.&quot;? So yeah, other mobas can do it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean league can.\n\nAgain, games that featured Ziggs bot were still League, and they were still fun. In fact, many people praised the possibility of a non-marksman in the bot lane carry position, because it would've added immensely more diversity to the game. Similarly, while Mordekaiser bot was largely criticized due to how badly designed his kit was/is, many players were favorable to the idea of having _some_ non-marksman carry. League can have games where marksmen aren't essential because we've already had them, and so without even really deep changes. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Hyrum Graff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8nhyv9pX,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-10T02:15:37.351+0000)\n> \n> Marksmen hyper-scale because crit gives them an extra level of multiplicative scaling.

This part is what ties together the three different things in this comment. \n\nExcept crit is a widely disliked stat that even Riot has criticized on several occasions. Again, I'm not suggesting removing crit is the way to go, but we already have several marksmen who do not really need crit to operate, and who play just fine. Marksman build diversity has never been better, and while some aspects of that may not be so great (marksmen depending on Lethality makes it harder to balance AD assassins), it just goes to show that crit is not this sacred, monolithic stat that absolutely needs to be preserved at all costs, for fear of \"disrupting\" marksmen.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Hyrum Graff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8nhyv9pX,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-10T02:15:37.351+0000)\n> \n> Ranged, targeted, infinite, highest dps, essentially 0 downtime =&gt; best in teamfights (because tanks), fastest objective takers, &amp; good at seiging. Scales with gold more than levels =&gt; great duo laner. If you want optional adcs, something has to give.\n\nI completely agree that something has to give. For one, I think fighters and marksmen should be on equal levels of DPS, particularly since fighters have to work more in general to be able to apply their own damage, but in addition to this I think marksmen are going to have to end up relying on their kits more in the future. For most champions, we've evolved past the era of ball-of-stats champions whose unique abilities only serve to amplify their items via on-demand steroids... except for marksmen. Champions like Twitch and Tristana are relics of that era, and more modern marksmen have unique enough abilities that they can be made more level-dependent. Marksmen like Caitlyn, Ezreal and Varus especially are already somewhat more level-dependent, as they were originally designed to be mid laners, and at this point the argument that marksmen _need_ to be more gold dependent no longer has any bearing, because marksman builds are the second-cheapest in the game, after support builds.\n\nI would also add to the above that one of the reasons marksmen are currently mandatory is because they're the only damage class allowed to be late-game champions, with Riot [stating as much](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/bPE1A1gi-the-problem-with-adcs-is-they-do-too-much-damage-full-stop?comment=0005) during this year's Worlds (they also stated there that it was perfectly possible to switch primacy over from marksmen to other classes, such as battle mages). The notion of an entire class having the same power curve, aside from being impossible and harmful to in-class diversity, is also harmful to diversity across all champions, as here it means that carries from other classes are being deliberately relegated to second place at best, whereas marksmen who are naturally good early- or mid-game also get to enjoy an arbitrarily strong late game. Part of the issue with marksmen is effectively not so much that their damage output is somehow so special that it needs to be on every team (again, look at HotS and see which characters are the best teamfighters there), but that they're simply not made to run on the same design rules as every other class, to the detriment of everyone else.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Hyrum Graff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8nhyv9pX,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-10T02:15:37.351+0000)\n> \n> By crit I meant another form of (hyper-)scaling, not the pRNG we have today.\n\nBut why? Are spells lacking in their ability to kill their intended targets right now? I don't think the answer to hyperscaling autoattacks should be to multiply the damage of ability-based nukes, as in their current state it would cause many single abilities to kill other champions in far too few hits, which would be immensely frustrating to all. Considering how there is frustration already at how marksmen are outputting burst-per-second, toning down their later autoattack damage would likely be a far better alternative.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Hyrum Graff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8nhyv9pX,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-10T02:15:37.351+0000)\n> \n> I need to get back to my hellish finals week, maybe no reply for a couple days.\n\nBest of luck with finals!

It also counts control wards and enemy wards you kill as well as your own wards. It is not even uncommon for me to get 5 wards on the map at any point in the game. Effective use of the Zombie Ward & Ingenious Hunter + Scanning Trinket can shut down enemy vision and turn it into your own vision. If more supports would do this, then this thread wouldn't exist with Ganking as a topic. \n\nAlso bomb plants are OP in general, it is not smite locked like jungle items {{item:3711}} {{item:3715}} {{item:1402}} so anyone can use them. It gives gap closers that champions are not meant to have in their kit. While I have reaped the benefits of this mechanic numerous times, I do not believe that it should be in the game.

The fact that Ziggs bot was even being considered even professionally (the only thing that held it back is that mages are *also*  borderline mandatory in pro play which means Ziggs bot fucked your damage profile, unless you took something like Jayce top, which fucked your team comp) because he actually was useful in the first 25 minutes of the game was a reflection of how bad the class was. \n\nThe reason why ADCs were tuned to spike so comparatively early is because the game had accelerated to the point where it was and is largely decided in the first 15-20 minutes, with every class being dangerous at 1 item, compared to the 3-4 items it took for ADCs, however ADCs were largely left at their old power curves and needed to be adjusted to the new state of the game. Riot definitely overshot (and some ADCs are just flat out unhealthy, Twitch comes to mind) The problem is that supports were also overtuned, especially enchanters, which are more dedicated to supporting the ADC than doing other things. Now ADCs are in a largely healthy spot (they still spike later, they're just not useless at 1 item like before), the problem is that on the boards, if ADCs have actual game impact, they're \"broken\", and if they're just glorified cannon minions, they're \"balanced\" .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-12-10T01:18:17.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this, but the way I see it is a carry role will always make people expect you to be their savior and if your not, they will inevitably get mad.
