Other recent releases - involved champions with absurd kits (champions capable of doing free damage - since there was no way of punishing them - and on top of that.. their kit also involved heal, shield, evasive abilities and cc). There's a complete lack of common sense behind their kit - for a moba game (it's as if those champs were made for a brainless hack and slash mmo - where you need a swiss knife kit for the sake of entertainment - cause grinding till lvl 180 can be quite boring with the usual LoL kit - as champs used to be made).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Love Anastasia","date":"2020-01-20T18:06:34.127+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":9,"body":"If he has 50 % winrate in his first week, he's not balanced, he is op.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2020-01-20T19:09:12.830+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"He's an easy to pick up champion, it's not going to be hard to use him.","replies":[{"poster":"OHminus","date":"2020-01-21T17:35:48.363+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you can say he has an easy Sett-up\n\nI'll see myself out","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2020-01-20T14:26:32.865+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Soloq you maysee a nerf and thats it but you better hope to god he isnt a problem in the LCS or they will gut his gameplay like they did Yuumi.","replies":[{"poster":"YaraOwO","date":"2020-01-20T23:22:17.039+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"And tahm and kindred and azir and sol and sylas and ornn and rakan and ivern and kalista and braum and jinx.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2gudaiya","date":"2020-01-20T13:18:18.489+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":37,"body":"yuumi actually, but then she got hotfixed in under 24 hours and the nightmare began.","replies":[{"poster":"taleofsonata","date":"2020-01-20T13:19:04.390+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=2gudaiya,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E5vVALQ3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-01-20T13:18:18.489+0000)\n>\n> yuumi actually, but then she got hotfixed in under 24 hours and the nightmare began.\n\nThey destroyed her, she is straight up garbage. turned into a healbot with a 160 mana cost on her E LOL.","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2020-01-20T13:57:02.375+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=taleofsonata,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E5vVALQ3,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2020-01-20T13:19:04.390+0000)\n>\n> They destroyed her, she is straight up garbage. turned into a healbot with a 160 mana cost on her E LOL.\n\nYea they destroyed her and still cant get her WR to 50%, what a joke company.
