Trin has increased AD based off missing health and *actual* free 35% crit, Fiora gets %health true damage, Yi has attack speed steroids, extra AD and true damage, jax, aatrox, etc etc.\n\nYasuo's damage steroids are his crit multiplier, which he actually has to invest gold into it before it even turns on, as well as his bonus %arpen from Last Breath, which also needs to gold because it only applies to crits. He has far from the least problematic damage steroids in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2017-01-21T01:21:26.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while yes, every champion does have some damage booster, Yasuo is a bit different, Trynd has 35% free crit, but Yasuo only needs 50% to get 100% crit, so he potentially can have more crit than trynd can with the same items, and get 100% crit very early on with only 1.5 items, where everyone else needs 4 items (besides trynd and 100% crit chances) for the smae 100% crit chance. Fiora needs to hit her passive marks at the correct angle to get her damage boost, Yi has no reliable defensive measures as his trade off for his damage (he can Q to dodge an ability or two but he sitll takes the damage if it is an AOE or DOT and has a telegraphed end point, and his w stops him form attacking while channeling it). Jax needs to build up his attack speed, etc... all of them have some tradeoff for their power. Yasuo needs a knockup for his ult, sure, but by simply moving he can get a massive shield, and his dash add to its charge which is not very much as it is He also has both engage and disengage. not many other melee champions have both and if they do, they are not as reliable as his are.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-01-21T02:35:21.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Believe me when I say that each of those champions is balanced differently and that Yasuo isn't an outlier in any regard save perhaps for his skill ceiling. This was your TLDR, continue reading at your own risk.\n\nEach of those points has its own caveat. In the case of Tryn, there's the matter of League's crit is actually being pseudorandom. A Yasuo critting 100% of the time (with the .9 penalty given by that same passive) has nearly the same DPS as a tryn with 85% crit, assuming equal stats. Their damage will differ by only 5%, ignoring Yasuo's Q, which loses effectiveness as he gains AD. And that's not even counting the IE bonus, which only gives Yasuo 225% damage instead of the full 250% tryn and everyone else gets.\n\nYi has absolutely zero ultility, and as such, most of his power budget is damage (he very reliably beats yasuo 1v1 in a straight up fight), which also why he doesn't see pro play. Jax's ramping damage is the price he pays for his hyperscaling DPS (he also outfights Yasuo). Fiora has the most modern kit and her's is, all things considered, actually quite healthy. Her damage is absolutely nuts, but it is conditional. I'll give you this one.\n\nHere's the thing, all of these champions have basically the same 4 basic tools at their disposal. They have damage steroids, mobility, defensive abilities, and stickiness. The degree to which tool is emphasized in their kits varies. Yasuo's kit doesn't actually have damage that outstrips his peers, but instead he has more defensive tools and utility to keep him relevant when behind. Does he strictly need the passive shield?  Not really, but his base stats are garbage and he wouldn't survive without it. He has defensive stats like a lux and his passive shield has both the longest non-ult cd out of any non-ult shield in the game and he doesn't even have full control over it. His damage steroids are forced to scale with his gold which keeps his early power in check so he can't all in you like a Tryn might. Moreover, his crit passive lets his build defensive items that don't normally fit into ADC builds, which he needs as a melee champ, since he has neither the stats of a front liner, the safety of a true marksman, or the ability to straight up ignore death like Kayle or Tryn. His mobility is very strong during laning phase and potentially nonexistent in other circumstances. Can you imagine Yasuo facing off against ranged champions without it though? There's a reason he has all those things in his kit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shynana","date":"2017-01-20T23:19:46.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"grevious wounds mannn","replies":[{"poster":"taleofsonata","date":"2017-01-21T00:07:53.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It gets countered by Crit and Crit damage...","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-01-21T00:41:09.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grievous wounds is countered by crit? What. I know that crit indirectly amplifies life steal, but that doesn't make it a counter to grievous wounds. That's not how anything works.\n\nA 50% healing debuff is still a 50% debuff regardless of whether or not critical hits are doubling the lifesteal. Not only is non-crit lifesteal kind of underwhelming, but the increased amount of health regain make grievous wounds all the more valuable in raw stat denial.\n\nIn other words, applying grievous wounds onto someone healing 20% ad every second is nothing special, because functionally, all you've done turned into 10% ad. If they're critting and healing like 50% ad per second, then your grievous wounds are taking away a whole 25% ad.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Denims Wrath666","date":"2017-01-21T03:46:44.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bets yas counters are {{champion:14}}  (if you can manage to actually land shit) {{champion:31}} land stuff {{champion:86}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:62}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-01-20T23:13:17.990+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"He's just WAY too strong early for how ridiculously strong he is late game.
