I mean its pretty hard to juke an attack move click ADC with the bush, because as soon as you show your head out they automatically auto attack you. In other Moba like Dota, when I ask my friend who is a dota player, he replied that attack move click it's a pretty unskilled and noob friendly mechanic. I mean if you want to target a champion you just gotta hover your mouse and click on them not just let your game macro do it for you.\n\nI don't think it should be removed but tone down when it comes to juking from bush to bush or hyper mobility assassin jumping on an ADC. Because I've seen leblanc dying mid W to an ADC. It's pretty disgusting.\n\nWhy is there no auto cast move click? Casting a point and click spell automatically as soon as a champion is in range?","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-09-04T01:34:57.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, we're really complaining about attack move now?\n\nSorry you can't just autowin by ducking in a brush.\n\n(Also, DotA has attack move, so...)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2017-09-03T22:15:33.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think it could be removed, it would greatly help balanceing adc.\nHowever, chances are that the discrepancy beteem low and high elo adc gets even worse that way, which already is a huge issue since riot trys to balance around both to some extend, which just doesn't really work.","replies":[]}]}
