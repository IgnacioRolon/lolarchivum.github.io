It's about balancing power and the thought that Shaco's power balance is currently warped. \n\nNow Old!Shaco did a few things, but the important 2: have a 3.5 second invisibility at level 1 and insane out from invisibility damage burst with his E. This was unhealthy so over time Shacos damage was nerfed and he's been sitting like that for awhile. If he gets fed it can be kind of unhealthy but to get fed a Shaco player needs to play a lot of mind games. \n\nNow comes the rework. Riot, perhaps rightly, decided that the huge invisibility and his current burst were too much and the potential for his getting fed were off so they decided to work on him. \n\nHowever, in doing so they gave Shaco players a catch-22 of sorts. They either have to invest all their early skill points into invisibility to approach their prior invisibility time to set up useful ganks, at the cost of a lot of their early damage, or, they can focus on their early damage but to get it they no longer have anything approaching their prior gank potential. \n\nBoth options just leave Shaco players feeling weak, like they got a rather hefty nerf. And while Shaco was a bit unfair against new players, at mid to higher level play Shaco already was fairly balanced. Maybe a little overtuned but not overbearing. So now he's just in this limbo where to make him more fair for lower level play he can't really do anything well. If he chooses to try and set up good ganks by maxing Q first his actual ganks do pitiful damage. If he tries to have his damage maxed by putting points in E his method of ganking is no longer possible. \n\nNow in fairness, his late game is improved, in theory, but it's going to be a monumental task as Shaco to get to a competitive late game build in his current state. \n\nNow, Riot may fix this. But, we can only comment on what is currently happening and hope they hear us and change around his numbers.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"dunkeroni","date":"2016-10-26T06:28:57.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"It seems to me that most of the Shaco mains are excited about the changes.

It was by far his most important mechanic. If he's going to lose that for a significant portion of the game, he has to have a mechanic introduced that makes up for it. Right now, I don't think they've done that. I don't think they've come anywhere close.\n\nHe doesn't feel like he has any options until level 7 with a Q max at the earliest, at which point he's basically like an unsnowballed Shaco who Q maxed on live: Pathethic and still lacking the tools to eke out an advantage. Q isn't a good fighting tool. Having to max it doesn't work well, because it locks you into an incredibly predictable, incredibly simple playstyle until you can finally start maxing out the other skills. Regardless of the numbers, it's not fun, but it's your only choice because having the E without any Q duration is even more laughably bad. It can't come anywhere close to comparing to live, where the E max gives you a ton of flexiblity in how to approach problems. Specifically, it lets you use the invisibility for repositioning instead of just for jumping on someone. Having all of the damage loaded into your Q doesn't let you do that. If you don't jump someone with the Q, you're going to lose the fight. It makes you incredibly predictable until you have the E and the Q both maxed out, but of course, that's the point where you're falling off like a brick and you're out of options because there's no way you got fed with such a terrible kit.\n\nThey've taken away the ability to gank early and to have an E max in an effort to prevent snowballing, but in doing so, they haven't supported any different playstyles that can actually offer real gameplay. Basically, it feels like your best option is \"pray you get fed early somehow despite not having any tools to make it happen\", and if that failed, then you're going to regret playing Shaco because you almost as few midgame options as you have in the early game.\n\nI doubt numbers changes can actually make the new changes compelling to play with. So far, it's been dull even in the games I've stomped in. In my experience, that's indicative of mediocre design. I think Riot put too much effort into preventing Shaco from being annoying, without really considering what should replace the playstyle they took away.

Nothing good did. He was reliant on a playstyle that came from having access to high duration mobility combined with the flesiblity of being able to max out his E. If he's going to lose that, he has to get a new playstyle. The only thing he's being offered is \"farm until at least 7 because your ganks suck without invisibility, then keep farming because your ganks suck without the E maxed, then lose because you're level 10+ and now you're an unfed midgame Shaco\".\n\nSeriously, I understand how annoying Shaco is. I hate him. I don't like playing against him. I want to see him changed. However, that doesn't change the fact that he's incredibly reliant on his current playstyle, and just ripping it away from his doesn't fix his problems. If we're taking way the most important part of his kit, then we can't just replace it with gimmicky, pointless bullshit. If we do that, then what's the incentive to play him? What the hell are his players supposed to be doing now?\n\nActually, I already know the answer to that question. What they're supposed to do now is play someone who isn't Shaco. They'll be better at early ganking, midgame ganking, split pushing, and teamfighting. It's the perfect solution!\n\n>You say they did not add any mechanics ti replace that. I say that:\n\nFrom my experience playing with the new Shaco and playing against him, I can say with complete confidence that none of these changes help anywhere near enough,  and I will tell you why.\n\n>1) boxes can be placed while invisible\n\nThis mechanic is pointless, and I can explain why. It reveals you and the box when you place it, then recloaks you. That means they know you're there, they know where you are, and they know where the box is. It does nothing for you. The only reason it exists is because they're forcing you to max the Q, and this allows you to drop a box while still using the Q for damage. Of course, it's still less damage than you have on live with the E max, and it forces you into a much more predictable pattern (because you MUST autoattack them from stealth or you are guaranteed to do almost nothing), so you're still weaker regardless.\n\n>2) invisibility is no more detected by pink wards\n\nNot that big of a help. Shaco's biggest strength in ganking was the ability to ignore pink wards by teleporting from places that they couldn't possibly cover. That was pretty much his defining trait. I honestly can't remember the last time a pink ward stopped a Shaco gank. While this is slightly helpful in lategame fights, it's ultimately very minor given how much of an early game reliance you still have.\n\nOther assassins benefit from this change much more than Shaco does. His competition thrives off of this. He likes it, but less than them by a pretty notable margin. Kha'zix is far more excited than Shaco is about this stuff.\n\n>3) the ult changes\n\nIt adds a small amount of delayed CC to the ultimate that never fools anyone anyway. Not very good. People can still ping me to see which Shaco is the real one after I split, so I'm still not tricking anyone. It doesn't do anything significant for making my late game less shitty.\n\n>And the scaling missing hp damage on dagger, but i don't consider it as a mechanic.\n\nThis is a very, very neutral change when considered with the other dagger changes. The base damage is down, the bonus AD ratio was decreased and shifted to a total AD ratio, and the missing health ratio was added. It represents slightly more damage at level 1, and then significantly less damage as you level up, particularly with AD-focused builds. As a rule of thumb, with a full build, the enemy has to be missing about 1,200 - 1,600 health to make up for the damage you lose out on.\n\nOf course, this does mot take into account that the E damage can no longer be enhanced by shaco's passive. With that accounted for, E generally  hurts less.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-10-26T09:01:26.745+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless they compensate A LOT with his numbers, the Q duration is the killing blow at Shaco.

Not nerfed, not class updated, not out of the meta for a few months, just _gone_.\n\n**I can't play my favorite champion anymore, ever again. And that's a terrible feeling.**\n\nAlthough just to prevent revisionist history, I will say that no matter how bullshit old Sion was, it's not like he was a huge problem. His playrate was so low that you'd be hard pressed to even _see_ a Sion let alone be traumatized by a good one. I understand that made him a prime candidate from a rework, but let's not pretend that he was anywhere close to something like season 3 Kassadin where you had to ban him or risk being tempted to kill yourself with a rusty spoon.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2016-10-27T18:10:51.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did they really delete him though?\n\nOLd sions passive might as well have not existed.

Unless you're facing doom bots, then you get to use it without getting slowed and kited. Sion's passive is supposed to be this \"taking you with me\" moment that matches his lore. Instead, it just means that someone with a rylais has to throw one extra spell your way. The old passive was horribly uninteractive and boring, but it did it's job. You can't say that about the new passive a fair bit of the time.\n\n>His Q went from a point and click stun to a healthier 5 man aoe stun - so its still a stun same thing.\n\nA point and click stun with a .9 AP ratio vs a heavily delayed, easily dodgable AoE stun with a maximum of 1.17 AD ratio. I know which one I'd rather have, especially when it comes to all the mobility League has nowadays. Give me that point and click 100% reliable stun to shut down Leblanc and Yasuo anyway. Just because they're both stuns does not mean they are in anyway similar or applied in a similar way. Old Taric Q was more comparable.\n\n>His w is still a shield. Less health gain and damage but still a shield.\n\nAgain, .9 AP ratio, nearly doubled his HP, and you could pop it after 1.5 seconds. Current Sion W has a piddling shield until late game, requires 3 seconds to pop, and has a .4 AP ratio with %max HP damage. While I do appreciate the %HP damage the new one has, it loses to the old one in every other category. If you ever tried to pop old Sion's shield, you had to do a lot of damage quickly or he'd detonate it right into your face. The new Sion shield is much less reliable.\n\nHell, I could make the argument that Janna's E and Sion's W are much the same because they're both a shield. That wouldn't be true though, because there's more that makes them different than what makes them the same. That's the same case with old and new Sion's Q and W.\n\n>His E shit old sions E was so worthless i cant even remember what it did. SO replacing it shouldnt matter. AHHHHH IT WAS PASSIVE DAMAGE. REmemebred.\n\nYep, it was a toggle that added an amount of damage to every auto attack while also costing HP every time you AA. Similar to Aatrox. The E was completely changed. It's more interactive now, but also less reliable. I think we can see a pattern starting to develop at this point. Riot severely reduced the reliability of Sion's abilities in order to promote counterplay and interactivity. This was a healthy thing.\n\nHowever, they gave Sion far too much counterplay, while simultaneously not giving him enough in return to make up for what he lost.\n\n>And his R was also a random passive you would press and forget about.\n\nIt was far more reliable and uninteractive than the new ult (the pattern continues), in which the new ult also has so much counterplay it's less a show of skill when you land one and more of a mistake on your opponents end. (Seriously, does he really need a global noise _and_ to steer like a drunk driver on ice at the same time?)\n\n>So really the only thing you should care about missing is the point and click stun.\n\nHe lost reliability. If an ability isn't reliable, it can deal 4000 damage at level 3 and still be considered underwhelming. Old Sion took no risks. New Sion takes all the risks. There was a happy medium there that wasn't capitalized on. Sion needed counterplay, but he sure as hell didn't need as much as he got saddled with.\n\n>Other than that he lost 4 passives. MUH IDENTITY.\n\nYeah, it's not like lots of newer champs have three or more passives _in addition_ to four actives. Sion's kit was boring and uninteractive, but also functional and not overloaded by any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that a simple, boring kit filled with passives is far healthier than an overloaded one filled with both actives and passives. More boring to watch and play as for most people, but much easier to balance.","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2016-10-29T00:53:31.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BastionKross,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LGUmBQgu,comment-id=002a0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-28T18:16:29.279+0000)\n>\n> However, they gave Sion far too much counterplay, while simultaneously not giving him enough in return to make up for what he lost\n> ...
