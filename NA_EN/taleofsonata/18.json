Up until very recently, Wukong largely felt weak and unsatisfying, with many threads on here pointing out just that. Around the time of the marksman mini-update, though, Wukong started becoming overbearing, namely because people seemed to have figured out how to abuse front-loaded burst builds using his stealth and mobility. In the end, he's still a champion many players find dissatisfying, but his core issues right now appear to stem from features like Duskblade and Electrocute, both of which have themselves earned heavy criticism. Quinn also seems to be a similar case in parallel, as she went from weaksauce to far too strong once she got to stack Stormrazor + Statikk Shiv + Duskblade for maximum front-loaded burst. Because of this, it might be better to target the offending items and runes, rather than the champions themselves, in order to make Wukong healthier in the short-term, and in a manner that won't backfire a few months down the line.","replies":[{"poster":"BadgerDrool","date":"2018-07-27T16:57:42.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely a very insightful post here by Teridax68.\n\nWukong is operating as a rune and item delivery system at present.
