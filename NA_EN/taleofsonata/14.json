If you land hard CC on her before she completes the dash, the dash will be interrupted and it won't deal any damage. You can do that with Ahri's Charm (E), Syndra's Scatter the Weak (E), Lissandra's Ring of Frost (W) etc. She can't dodge skillshots mid-dash so just throw it in her direction. I like Syndra and Lissandra better because their ability is not blocked by minions. Distortion's damage can also be avoided easily by blinks such as Katarina's Shunpo (E) and Talon's Cutthroat (E). \n\nThe good thing is that most of these spells have lower cooldown than her Distortion (18/16/14/12/10) until around level 7, when LeBlanc have 4 levels in her W and likely have a Fiendish Codex. So if you play it right you can win the lane early on.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2015-03-06T16:52:40.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually most LeBlancs max Q first because the most basic combo is Q R W and it's basically guaranteed burst. So blinks tend to be super effective until even later in the game than level 7.\n\nAt least that's my experience anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-03-07T03:00:11.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maxing Q is a weak play.  Ranks of Q give you 50 more damage for 10 more mana.  Ranks of W gives you 40 more damage and 2 seconds lower cooldown for 5 more mana.\n\n10 more damage is definitely not worth having fewer Ws.  W is one of the best buttons in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-03-06T17:31:23.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, most LBS max W first. for wave clear, and stronger/easier harass","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"doublelift fg","date":"2015-03-06T15:41:23.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"give me one pls","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-03-06T17:34:04.686+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~play vik.~~\n\nOh wait. nvm i don't want him to get in the spot light\n\ndon't play vik","replies":[{"poster":"Gank in Progress","date":"2015-03-07T02:56:33.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BIitskrieg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=w0qBLMG8,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-03-06T17:34:04.686+0000)\n>\n> ~~play vik.~~\n> \n> Oh wait. nvm i don't want him to get in the spot light\n> \n> don't play vik\n\nwhy would viktor counter le blanc? now seriously","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-03-07T03:25:21.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he doesn't. \n\ndon't worry about it :)\n\nIts a secret :D\n\nSHUUUUUUU don't tell him!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-03-06T17:31:02.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tips\n\n1) Play Vik Vs LB\n2) Watch as she melts every time she engages on you\n3) win game with ease","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazaashi","date":"2015-03-06T15:22:38.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMHO, Fizz should do great against LB.
