I am new though and i'm not sure that this is normal. I was about to get into a match i was still in champ pick Co-op vs AI and I get a notification Stating that my summoner was logged out because a specific player support modification was being added to my account and to log back in after 5 minutes... although I thought it was maybe a keylogger or something so I immediately tried logging back in and did so successfully. Any clarification on this subject would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-26T03:59:08.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like what happens when a Player Support Specialist is making a change to your account. Typically you'll just get kicked off for a second as the new adjustments to your account takes effect, which is what I suspect to be happening here. So, my QA senses tells me this is probably NOT a keylogger thing. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Hailbringer2","date":"2014-09-26T05:06:25.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah, okay, thank you. Exactly what kind of changes would need to be made to my account though? something like mmr or that?","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2014-09-26T06:36:08.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Hailbringer2!\n\nI took a look for you, but this actually isn't tied to an action by Player Support.  (double checked in our tools)\n\nBack in the day... (a ways ago) if a Player Support agent took an action on your account while you were logged in  (say to grant a refund, or fix an inventory problem) you would be briefly kicked.  That's not really a lot of fun though, so we removed that side effect all together.\n\nProblem is, the error message relating to that still exists in the client.  Currently there is a bug tied to a connection issue.  When this bug occurs you'll get the wrong error message in the client.  Rather than saying \"connection lost\" it'll say what you saw; that your account has been modified.\n\nAwkward huh?  I know we have some dudes looking into this at the moment, but hopefully you should be okay reconnecting without any issues.  The disconnect seems to happen sporadically and it's been hard to get a consistent repro of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hailbringer2","date":"2014-09-26T06:49:51.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohh okay, well that makes sense also. Thank you wookieecookie and that's alright, I was just afraid i was going to get leaver busted again. lol. Thank you so much! and umm... make sure you take care of Han for me alright? He seems to think he's invincible with that bulky smuggle-running ship of his.
