Like the first lil bit shown, u get a ashe with no chest &gt;.&gt; and looks to be mostly female cast. Dont get me wrong tho. if the story is great and the writing is good I will buy this, but I won&#039;t be surprised if its trash :/. I really hope league of legends writing team is part of the making.\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot","replies":[]}
