A phrase which here means. A company that has been shown to incorporate.  Radical Far left,Social Justice ideology,into its products and services. Resulting in mass Exodus  of players who do not want said politics to be promoted in their video-games. These are often the majority of players. These players are often met with attacks from company executives on soceil/traditional media  soon after.  \r\n\r\nWith the release of neeko and  Riots statement confirming  she is &quot;lgbtq&quot;. They have basically made their political ideology known and enforced. I believe that this was a massive mistake,will be a PR nightmare,and shows that whoever made the announcement was ignorant of the current political climate,or knew about it. Didn&#039;t care to learn from history, and made a stupid choice to go forward anyway.\r\n\r\n As it stands.  I think  Riot has less than 24 hours to go back on their statement before this game becomes defunct.  Because this is going to cost them in the long run. I&#039;m not sure why riot. Doesn&#039;t realize sjws do not play their game or buy skins or champions. Doing this will make the people who use to  play and support the game, leave the game.  The future of this game is bleak. As History repeats itself.\r\n\r\n I can guess with a rather high degree of accuracy.  Based on events in recent history,that the next move will be to attack any fans who speak out against it. after that they will declare all gamers who play their game and don&#039;t like this choice. To be sexist bigots. After that  comes Mass ban-waves,starting with streamers and forum goers who speak out against it. Then normal players threw the automated system. \r\n\r\nI say 24 hours is all that&#039;s left for this game,because the moment Sargon of Akkad,The Quartering,Raging Golden Eagle or Rags get wind of riots mistake here,its all over. The dislike bombs on neekos trailer are starting already. Hope you people weren&#039;t looking forward to the next season. This game will not last another month. Someone at riot really messed up. Having this happen at the end of season gurentees no one will come back. Had they done this earlier people may have been incentivized to continue to seasons end.\r\n\r\nR.I.P get woke go broke.","replies":[]}
