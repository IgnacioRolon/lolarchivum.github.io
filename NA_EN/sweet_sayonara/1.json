So I inform him and the rest of the team that I am leaving lane. Sup then asks me why, over and over again, and I explain to him why. \r\n\r\nIn the second game, mid does well, I do well (bot), and jungle does well. But top feeds and leaves game after 5 mins. I highly doubt anyone even reported me in this second game, but riot just looking to bolster there case cause they know they have no reason for chat restriction in the first game. \r\n\r\nThis is really pathetic. I see ZERO reason, ZERO, to be handing out chat restrictions for this. Riot should be ashamed of themselves. What a terrible terrible organization chat restriction with zero objective reason. \r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nSweet Sayonara: you got me walking up and you got nothing\r\nSweet Sayonara: and plz dont hit my cs\r\nSweet Sayonara: gg\r\nSweet Sayonara: sup taking my cs\r\nSweet Sayonara: im done with lane\r\nSweet Sayonara: gg\r\nSweet Sayonara: sup taking farm\r\nSweet Sayonara: troll sup\r\nSweet Sayonara: sup\r\nSweet Sayonara: do not take my farm\r\nSweet Sayonara: dont take farm\r\nSweet Sayonara: it is that simple\r\nSweet Sayonara: bad matchup\r\nSweet Sayonara: you dont take farm\r\nSweet Sayonara: you dont know... that you dont take adc farm?\r\nSweet Sayonara: you took canon right in front of me\r\nSweet Sayonara: you do that\r\nSweet Sayonara: i dont play lane with you\r\nSweet Sayonara: it is that simple\r\nSweet Sayonara: muted\r\n\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nSweet Sayonara: wow mid\r\nSweet Sayonara: go\r\nSweet Sayonara: have to play perfect if want to win\r\nSweet Sayonara: yupo\r\nSweet Sayonara: amazing\r\nSweet Sayonara: this was such a free win with 5\r\nSweet Sayonara: i hope top is banned for life\r\nSweet Sayonara: mid top['\r\nSweet Sayonara: wtf]\r\nSweet Sayonara: mid\r\nSweet Sayonara: wher are you??\r\nSweet Sayonara: end\r\nSweet Sayonara: report top","replies":[]}
