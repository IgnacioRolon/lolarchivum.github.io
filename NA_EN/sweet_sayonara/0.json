I live in Hong Kong and my main account is on the Japanese server (posting here because I can&#039;t read Japanese so can&#039;t navigate the Japanese forums). I initially started out on the NA server (where I could play with a friend) and later transferred to the Japanese server. On the NA server where I played for roughly 8 months I didn&#039;t have any disciplinary issues. However, after transferring to the Japanese server, I got into trouble. I admit that initially I had issues transitioning to the Japanese server. Compared to NA, people on the Japanese  server rarely use chat and when they do it seems far less hostile. Although my chat was never really all that bad, I understand how in the Japanese context my previous chat could have been considered hostile. Over time my chat had improved considerably.\n\nYet 3 days ago my account was permanently banned and for the life of me I can&#039;t figure out what I said that could justify a permanent ban. Have a look:\n\nGame 1\nFireNovaStar: \\wtf\nFireNovaStar: i was stunned foreever\nFireNovaStar: nice\nFireNovaStar: game over??\nFireNovaStar: JUNGLE\nFireNovaStar: we were pushed in the entire game\nFireNovaStar: not sure why you diddnt gank\nFireNovaStar: i dont speak japanese. [I said this in response to a teammate typing in Japanese. Just letting him/her know that I couldn&#039;t understand]\nFireNovaStar: runi\nFireNovaStar: DONT\nFireNovaStar: open your eyes plz\nFireNovaStar: wow\nFireNovaStar: wp\nFireNovaStar: why fight there???\nFireNovaStar: they knew where you were\nFireNovaStar: better to back off and fight under tower\nFireNovaStar: sigh\nFireNovaStar: that gives them baron\nFireNovaStar: UNDER TURRET\nFireNovaStar: lol\nFireNovaStar: LOL\nFireNovaStar: GO IN\nFireNovaStar: what are you waiting for??\nFireNovaStar: lol\n\nOne thought I had was that there is a bias against using English in game and people are reporting me for it. (Just so everyone knows, I would say roughly 2/3 of people on the Japanese server are able to chat with me in English.) Although unlikely, I really can&#039;t think of another reason why the language above would justify a permanent ban.\n\nAppreciate your thoughts and any suggestions on actions I can take to get my account unbanned. I wouldn&#039;t care, except that I have put in roughly 200 USD into the account.\n\nShould I not use in game chat at all - even when trying to help other players? I feel like that is what Riot and their ban system are telling me...\n\nThanks for your feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2018-01-23T16:23:00.837+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm happy to help you understand.\n\nYour ban is not a case of a ban for one egregious game.

There are certainly things in these examples that I would agree are objectively negative and warrant a chat ban. I will not make the mistake of making similar comments again. Believe it or not, looking at my comments here, I am quite embarrassed and disappointing in myself.  I still don't know if a perma ban was required, but I did need a good knock to my head. \n\nCouple questions:\n1. Did you put this together on your own, going through my games individually? Or does the system pull this together for you? \n2. If the system pulls this together for you, I wonder why it can't be provided as the reason for my Ban? Just seems like it would make a much stronger case for my banishment than the one example I was given. We could avoid much of this back and forth. \n\nThanks again for taking the time.

Effectively the system doesn't \"understand\" any language, it just knows which phrases and occasionally words are perceived as negatively impacting other players. As long as the system gets enough input regarding dialect insults (in other words, enough people report such insults) it should work out.\n\nA last note: If I'm not mistaken the systems on different servers work seperately, because of how important culture is as a context to certain insults. So on EUW I have no doubts that Austrian/Swiss insults are going to be identified properly. On other servers, though, probably not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InexpensiveRun","date":"2018-01-26T11:21:08.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"buthurt mod.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sweet Sayonara","date":"2018-01-22T10:06:44.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"**\nHERE IS THE FEEDBACK FROM RIOT SUPPORT --------------------------------**\nKomari again.\nThank you for your reply and I apologize to confuse you by my words...\nLet me answer as accurate as possible again to you, so please see my comments in your questions below.\n\n_How am I supposed to learn or improve if the only example provided doesn't clearly demonstrate or point to incorrect behavior/words? \nI agree that we should be respectful to all players at all times. Was I not doing that?_\n\nUnfortunately we can't point exactly words or behavior of the players due to the reason that I told you last time. But remember, \" Community rule \" is the standard that our Instant Feedback System(IFS) constantly updates by the reports from the players in each server, and not open to the public, but it bases on \" Summoner's Code \".\n\nSince we are not allowed to disclose our community rule, so please listen as just a personal opinion, you should be little bit more careful in your wording when you gave advice for other players. Some people would catch it kind of as high handed behavior and they'd cower.\n\n_Can you please point me to the Japanese Community Rules?_\n\nPlease keep in mind that the rule and standard in a server have been drew up by the all players who have been playing in this server, not Riot. Players in each servers have different sense of values, and that also could be the reason why there is difference between the \" Community rule \" in each servers. All players in the server need to follow the community rule in there at any time, but this is absolutely bases on \" Summoner's Code \" and we have adjusted our rule not to be inappropriate all the time.\n\n_You mentioned that \"Including when the player was using Ping to stir someone's anger, or player was seems to be missing attitude of cooperativeness, or something that is against our community rule.\" \nAre you saying that is part of the reason why my account received a ban?_\n\nI'm sorry that it makes you confused...\nI just wanted to tell you that IFS audit all of behaviors in game, not only the words in the chat. I'm not saying like \" You were using Ping improperly and this is why you got banned! \". Again, sorry for the confusion.\n\n_Moving my RP to another account_\n\nYou can create a new account in League, but it is not allowed to move any contents from the account that is permanently suspended. With regards to refunds, we do not provide refunds for accounts which players are warned about in the Terms of use. You can find the full policy at our Terms of Use on the website: http://www.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\n\nWhat is the process to receive an official review of my ban?\n\nI'm sorry that I can't tell you what behavior exactly caused this suspension, but please note that the factor caused the suspension is not only 1 game. The suspension is as a result of IFS found unsportsmanlike behavior from multiple games you played.\n\n**END ------------------------**\n\nIn all honesty, this is what I have learned:\n1. Don't bother spending real money on RP. Riot can take away my account at any moment for essentially any reason and they don't owe my a explanation in the slightest. It's a waste of money. \n2. Chat is a trap. A couple months back I was playing a game of LOL and this random person's name was \"chatting equals ban\" (or something like that). I laughed at the time, but only now do I realise how accurate it is. When simply making suggestions on how other players can play to improve team performance gets you permanently banned, why bother with chat? \n\nSo now I will simply create another account, never use chat again, and never spend another dollar on RP. \n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-22T14:45:17.275+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, you seem to be confused. Chat is not a trap. It's just expected you hold yourself to the decency of public standard. If you're playing on the Japanese servers, you're expected to behave as Japanese would in public. That culture *does* tend to have a much higher level of politeness when in public or dealing with strangers - so it's not unreasonable that you were too harsh and blunt with them for their liking. As the support agent said, each server has slightly different levels of punishable behavior depending on what the community of that server wants and the culture. You seem to have a great command of the English language - which leads me to believe you're possibly a native speaker from either the US, UK, or Europe - all of which have this blunt style of attitude with others. That type of attitude may not fly in Japan - and that's your fault for not conforming to the standards of the environment you're in.\n\nFurthermore, you say that they can take away your account at any moment for any reason - and while this is technically true, they do not do this. They do not lock or ban accounts without reason - ever. You were **given** an explanation - you just don't like hearing it. The bottom line is your behavior was not in line with that expected of someone on the JP servers, and as such you were given warnings and then a permanent ban.\n\nYou weren't banned for \"simply making suggestions\" - you were banned for the attitude you had in doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Sweet Sayonara","date":"2018-01-22T19:04:10.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi Chermorg. Thanks for your reply. I don't visit the forums often (I probably should have... might have avoided this misunderstanding) so not quite sure what an Advisor does. I'll just assume you have some connection with Riot and that overcoming your bias will be unlikely. But here goes...\n\nCan I ask you to reread my chat log? This time... don't make any assumptions about who I am or where I come from. In fact, imagine I am a young, innocent 13 year old school girl with not one bad bone in my body. Go ahead.. I'll give you a second... \n\nNow imagine I am a 45 year old drunk, pissed off that my wife left me and all I have left is League... Again.. I'll give you a second...\n\nWhat's the point? Just about any sentence in the english language can have \"attitude\" if the reader is biased against it. If that is incorrect, and I used specific words that convey a negative attitude, please feel free to point them out.  \n\nOn the other hand, there most certainly is such a thing as objectively negative language. Using swear words or hate speech particularly when it is used to put others down is never okay. But as you can see, I didn't use any objectively negative language. At worst the language in my chat log is ambiguous. Personally, I don't agree with punishing ambiguous language, but for the sake of this discussion, let's say we need to. What sounds reasonable to you - a 5 day chat restriction? 10 day chat restriction? even a 5 day playing ban? Well apparently Riot believes a full life-time account ban is the right way to go.  Ouch. Even if you thought punishment was appropriate, I think you would agree that a full account ban is extreme, no? \n\nRegarding play and chat on the Japanese server, I have lived and worked in Asia for the past 10 years. I am familiar with Japanese culture and actually love visiting Tokyo and other Japanese cities. Having said that, I must say, not until two days ago (after receiving the ban) had I ever heard that \"each server has slightly different levels of punishable behavior depending on what the community of that server wants and the culture\". Not only is that information no where in the LOL game or LOL client (I couldn't find it), but it is incredibly hard to find on the web. Riot doesn't even tell you that when you get a chat restriction. I only found out after sending emails back and fourth with the LOL support person. Considering that this very well could have been a key reason my account was banned (and loss of 200 USD worth of RP), don't you think this should have been communicated to me sooner? Say when I switch servers or when I receive my first chat restriction? \n\nFurthermore, am I to believe that diversity in LOL is not encouraged? That if you play on a specific server, all of your actions and communications should assimilate? I did grow up in the US (as you astutely pointed out) and I most definitely am more direct than your average Japanese player. In the vast majority of games, I have found this to be a positive for the team, not a negative. Being more direct and assertive means the team communicates better and works better as a team (Asians do a ton of things well, but not everything, https://youtu.be/Bk51T8X2lXA ). When I wasn't banned or chat restricted, I picked up a ton of Leadership Honor. A system that punishes  nonconformity - and especially when that system is hardly (if at all) communicated, is just plain wrong. \n\nAnd yes, chat is a trap. As long as Riot continues to believe that everyone is a troll and assume the worst in people, even the most level-headed, team-orientated comments will be misconstrued and lead to an unceremonious banishment. \n\nI assume there is zero I can do about my ban now, so rather than ask you to speak to Riot on my behalf, I would appreciate it if you can encourage them to update and improve their system. An easy fix is to treat ambiguous language differently. Instead of giving a full account ban, continue to give smaller chat restrictions or playing bans. Easy, no? \n\nThank you for listening. I really appreciate it. \n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-01-22T19:41:53.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might think you were being ambiguous, but if that were the case, how'd you even get reported?

If not, (Only if not) does that mean riot would deem his criticism as \"Crit-hits\" on his team-mates?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-22T16:14:54.267+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"This chat log is negative - but it’s not necessarily punishable in NA.

If this sounds like a bad chat log, fine, was there a \"Lack of\" information for said chat log? yes, but in giving this example the only thing I could see as being flagged (And it wasn't used at anyone, just used) was \"fkng\", and \"wtf?\" \n\nBoth weren't directed at anyone with negativity. the first was merely a \"Sentence-enhancer xD\" whereas the second was more of a confused moment of: how the hell did bot end up top to take turret with my top lane enemy without bot responding, or alerting. \n\nThen everything else was merely criticism. Also, you may even note that in my example, I seemed to be doing more of the whining which makes me seem even more like a villain, but yet again, it was all in an attempt to help my team-mates *Without* being negative. If this chat seems negative, then a question of your personal interpretation of criticism comes into play.\n\nI simply let them know:\n\nWhat would work better (i.e. Gnar want's to try an ap item for his third hit's ap damage instead of using something more viable)\n\nWhat's going on in my neck of the woods (steals, invades, ect)\n\nand even being aware of the map to be able to warn them of a threat (that they may, or may not heed to)\n\nAnd even if I throw these things in, this chat had nothing that shamed them for their mistakes unless it's helpful.\n\"You should have stayed under your tower.\" I'm telling them that it would have been the safer route, and hopefully they will take the advice. I didn't say: \n\"Stop feeding\", or \"why do you keep feeding in your lane?\" Both of those are literally non-helpful statements that would make sense for receiving reports on, but it seems like your personal views on someone's words misunderstands criticism/helpfulness for toxicity, and associates them with toxicity? \nCorrect me if I'm wrong.\n\nEdit-\nI also understand it takes a multitude of games to receive severe punishment, but it always starts with one.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-22T17:40:07.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is where people get caught up - trying to look for “key words”.

The system does not look for words except hate speech or “kys” (and similar) - it looks at chat holistically to determine the “tone” and attitude of it.\n\nalright so even a sentence that displays light humor such as \"Bot, don't dive **I literally watched Kha go swiggity mode in the fog-of-war**\" Isn't enough for the system to make a judgement call on how a human beings attitude is, but for another human it clearly shows I'm not worked up over the match. I can't be assertive when pointing something out without being told that because I didn't \"sound\" a certain way through my chat-logs, that I was given a chat-restriction?\n\nattitude/keywords aside, the way the system works could in-fact use some changes. I am a human being, and just like every player in the community that Isn't toxic, we all communicate differently. for what I have to say to someone to sound toxic when I have no means at all of being toxic just means I can't type at all. If I'm ever in a match with you on my team, and you make some honest mistakes (Because you're human, and it's okay man) then I'll throw in some recommendations. If you report me because you think my attitude is crap when I'm actually in a great mood, and enjoying the match, then obliviously report me. \n\nIf you misunderstand my words that would in-fact, be pretty hard to decipher how I'm feeling (Since there are in-fact players who have been positive through-and-through to their team-mates in a match, but threw the nearest object out of rage against them in reality), then I understand, but to leave it up to a system to judge how I feel towards players using positive remarks, or to eliminate any use of \"key words\" based off my entire chat log from a match, game-play, pings, ect. there seems to be inaccuracy. \n\nDo you know how the system works? I thought only Rioters knew how it worked, but if you do, then cool beans. If not, then (giving an opinion in no way made to be toxic) I feel like you're backing something without having any information, but if you do have proof of how the system works, please inform me. But this attitude thing from the system sounds iffy.
