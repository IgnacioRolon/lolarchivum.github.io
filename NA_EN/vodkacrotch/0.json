It is kinda hard to explain, but I will give it a shot. \r\n\r\nI have 2 monitors, on the left, I play league, on the right I have chrome open for like discord and music. I play league in borderless mode so I can Alt+Tab without closing closing game screen so I can still see what is going on. Now for some reason, whenever I am in game, I can't hear game sounds, and any music or discord becomes spazzy and I can't hear it. If I Alt+Tab, all of a sudden, all the game sounds come back and discord and music all works again. The client is also slow and stuttery and laggy while I am in champ select and while simply clicking around in the client.\r\n\r\nNow, I have a Corsair keyboard and mouse that I use the buttons on the mouse for game shortcuts like pinging and quick upgrade abilities. When I am in game, they do not work, but again, once I Alt+Tab, they work again, but once I click back into the game, it stops working. \r\n\r\nLast night, I uninstalled league twice, completely deleted the entire folder of league and reinstalled in again fresh. I then was able to play like 4 games with my friend, and using discord, before I went to bed with no issues. I wake up this morning and log in and the same issues occur. I am currently uninstalling and gonna try reinstalling the game again.\r\n\r\nNow I have a pretty good computer, and have had no issues like this before, I normally run a fine 150+ fps and a stable 30ms. Ever since yesterday, it has been around 60 fps and is constantly dipping while in games. \r\n\r\nAny ideas on why this is happening all of a sudden?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-12T15:30:27.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be caused by a few other things unrelated to League.  For one, if you have any third party apps running (yes even discord) or overlays they could be cause an interference with your in-game sound.  You should also double check your primary audio device settings, to be sure you've got the correct one set to default.  Disable one app at a time and test it in a custom to help rule out some of these possibilities.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"VodkaCrotch","date":"2017-05-13T02:34:33.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have been trying them and to no avail. I deleted the discord app, and any overlays like overwolf/lolwiz. And I checked the audio settings and that was all fine.  I don't have any thing else running that is out of the ordinary. It just started happening too.... Any other ideas??","replies":[]}]}]}
