I go to a game, whether it is a custom 1v1 or a draft game, 5v5.. everything will be fine while we are picking characters and while the loading screen before the game is loading (Where all the characters are lined up). But the second the game starts, like we get into game, it freezes and buzzes loudly.. (like its gonna blue screen, but doesn't). The only way I can stop it is to hard shutdown my laptop. I have been getting  penalized for leaving these games and it is really annoying me.. Any thoughts??","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T20:59:07.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is very likely caused by the Game DVR feature that was enabled by the recent Windows 10 anniversary update.
