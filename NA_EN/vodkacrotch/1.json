FYI. \r\n\r\nI am running league and have been experiencing constantly changing ping from 30-200 and the game freezes and i will be 'jumping around map'. The game will freeze for a second and then fix itself, but this is constant throughout the game.  I used to run fine with a stable ~30 ping and only have a couple lag spikes, that quickly resolve.  My roommates are not experiencing this lag, I have used my account on their computer and it runs fine.  I have reinstalled the wifi drivers, and reinstalled League to no avail.  The game is basically unplayable now and I don't know what to do...  Suggestions??","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T22:23:23.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some big connection problems, and you may need to contact whoever admins your network.

My connection is fine and I am able to open websites and load videos on YouTube but in League, my ping will spike very high (above 10000) and then sometimes I have low ping but the game is freezing. Most of my friends don't experience such an issue but there are a few of us who do.","replies":[{"poster":"VodkaCrotch","date":"2016-11-04T00:02:49.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea, occasionally i will have it spike to 2k+ ping and its so annoying.
