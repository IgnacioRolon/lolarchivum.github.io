They'd rather have a lot of farm and kills with no deaths. And if they die because they stupidly went in without the support, then they needed to blame someone other than themselves. Because hey, the support is there only for the adc.\n\nIt's the same for asshole supports. It's your fault if you die, but they'll bitch at you for it, even if they were right there and didn't bother to help. They wont want to die, because their kda revolves around deaths and assists over kills, but they wont want to help either because they might die and ruin their precious 0/0/1 kda.\n\nIt's a two-way street with the toxic adcs and supports. Just remember that not all of them are like that. You can get a great, nice support and a great, nice adc.","replies":[{"poster":"HavokDash","date":"2018-11-20T04:48:20.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a support main, exactly this.\nI can bust my ass to keep my adc healed, get them a triple kill\nand still be told how \"fucking useless support\" I am and how that triple kill was \"all me\" according to the adc. \nThey will take all the credit for the kills, use supports as thier personal verbal punching bag,Expect a support to throw themselves upon the enemy sword because the adc wants to score a kill off the support's corpse.\nand at the end of the game, will completely ignore all assists and contributions SUPPORT has made to the team.\nand tell them how useless they are because 'Look at ur kills, ur useless. 0 and 4\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-11-19T23:04:13.664+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"because of people like you who use 1 person to depict an entire role.","replies":[{"poster":"BrandOneTrickBOI","date":"2018-11-19T23:31:47.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But I don’t play adc...","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-11-20T04:37:56.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BrandOneTrickBOI","date":"2018-11-20T11:46:54.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Reported","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-11-20T17:11:41.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BrandOneTrickBOI,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3X6jW4uG,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T11:46:54.517+0000)\n>\n> Reported\n\ndon't give a shit","replies":[{"poster":"BrandOneTrickBOI","date":"2018-11-20T17:36:52.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-11-20T17:48:05.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BrandOneTrickBOI,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3X6jW4uG,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T17:36:52.846+0000)\n>\n> <Removed by Moderation>\n\neek! :c","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Faneseeker","date":"2018-11-20T13:18:37.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Filler supps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-11-20T00:35:23.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the issue is the lack of muting.
