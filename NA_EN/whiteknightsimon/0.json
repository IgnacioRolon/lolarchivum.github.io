I have won one and lost two, and have realized that I should probably not play high risk high reward champions during ranked, at least until my mechanics improve. I like playing mid and top lane, and I was wondering if there were any champions that an unranked pleb like me could play decently. It would be nice if they were kinda forgiving, as I am going to make a lot of mistakes. Please leave some feedback, as I am inexperienced compared to other people.\r\n{{item:2050}} {{item:2050}} \r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-19T19:20:33.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What sort of champion do you prefer?
