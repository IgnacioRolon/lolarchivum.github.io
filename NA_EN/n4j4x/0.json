Malheureusement il n'y a rien à faire.\"\r\n\r\nWhich mean in english : \"No decoder suitable for format:\r\nVLC probably does not support the audio or video format \"undf\". Unfortunately there is nothing to do.\"\r\n\r\nI also tried to change the format with Format Factory, it doesn't work, I tried with website webm to avi or mp4 but my file is too big finally, I tried to open it in Adobe Premiere but Adobe cannot importe the file...\r\n\r\nAnyone of you could know about this issue ? Do I have option to be able to read it and watch my replay ?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help.\r\n\r\nPS : sorry for my english, I'm from france, here to learn it ;)\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T00:42:54.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replays are still in testing so you may run into problems.  Unless the replay is from an older patch, I'm not sure why this would be happening.  I recommend reporting this over at the [client discussion ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)boards so the client devs can review it.
