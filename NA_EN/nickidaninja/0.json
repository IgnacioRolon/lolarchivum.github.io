In creating the new account, I cannot because the email and username are apparently in current use despite having a successful deletion of the account. It's not really a big issue for the username as I can just make another, but now my game email can't be used. I'm aware that I can use another email or make a new email for this, but I would ideally want this on my game email (pretty much my central email for games; I don't want to have multiples for basically convenience). I checked the FAQ (which is linked here) on the account deletion and the deleted information (including the username and the email associated) should be available for future use but apparently not for my case? Am I missing something I'm not aware of? I was sure I could at least use my email but does the information from deleted accounts can not be used for future use then? (And if you're wondering, no I wasn't able to use that email to this account I'm using on forums, and no, I wasn't permabanned and the account is definitely deleted as I don't see it on the database nor can I login with the old account)","replies":[{"poster":"NickiDaNinja","date":"2016-10-21T22:28:07.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't think of that! I'ma try that out to see if that works when I'm able to.\n\nI'm curious though why the username was not in use?
