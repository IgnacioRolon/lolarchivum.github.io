Since your e-mail was verified, we want to be sure it's you before changing the e-mail address.  Really just a sort of safety measure to be sure that someone doesn't just get your League password and change all the verified information.","replies":[{"poster":"CallMeMonk","date":"2016-05-04T20:46:03.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sent a ticket around 9pm yesterday. hope you guys can get to me soon.","replies":[]}]}]}
