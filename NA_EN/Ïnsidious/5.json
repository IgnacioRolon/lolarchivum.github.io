Off the top of my head I can think of a few immediate effects:\r\n\r\n- ADC&#039;s will do less damage in trades, which will make mage supports more viable\r\n-It will disrupt the ADC build path, because you&#039;ll need to buy attack speed and damage on your first back instead of being able to get away with a BF sword. \r\n As a result if you can beat your opponent to an attack speed item and a bf sword you&#039;re gonna wipe the floor with the enemy botlaner\r\n\r\n- These are really going to hurt adc&#039;s that stack passives (Twitch, Kallista, Tristana, etc)\r\n\r\nDiscuss","replies":[{"poster":"ExHentai","date":"2017-11-07T03:18:31.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They get AS through the runes.\n\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-722-notes#patch-precision\n\n>Path Bonus\n>PRECISION + ANY PATH : +18% Attack Speed","replies":[{"poster":"Phantom Blues","date":"2017-11-07T03:23:54.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.
