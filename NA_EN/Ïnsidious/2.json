Now, I love Twitch, and I don&#039;t want to see him nerfed, but I&#039;m curious as to why there are so many people complaining about {{champion:67}} while {{champion:29}} has a higher winrate, and if {{champion:29}} is actually out of line, I don&#039;t want to be blindsided by a nerf.\n\nI&#039;m not too familiar with how good the stats are on OP.GG either, so if I&#039;m wrong let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-11-16T14:49:18.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"twitch has a 6% pick rate\n\nvayne is at 25% \n\nstatistically, Vayne is stronger. twitch is still busted too, tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfram Oxford","date":"2016-11-16T14:26:56.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion ADCs shouldn't be touched until mid laners and tank junglers are dealt with, even if they prove to be strong.

That said, I don't use OP.GG so I'm not exactly sure where their cutoff is.\n\nAccording to Champion.gg, both Twitch and Vayne have a 53% win-rate and are the top two ADCs at the moment.  \n------------------------\nAnyways:\n\n* Vayne's stealth can make her difficult to track during fights or actually target with autoattacks or abilities\n* Vayne's Silver Bolts let her melt through tanks better than most ADCs\n* Vayne is a better duelist (making her more difficult to kill when caught alone or splitpushing)\n* Vayne tends to be a champion who attracts selfish or toxic players (similar to Riven, Yasuo and Zed)\n \nThose are some of the reasons people can find Vayne rather annoying to deal with.\n-------------------\nTwitch may or may not get nerfed.  \n\nAfter large systemic changes (especially during the preseason), outliers are expected to appear due to the massive amounts of changes performed at one time.
