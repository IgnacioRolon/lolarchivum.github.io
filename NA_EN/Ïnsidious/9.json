Bot lane has access to double the wards as any other lane, and the jungler is at bot more often than any other lane... so why does support specifically need to buy sightstone? If it&#039;s for lategame, why not have the toplaner take it? Why not the jungler?\n\n\n\n(I know the answer, it&#039;s because it builds exclusively from gold/time items)\n\n\nIs this a good thing? Should it be limited to the support? If other vision items were added to the game, would you take them over what you currently have? Am I stupid?\n\nEdit 1: Holy shit, am I getting dumpstered or what?\n\nEdit 2: I'm more asking if it is a good idea to make vision more available, and thus free up supports to build different items than only sightstone","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2016-11-30T15:01:41.922+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Several reasons come to mind.\n\n1) Support, by definition, is not a carry role. Sure, they carry sometimes, but they aren't the member of the team designed to blow up the enemy team and secure victory. they're SUPPORTING the player(s) that do. So, while other roles need to aggressively pursue higher stats to achieve the plays they're meant for, the support player suffers the least for buying something that isn't strictly about the stats. \n\n2) Support doesn't farm! So, roaming around a bit to set up wards costs them the least. Requiring the ADC to constantly ward costs them CS and puts them in danger. \n\n3) Supports typically get the least gold on the team. While this can be used as an argument for somebody with more gold to get a sightstone, it also means that the support is the least likely team member to reach full build, so using one of six available item slots for vision rarely hurts them. A toplaner or jungler is much more likely to need that extra item slot in a longer game. \n\n4) The team as a whole benefits from having more wards. Defending the bot lane against ganks is one thing, but warding also keeps vision on the dragon, deep-wards the enemy jungle to set up invades for your jungler, helps to chase down enemies as they duck into bushes, sets up teleport ganks, etc. Trinket wards are a bare-minimum solution to these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2016-11-30T15:31:56.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What then, is the difference between top and bot lane as far as objectives go?

Bot was meant to hold control over dragon to keep the enemy from taking it by warding it. It also makes taking dragon easier then if a solo top laner and a jungler (and maybe mid) were trying to take it. Rift is still a pretty new addition to the rift. so baron pit used to be empty for the first 15 mins of the game. so having an ADC, Supp, and Jungle (sometimes mid too) take the dragon would be faster. and with Tops able to take TP they can come down to help if a fight breaks out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2016-11-30T15:45:17.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that, I noted that on my post. Anyways, top can keep vision control of their river and the baron pit. Now, by my math, if you have a trinket in tribush and river bush and a control ward in dragon pit, you still have 1 left over for deep warding if you are in the bot lane","replies":[{"poster":"ForgivenSoul","date":"2016-11-30T16:14:40.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at level 6 the warding totem lasts 78s and takes 153s to recharge. so it takes a little over 5 mins to cover 2.5 mins of vision with 4 wards to ward 2 spots. also being able to ward a bush is a huge thing in bot lane. Supports and ADC use bot lane bushed so they can trade and poke. sometimes you need to ward these to reduce the poke you get, counter a lane gank or have a ward in a bush behind them to set up for a TP gank from top. But sightstone wards last for 2.5 mins which means supports can cover the same 2 spots with 2 wards for the same amount of time that the ADC and Supp can cover with 4 trinket wards. This allows ADC's to ward bushes in lane to reduce poke or lane ganks, and this allows Supports to pick up Sweeper to remove wards from say Dragon pit without putting a vision ward down.","replies":[{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2016-11-30T16:42:13.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok, but why can't that be a role for the jungler? They have trackers knife for that purpose explicitly\n\nI know it's used by ward-hopping junglers currently, but I dont understand why jungle vision becomes the job of the support and not the jungler","replies":[{"poster":"ForgivenSoul","date":"2016-11-30T17:07:41.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this may be a bad example but I can't think of another one atm.\n\nBut in the LCS it was pretty common to see Junglers pick up a sightstone pretty early on in the game for vision. They understand the underlying strength of vision.  The problem with trackers knife is that while it provides vision, it also takes away the smite buff a jungler could get for extra damage or a slow to help with ganking. Vision is part of the junglers job too but because of how weak the tracker's knife actually is, junglers are more pushed to the Vision Clearing side of vision control then the placement and removal of vision. I think if we buffed Tracker's Knife to say grant a charge when killing a Large Monster in the enemy jungle (Scuddle, dragon and baron aside) we would potentially see it picked up a bit more (atleast on strong counter jungle champions) full Vision Control from junglers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-11-30T17:44:08.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure you can't smite enemy champs with {{item:3711}}, otherwise we'd see a lot more of it. Would be nice if they would add that, but with reduced damage and granting a few seconds of true sight.\n\nBut to answer your question, building sightstone in non-support roles puts you at a gold disadvantage against your enemy laner. Assume you have a mirror matchup of Dr. Mundos in top lane. Both base with 800 gold. One buys a sightstone and returns with +200 hp. The other buys two ruby crystals and returns with +300 hp. Barring any other factors, the Mundo with +300 hp will have a noticeable advantage in duels. \n\nThe gap is even bigger between pure dps where one buys a sightstone at the expense of damage, while the other returns with more damage/mana/move speed or whatever else.","replies":[]}]}
