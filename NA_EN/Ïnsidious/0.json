They hate that every game can be ended in 20 mins off of one mistake botlane. \r\n\r\nThey hate that you don&#039;t need an early game comp to force a game to end. You should not under most circumstances be killing an inhibitor at 20 minutes unless your comp is {{champion:80}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:89}}  and you are getting big. \r\n\r\nI should not be able to pick up a front-to-back teamfighting comp and end the game after giving the midlaner a couple of kills. I should not be able to end a game by forcing an early back or getting a pair of botlane kills.\r\n\r\nBUT\r\n\r\nPlease stop asking for longer games just for the sake of it. If we aren&#039;t careful, we might just get what we are asking for.","replies":[{"poster":"SuddenAntagonist","date":"2017-01-24T08:37:28.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you for the most part. This entirely comes down to turrets being made of cardboard this season. If I pick an early game champion, I should be able to feasibly bully you out of lane and get some free damage. I should NOT, however, be able to take the turret the first time I do this. Minion damage plus a starter item should not be doing that much damage to a turret within the first few minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-01-24T04:57:48.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was no vote option for Spoopy :c","replies":[{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2017-01-24T05:54:36.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry?
