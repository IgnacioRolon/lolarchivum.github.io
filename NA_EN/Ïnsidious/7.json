ADC scales the worst of any role, in both levels and gold. ADC scales almost exclusively with items, and even they scale poorly. In other words, a fed adc is worse than any other role, be that fed tank, bruiser, mage, or assassin (Talon excluded). \n\n2. ADC&#039;s have to build full glass or else they are worthless. There is no time that an adc can afford to buy a real defensive item. Lifesteal is the best thing they have access to because if you build a GA your damage goes to shit and you are useless. \n\nThis is because most adc&#039;s need at least 3 items to teamfight. For example, when I play {{champion:29}} for example, I need {{item:3031}} {{item:3085}} and {{item:3036}} or else I wont be able to deal good damage because the other team will just build {{item:3047}}  and beat my rat-ass into the ground. Now, if the game gets to this point I actually can afford to buy some lifesteal and a GA, but as we all know this is an early game meta and 80% of the time I&#039;m not going to get past 3 items.\n\nNow, I can&#039;t afford to give up any of the 3 aforementioned items or else I will lose all of my damage. ADC&#039;s have no option to build damage and defensively at the same time, like all other lanes. \n\nToplaners have {{item:3071}} {{item:3022}} and {{item:3068}} , midlaners have {{item:3157}} and  {{item:3001}}. What does botlane have? {{item:3156}}  and {{item:3139}}, neither of which are good choices as a first or second item, and neither of which give armor(I know that MF can build {{item:3071}} and {{item:3142}} but that&#039;s extremely niche)\n\nTL:DR, ADC&#039;s are forced to go full glass in order to have enough damage to contribute to teamfights in levels equivalent to mages, fighters or bruisers, but unlike the latter classes have no way to take health or resistances along the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-04T21:11:51.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"A fed ADC is worth less than any other role\"\n\nWhat is this?

Bruiser ADC cannot and will not work because all ADC damage comes from flat AD with low base damages in abilities.
