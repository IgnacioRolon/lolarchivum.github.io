To elaborate, if assassins suck, mid players can fall back onto control mages. If tanks are bad, toplaners can swap to splitpushers or bruisers. If marksmen suck, 1/5 of the players have no recourse and are forced to play through a game that will not be fun, and if they end up in a meta like this one, where you have 2 tanks to peel, a janna with shields and a control mage to cc incoming players it feels pretty good, but not for other players, and not for the losing ad carry.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, a difficult problem to balance. If they are strong, 1/5 of players is having a great time, and if they arer too weak the opposite is true, and neither are healthy.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, a new class is required to give botlaners a different option in champ select, and allow marksmen to fill more of a niche. I don&#039;t think that constantly raging against 1/5 of all players will produce an outcome of any value","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2017-08-25T17:33:46.519+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be perfectly fair, \"ADC\" means \"attack damage carry\". Not only that, but it is possible to run non-marksmen champions down in bottom lane, with the proper support to help them out (Yasuo is a good example, Mordekaiser may also be thrown in. In my experience, it is possible for Gnar to replace the marksmen as well, since his little form is actually quite similar to a marksmen and his big form allows him to assist in heavy engages.)\n\nI think the problem is that marksmen are too broad; they offer DPS, objective control, and overall presence throughout the game. Ignoring a marksmen is not an option, and tanks often have to itemize several items just to survive the marksmen, not even counting the rest of the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2017-08-25T21:15:59.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, you worded it better than I could have ever done.\n\nI would argue however that until they hit at least 2 items their presence is pretty lacking, and there's no good way to make the most slower at killing turrets unless you nerf their damage even harder which affects their teamfighting","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nipsahoy","date":"2017-08-25T18:24:30.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ADC aren't a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2017-08-25T21:13:17.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant in the sense that they are a balance nightmare.
