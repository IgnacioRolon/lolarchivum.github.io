Now you are just able to create games that match you versus strangers....... Can&#039;t riot implement this again please?","replies":[{"poster":"BubbaV","date":"2018-01-04T00:35:19.369+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"no because that would be fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"fƒ15","date":"2018-01-04T02:29:45.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I also really missed this!!\nThen again it wouldn't be as random if you just made matches and quit them until you got the champions you liked even tho the chances are small. Then again it's not like Riot would care about people seeing the same champions much if it was just a custom right? Why not bring URF to custom when it's released?","replies":[{"poster":"simme0","date":"2018-01-04T10:36:41.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back then you were able to choose your champ and not AR just URF as I remebered it. So I would like be have  settings to choose map, URF or not and then the normal settings like All random or draft pick etc. But that's just my thoughts ^^, \n-Why not bring URF to custom when it's released?- they are maybe scared of people stop playing normal ARURF? dunno but when I asked why they haven't implemeted this yet they replied that I should take this up on the boards, unfortunately I suck at creating posts and I am not sure if other people care to much so I don't think this will have influence ;_;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-03T23:59:44.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ","replies":[]}]}
