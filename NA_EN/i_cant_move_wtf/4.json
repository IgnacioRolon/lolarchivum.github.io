I like this amount and distribution.  I don&#039;t want every game to be expected to be a huge investment of my time.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m trying to understand why others would even want longer games on average.  Why do you think they&#039;re better?  I don&#039;t see the benefits.","replies":[{"poster":"cardsbejiggy","date":"2017-10-02T10:52:50.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because 20 minute stomps are boring and soulless. I'm not feeling it like I did when a {{champion:55}} ruthlessly tried to slit my {{champion:202}}'s throat, while making crucial engages and taking objectives behind the enemies' back. There's also the fact that I can curbstomp an {{champion:420}} or a {{champion:157}} but no matter, they just waveclear without a care in the goddamn world and take my tower instantly because damage stacking and weak towers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2017-10-02T08:24:05.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Longer games are simply more worthwile. Most of us are here to have fun, and losing a game after 7 minutes is not fun. Sure, the game lasts much longer than that - but it was essentially lost already then, and from there it was just a nearly vertical uphill battle of trying to stall for time against an opponent that is morbidly much farther ahead of you. \n\nNow i'm not saying Season 2's 20 minute laning phases were necessarily better - but come on, first tower down between 5-7 minutes almost every single match? Seriously? There has to be some sort of middle ground here.\n\nDo you really have fun when \"late game\" is considered the stage of the game when an adc completes their third item?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-10-02T08:22:26.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Longer games require more thinking and a more strategic approach.\n\nIt's not just 'hurr durr farm for 20 minutes' like people who don't want longer games tend to argue, it's 'how can we slowly push our lead (dragons, towers) and win one step at a time'.\n\nOn top of that Riot invalidates lategame carries due to short games to the point where they need reworks just to be viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-02T08:12:55.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Longer games provide more emotional investment, which gives you the idea that your actions caused the outcome to a higher degree, causes you to feel a sense of bond between your team and yourself, and develops memories of the game that can be reflected upon for additional enjoyment.\n\nWhen the game is shorter it feels like you interacted with it much less than you actually did, and gives the feeling that you couldn't affect the outcome regardless of whether or not that is the case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2017-10-02T07:55:46.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally like longer games because they are more intense.
