But there are other ways to enforce a hard damage reduction limit, such as through unique passives, or by the 6 item limit itself, allowing no defense item to grant more than (100 - 1) / 6 % damage reduction of either type.\n\n> and would create a far less smooth power curve for tank items.\n\nThe power curve isn't smooth to begin with by the nature of the item system.  The power you get from an item is only granted after you buy it and it exists in your inventory.  Armor/mr items as they exist now do not grant a smooth curve, their power comes in discrete spikes.  So this is something that would not change.","replies":[{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2019-03-15T05:07:26.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=i cant move wtf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QaJ3TyNh,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-03-15T04:17:55.136+0000)\n> The power curve isn't smooth to begin with by the nature of the item system.

What I mean is that the power curve will be exponential, with later items granting a much larger power spike than early items. I suppose you could make tank items stack in a multiplicative manner rather than an additive manner, but that'd be more confusing than it is now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2019-03-15T09:20:28.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Under your system, if you bought 4 items with 25% MR on each item, you would be completely immune to magic damage.
