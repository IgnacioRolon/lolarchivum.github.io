For the past few months, a friend of mine has had the idea for a scuttle crab plush to be added to the Riot Merch store.  After having a conversation with a Rioter last night after a friendly game he gave us the idea of creating a petition to raise awareness for the idea.  Of course Riot would have all credit and ownership of the idea, this is just to put the idea out there and attempt to bring it to attention.  \r\n\r\nWe hope that you would be willing to sign it to help get the idea out there and to show Riot a great idea that they could easily capitalize off of.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Limely","date":"2017-06-30T22:11:01.113+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey did you play in one of my games??
