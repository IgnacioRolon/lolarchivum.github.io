Specs are 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM memory, ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro 256 MB graphics.\n\nBasically what I've noticed recently is that after I'm done spectating a friend's game, my play button will be grayed out. When I hover over it, it says \"You're unable to play because you may be offline\", but I'm clearly not. My friend also invited me to a Draft game, and it wouldn't let me select my roles. My friend also says that I'm online from his side. I've tried clicking the little green button to go away and back online a few times, which did nothing. The only thing that seems to work is that I have to close the whole application and restart it just to play, which is really inconvenient. I wouldn't think it's an issue with my computer, since I haven't had this problem until recently. However I am definitely open to suggestions.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T16:45:58.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network might be unstable in this case, and losing comms with matchmaking so you can't queue up.
