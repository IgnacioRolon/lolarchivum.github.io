The unusual thing was that players from the enemy team had it to. So i want to know why it happend? And if it happend to other players. Cause this is not normal to me.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nGreetings instaguard","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T00:52:33.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh sounds like you happened across a game that crashed on the server. It doesn't happen too often, but when it does everyone gets kicked and can't rejoin because the game no longer exists. You won't get any punishments and are free to queue back up. No harm no foul.\n\nThat little lag that *everyone* was experiencing is a little troublesome, has this kept happening?","replies":[]}]}
