Because the Dock is on the bottom of my screen, I can't see whatever's on the bottom, so I can hardly click anything down there. Is there a way to make it smaller, or to make it fullscreen?\r\n(2) When playing a game, I can't switch screens, like I usually do by using F3 or by swiping my fingers on the trackpad to switch to other screens (on Mac). It seems stuck. I'd have to wait for the game to end in order to do so. Is there a way to do this, or to make it windowed instead?\r\n\r\nIf this has been answered before, can you please tell me or send the link? From what I've seen, though, it hasn't, or maybe I'm just terrible when it comes to research.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T00:31:25.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooh, well first off, welcome to League!

If you're running the *Beta Client*, you can resize it by holding down the **CTRL** key and hitting the **+** button to increase the client size or the **-** key to reduce the client size.\n\n2. You can change to a windowed mode by hopping into a custom match, then hit the **EXC** key to bring up your in-game settings and head into the **VIDEO** settings, where you can change your windowed mode to window or Borderless. \n\nPlease let me know if these worked for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Petty104","date":"2017-01-10T13:50:02.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=2Ky2GHhP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-06T00:31:25.266+0000)\n>\n> Ooh, well first off, welcome to League!

I'm really sorry for the month-long delay--I wasn't able to post a comment because my level didn't appear to be high enough.\n\nFirst of all, it turns out I'm running the Beta Client, and I was able to resize the client down with your instructions. That means it worked perfectly--thanks!\n\nI was able to change the video settings, although it seemed a bit too big. After some resizing and changing the resolution, it worked! I resized it in such a way that it appeared as if it were in full screen, but it was just a full screen-sized window, which allowed me to switch between screens when I had to. When I go back to it, though, because it's a window, it minimizes and finds its way back into the Dock, where I can just click it again to continue the game. (Don't worry, though, I don't stay away for too long. A few, short checks on other things is all I do. I don't wanna keep my team waiting!)\n\nThanks for the help, I really appreciate it! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T22:32:35.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so glad to hear you sorted everything out to work best for you.
