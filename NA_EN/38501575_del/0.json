Others come to the table with their decisions already made, and for them it's a bore waiting for the game to start that can result in afk failures.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeeCuz","date":"2016-11-01T23:13:31.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Demonizing and enforcement fails to provide an entertaining game experience for the players that aren't you.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"38501575_DEL","date":"2016-11-01T23:14:26.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who's demonizing anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"BeeCuz","date":"2016-11-01T23:16:00.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Merchant,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vfZuziVt,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-11-01T23:14:26.693+0000)\n>\n> Who&#x27;s demonizing anyone?\n\nYes, let's hunt them down!
