When I play vlad, I am always able to charge E then go into pool when the screen is unlocked. However, if I am holding space, and I hold E (my E is on quickcast), then try to pool, the pool won&#039;t work. If I am holding space and I am not charging E, I can pool just fine. This is really annoying because sometimes in teamfights ,I am really concentrated and try to hold space, charge E, then pool but I end up dying because I didn&#039;t pool.","replies":[{"poster":"Vlad","date":"2019-02-05T01:40:30.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really I should be able to press E after pool starts. Riot is kinda silly when it comes to my skill combos and bugs with me. Fizz can troll poll much more often gets real AOE damage on E and can go over walls. What can I do? become a pool of blood and still take some forms of damage :(\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-05T00:48:52.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does your keyboard handle rollover/ghosting? It might not be able to detect W presses while you're holding spacebar and E. Try that combination in another program (like Word or a Boards text field or something).\n\nEDIT: My keyboard can do that combination, and I had no trouble holding E, holding spacebar to center the camera, and then pooling with W in the Practice Tool a moment ago.","replies":[{"poster":"theWestButt","date":"2019-02-05T22:39:36.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, turns out I can press q and r while holding e and spacebar but can't press w.
