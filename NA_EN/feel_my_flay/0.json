Ok so say im in a game, someone starts trolling me, i start to get verbal with him(yes i shouldnt but if someone ruins a game for me n 8 other pp why shouldnt i be pissed) and he keeps trolling me constantly, id rather not even play the rest of the match...sometimes its just too much to take, and not worth my time to put 110% effort into it, only to waste 30-45min of my life, in a game thats not very enjoyable to play. So most of the time, ill go some what afk(meaning-i would jung or farm whatever i can to get by, but not helping with team fights, because im too far behind) by this point in time, the flame went from him to me....so by end game everyones flaming n i get reported...so with chat ban or regular bans, it shows what ive said in messages....If its so toxic, why not mute? And if you did mute, how would u know im being toxic if you cant read it? im jus saying banning is stupid...why give us the power to mute if you still gonna punnish for verbal toxicity? yes i can understand about ACTUALLY trolling, and being toxic that way....yes ban that, but why ban for verbal toxicity?.....sorry jus ranting, i jus feel like riot needs to fix it...","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-08T08:46:11.391+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"By the time someone has to mute you, you have already had a negative impact on their game while they are trying to enjoy themselves. \n\nRiot realizes that people like that are losing them busibess and has decided to escort those people out of their establishment.\n\nYou are allowed to be mad, you are not allowed to harass people because you are mad.","replies":[{"poster":"Feel My Flay","date":"2017-03-08T08:54:40.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"no see thats my point, if there was any harassment it was towards the person who decided to troll me. There would be no reason to get toxic with anyone else, unless they are starting to do it....as i said, the point of flame went from the person who was trolling to me AFTER i decided to just farm what i could n play safe n NOT try to team fight seeing as im too far behind.....but at this point most ppl would start to flame me for \"not helping them in team fights\" esp. when i feel like its not a good fight to engage in on...","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-08T09:00:55.339+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Two things here;\n\n1. Even though you think your toxicity is only affecting the one person, it's actually a distraction for the whole team.\n2. There's no situation where it becomes ok to flame another player. If they are being toxic or trolling, mute and report them and let Riot take care of it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-03-08T08:56:55.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just because someone has the option of ignoring your actions doesn't make your actions any better.  I have the option to mute a raging player.  My muting them has no impact on whether or not they get punished because either way they are causing a strain for other player.  Giving players a mute option is not a way for ragers to avoid punishment, it is a way to relieve the stress of a rager in game until the players can report them in the end of game screen.\n\nIt is like having the option between getting robbed and giving up money, or getting robbed, refusing to give up your money, and getting killed.  Either way the one doing the crime deserves punishment.  The victim still has options in the situation.  If they come by a solution that helps alleviate the issue for them that does not excuse the criminal of their act.  In the same way having the option to not listen to a rager doesn't change the fact that it is against Riot's rules and terms of service, thereby being the equivalent of a crime and as such punishable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soulhavok","date":"2017-03-08T10:58:17.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand your point regards to being banned for chat reasons. Leaving a game because of a troll however I disagree. I would rather play it out and use the time as practice so I can report them afterwards.\n\nI believe a ban over chat is silly except when someone blows up and instantly says something bad like \"go kys %%%got\" when it is the first toxic thing they said. \n\nI mute people once I see a pattern that they are escalating but I rarely report as clearly they are having a bad day. I do report trolling behaviour but chat able to be muted and I believe the younger players really need to learn to use the feature. \n\nWhen you are on tilt just mute all and actually  play the game that will avoid riots silly system catching you out.","replies":[]}]}
