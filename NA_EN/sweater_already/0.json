A few minutes later, he purchased the World Breaker Nautilus skin form the store. I guess this happened before my gift went through. I'm confused, because we both spent RP on it, and he got the skin, but one of us should have not been charged RP, or the transaction should not have gone through or something. Anyone able to help with this? Or point me in the right direction?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T05:00:04.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look and it doesn't look like your friend was charged for their purchase.
