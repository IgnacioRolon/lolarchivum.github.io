This makes the game very frustrating when you randomly can't move and get stuck in the middle of the map. Also have been experiencing extreme lag spikes. My internet is fine. The only thing working properly is my attack click move button. But other than that, the game has been a mess the last two days. Any similar issues or ideas on how to solve this madness?","replies":[{"poster":"Suka Blàtz","date":"2016-08-04T23:45:12.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried reinstalling- nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T15:45:48.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue here may be network related, so reinstalling the game wouldn't necessarily fix this.

I see everything going on around me but my clicks wont go through. Its not with my mouse as i've tried different ones of as well as my laptop track pad.
