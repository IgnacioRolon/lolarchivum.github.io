Because as far as I can tell, his passive isn't CC, his W isn't CC, and his ult isn't CC. This means only his charged Q and E are CC, which is 2. As for the question of why Pyke should have CC, he's a support champion, and he cannot be played like a mid laner or a top laner(at least not without extreme difficulty). He doesn't have waveclear without building it, and he relies on kills to actually get damage, of which, he can't get kills without CC. He pays for his CC with less damage. Also on his ult, it only resets if he kills someone. You can heal someone about to die to it and he loses all kill potential.\n\nPyke as a support RELIES ON HIS ADC more than other supports. If he goes in without his ADC as backup, he's just gonna die unless he's fed.","replies":[{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2019-03-29T07:24:36.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe he was counting the slow you get from his uncharged q as a separate cc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JuiceBoxP","date":"2019-03-28T09:18:57.686+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"1) His damage is quite pathetic.\n2) He is a support squishy diver, he's meant to have cc\n3) 100% of this champ's damage can be denied with the move command.\n4) his gray health gives him sustain between trades, not during fights.\n5)more like a thresh pull\n6)???","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonscourge","date":"2019-03-27T23:43:40.818+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"Please just play him before shitposting like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bluefire mark 2","date":"2019-03-28T01:59:23.004+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A pull a camoflauge an execute and a dash stun... three cc? where's the third?","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-03-28T02:37:48.278+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Op counts his Q twice.
