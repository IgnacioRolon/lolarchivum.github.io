Their dmg is FAR too reliable. Their mobility is FAR too much of a safety net. They&#039;re literally just braindead idiot champs that treat every other champion in the game as food for their fun while the person that didn&#039;t play [insert mobile assassin here] gets to just watch them fuck their combo up and still one shot them. Or even worse fuck their combo up and then just go eh, fuck it, I&#039;ll just run away.","replies":[{"poster":"Reksee","date":"2019-01-31T06:08:18.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mobility and damage, assassins need both.
