She can kill any squishy with R, E, gunblade, blue smite, auto, and Q in less than a second.  The continued AoE damage from her W will then do a generous amount of damage to anyone else in the area before you either run away to farm your ult back up or die.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-27T10:10:15.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't really work that way in high elo. Because you can't risk getting flashed/dodged on the RE and give away 1000g for free and no reason. And you are a sitting duck. In sub plat elo's where everyone is stoned/bad it does work great though.\n\nBest way to play her in high elo is to pop R before a tower siege/defence or an objective/teamfight is about to happen and use 4-5 fireballs on the enemies until they can no longer contest shit. Her R is too slow to hit reliably when her enemies have mechanics and reaction times better than an intoxicated sloth.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2019-02-27T02:17:19.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Shyvana has been a thing for the past...6 seasons.
