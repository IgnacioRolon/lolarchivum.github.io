IMO she's most balanced when her W is treated as secondary damage and you max Q or W is upgraded first mainly to fluff it up.  When she's maxed Q there has been the issue of her being too bursty and dashy, these are early season styles of Vayne.  But the majority of her damage was loaded into physical damage and W was an extra that kept her relevant vs tanky characters.\n\nThe 3 hit is ok but it shouldn't be tied to a 2 hit condition (COUGHPHANTOMHITCOUGH) and it shouldn't be the most rewarding part of her kit.  For some reason a lot of the time when Riot has buffed Vayne, its been her W.  When historically she's needed nerfed on her W a little and mostly on Q and R damage in the early seasons.\n\nThe recent R changes are about the only thing that's new but that just limits counterplay from auto attack champions, she's still vulnerable to long range and burst.  I think item changes and/or rebalancing her kit would make her less of an issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-03-27T15:22:34.556+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":58,"body":"The counter strategy, get this, isn't to build against it.

It's here so she could melt tanks and squishies at similar rate, without being too skewed for any of them.

Basically a reverse to her current power curve, which shouldn't happen\n4. **True damage with Ad scaling**: Fiora burst squishies very very hard while working good vs armor tanks (Malph, Rammus) but being bad vs HP/Sustain tanks (Sion, Maokai).\n5. **Physical %max Hp with bonus % armor pen**: would work very similar as current Fiora tbh, but her numbers would need be bigger (due to loss of true damage) so she would kill squishies even better.\n\nSo, the point is that Fiora %max hp true damage exists not because devs are monkeys, it exists so her dueling potential is similar against every kind of opponent, which is 101 of her intended design.
