Junglers, as of right now, sometimes take sightstone but usually just buy wards like everyone else (and if everyone else aren't buying wards, they *should* be!). If sightstone was buffed, it could be a competitive choice (the enemy jungler has sightstone, so I should get one too!) but I don't think junglers would be forced to.
