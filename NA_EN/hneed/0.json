For context, [this was what the notice said](https://twitter.com/KateyAnthony/status/865299096852090881). We'd deactivated Your Shop while we fixed the issue, so you likely didn't see the non-personalized offers. \n\nThe system used to create your personalized offers is pretty complex and takes a bunch of several factors into consideration. Unfortunately, I'm not able to give exact details, but it's more than just 'who you play'.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackhawx132","date":"2017-05-19T22:46:12.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, my shop didnt change after the reset.

Sorry for the delay here - it was the weekend and I don't usually check on the boards! Regarding your shop, whatever you're currently seeing in the client is what's intended for your offers.

Unfortunately, we aren't able to reroll shop offers. :c","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ButDidYouDie","date":"2017-05-21T17:53:30.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I watched both my buddies ImperatorJhaood and Phoenix609 get redo's on their \"your shop\" While I struggled to even reveal the skins that were discounted.
