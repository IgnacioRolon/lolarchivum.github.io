Since the nerfs, Anivia has been unable to deal with champs with any type of mobility, considering that her ult e combo is now done. iT IS TOO MANA COSTLY TRY AND USE THE ULT E COMBO. And her q is one of the slowest skill shots in the game. She has no counterplay against assasins and cannot even lane against them. RITO PLZ. Buff anivia.","replies":[{"poster":"Bimkon","date":"2016-12-20T15:16:29.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"as anivia main. anivia cant trade with such champions like viktor anni and ect. anymore since if she doesnt hit q its done for her. Now there are alot more usefull champs that can deal more damage with moving fighting area. Anivia need good team to make her new changes usefull and its not for soloq anymore. Hope rito will make changes back where Anivia could dial almost same damage as top tier apc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-19T22:52:29.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Counterplay against assassins: Q them in the face at point-blank range.
