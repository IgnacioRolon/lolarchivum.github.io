Is there a way to get the replay/highlight to show up in at least 1080p, if not some better resolution?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-15T04:32:21.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not very sure if you'll be able to make highlights save by default in 1080p. I've reached out to some of my tech team, and they're under the impression that highlights are inherently saved as 720p in order to save processing time and that a short clip doesn't necessarily require high quality if it's only 10 seconds. \n\nWith that being said, go ahead and reach out to our tech team if you'd like. One of those guys may very well have a trick up their sleeve.","replies":[{"poster":"Arctic Wolf","date":"2017-08-15T14:01:33.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for the reply! I honestly wouldn't care too much if it were short, but what if the clip I wanted to do was more like 3 minutes though? is there a better way to do that, or should I stick to using OBS to record my games in the meantime? (I just wasn't expecting anything that amazing to come of URF, so sadly wasn't running it)","replies":[]}]}]}
