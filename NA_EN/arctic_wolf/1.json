D:","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":16,"down_votes":4,"body":"I like how Riot is updating a lot of their champion base and skin textures for the SR update, but unfortunately it also seems like there's a lot of detail being removed from these skins as well. You can check out the first batch here at http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/09/912-pbe-update-first-batch-of-texture.html#more .  \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, some are being done pretty well. I like how champions such as Ahri, Ashe, and LeBlanc are coming along, their updates improve the textures without taking away from their aesthetic appeal. However, you can see a lot of the minutiae being purged from the skins on champions like Akali, Nautilus, Corki's skins, Xerath, etc... Let's take Nautilus and Orianna for example: their colors have been adjusted to be slightly more subdued to tie into the newer colors on the SR update, however in doing so they lose the details which accentuate different parts of their base skins. Nautilus' armor looks nearly all the same color and his anchor doesn't appear to have spent any time in the depths of the sea. Orianna is a tad different, her incredibly bright yellow has been subdued with a much more classy gold color. However, details in her metalwork on \"The Ball\" as well as her character figure have yet to be buffed accordingly to fit with her new scheme. They didn't necessarily need to stand out as much before as the bright yellow made them 'pop', but the gold is less forgiving. On that same note, Xerath also suffers from a contrast nerf, where the runic designs on his sarcophagus are far less visible than they were before the texture update.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, for any Rioters reading this, I want to turn your attention to this post made a few days ago by a summoner who goes by Mars: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4849631\r\n\r\nHe pointed out great inconsistencies between the Cassiopeia in-game model and the splash art, and even went so far as to create models which would more accurately reflect what it should look like in game (if one was to make the model as a representation of the splash art, not the other way around). Specifically, among his chief concerns were that the scales differ greatly in color and consistency from both the old model and the new splash art. His concerns about the inconsistencies appeared to be legitimate after the new model was released and appeared significantly different from both the old model and new splash art. (Since he didn't include it, the old model vs new comparison can be found here: http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/09/patch-416-cassiopeia-and-renekton-model.html#more) His concerns addressed something I noticed which was different and made me not particularly enjoy the texture update, but unfortunately I'm not the best at 'one of these things is not like the other' and wasn't unable to figure it out until seeing Mars' post.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Rioters, I ask you this: \r\n\r\n1)  Why the drastic change to Cassiopeia's in-game model?\r\n2)  Was it intended to be this different from the splash art?\r\n3)  As Mars asked, is there any chance for a \"Traditional Cassiopeia\" skin, given that her scales are so drastically different and this consists of about half her model?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to any and all who have read this, sorry for the long post","replies":[{"poster":"Tasgal","date":"2014-09-13T14:51:32.351+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Simplicity is often better overall. When you're looking at a still image with an insane resolution small detail can be nice, sure, but otherwise it's best not to include it. In game are you really going to notice the removal of filigree on something? Probably not, you're a little busy focusing on the rest of the game.\n\nRemoval of bloating detail is common in many disciplines outside of art as well. In mathematics for instance, nearly every problem in school begins or ends with the word 'Simplify'. Nobody wants to see some massive ugly expression at the end when you could've trimmed it down to one number. When writing it's common to remove unnecessary words. How much do you really need to say 'very', 'quite', or 'somewhat'?  In physics, do we need to know what every object is doing in an area if they don't affect what we're modeling? No, so we don't include it.\n\nAt the end of the day I agree with their decision. I do love small detail. Things that people may not notice but I've seen or heard make me happy. Yes I was annoyed they removed it, at first. However, if there's never any time to notice it besides the first two minutes of a match, what's the point? Besides, they can include small details in other ways, like Viktor's staff changing color, or Kha'Zix growing new body parts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2014-09-13T23:57:11.965+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":8,"body":"Sometimes, less is more.\n\nCool little details up close muddy how something looks far away.

Nautilus himself is already far too huge that he should be exempt from that effect, whereas Renekton...not that he was super duper great in his old skin, but he really lost a lot of his \"savagery\" with the new plastic-y look.\n\nI can see this making sense in a lot of other smaller champions, but not so much Renekton and Nautilus. For Nautilus, for as squishy and weak he really is (by tank standards) in-game, he is meant to convey a sense of impenetrability and heaviness.

(Think about it though, this part of the anchor is constantly being thrown at targets and slamming into walls, so it's not gonna have the same wear the rest of the anchor does).

Even outside of it, there are a lot of texture updates that (imo) are done really well; I personally like the changes to LeBlanc and Ahri, I think Galio looks even better than before, and Battlecast Xerath actually looks like he belongs in the Battlecast lineup now (Awesome!). Overall I like how a lot of the brightness has been adjusted across the board so that it fits more with how the SR update is coming along. I realize most of what I take issue with isn't something that can be seen during the calamity of battle, however I do feel there are some legitimate concerns I raise. I suppose if I were to boil it down to its essence, my 2 main issues would be this:\n\n1) Nautilus - almost looks a bit too uniform, and from seeing just the model kinda looks more like a character in the \"Jimmy Neutron\" cartoon style, vs a champion in League. Adding back some depth (puns of damage?) to his color scheme might help fix this almost claymation style he now seems to be\n\n2) Cassiopeia - I'm glad I found Mars' post as I couldn't quite articulate what was just so off about her, but her visual/texture update which recently came with her rework changed a lot of things about her character. Her scales, in particular, are no longer the green & black they once were. They are instead a mix of two different blue/green colors, yet the new splash art released had her scales the previous colors. I don't think the changes to the head dress or the eyes being white instead of yellow matter all that much, but I used to be a big Cassiopeia player back in season 2, and now that she is becoming more viable again I'd love to see her color scheme remain as it had been.\n\n\n\nThank-you for taking the time to respond to my post, I apologize for not thinking more clearly and coherently before as a lot of it was more griping than actually addressing the issues which concerned me. \n\n-Arctic Wolf","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2014-09-14T00:01:39.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Some of those new colours just seem... wrong.

WHY REMOVE IT!?!\n\n- This comes up a lot in every sort of texture change but sometimes the small details get the axe in favor of the bigger picture. RiotBaconHawk addressed this in a thread about the removal of Corki's runes on his ROFLcopter blades:\n\nAs always, I want to strongly emphasize that a screen cap does not do justice to an actual in-game experience. Speaking to the removal of the runes, for game clarity purposes, detail like that is lost at game height and muddies the champion look, making it overly busy to the eye.\n\nHowever, would love for Ququ to come weigh in on this as it's his team working on these. I'm on Skins team, and we focus on ensuring we don't add these kinds of unnecessary details—which are cool when zoomed in, and on cosplay, but sadly, not conducive to a clear in-game experience!—but that doesn't mean we don't add details anywhere else :D We are just selective and make sure that details we do add are meaningful and add to the character!\nIronStylus also commented:\n\nGotta remember that detail frequency often works against us. Excessive detail, especially detail that is highly contrasted against it's adjacent material leads to \"flickering\" and \"buzzing.\"\nThat a) hurts they eye, b) generally feels low quality, c) doesn't fit in with our changing style.\nWhile it can be sometimes confused with feature removal, it results in a cleaner asset, it's for the overall health and quality of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Arctic Wolf","date":"2014-09-14T00:50:55.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello AIexei Stukov,\n\nThanks for taking the time to reply to my post, I apologize I noticed Baconhawk first because of the redpost, but I really appreciate someone from the skins team taking the time to elaborate on this.

Upon having more time to look at the models I would agree that most of what is cleaned up won't be noticed in the thick of battle, and some even look much better.

Champions like Orianna, Leona, and Fiora seem to have had the colors muted or dulled, which I opine to be both strange and detrimental. The old textures made the champions pop out more, and the new ones feel like they belong in Zack Snyder's recent take on *Superman.* \n\nIt seems that desaturation or actual darkening of an image is done to make movies/games look 'grittier' or 'more realistic,' but I don't really think that kind of ideology is needed in LOL, in fact I think it becomes a hindrance. The champions in LOL are the most important aspect of the game, and by subduing their appearance they don't stand out as much.
