Wipe their Influence Points to 0. \r\nThis is a great incentive for players with progressive goals to NOT act like savages. If they want new runes or champs via IP, they must start from scratch, or play nice.\r\n\r\n2. Influence point restriction included. Summoners may not EARN influence points until they&#039;ve completed the necessary mandated amount of restricted games. This correlates well with option 1, in that players will be wiped clean and then also restricted for their 10/25/30 game restriction.\r\n\r\n  Players who are goal-oriented and care about the game won&#039;t be acting up, and the players who DO misbehave are forced to take a much better look at the big picture when it comes to progression in this game. \r\n\r\nI propose ideas that wouldnt effect the monetary income of Riot, out of respect for their business.\r\n\r\nIf someone is uber toxic and gets their IP wiped and restricted and decides &quot;eff this game im not playing anymore&quot; then that literally weens out the bad vibes in league that much more. \r\n\r\nThese are two ideas that ERADICATE trolls and toxicity, without disturbing the popultion of dedicated, loving players.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, please comment your thoughts or tweaks to this if you have any suggestions!","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-05-16T07:33:54.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I understand the intention, but honestly I think it would make people more likely to quit than reform.

Smart people don't. It is too obvious that Riot has been perma banning people pretty quickly this season and COINCIDENTALLY made EXP to 30 by half. It's a business decision on their part. They know that a high % of people who get perma banned will make a new account and MOST likely buy boosts/champs/skins all over again.
