Now his account password is changed, then the account sent everyone this: EDIT\n \nSo is there away my friend can get his account back? He worked so hard for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T20:49:36.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yooooo that's not good! First off, I edited your post to remove the links to protect others from being hacked as well. You should definitely have your friend hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) ASAP so that we can help him secure his account and repair any damage that may have happened. Make sure to have him choose the option \"I need help recovering my account\" or he may not send his ticket to the right people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Greyscarr","date":"2017-07-23T14:26:30.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend should know that nothing in the world is for free... even when it comes to RP.\n\nAlso, your friend of yours should suspect at least the fact that the site does not have a https://, but has a http://. That means that the \"s\" that is missing stands for \"secure\" and also means that it's not legit from Riot Games (8th grade IT classes really helped me ^^).\n\nBut going back on what I said before, nothing is free. Your buddy should know that there are these sites that scamm people who believe they will get any benefit  from some reward they see on the internet by putting their username and password on it.\n\nNow, unless some guy at Riot shows up to this thread and decide to help your buddy, I'm afraid that he will have to make another account and start over again.\n\nOr you can send a ticked to Riot. Here is the link: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us\n\nThis one is defenitly secure btw ;)","replies":[]}]}
