There should be a harsher penalty in terms of LP if you leave and make the game needlessly tougher for your team.\n\n> Current system is fair enough. You lose LP regardless of game outcome and get leaver bustered into low priority que which can lead to a ban if you do it regularly.\n\nBut said system does nothing to ensure the people who have leavers are taken care of.\nIf someone gets knocked off the highway by a reckless driver, they don't just arrest said driver. They also send an ambulance and a squadron of firefighters to ensure everyone is safe too. Riot's system is just arresting the reckless driver and leaving the victims to rot.\nAnother problem is that accounts aren't that hard to make. You get a ban, you can make a new account, level it up, and boom, you're now free to ragequit ranked games again. Not hard.\nThat said, a ban doesn't mean much, especially in low elos.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2019-04-02T18:29:18.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No because that would just encourage flaming towards teammates that are doing poorly.","replies":[]}]}
