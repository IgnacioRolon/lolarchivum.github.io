I don&#039;t think he was ever connected for more than a minute at a time. During one of his longer appearances in our game he said his lag was so bad he couldn&#039;t move. But based on his match history, this was a rare occurrence. Of course I reported him, but what will come of it?

Sometimes they have emergencies. Sometimes their power goes out. Sometimes their cat catches fire.\n\nIf Riot put in compensation systems for lag or disconnects, people would find ways to abuse them. And yeah, it really sucks. But there isn't really a better solution.\n\nAs for what will come of it? Likely nothing, which I know is frustrating to hear. But there's no requirement that you have to manage to maintain a lag-free connection for the entire game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecondAirbane","date":"2017-04-28T21:38:51.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean if he was afk all game he will get punished","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2017-04-29T04:44:29.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, you can't get a player banned or suspended due to internet issues.

Which, in that case, this game is behind on the times in comparison to some other games or games are behind in times in general.
