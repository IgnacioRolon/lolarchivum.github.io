It's not helpful, it's not constructive, it's just annoying and disrespectful, hence why you were reported for it.\n\nAlso, you already had at least 3 chances to improve your behavior before this and you didn't. When you're on a 14-day ban your account is on thin ice, and one more mistake can cost you the account. While this isn't the worst set of chat logs that I've seen it's still showing you make little effort to improve your behavior, hence the punishment. If you really were working on improving your behavior like you said then great, but this set of chat logs isn't a very good indicator of that unfortunately.\n\nNext time if someone is acting up and refuses to stop then just mute, report and move on instead of spending the majority of the game complaining about them.

If I was raging at the guy, cursing him to high heaven, flaming, berating, whatever, then I would actually understand that, but this, DESPITE mass improvement compared to the issue that I admittedly used to be, seems unfair to me. This is nowhere NEAR the horrid things that I&#x27;ve seen other people spew all over League chat logs relentlessly. I got told to &quot;rope&quot; myself just the other day... I&#x27;ve NEVER SAID THAT to anyone. That guy&#x27;s running around saying stuff like that not getting banned, but I make a couple of complaints and that&#x27;s not only bannable but worthy of a PERMAban? That&#x27;s insane.\n\nYou were punished based on your behavior alone and the fact that despite receiving prior punishments you still acted in a negative manner consistently enough to get punished again. You cannot get punished based on someone elses behavior, and so what if other people were behaving worse? The \"he started it\" excuse didn't work in school and it doesn't work here. Also, the question isn't \"is this permaban worthy?\" but rather \"is this punish worthy?\" instead, to which the answer is yes. Ordinarily this reform card would receive a chat restriction at most, but since you had a 14-day ban prior to this you were assigned the next available punishment, which in this case was a permaban.\n\nIt's important to note that punishments are handed out based on the consistency of ones poor behavior. Having an off day/game or two when you normally don't act like that won't get you punished, but a consistent enough pattern of negative behavior will. Yes it stinks to see people who act up go unpunished for as long as they sometimes do but that's just the way it works unfortunately (better this than to punish people unfairly for just having off days/games).\n\n> Also, the repeated comments regarding what the player was doing, although not constructive to my team was also not meant for my team. They knew what was going on rather early on in the match. The repeated comments about the player inting and carrying on in a negative way was made in all chat to the other team who inquired about what the heck was going on and I told them. I then continued to discuss it, perhaps giving it a little more thought than I should have, but hey as long as we&#x27;re banning someone for explaining things and lodging a couple of complaints then I suppose we&#x27;re all doomed. \n\nEven if it wasn't meant for your team they still had to put up with your constant complaining about the vayne as did the enemy team assuming no one on either team muted you. I understand that you were explaining what was happening due to them asking, but as you admit you continued on for longer than you should have. Explaining it once or twice? Fine. Complaining about it for the whole game? Not fine.\n\nYou want to help get troublemakers punished? Then report them when you see them. Complaining about them all game long is not only pointless but it also takes time away from playing the actual game itself.\n\n> Either way, I can&#x27;t disagree more. This isn&#x27;t even close to permaban worthy and I can do nothing but stand by that opinion as I challenge the harsh decision for reacting in a disappointed fashion to something that someone else was doing. That&#x27;s like kicking the guy out of the bar who yells at the bouncers &quot;Hey, those guys are fighting and it&#x27;s really annoying&quot; and points at the pair of guys fighting on the other side of the bar, but the spotter gets the boot. It&#x27;s ridiculous.\n\nAgain, the question isn't \"is this permaban worthy?\" but rather \"is this punish worthy?\" instead, to which the answer is yes. Ordinarily this reform card would receive a chat restriction at most, but since you had a 14-day ban prior to this you were assigned the next available punishment, which in this case was a permaban. Why? Because the IFS deemed that you hadn't improved enough to warrant a lesser punishment.\n\nAlso, since you brought up the bar analogy in this case it would be akin to getting involved in the fight after alerting management to it. You want to get the word out about someone, great, but there's no need to get involved in the fight yourself unless your life depended on it, which in this case it doesn't. By making the situation worse you ensured that the 3 of you get the boot. Next time if you must speak then say it once or twice and leave it at that and don't make it worse than it already is.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyriel","date":"2017-09-09T20:02:44.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">\n> You were punished based on your behavior alone and the fact that despite receiving prior punishments you still acted in a negative manner consistently enough to get punished again.

I had EARNED rewards back and had begun to earn player honor back as well. I was literally BACK into the good graces already and hadn't had a warning or any form of punishment in more than a MONTH. Yet I complain about a player's crap behavior in one game and I deserve to get permanently banned when my attitude had been in check for SOOO long? No. That's absolutely nuts. Why in the world would I EVER genuinely care to reform on any other account I play on if their system is clearly flawed in that it doesn't take into consideration the massive strides I had taken to improve to begin with?\n\nI cleaned up my language. I started muting(which I did in that game in order to silence the inting, toxic Vane). I started trying to diffuse situations between teammates rather than causing more aggravation by salting the wound or any of that. I busted my butt to get back into the good graces I had found myself outside of for a while, and ACTUALLY GOT BACK IN... then, after one game that I complained about a top laner who was obviously, visibly being a scumbag, I got shot down in flames. THAT is NOT... fair. Not at all.\n\n\n> Even if it wasn&#x27;t meant for your team they still had to put up with your constant complaining about the vayne as did the enemy team assuming no one on either team muted you.

He hated what Vayne was doing, lodged his complaint openly more than once int he chat logs and did not get a ban or a warning of any kind. Beyond that, what you're basically telling me is to not use chat at all, which seems a little ridiculous because it is a feature of the GAME. \n\nNoted. DO NOT use the chat system provided by league of legends. And when I say this I am not joking. I've moved the chat OFF of my screen on my other account because it's clear that Riot doesn't actually delve into any of these chat logs honestly. They just let their system do all the work. A system that is ripe with errors because Riot is tired of dirtying their hands with all of this. I understand that, and I wouldn't want to both with the obelisk of toxicity that is the League community either, but for an instance like this it is glaringly apparent that this system is flawed. \n\n> Again, the question isn&#x27;t &quot;is this permaban worthy?&quot; but rather &quot;is this punish worthy?&quot; instead, to which the answer is yes.

Going for so long with such good behavior that I EARNED my rewards and the honor system back isn't a massive stride of improvement. I had the 14 day ban WAYYYYY before the new honor system was implemented and I didn't apply for it to begin with, so I never had it because rewards/honor system was disabled already by the time they implemented it. I was actually excited about the new honor system and worked hard to earn it AND rewards. Then, after months of no problem, I got slammed with this? Get out of here.\n\nI get what you're saying about what the question really is, I do. It's not \"is this permaban worthy\" it's \"is this reportable\". I fully understand your standpoint, but when I go two, or almost two months with no troubles in regards to my behavior and then I get this, it's literally out of NOWHERE. I got blindsided by this harder than anything gaming related. This was something I didn't expect AT all, and that is because I had been SOOOOO good lately. I hadn't been tearing people down, raging constantly, AFKing from games, feeding or griefing people. Apart from some small complaints, actually, and I hadn't done ANYTHING wrong. I was just a player enjoying the game that I had been working hard to reform in, but because that \"report\" button is so easily accessible to EVERYONE in the game, regardless of their attitude or their prior infractions, someone who really isn't toxic at all these days got a permaban, and that's what I can't get my head around.\n\nYour jungler could accidentally take a BLUE from the mid laner, and if you don't like that or if that put a bad taste in your mouth you could click that report button at the end of that game and that one report could ACTUALLY effect them. It's not that likely, but that stuff happens, and you KNOW people report other players for petty, small things like that all of the time. The system is broken as long as people can be reported over nothing or next to nothing. Lodging a rightful complaint, which this seems to be in my opinion, should not be reportable. I guess I'll be one of the select few that gets a permanent ban for complaining about someone else being toxic, though. Seems fair.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Killer3000189","date":"2017-09-09T08:32:02.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is it not permaban worthy?

See, you don't know a thing about me. You don't understand how hard I've pressed for change over the last few months that I've been working to get back into the good graces of Riot's community. I got that 14 day ban and shut down my attitude. I never quit games or intentionally fed in the first place, but since that 14 day ban I cleaned up my language and soldiered through game after game of toxicity in trolling for about two months. I tried to be encouraging and constructive in games. I worked a little better with other players and honestly my win rate improved because of it. Based on the changes that I was seeing with my play and my progression, I had nowhere to go but up and no reason NOT to play the game with a good attitude because I was getting good results with an improved attitude. \n\nIn fact, my improved attitude is partly to praise, I think, for finally being able to push up into Plat as a player. For around TWO MONTHS I had no issues. No warnings. No problems. Didn't fight with people(that I can recall). Had a great win rate. Great progression. Earned my rewards back. Earned my honor system back. Things were fantastic.

You're just trying to act as though this was deserved, like I'm sure you do with every other thread in the player behavior thread.
