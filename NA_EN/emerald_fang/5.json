Shaco can copy it to an extent but he can't skip your ward and literally wait in the middle of your lane until you all-in and get smashed because what is counter-play.

I don't know what junglers you're speaking of that tower dive and call it a normal gank, but we have none of those. Only fed champions tower dive.\n\nWhat I said has everything to do with mana cost. She has a more spammable and lower CD Q than Kha, rank 5 is already WAY past the point where you've done multiple ganks and therefore have done something in the game other than farm. She doesn't need blue to regen her resources after farming either, making her transition into mid-game a lot smoother than you probably think.\n\nI'm mostly countering your point of \"AP champs are bad\" because you think that mana cost is a relevant issue. It isn't. Evelynn has always been a squishy champion who gets her ass beat by the jungle and she has no in-kit sustain like Graves/Kha/Rengar or gimmicks like Elise/Shaco to have something else do the tanking.","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2017-03-19T22:27:09.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you even talking about? \n\nClearly we are playing a completely different game roflmao.

It's not really my own opinion if it's not my first time talking about Evelynn or seeing Evelynn used by someone like Dom. Your post was a complaint post nonetheless about how trash your champion is along with the generalizations of AD being stronger than AP in the jungle. Or did you forget that you posted things that aren't 100% objective?\n\nEvelynn has historically changed her build between AD/AP over the years, the AP one being stronger this time.
