There is a list of steps I'd like you to try, they may seem lengthy, but I'm confident they will resolve this.\n\nFirst, I'd like you to log into League, then hop into your installation folder (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and delete the folder called **Config**.\n\nNext, you'll want to hop into a custom match, then go back to your League directory and hop into the Config folder. There will be a file called **persistedsettings.json**. Delete this file. \n\nWhile still inside the Config folder, open the **input.ini** file with wordpad or any text editor. *Delete* all text within this document, then paste the following block of text in its entirety within this document.\n\n> [GameEvents]\nevtPlayerSelectClick = [Button 2]\nevtPlayerMoveClick = [Button 1]\nevtPlayerAttackMoveClick = [Shift] [Button 1]\nevtPetMoveClick = [Alt] [Button 1]\nevtPetReturn = [Alt] [Button 2]\n[HUDEvents]\nevtOnUIMouse1 = [Button 2]\nevtOnUIMouse2 = [Button 1]\nevtOnUIMouse3 = [Button 3]\nevntHudMoveableSelect = [Button 2]\nevtOrbitCamera = [Ctrl][Button 2]\n\n**Save** the changes, then leave the custom match and close League out completely. Log back into League, then hop into a custom match to see if your mouse buttons work as you'd like them to.\n\nI hope this helps, sorry for the block of text, but it was necessary. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Mermaidon","date":"2017-01-03T02:16:18.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked for me, thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-11-24T16:54:23.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, this does not work...\nThank you for your time however.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-11-24T16:20:04.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you.

I say this as a former mouse razer user who went though multiple before i realized its not my usage it is crappy business practices.\n\ncheck out mice by other makers even off brand ones or generic microsoft mice that tend to boast much better quality for much less price ironically.","replies":[{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-11-24T16:54:47.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would I run a repair?","replies":[{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2016-11-25T07:49:54.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its under the options cog wheel in the client, if your using the old one its before you login top right corner if i remember right, if the new one still the top right corner under general tab, initiate full repair.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
