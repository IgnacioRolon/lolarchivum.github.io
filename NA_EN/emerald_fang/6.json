They're giving him a massive buff to his isolation damage. If this change goes through, no one is going to be able to 1v1 him early so he'll be able to invade the enemy jungler at level 3 and fuck them. They fucked up both Kennen and Kha'zix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2017-06-14T16:08:16.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait for the actual patch and then read the notes and you will know their reasons.","replies":[]}]}
