I've tried setting framerate limits and it doesn't work.\r\nIDK if it has to do with my graphics card or not. I have an Intel built-in card and then a Nvidia GM 840. However I'm pretty sure a) I'm playing with the Nvidia instead of the Intel, and b) the Nvidia is capable of running at 144 FPS or higher.\r\n\r\nI know 60 is a perfectly fine framerate to have but sometimes when the game lags out it goes to 10-20 FPS briefly; when the framerate was higher the lags would only decrease FPS to ~30-40. Also I want the higher framerate anyway.\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Indomitus","date":"2016-12-13T22:21:42.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there sorry for the late reply. This happened to me as well a couple months ago, I gave it a day or two then update my graphics drivers and my fps returned to normal, let me know if this helped you as well :)","replies":[{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-12-13T22:53:07.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T04:12:52.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ensured that *Vertical Sync* is disabled in your in-game **VIDEO** settings?
