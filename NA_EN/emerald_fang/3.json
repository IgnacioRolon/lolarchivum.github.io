I'm saying if we ever want him to be competitive viable(and not just a niche pick used to try to surprise the opponent to get a single win for a team who has practiced it), they'd need to either adjust his kit to make him less one-dimensional OR overpower him to such a degree that him being one-dimensional no longer matters. (and ya, Nasus is in the same boat)\n\nUncoordinated teams aren't able to punish that type of telegraphing, but coordinated teams ARE. So if you're revealing your entire strategy that early, the pieces of that strategy have to be insanely strong in order for them to not get countered by coordinated teams. And if they're strong enough to not be countered by coordinated teams, then they're going to be even STRONGER against uncoordinated teams. Which means if they're viable in competitive, they're almost certainly overpowered outside of that environment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2018-09-28T03:05:25.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, he's actually not a dedicated split pusher.

Whereas if Kha'Zix is seeing competitive play, that may not be the same case (depending on what's causing it). That said, Wukong doesn't seem like he's that bad right now.

After the nerfs, I believe Wukongs win rate did not change that much, but his play rate halved. When the sample size is so small, is the data as reliable? I'm not saying somebody should be able to pick up a champion and perform well, but if the majority of Wukong players are OTP, is that a fair comparison to a champion with double the play rate? I think win rate is a little tricky for a champion like Wukong, who is played rarely compared to other champions. If Wukong is picked 4% of the time, with a 12% mid lane play rate, is a 53% win rate really indicative of how the champion is performing? \n\nI understand his burst was too high, but it was said he'd be buffed in a way to increase tankiness, regen, sustain damage, etc. That resulted in an 8% attack speed buff (not to the ratio), which doesn't seem like enough to pick him over other junglers. But I feel like the reason why he is \"bad\" now, is because he is worse in multiple aspects compared to other champions, who haven't been addressed. Graves has a 20% play rate with a 52% win rate... That seems a lot more indicative of an over powered champion. \n\nI hope this clarifies why I was a bit confused about Wukong. I don't mean to come off as argumentative, I just feel like the Wukong nerfs were way too harsh, especially when compared to other champions. Graves is tankier, has a better early game, and can output a lot of damage.

Look at his play rate and tell me again he's OK at the current meta when his E deals literally no damage but if you build duskblade you can one shot people. Do you really not see the problem? That balancing assasins is SO inconcistent because of duskblade? I don't have to be the design director to tell this, so keep it up nerf shaco more because of the overpowered duskblade :) The best thing you could do is remove duskblade from the game (or change the way it works) and revert every assasin in the game, and PINK WARDS, maybe then you wouldn't have problems with \"balancing\" assasins. There was something about league back then that you could do everything you want, bruiser shaco, ap shaco that wasn't even op he was my favourite pick because of fun you could do with him but you killed him for some reason I don't even know why, full ad shaco, unique builds and now? Here you have your duskblade boy have fun with one shotting people when shaco was supposed to be a mindgame champion but now he isn't even unique, and if you are \nstill reading this comment to the end I just want to tell you one last thing, he isn't fun anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ayzev","date":"2018-09-27T14:20:03.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=1022,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XrxOZ8kF,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2018-09-27T00:04:27.993+0000)\n>\n> so shaco is cancerous champion which u never allow to be strong in soloq for longer than a day\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/shaco/diamond\nLiterally unplayable","replies":[{"poster":"1022","date":"2018-09-27T18:31:25.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some champions dont translate well into soloQ winrate, look at lb which at peak of her  strength had like 48% winrate with 90% banrate nobody was claiming she was weak, since release kha  is periodically  broken perma banned in soloQ and lcs  while shaco didnt ever come close to that dominance and versatility, even with  55% soloQ winrate he was almost never picked in  lcs.

Some of us get off work and want to play a couple of games but we have to deal with Zed (i love playing her but) Irelia, Jhin etc. being top tier for months and going untouched. We have to deal with damage creep and pathetically weak turrets because of pro play. 97% of us are screwed because you guys dont want to inconvience the top tier players. \nIt isn't fun watching Zed kill someone because duskblade and thunderlords even when hes slightly behind. \n\nAnd for the love of God please slow down with the patches and just thoroughly assess the state your game! Look at the runes, strong items, overloaded kits, unbalancable kits, boring and uninteresting items, and damage. Sit down and play the game for a few weeks and get the feeling that we get, Smurf if you want to. This game feels like more of a coin flip on which person is going to get caught and lose you the game. It isn't skill, getting fed or objectives, or farming.
