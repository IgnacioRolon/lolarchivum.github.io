Having suffered the loss of his family during the war against Noxus, Bezalel has become disillusioned with the conflict. Seeking a way to end the hostilities while preserving Demacian life, Bezalel researches dangerous forbidden magicks, particularly those concerning the art of golem creation. In doing so, he plans to craft a perfect army that will destroy Noxus once and for all. In battle, Bezalel is a long-range controller/mage who summons and controls clay golems from afar to attack his enemies. Although he struggles to defend himself from up-close attacks, Bezalel&#039;s playstyle makes him particularly effective at engaging others at long range, trapping and collapsing on them with a veritable horde of golems.\n\n\n#**General Info**#\n\n**Role:** Support, Mid\n**Class:** Controller, Mage\n**Subclass:** Disruptor, Artillery Mage\n**Attack Type:** Ranged (550)\n**Secondary Resource:** Mana\n**Appearance:** [artwork is NOT mine](http://img08.deviantart.net/e0bd/i/2003/40/3/d/stone_golem_army.jpg)\n\n\n#**Abilities**#\n\nBezalel is a champion whose power relies heavily on the golems he creates and controls. As such, we will be discussing his ultimate ability first, before addressing his regular abilities.\n\n**_(R) Rite of Creation_** - Bezalel forms a magic circle beneath his feet, allowing him to create &#039;Clay Golems&#039;. Bezalel can only create and control his golems so long as he is within the circle. This ability is available at level 1.\n\n* cast range is 400 (around himself), and has no cost\n* Bezalel sets down a magic circle, changing all his basic abilities to &#039;Clay Golem&#039; while he is inside it\n* while inside this circle, Bezalel may re-activate this ability to change his basic abilities back to normal, and vice versa (there is no cost or cooldown to this effect)\n* if Bezalel is outside the initial circle, he may create another magic circle with this ability (max. 1 circle on the field)\n* cooldown is 8/7/6/5 seconds (after the circle is placed)\n\n>_Design Notes_ : This ability is designed as a position-based form change. Unlike other abilities which can be used in the thick of battle, this spell encourages Bezalel to stand still in an area in order to access his other set of abilities. This allows Bezalel to focus his attention towards manipulating the golems he summons, using them as proxies to fight the battle for him, while occasionally switching forms to his normal abilities to defend himself or aid his allies. In return, enemy champions can counter Bezalel by getting close and forcing him off the circle, which prevents him from controlling his golems. As such, positioning becomes an integral part of Bezalel&#039;s playstyle, since it will likely determine how much power he can dish out during a fight. \n\n**_(Alternate Q/W/E) Clay Golem_** - Bezalel summons a golem from the ground, directing them to attack nearby enemies. This ability levels up along with Bezalel&#039;s ultimate, and is only available if Bezalel has at least 1 point in each respective basic ability (similar to Nidalee).\n\n* cast range is 600, and costs 30-240 mana at all ranks (cost caps at 10 golems summoned)\n* after a brief delay, a golem erupts from a target location in a (200 unit) AoE, dealing 60/80/100/120 (+20% AP) magic damage\n* Bezalel may re-activate the ability that summoned the golem to control it remotely (golems are colour-coded to aid players)\n* after 3 golems are summoned, each subsequent golem summoned in the next 8 seconds will cost 30 more mana\n* static cooldown is 2/1.5/1/0.5 seconds (this starts after the golem dies)\n\n> _Design Notes_ : In contrast to other transforming champions, Bezalel&#039;s alternate set of abilities are all the same skill. They each create a golem that he can micro-manage via their respective ability, allowing a skilled player strong map control, at the cost of mobility. Knowing where to move the golems is a key element of Bezalel&#039;s playstyle, especially in conjunction with his basic abilities. It should also be noted that summoning many golems over a small period of time can deplete Bezalel&#039;s mana reserves quite quickly, making resource management a key factor in deciding upon engagements with the enemy.\n\n**_(Pet) Golem_** - This isn&#039;t an ability, but more of a general run-down of a golem&#039;s stats. This section will refer specifically to golems summoned by &#039;Clay Golem&#039;. Their design and stats are based on Zyra&#039;s plants, although input from other pets was also considered.\n\n* clay golems have 4/5/6 HP (levels at 1/7/13), and a leash range of 1000\n* when summoned, golems gain 50% bonus movement speed that decays over 2/3.5/5 seconds (levels at 1/7/13)\n* golems prioritize enemy champions, especially those that are hit by Bezalel&#039;s attacks or abilities\n* they have a vision range of 250, attack range of 150, and their attacks deal 30-150 (+20% AP) magic damage (based on level), applying spell effects\n* on every 3rd attack, clay golems will do a ground slam, dealing damage in a (200 unit) AoE\n* golems give 10 gold when killed, and lose HP rapidly whenever Bezalel steps off the circle (1 HP per 0.5 seconds)\n* if out of combat for 5 seconds, clay golems will start to regain 1 HP per second\n\n**_(Passive) Clay Army_** - if more than 1 clay golem exists on the field, all of Bezalel&#039;s golems will gain 10/15/20/25% bonus attack speed for each additional clay golem, capping at 20/30/40/50% attack speed (passive levels up at 1/6/11/16).\n\n> _Design Notes_ : This passive is designed to encourage the use of more golems to mob the enemy, rather than only using one to harass at a time. The more golems there are, the more damage they can output. Conversely, killing golems slows down their assault, effectively weakening them.\n\n**_(Q) Earthen Spire_** - Bezalel sends a bolt of energy through the earth, creating a large earth spike that damages and knocks back enemies. If enemies are knocked into a wall, they are briefly stunned.\n\n* cast range is 950, and costs 50 mana at all ranks\n* an energy bolt is sent towards a location, creating a (200 units) AoE spike if the bolt hits an enemy, or reaches the end of its flight path\n* spike deals 70/115/160/205/250 (+60% AP) magic damage, knocking away all enemies hit (400 units)\n* if an enemy is knocked into a wall, they are stunned for 1.5 seconds\n* cooldown is 11/10.5/10/9.5/9 seconds\n\n> _Design Notes_ : An ability used to keep enemies at a distance from Bezalel, so that the golems can attack them without fear of repercussion. This is the only spell within Bezalel&#039;s kit that provides hard CC, and the only method that allows Bezalel to distance himself from an enemy at melee range. This means that Bezalel will use this spell only if he is able to follow up on the stun, or as a last resort against an opponent diving upon him.\n\n**_(W) Crest of the Titan_** - Bezalel places a magic sigil on an allied champion or a clay golem, increasing their size, and enhancing their abilities over time. This is a toggle ability, and will end automatically if Bezalel is interrupted, out of mana, or either he or the target dies.\n\n* cast range is 850, and costs 40 +13/16/19/22/25 mana per second\n* Ally cast: the target becomes immune to enemy slowing effects and gains 5/10/15/20/25 (+15% of Bezalel&#039;s armor) bonus armor \n* Golem cast: the target becomes immune to crowd-control, and deals 15/20/25/30/35% (+7.5% per 100 AP) increased damage (this also fully restores the golem&#039;s HP)\n* cooldown is 10/9/8/7/6 seconds (starts after the ability is toggled off)\n\n> _Design Notes_ : A powerful toggled ability that empowers Bezalel&#039;s allies or golems, granting them survivability and damage respectively. It can help your allies get close to the enemy team when the latter tries to kite them, or stave away soft CC while retreating. This makes Bezalel synergize quite well with juggernaut champions, who can mow down enemies or body-block skillshots. Alternatively, it may be used on a golem to deal more damage and carve a path through the enemy team, distracting them long enough for allies to push forward. However, it must be noted that this spell is rather mana-hungry in nature, so careful consideration must be taken as to who gets this buff, and how long they should hold it. As a side note, Bezalel may also cast it on himself, should he find the need to reduce any damage dealt to him.\n\n**_(E) Guardian Wall_** - Bezalel creates a curved wall of immovable golems for 4 seconds to attack nearby enemies. Enemy champions may attack the wall to break it down. This ability has a minimum cast range.\n\n* cast range is 450-900, and costs 70 mana at all ranks\n* after a brief delay, a wall of golems is created a location, facing outwards away from Bezalel\n* the wall length increases the farther Bezalel casts it from his current location (350-700 units)\n* wall golems have the same attack range/damage/speed as clay golems (but they can&#039;t move or attack turrets)\n* enemies can&#039;t be attacked by &gt;1 wall golem at the same time &amp; may attack the wall to destroy it (2/2/3/3/4 HP)\n* Bezalel may recast this ability to bring down the wall early\n- cooldown is 18/17/16/15/14 seconds\n\n>_Design Notes_ : This spell works similarly to Cassiopiea&#039;s (W) Miasma. It is mainly designed to help corner enemies and stun them through the use of (Q) Earthen Spire at long range. Because of the minimum cast range, this spell is less useful at close quarters than it is at long range, so a mobile enemy can render this ability useless if they avoid its cast location and get in close enough. \n\n\n#**Gameplay**#\n\nBezalel is a champion meant to operate in the backline, using his golems to attack the enemy rather than doing so himself. To do so, he must often find a spot to place his (R) Rite of Creation that will keep him out of harm&#039;s reach, but still allow him to have an influence on the battle. This long range playstyle allows Bezalel to harass his foes easily, laying siege to the enemy base, and summoning a frontline of golems that can defend his allies without fear of retaliation. While fighting in the jungle, Bezalel can scout brushes and control objectives through careful manipulation of his golems, reducing the chances of an enemy ambush. During teamfights, he can block off narrow corridors to separate the enemy team, giving ample time for his golems to beat down isolated champions.\n\nHowever, Bezalel&#039;s power and control is not without its risks. While he excels at long range combat, Bezalel struggles to deal with anyone that slips past his defenses and gets into close range. As Bezalel can only control his golems while in his summoning circle, enemies will often try to force him off the array and kill him before he can respond. This makes wide open spaces somewhat difficult for Bezalel to fight in, as there are more places that an assassin or diver can use to maneuver around his spells and attack up-close. As such, Bezalel may sometimes need the help of allies who can prevent enemies from getting close.\n\n\n#**Lore/Background**#\n\nThere is little that can be said about Demacia's College of Magic without paying heed to Bezalel's contributions. A skilled magus and former war advisor, Bezalel resided within the College as one of its foremost professors. His guidance and tutelage influenced countless students, many of whom would later become distinguished mages themselves. And yet, if one were to walk down the institution's hallways, they would be hard pressed to find any mention or trace of his accomplishments. For although his skill and achievements were great, Demacia had little tolerance for anyone that deserted their homeland.\n\nIt is difficult to tell what sequence of events made Bezalel's desertion, but many of his former colleagues point to the deaths of his wife and son as a potential tipping point. Driven mad with grief, Bezalel shut himself within his study, burying himself in research as a means to forget his sorrow. Any attempt to console him was met with a closed door, and every conversation held was brief and scattered, his contemporaries unable to distinguish his muttered responses from that of a madman. In the end, they decided to leave the man to his grief, hoping that whatever he was researching would help ease the pain of death. \n\nIt wasn't until the late spring of next year that the College realized something had gone horribly wrong in their midst. Tales of strange earthen creatures in the middle of the night had sprung up within the city walls, terrorizing citizens before being taken down by the city guard. Each of them bore horrific scars, stitched together in an unrecognizable patchwork of clay and metal. When it became clear that the incidences seemed to coalesce around the College of Magic, a full-scale inquiry was launched to clear the matter. It wasn't long before a search through the college grounds revealed that these creatures came from Bezalel's study. Within his chambers, they found various notes and specimens, ancient texts detailing forbidden summoning rituals and creating artificial life. It was clear that the monsters were failed experiments, golems that could only imitate life but never truly experience it. Armed with this knowledge, the Demacian Council arrested Bezalel for illegal experimentation and for violating the sanctity of life.\n\nNeedless to say, Bezalel protested heavily against the indictment. He claimed that his research could save the lives of countless soldiers, even win the war against Noxus, if they allowed him to complete it. But his arguments fell on deaf ears, and his research was confiscated. Infuriated by the Council's unwillingness to prevent more bloodshed, Bezalel escaped his captors and fled the city. Making his way out of Demacia, he now seeks asylum in another land, a place where he may finish his research. Only then, will he begin his true mission; to raise an army of golems that will destroy Noxus once and for all.\n\n\n#**CCOS Reviews**#\n\nThis concept is participating in the March 2017 CCOS.
