Before i start, however, i&#039;d like to say that even without any answers to this post, i&#039;m still pretty hyped for his rework: he was, after all, the original &quot;my whole kit is about summons&quot; type of champion. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Malzahar&#039;s update made his main damage source his minions. Annie and Zyra, to a certain extend, are also now based off their summons. Does that mean Yorick will be updated in a different direction? By this, i mean necromancer instead of minionmancer: instead of summoning minions who look like zombies, will his kit feature a &quot;something happens when things die around me&quot; ability? \r\n\r\n* Will he still be tanky? Illaoi does focus on her passive summons, but is a juggernaut. Yorick being unkillable with a swarm of ghouls is still considered plausible.\r\n\r\n* Shovel, hunchback and sadness. Will Yorick keep those? With the pretty neat Skarner story, Yorick digging right through our hearts is possible.\r\n\r\n* Pentakill album. How&#039;s it going? Anything you want to focus on?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-17T18:10:26.786+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yorick will still be pretty summons heavy post update, we see that as a core of his gameplay identity.

Everyone of his summons should be one of his dead friends he brings back to life because he can't let go.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"alfavhunter","date":"2016-05-19T22:31:55.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New passive\n\nGrave robber\nYorick basic attacks increase the duration of all active ghouls by 1 second and increases thier movement speed by 12+1 per LVL % (30% bonus MS at LVL 18 per ghoul with yorick base MS), Yoric gains 10/20/30/40% AS per active ghoul (2.5 is max attack speed so it has a cap)\n\nYoric spells now cost 2% of his max health to use, he no longer uses mana, his sustain is he gains massive lifesteal from a ghoul on his basic attacks (he no longer heals from ghouls dealing.
