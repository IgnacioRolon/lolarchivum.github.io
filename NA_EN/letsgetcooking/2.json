Braum. \nYou like playing {{champion:122}} {{champion:24}}  or {{champion:131}} ? Braum.\nSeriously, i never saw anyone else play Braum, and, to be honest, i&#039;m rather fine with it: i like my ranged teammates relevant.\n\nBut Braum deals no damage, thus is worthless, right? That&#039;s the beauty of it: Braum will deal no damage, and make sure the enemy {{champion:119}}  won&#039;t either. Does Draven have CC? None that go through my shield? Glorious.\n\nSometimes it is annoying not to face champions that rely heavily on their attacks, like {{champion:17}} and his mushroom  or {{champion:412}}  and his instant attacks who go through your shield. But then again, this is also the magic of Braum: when you play Braum, you go full tank mega shield Braum. Braum needs all the shields for his team. {{item:3401}} {{item:3190}}  and makes sure nobody dies. \n\nAnyone who plays Braum in regular games or likes him, try him out in hexakill. Start {{item:1054}} {{item:3302}}  and have around 800 hp at lvl 1. Braum is not one to die easily.\n\nYou still rely on teammates, yes, but when you are Braum, your teammates grow mustache and chest hair, even ladies. Always victory.\n\nDon&#039;t worry, Braum was trying little bit.","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2015-06-03T17:28:43.514+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing AP Alistar.

It's almost a certain win for me everytime I play her, as her ultimate will turn any teamfight into a victory. She's extremely strong in this gamemode when the map is so small and there's 6 people.\n\nI really wish Hexakill would become a permanent game mode. I haven't had this much fun in league of legends for ages! I rarely play classic SR games, and have sticked to arams, but the mark/dash has made it somewhat annoying for me, and I've finally found a new game mode I really love!
