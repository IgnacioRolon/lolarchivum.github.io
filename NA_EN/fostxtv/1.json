I am fine with Azirs movement speed R nerfs and that he cant cast soldiers on towers to lower his pushing speed. Its not fair to nerf wall from 5/6/7 seconds to 3 at all ranks. At least make it 3/4/5 instead of 3 at all levels. It really helps and teamfights last much longer then 3 seconds. I messaged Rioter and he said that his ultimate is only used for knockback which isnt true. His ult has many uses including knockback, one of primary uses is protecting yourself and your carry in teamfights from all these assassins and tanks who want to destroy back lane. It would be amazing if Riots balance team can look at my suggestion to make his ult last for 3/4/5 seconds instead of 3 seconds that is currently on PBE. Personally this would be a solid nerf while not gutting him, even if his whole kit got nerfed.\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\n-{{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-26T03:43:38.894+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":75,"body":"Zed: We've pulled the ult nerf from patch 6.11 after a lot of debate on the team as to how hard the Q changes will or won't hit Zed. Still sitting on it as an option for a later patch, we want to assess what impact those other changes have first though.\n\nAzir: One of the issues we're looking to address with the reduced duration on Azir's ult is how hard it shuts down melee, fighters in particular who can't just disengage from the fight for a while. 5/6/7 seconds is a really long time to wait in a team fight for it to go down, meaning Azir's presence makes it really hard to play many melee champions usefully unless they've got really high slipperiness (leave fight then return), a way to cross his wall (blink or flanking ability) or really long fight times (tanky, or great with a tanky build). The other issue is just the raw power of the ability, as both a strong AOE knockback and a persistent wall. The knockback generates a lot of interesting plays/counterplays. We concluded as a result that, given we felt we needed to take power out of the ability, it was better to hit the persistent wall, which tied in well with the above concerns on effect on melee champs.\n\nIn terms of overall power both Zed and Azir are too strong. Azir's particularly out of line when played by a really experienced Azir player (experienced players should perform much better, there's still a limit though). I suspect we'll have to hit both of them again at some point in the next few patches, that's a personal guess though rather than currently planned work.

Assassins should be riskier than other champs and more difficult, as playing them without considering their weaknessess should result in their deaths and losses, while tanks on the in contrast  basically exist to reduce risks.\n\nWith this in mind, i consider assassins balanced when they sit below 49% winrate, even lower if the assassin is popular, while tanks on the other hand are balanced when they are above 51% winrate as they generally complete teams and a team with a tank should be more likely to win against a team without.\n\nSo when i see an assassin, especially a popular one, sitting at or above 50% winrate i just know that its overpowered. Their risks are too few and not reliably punished enough (zed popping your ADC in .5s before morgana can even land her Q on him when he is literally on top of her, then blinking back), and their skill floor is too low if they are easily accessible.\n\nSo while zed isnt the worst designed assassin (remember that rengar, akali and talon all exist) hes still overpowered.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-05-26T04:13:22.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"what about kindred. hes getting nerfed and getting a pretty decent compensation buff.  hes both a good team fighter and a good 1v1 champion in the jungle early on.  the ultimate nerf didn't seem to do anything to him as most of the time kindred just ults in the middle of his whole team and everyone goes in. better safe than sorry. but again the ult nerf didn't do anything. bloodrazor is better on him than any other champion and it got buffed.","replies":[{"poster":"Titanusse","date":"2016-05-26T04:50:48.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":21,"body":"*Shes Shes shes her her her Holy shit how can you talk about this champ without even knowing her gender god-dammit {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \nAS her her ults strength its honestly massively detrimental as it lasts almost no time at all in a teamfight and when Vs champions that can stay out of her extremely shot auto range have a;l too easy of a time against her","replies":[{"poster":"OrigamiPaper","date":"2016-05-26T04:59:57.953+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be more specific, Kindred should be referred to as \"they\", so you're not correct either...","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-05-26T05:39:28.089+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if \"it\" would be correct or if it is \"they\".

Since it doesn't sound like you want to touch his overall damage, the next major focus should be Zed's mobility. Either reduce it, make it more conditional when he can jump (like needing to deal damage first), or add a cooldown between when he can activate his jump from when he first casts it.\n\nHonestly, a major issue people have with Zed is that he can use flash to jump to someone outside their normal vision nearly instantly.

His W already has a 24 second cd at rank 1 so he can only do it ever 24 seconds in lane eventually going down to 20 seconds towards lvl 6 and  on ward since Zed most likely got cd till he maxes W. This should of been plenty of time for you to do a full combo on him...  \"He plays safe all game if I try\" I can assure you that zed is probably going to go last hit minions if he is an average Zed. Which is where you should be going for a full combo depending on the champion you are playing. If he isn't then just force him out lane while he has the cd up, more cs for you will help you in the long run. Note this average Zed player , the problem is with the people who can play him above average. That's where Zed becomes a massive problem. His kit is a lot more overloaded when you can utilize his kit fully which is a problem.  Also understand that people's favorite champion will be handle alot more bias then other random champions, especially if the balance team likes Zed alot, while this is unfair but you will also find this life as well so we are going to have to deal with it . I miss old zed where  it was actually considered skill to play him correctly.  Now how would I balance him?\nI would put that nerf to his ult because that to me would define him as champion and make him actually land all q's and make sure he has to stay there long then 1-2 basic attacks with an e and then back to q cast from shadow to hit the champion if needed.  I would also remove the slow from E since that give him that helps him a bit too much when landing his q.  Then make a nerf to his passive for the hp required to proc it since its basically an mini-execute.
