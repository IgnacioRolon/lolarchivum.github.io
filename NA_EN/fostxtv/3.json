The passive&#x27;s also, we think, a safer place to put power, hence doing so in ways that both make it a bit more useable and decrease the cost of doing so a bit.\n\nI am going to refer to Azir and Illaoi in relation to each other as Illaoi is where I see Riot intending Azir to be in how he uses his abilities. \n{{champion:268}} {{champion:420}}{{champion:268}} {{champion:420}}{{champion:268}} {{champion:420}}{{champion:268}} {{champion:420}} \n\nOne of the biggest things with Azir is that in order for him to be useful, he must practically build full damage and have very offensive runes and masteries. However, he still suffers from very big mana problems which is understandable to keep him from becoming a menace. \n\n However, why not give him treatment to match someone like Illaoi (somewhat). Illaoi has low mana costs that give her the damage to use her abilities often and repeatedly (which is what Azir is designed to do). Azir needs to be able to raise and reorder soldiers reliably to sustain dps. We all know Azir is basically an ADC that does AP damage instead of AD. One of his biggest failings is not his ability to not do damage early but the fact that his abilities cost so much to use early and once out must 9/10 go back to base. His damage can be reigned back but honestly if a player decides to try and construct an Azir build around mana/durability (one or the other or both), his damage is irreparably hurt and he doesn't recover even in late late game. \n\nCompare Azir with other dps casters (Ryze, Cass, etc.) If they run out of mana they become worse than useless and more often than not that's what happens to Azir and he is a glass cannon. But Ryze and Cass have been built around closer range and their damage reflects shorter range and their defense is much better. Azir is a glass cannon with high costs, no real defense stats, and gutted scaling that hurts his late game and kills his early game (you see what I am getting at here?). You have turned a fun champion into a champion that becomes a liability. I seriously think that you can hit his dps damage, his q damage, and his r duration and IF YOU GAVE HIM THE ABILITY TO KEEP CASTING SPELLS HE WOULD BE OKAY (not amazing but okay). You originally built Azir around spell costs to account for building items like Rod of Ages and Morellos. But experienced players can't build those items on Azir and expect better results than building Nashor's Tooth and Rylai's on him. \n\nI sincerely think that what Illaoi eventually became is what your goal for Azir should be. Illaoi is hella fun and she offers Zone Control, just like Azir. She has a small mana pool (just like Azir), but her abilities cost far less AND they scale from low levels up to give her mana pool time to grow/lvl. Her signature q starts at 40 mana then grows 5/lvl to 60 mana. Azir's q is a NECESSITY for his style of play and costs 70 mana AT LEVEL 1 and remains at 70 mana at level 5. Illaoi has a mana pool of 300 at level 1 ( she can q 7.5 times with 0 mana regen). Azir has a pool of 351 at level 1 ( he can q 5 times with 0 mana regen BUT he must ALWAYS CAST W before doing any spells so in reality his q costs 110 mana to use and he can only use it 3.19 times level 1 [I know that he has to be level 2 to use wq but its to show how high his mana costs are]).\n\nConsider a more lenient mana system for Azir so that either his pool is naturally larger than it is or that his W-Arise, does not cost any mana to cast. Because the problem with Azir is he is starved for multiple stats that and he CANT have all of them. You can gut Azir's damage (even more than you have), but if you made it so that he can cast abilities without losing a third of his mana pool he would be sooooooooooooo much better. On top of that, IF YOU MADE HIS W FREE, he would not be worthless when out of mana. His soldiers couldn't be dragged around, but as a champion, his damage is tied to his soldiers, and denying him his soldiers means you deny him any damage when he is in trouble.\n\n\n\n\n**TOO LONG DIDN'T READ:**\n\nConsider treating Azir like Illaoi, allow him the use of his abilities at a lower cost.\n\n**Calculate his Q and his E costs as W+Q and W+E because in reality that's what those abilities ACTUALLY COST. Consider moving W's cost to Q and/or E so that he can access his soldiers (HIS ACTUAL DAMAGE) in a pinch but with the very BALANCED negative that he can't move them when OOM and they can be sidestepped. Basically make W free or extremely low cost. As of right now, his W+Q cost 110 mana (31% of his mana pool at level 1, and 10% at level 18, I know mana regen is a serious factor here, but this is just to show how much it costs him to have extended fights as a DPS.  Illaoi reliability to keep casting represents Azir's desired state to be a DPS.) ** Also DPS is how he does damage, I am not suggesting a buff to his damage numbers. But his mana costs were scaled ORIGINALLY for a very powerful Azir and have since not significantly been altered.\n\nConsider one or all of the following: upping his mana pool/increase regen/lower his mana costs on abilities because if he has been gutted for damage, at least allow him to use abilities at a MUCH more reliable rate so that he can at least still be fun.\n\nNever said it but feel free to give him a longer cooldown on his e if you even consider making his other abilities more accessible/lower cost. His e is in reality only used for escaping or for his Shurima Shuffle. If you want to make him a target for ganks but allow for reliability of E->Q->R make it so that he has to use it and then wait for a long cooldown. Also his cooldown on E is 15 seconds at level 5 BUT that is incorrect. His **ACTUAL cooldown is 9 seconds** because that is what his E is like on **40%** cooldown. Balance him according to what his abilities cost/use are like on 40% cooldown, because an experienced Azir player (pro or not) will have on him to make use of his passive. \n\nAzir is a caster champ and WANTS to cast abilities. So LET HIM.\n\n\nAs a side note, I really feel azir should go 18/12 because he is a DPS champ and in reality should be making significant use of Deathfire's Touch. He should be the kind of champ that should be knocking tanks down rather than bursting squishies with Thunderlords. But he can't keep up the repeated hits over the long term with small mana resources to make use hammering on tanks. \n\n\n\n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2016-12-01T12:30:12.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Gsfgqyig,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-11-28T20:58:05.246+0000)\n>\n> There are some champs, Azir and Kalista being the most prominent two right now, with whom we&#x27;re really cautious when buffing.

They're awesome. Reduced CD on soldiers is quite dangerous in my opinion, though. 4 soldiers are going to be extremely oppressive in lategame teamfights(Azir is extremely strong late game already!! Giving him 4 soldiers in a teamfight absolutely can break it), and 2 seconds shaved off early game also means having a soldier more likely to be available for an escape early game, which means that Azir's ability to escape ganks is going to be even higher(and he's already basically ungankable).\n\nI have some questions/suggestions about Azir, and would really like you to take a look.\n\n1) I absolutely hate how Azir's turret slowly loses HP over time, even if you're near and actively using it. In my opinion, it would be much better for a turret to only start losing HP if Azir is far away from it/dead. Making it a bit like Tibbers, who doesn't lose HP by itself and only dies by a timer. Have you ever considered making it this way?\n\n2) The \"extra\" slow mechanic on Q. I'm not sure most people even know that it exists, or that it ever gets used against anything that's not a 6 stack Cho'gath. I think it's a little bit redundant for a slow to be increased if multiple soldier's hit. Also, I never got to testing it, mainly because it's currently nearly impossible to have 4 soldiers out, but will a 4-soldier Q root a target if all of them connect? \n\nAs things stand, I think that extra slow mechanic is better off gone, much like the knock-up from E that got removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Mikiux","date":"2016-11-30T11:28:53.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Catchdown S,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Gsfgqyig,comment-id=00050010,timestamp=2016-11-30T01:02:12.019+0000)\n>\n> I really love the turret changes!

Slow duration is only refreshed if soldier hits.... http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-513-notes#patch-slow-stacking  Its been more then 1 year since this patch where Azir Q don't get additional slow for multiple soldier Q hits. meaning that you will only notice slow duration increase only if your soldiers are behind and in front of you. Also you can't have 4 soldiers to hit one person because your Q spreads soldiers (when you have 3 soldiers and use Q right at target you may only be able to attack with 2 of them) \nAlso slows never root. Because they leave a capped about of movement speed if slow is too high.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-11-28T01:03:17.085+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is going to slowly buff azir in ways to try and keep him out of LCS.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-28T01:03:56.977+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-11-28T01:05:20.408+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least he's getting something unlike aatrox LOL","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-28T01:09:07.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't Aatrox supposed to get something next Pbe patch?","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-11-28T01:15:14.444+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope, it was this patch, and he gets fucking nothing.

Though I really dislike the idea of buffing his passive as a means of making him balanced. I mean yeah itd be nice if his passive was slightly stronger, but I feel that I dont play azir because of his passive, I play azir because of his ability to auto attack as a mage from a distance and have small windows of burst and mobility. His ult seems very underpowered now and I know you recently nerfed it hard and his early damage. I would much rather see his passive changed or something and put the tower making onto another more thematic champion. Its really just another extra that he has that fits a little but not amazing. Please dont use too much of his available power into his current passive though. I would say, if his ult is only gonna last 3-5 seconds instead of 10, then make it wider at all ranks to compensate, this would simply make it easier to hit and hit more targets, since it wont keep them out, and this makes him slightly easier to play, further separating the gap from LCS to normal people. \n\nIf Azir existed with a knockup on his E, a shield on his E, a wall that lasted twice as long, a second passive that gives him free Attack Speed with CDR, a W passive that lets him smite towers, more base damages early, a passive that lets him summon a pseudo tower, and a lot of small other things, then I'm sure he can exist with a few of those things, maybe even replace his tower passive with the CDR to attack speed passive. Overall give him power where he is thematically fun, not where it works to give power to just because it doesnt help pros. \n\nAs a side note, now that his E doesnt knock up, having it stop on enemy hit is no longer a good thing, and usually only a bad thing for Azir (it was truly a double nerf). Maybe make his E go through champions and apply the shield if it goes through one. This is also another source of power that helps his escapes and positioning for knockbacks potentially, since his knockback is very limited as good peel now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-11-28T01:36:31.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They never said the Azir and Kalista buffs would be big.
