The first time this happened I assumed it was just a one time occurrence so I just went and tried to play another game. I was surprised to discover my computer had frozen a second time. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, deleting excess files to free up hard drive space, and restarting my computer multiple times. I still cannot even load into a custom game. I would appreciate some help in fixing this issue so I can play the game again. My Windows 10 updating itself yesterday, might this  have anything to do with it?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nWhiteFerret21","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T21:22:40.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A recent update with Windows caused an issue with the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) causing games to freeze for some players.
