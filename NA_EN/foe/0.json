Riot initially handled it poorly and didn't communicate well on an issue they should have known from past experience could go very wrong and would likely get much larger than just the players in that game.

Therefore the role \"Support\" should be allowed to go top, mid or jungle and \"Support\" their team. Unless it specifically states otherwise for example \"Support bot\" it should not be expected nor enforced as a punishable ban offence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Febos","date":"2019-06-21T17:34:58.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=blindasleep,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2bb28xra,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-06-21T16:56:21.524+0000)\n>\n> In the end both of the players were wrong.\n\n+1\n\nThe proof is in the cookie:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Nightbloo/status/1141963162360545280","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-06-21T17:13:48.580+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"OMG this again.\n\nThe dude was inting in a masters game.

He did communicate with his team with pings. You're right it's not a silver game, but this should not factor in where support can go unless stated with an update from \"Support\" to the role \"support bot\". So his team was pissed at him picking teemo support and going to other lanes, so what? He did not \"int\" or \"grief\" , he never walked into a tower to die, walked into the enemy with intentions to \"feed\" or \"die\", or purposely walked into deep jungle. Famousnubrac score at the end of the game was 0-2-1 in the game he got banned. Very similar to the other score of his team mates. Why does it matter when he chooses to play this strategy? Another streamer should not be able to get him banned for the simple action of \"supporting mid\". I don't fail to see how he is creating the \"negative gaming experience\" when four of his team mates literally went \"afk\" and are not playing the actual game. Also the Irelia went \"afk\" and built \"3 cloth armors\" an item that is good against \"Attack damage\" when the enemy team consisted of taric,sona,ryze,twisted fate,hecarim, a mostly Ability power heavy team. This is the \"high elo masters/challenger\" that you are so obsessed about, but her build is not optimized for the enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosmochris","date":"2019-06-21T19:30:07.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Foe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2bb28xra,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-21T19:07:46.131+0000)\n>\n> I don't care about his win rates as they should not factor into how the \"support\" role should be played.

NB3 even gives Nubrac (you included) the benefit of the doubt and says alright report me, this doesn't change the fact that it was Nubrac that caused this, and you are going to say how? and I am going to repeat what NB3 said 10 times.

I'm speaking in general sense about how the \"Support\" role is not specified in their position location on the map. Therefore they may proceed to go bot lane,mid lane,top lane or even jungle and help clear camps. However I would agree that double jungle without communicating this should be ban worthy only for the simple fact that the experience is not shared. If Riot wants a specific meta than they should change the name of the role: \"Support\" to \"Support Bot\" as every other role has specific lane they must attend to, for example role \"Bot\" clearly needs to go bottom lane. Now if your \"Bot\" lane player told the support to \"leave the lane support\" at the start of the game is this okay? Should the \"Support\" role now proceed to go top? Oh, top lane wrote \"leave my lane support\" as soon as the \"support\" went \"top\". Oh, \"mid\" wrote to the \"support\" \"leave mid lane\" as soon as the \"support went \"mid\". The \"support\" now goes to the \"jungle\" and farms with the jungler and the jungler writes \"leave my jungle support\". Hmm, okay by this logic the only place for the \"support\" to go is now away from keyboard or maybe the nexus fountain? I completely disagree with your statement. FamousNubrac is definitely not wrong in this situation, the change needs to be made in the LOL Client or TOS to specify exactly where the \"Support\" role should proceed to go.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmochris","date":"2019-06-21T19:15:56.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Foe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2bb28xra,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2019-06-21T19:02:41.643+0000)\n>\n> I don't really care about your age.

You would have grounds on reporting your entire team because they are toxic, but in the Nubrac and NB3 situation, Nubracs team all didn't tell him to leave. Irelia mid was telling him to leave. Going to your statement on roles, I personally don't care for this argument because you can go vayne top corki mid yasuo bot; this argument has no point. My proof? Riot specifically stated bot champs are bot, but people play them other lanes. No one said mages shouldn't be support but you now see brand vegiar and velkoz to name a few dominating in the support role. No one said taliyah jg should be a thing. I understand what you say when support was never stated to be for bot only (even though in champ select, support is situated bot on the map by Riot, therefor negating your argument), but this goes back to NB3s argument bringing up alicopter. I watch his gameplay and I do feel like hes in other lanes more so than bot, but the thing is, he communicates very heavily to his team. Nubrac refused to do so. And going to your last argument if you were to afk in your case then its you that would be punished even though your team was toxic and this goes to what NB3 said about Riot doing a shit job at everything. I agree with that statement. I also believe Nubrac going teemo support/mid is not bannable. Support can stay in jg for the first 10 min of the game for all I care, but if he intentionally creates a negative play experience for the team, whether Riot stated where support should go or not even though this doesn't really matter at all in this entire situation, he still created a negative game experience, which I can not stress enough.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-21T17:25:34.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can everyone just shut up about these two morons already? \n\nI get it, it is a fun way for all the gamer-justice idiots to inflate their justice, but nobody cares, and every one of you would have been screaming death threats at them if you had actually gotten them on your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Foe","date":"2019-06-21T16:56:57.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then Riot should specify what role support should go to in their in game client, simply rename the role Support to : Support Bot lane.

I am really not trying to dig into it too deeply, like watching the game vids to compare and all that. I'm speaking generally. You should communicate your intent to the rest of your team in a timely manner. If you intend to do something that could be generally unexpected or off meta that needs to be made known so the team can work around or with it. That's not to say that NB3 is right either, as he made no attempt to work with or around how Nubrac after it became obvious how he intended to play, and immediately started flaming and acting like an entitled spoiled child. One needed to communicate and the other needs to grow up. Doing something off meta should not be banable unless you can prove malicious intent behind the choice to play that way. Other servers from different regions experiment all the time, NB3 plays off meta things all the time and expects others to meta sheep so he doesn't have to think about how to work around a different strat. Either way both did something wrong. Nubrac probably should have gotten some kind of warning because refusal to communicate is negatively impactful to the team especially in high elo games and maybe a ban if that was already done before. NB3 should probably have gotten a ban before this, and was likely shielded for being a bigger streamer, he should also be removed from the LPP and basically cut off by Riot from contacting any employees outside of the paths available to general players.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zeyphel","date":"2019-06-21T18:04:04.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You brought this to the wrong section.
