So, when you find 2 Brawlers, you get a power spike (extra health for Brawlers).  When you find 4, another spike.  Then 6, another spike.   This is how it is for all Comps.\n\nBut, in my opinion, this is very flawed, and only  contributes to the RNG frustration of the game.  I have a solution to fix this.\n\nInstead of 2-4-6 comp power spikes,  I suggest you change it to 2-3-4-5-6 power spikes.   So, basically, you divide the current Power Bonuses of 2-4-6, into 2-3-4-5-6.\n\n\nThis way,  if I have 3 Brawlers, and you were lucky enough to find 4 Brawlers due to RNG....  you don't have twice as much Brawler benefits than I do, due to the 4 Brawler power spike vs I only  have 3 Brawlers.     The new solution would mean, I am still weaker than you, but I have a 3 Brawler bonus,  vs your 4 bonus,  and the difference is just incremental between 2-3-4-5-6  spikes. \n\n\n  This would help level out the power spikes and lessen the impact of RNG, to make Comp building a more progressive build into full power....   so each new piece you find, helps your team... instead of waiting on RNG to give you -several- pieces to hit the next 2-4-6 power spike as it is now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-31T22:47:16.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current system requires a level of dedication in order to receive bonuses, and requires more planning to maximize the benefits.
