Yes it works on her Illaoi&#039;s Q (Tentacle Smash) blocks the damage but she still gets the heal, I don&#039;t agree with it, but i understand it by definition. Yet Riposte &quot;_Fiora parries all incoming damage, debuffs, and disables for the next 0.75 seconds..._&quot; does that not include Illaoi&#039;s E since &quot;_Illaoi rips the spirit from a foe&#039;s body, forcing it to stand before her. Spirits echo a percentage of the damage they take to the original target. If killed, or if the target gets too far from the spirit, the target will become a Vessel and begin spawning Tentacles_&quot; or is it JUST because the initial of use of Illaoi&#039;s E doesn&#039;t deal damage no interaction occurs. Personally i think it should be blocked and no vessel should be taken since if it can block almost most other abilities and yet it&#039;s just a free grab for Illaoi. Please feel free to message me about this, I feel this is a bit unreasonable and should be looked at for a future patch. I feel it takes away to feeling of Fiora&#039;s Riposte if it can&#039;t at least stop her from getting grabbed by Illaoi.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBagelBomb","replies":[]}
