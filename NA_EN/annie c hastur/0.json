Has no clear disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOrianna: Laning phase ridiculously powerful, late game DPS among the highest of the ap carries, and comes with tons of utility and CC.\r\n\r\nZac: Way too difficult to kill. Damage is actually within reason for his capabilities, actually being lower than other tanks, but it's impossible to prevent his engages and nearly impossible to kill him when he does.\r\n\r\nCorki: Strongest laning phase of all the AD carries with amazing mid game, impossible to prevent farming from post 6, tons of mobility and the best scaling with Trinity Force, which may be overpowered in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything?","replies":[{"poster":"Capt Carmine","date":"2013-09-17T20:04:18.742+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Orianna actually has one of the lowest bases, and ap scaling on her abilites, her q-w does less damage than a nidalee spear. she looks big because she is always wombo comboing her spells really efficiently. and she also doesnt really have that much mobility so it can be easy to catch her. \n\nI spoke on another thread, but I feel aatrox has really starting pushing into zac's space, Zac has only really been picked once or twice in worlds, and aatrox pretty much carried the game he was in.\n\nI feel for the majority of play characters really arent as overpowered, it is just with the limited bans the game has, teams are playing a small subset of the characters so they can ban and pick the other teams champions.  \n\nAs much as Certain Rioters say they dont want to increase the champion bans I feel they really do need to do something to help with the ban pick phase of the game. becuase right now blue side has 4 bans with first pick, due to the fact that every team has come up with the idea of sharing a certain champion pool for sharing the champ, and when that happens a champ hits perma ban status, as it has happened for ahri and zed.\n\n if they increased the number of bans but then allowed some champions to get picked before all of the bans happened I think it would really allow for more characters to get played and for teams to play different champions and not feel limited for not playing the same champions other teams do. \n\nHowever going to your balancing question \nI feel Zed,\nAhri,\nand Aatrox are the characters they really need to look at since they already have a trinity force nerf coming up on the PBE for corki.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2013-09-17T20:50:27.303+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac I would agree has ridiculously high base damage on his spells, but currently I don't think he's a mega concern.\n\nCapt Carmine actually pointed out exactly what Orianna's core flaws are, but I would agree that if she's being deferred to as the fundamental \"fall back\" for a team fighting champion (if the Assassins are banned off), then maybe she should be looked at.\n\nIf you've been paying attention to the PBE, we're actually looking at Corki but, on a larger level, Trinity Force. From what I understand we're looking at simply halving the movespeed bonus of Trinity Force.\n\nAhri I think actually has champion deficiencies (similar to Orianna) but she's being deferred to as a high mobility assassin when Zed / Kassadin are off the list. I personally go to LeBlanc but that probably doesn't work beyond plat.\n\nBut on that note, good thoughts to bring, but the originating factor (THEY GET BANNED SO MUCH) isn't something LD really focuses too heavily on.

As far as I can see she has excellent auto attacks, ranged harass, waveclear, shields, movespeed buffs, CC, burst, AoE, DPS ... like really what doesn't she do? You can't make her lose lane and she can in fact bully many champions out, and her teamfight power is almost unmatched. \n\nThe only weakness I see Orianna has at all is that she needs her ball to be in a good position, but by maxing Q and rushing Grail like every player does, she can spam it all over the place whenever she wants. If her Q had a 6 second cooldown at max rank then maybe she would have significant counterplay.\n\n I consider it pretty awkward that you can pick Orianna into anything, and to go with anything, and do well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pramxnim","date":"2013-09-17T22:41:49.534+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the recent Corki hype has everything to do with Triforce and almost nothing to do with where Corki is as a champion himself.\n\nA couple of patches ago, Corki had his mana costs readjusted to make him less of a resource hog in lane, but his kit has basically remained unchanged since season 2. As a champion, he's in a good spot.\n\nTriforce, however, is currently a problem. I really liked the Phage change at first, but even before everything blew up I felt the cost reduction was too generous. Triforce was already cost-effective after the buff to its combination cost (300 gold -> 3 gold), and this change to Phage cut its cost by another 215 gold (Phage went from 1465 -> 1250 gold). The cost reduction and reliability of the new Phage / Triforce made it a must-buy on many champions and brought a resurgence of some favourite season 2 picks, Corki being the foremost among them.\n\nWithout the recent Triforce change, Corki would still be in his own little niche, not too popular, but not fading into obscurity either. His potential as an AP mid has also been explored by some people (myself included). Now with this latest patch, he's seen a resurgence in solo queue and competitive play not because of a metagame shift or a change to his kit, but rather a much too generous buff to a classic item.\n\nFor solutions to this situation, I feel like the changes that are being implemented on the PBE is a step in the right direction. The stats on Phage and Triforce remain untouched, but the item costs are being readjusted, which is super nice. Right now it is sitting at 1350 for a Phage, and on paper I think it looks fine. I wouldn't mind buying Phage at 1375 or even 1400 gold for the movement speed and kiting potential it gives though, so that's always an option if you guys feel like the current changes are not enough. But please re-consider nerfing Corki, as he has been fairly balanced ever since his mana cost changes.","replies":[{"poster":"UglyDoge","date":"2013-09-18T23:18:09.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I 100% agree with this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joren Uniek","date":"2013-09-19T20:11:29.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not entirely true, mid lane CDR/mpen Corki is also extremely strong at the moment.

We've seen in the past that these types of patches bring sweeping changes to the metagame, and I feel like nerfing these champions so close to the end of this season/the next patch has the potential to really screw them should the metagame shift.\n\nI'll point to Morgana as an example of this. She used to be a top pick/ban towards the end of Season 2, and now she's never picked. She was really powerful, and a lot of people wanted to see her nerfed. The metagame shifted though, and she fell out of favor. It's entirely possible that this might happen to those ^ champions soon.\n\nKeeping them the way they are now and re-evaluating them after the dust from the Season 4 patch settles seems like a much more conservative and calculated approach.

It seems more favorable in high elo since it helps make room for objectives, denying farm to the enemy team, and create small gold advantages when there aren't kill opportunities on the map.\n\nTo add on, I feel that the single target damage from the kit of each assassin does its role very well, but the way their skills are designed with wave clear in mind creates a low risk early-mid game with potential kill stacks mid-late game (excluding KZ and Akali).\n\nIn the end if you're consistent enough, you'll eventually out-farm and out-kill the enemy team one way or another. For low elo, they tend to farm less. Less farm means more time to reach critical mass and less kill potential for the player.\n\nThere has to be a middle point somewhere along this line where this critical mass has a larger gap of entry with agreeable damage scaling through late game. Hopefully, in a way, it takes them down to the same level with other champions (assuming that we aren't Arch-DOTA2 where everyone is nerfed) while still being enjoyable to play.\n\nWe could also buff everyone else.

He doesn't lane well, except for a lv 4-5 cheese kill he can pull off with QE flash W ignite, but most (good) players will be ready for that. He can get pushed off the wave around lv 3-4, which is why xPeke and other Kassadin players run teleport. \n\nIf Kassadin runs teleport, he is literally 0 threat all laning phase, at least until level 7 where you should be able to get a hefty lead on him. People are just too passive against Kassadin right now. Wait until Fnatic face the Chinese team and we'll see how Kassadin works when he doesn't manage to get equal farm to lv 6 - pro players are too passive, which is why the weak early game champions are played more.\n\nFor Ahri, you guys already removed the tanky build from her - the DFG build is the only viable one left for her (although it might be too strong). It only too strong because the bulwark removal made DFG over the top. I think DFG can keep it's power, it just needs a MUCH higher cooldown so people have to think about using it, and people can play around the DFG cdr.\n\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryx EU","date":"2013-09-22T08:43:13.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Meanwhile Fizz... and Zed... \n\n Stop nerfing Ahri, you already done it 4 times","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2013-09-20T22:30:26.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's DFG that needs to be changed not Ahri. \nReally nothing you can change about her without going to far except for her passive anyways.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Not Awful","date":"2013-09-17T19:42:31.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Joren Uniek","date":"2013-09-17T19:54:27.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri could easily just receive a nerf to her passive and her Q base damage so that it actually becomes possible for a good number of champions to win lane against her.

To fit with the 9 tails theme, Her passive triggers when you hit 3 targets 3 times, her R hits 3 targets on each cast, her Q is AoE, and her W fires 3 bolts that will always hit 3 seperate targets.

She's very safe though due to her high utility and ability to safely fark. xPeke showed how easy it was to dodge Gragas ults simply with his speed boost making ganks very difficult on him. She works best with others around to utilize her utility and combo with certain champions better. I don't think she's in position of extreme power, her kit simply lends well to compositions with AoE spells or a champion that can easily dive into battle which, with Zac and Aatrox being used often, is not had to build a composition around.\n\nAhri is very powerful, there's no denying that but poor utilization of either her ult or her charm can often ruin an attempted assassination or make her very vulnerable. If anything needs fixing, perhaps a slightly smaller ratio on her  Orb of Deception or maybe a smaller amount of Spell Vamp on her passive to make her laning phase a bit weaker without really hitting her ability to pinpoint and kill specific targets. \n\nZac is a bit tricky. His Elastic Slingshot makes initiations extremely easy and he brings great CC to a team. I think the most recent nerfs to him have brought in into line rather well actually. He has a harder time healing from his bloblets and it's possible to lock him down while he is in Let's Bounce. He seems to be much better suited for Solo Queue now although I don't think he's nearly as dominate as he used to be.\n\nCorki is primarily a problem due to TriForce. In his own right, I don't think Corki is a terribly overpowered champion, rather well balanced I'd actually say.
