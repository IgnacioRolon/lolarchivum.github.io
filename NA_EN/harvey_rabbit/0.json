For example, i'v lost a lot of games lately but my losses are about 280 in normals and my wins are 300.

If the opponent finds out that they won't get anything out of an all-in, then they won't do it anymore. Play champions that are easy or switch to a different role for awhile. \n\nAnd finally if your not comfortable in a match up, be passive, farm under tower until the opponent makes a mistake.

I have an ARAM only account where I only play plat/diamond players, are they shit?  Winning ARAM is the same as any other mode even though luck plays a slightly more role as far as comp goes (which is why a lot of high MMR ARAM only players will have specific accounts to ensure better comps).  Good players can still carry the crap out of ARAM.\n\nLooking at the OP's game history he dies an awful lot, even for ARAM.  My suggestion for him is to try and be a bit more conservative.

The important thing is knowing the limits.  It is harder to do in ARAM because you cant control who you get unless you only own a small portion of champions (ARAM only accounts are really nice for this).

The team composition is almost always the reason a team wins. So if you have varus and fiddlesticks, you will win more then tryndamere and vayne. People with poke and hard cc initiators will undoubtedly win more games. And since you mostly play aram, you don't really main any champions, you just play them all, and you only get about 15 minutes to play them. Also ARAM players tend to be worse then normal games players. Besides dumb luck, there are no content creators who teach you how to play ARAM. Normal players can learn by watching videos on their champions, or just about the game in general, nobody does that for ARAM.

And if the special mode you are playing is similar to normal summoner's rift games you will have a big disadvantage versus the players that play a lot of ranked since there is a big difference between howling abyss and summoner's rift.  Also, those modes have different matchmaking, so it may have placed you against harder players since the MMR is a bit different than the MMR for normal games since some people are bad at urf but good at regular 5 v 5s or ARAM.  \n\nAlso, if you are not abusing the OPs in 3v3s/Dominion/URF and other people are you are at a disadvantage if you play a lot of those modes since they are not very well balanced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2016-07-31T14:12:09.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lemme explain the system to you a little.\n\nLets say my true skill is gold 5 but i am silver 2.
