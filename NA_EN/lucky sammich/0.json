Pull down and even suggested, its not working at all. Even when you do send it (aka click to send), under invited it says your name instead of the people you invited. I am wondering if this is just me or if anyone else is experiencing the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"chupaacabra","date":"2017-11-06T19:31:15.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ILuckygirl, is this still occurring for you? If you find it happening again, can you send me your leagueclient logs for that login session? You can find the logs in your root league folder > logs > leagueclient logs, and then grab the most recent leagueclient.log. You can send it to me either through google drive or a dropbox link. Let me know if you need any help with this!","replies":[]}]}
