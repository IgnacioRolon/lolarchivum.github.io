It doesn't \"belong\" anywhere. It was created to draw supports to pick Ferocity, likely so that some squishy FQC supports would be easier to kill without their 12 points in Resolve, thus lowering their win rates overall if Expose Weakness is attractive enough to convince many people to switch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2016-02-27T08:46:41.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there are the Utility Carries {{champion:22}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:110}} and technically {{champion:203}}.
