It is easily my favourite game in existence when looking strictly at the game play itself. But I have been at the breaking point for years in regards to the community. And it just seems like no one cares and it doesn't get any better. \r\n\r\nSince I started playing this game in S2 the community has been incredibly toxic. Every game you join you have someone in your game trolling, trash talking, or just BMing in general. Sure you can mute and you can report but it doesn't do anything. And why should we have to? Why are these people allowed to ruin the game for others? \r\n\r\nPeople act like this because they can get away with it. LoL has the absolute worst community I have ever seen on a game. And I have played a lot of games in my 23 years. LoL is perhaps the worst community in gaming history. \r\n\r\nWe get all these promises about how they are going to reward positive play and punish negative play and IT NEVER HAPPENS. I've waited 3 years for this community to be improved but Riot is not willing to make the implementation to do so. \r\n\r\nAnd no one cares but I officially don't enjoy this game anymore because the community has ruined it for me. I'm going to go play the thousands of other online games with respectful player bases that help and better each other instead of chop down and insult each other.","replies":[{"poster":"Slumber Jack","date":"2015-05-18T23:26:02.406+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":12,"body":"Part of the reason we call it 'toxicity' is because it spreads; one player starts saying bad things, another player gets agitated and contributes to the overall toxicity of the game.

I occasionally get annoyed at people or make some harsh comment, but by and large I try to be positive, and never say anything too extreme even when I do get annoyed.  Yet I see at least one toxic player *in the vast majority of my games*.  Maybe the toxicity is only minor (e.g. wanting to false-report players who just played badly, or some minor verbal abuse), but it's nearly always there.\n\nInstead, most of the time people become toxic for things completely unrelated to the behaviour of other players - they make stupid mistakes and feel they have to blame and flame someone else; they feel that they cannot win and decide to troll to get the game over faster; an ally plays badly and so they decide that they need to flame them instead of helping them; an ally picked a champion that they disapprove of, so they don't want to try or want to make them lose for their pick; and so on.\nThese are attitude problems on the part of the toxic player, ***not*** the fault of the other players on their team.  Sure, sometimes you can try to talk them out of these destructive behaviours, by encouraging them to believe that they can still win and to keep trying, but most of the time you can't, and they'll just verbally abuse you for trying.\nYou can't just say \"play better and carry your games so your allies will be less toxic\".\n\nMuting is a patch-fix for a problem that's already happened, it's not a solution to stop the problem in the first place.\n\nAbout two years ago, I did an experiment where I kept track of the levels of toxicity that I saw in ranked games.  I played 168 ranked games at Gold ELO, and **81.55%** of those had some level of toxicity, with 57.15% having medium or higher toxicity.  The situation has improved very slightly since then, but not significantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TH Exarthious","date":"2015-05-19T17:19:49.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's unfortunate.

If that isn't bad enough, they eventually go afk, or link dead entirely leaving you to a lost game. Both of my boys, my two cousins, and one  of their friends quit playing League of Legends because of the toxic environment and the constant trolling. That's five people, and at one point I was trying to get my wife to play the game with me since she plays PvP in other games with me. I've stopped asking her to play and I myself am considering the option of quitting this game too because of the toxic players. So that's seven potential players paying for stuff you could have playing, but you only have one hanging on by a thread.\n\nI beg you guys to start taking this seriously because it is bad right now.

But more often than not I don't contribute. Since I know how awful this community is, I can usually see the toxicity coming from a mile away. If I see a bunch of people bickering and being jerks in camp select, my whole team is muted as soon as we spawn so I can avoid the entire unpleasant experience that I know is coming. If people start arguing mid game, same thing applies.\n\nBut my question is, why should we have to put up with this? Why should we have to regularly mute players on our team or our entire team to avoid the negative player experience. Why cant Riot start implementing a better punishment system to deter these people from behaving like this in the first place? It really cant be that hard. Many other games seem to do a fine job keeping their player base in check. I have played a lot of games. In most of those games, you run into pleasant players on a regular basis who are enjoyable to play with. I find this very rare in LoL. Also, in other games I find trolls, toxic players, etc, to be very far and few between. But they seem to run rampant here.

What we see time and time again is the players who see toxicity in more of their games often are being toxic in them as well.\n\nJust because you were the recipient of toxic behavior doesn't give you a chance to be toxic to others. That's how it spreads and the attitude that some people are only toxic because they have been the target of toxic behavior is why it remains such a problem.

Again this extremely disturbing from a player behavior specialist. That said muting is a powerful tool that can fix a lot. In a game if you have been flamed once, even if you mute them, your teammates still have to listen to that player. I can't force them to mute that person and i will still see if they respond to that person so i'm still being exposed to the effects of that one person so in order to solve the problem i have to mute my entire team in a game where clear communication is key to victory and the lack of communication is a reportable offence. \n\nIf this response came from someone on a skins team or technical engineer i might understand, because muting is a useful tool. Coming from a player behavior specialist this response just sounds like \"feel lucky we gave you a mute button our job is done\" and you aren't looking to improve the situation. \n\nTell us how you can do better. \n\nTell us what you are doing to improve the situation. \n\nDon't defend the toxic people. \n\nDon't blame the people who are their targets for not muting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sythriel Draken","date":"2015-05-19T23:14:17.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slumber Jack,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=UKGQzwzt,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-05-18T23:26:02.406+0000)\n>\n> Part of the reason we call it 'toxicity' is because it spreads; one player starts saying bad things, another player gets agitated and contributes to the overall toxicity of the game.

Since the tribunal went away I have noticed it steadily increasing more and more as time passes. the other day, the top laner made one mistake, and mispinged he needed help.

He goes \"stfu bitch, I am going to carry your horrible asses anyways\" Then I responded with, if you continue this attitude I will report you.

A large group of us who have played for many years, mostly play only with each other now because of how toxic it can be. The tribunal at least deterred people a little more, because one person that can rage I knew had gotten suspended while it was around, now that it isn't I refuse to play matches with him even because there isn't a game he isn't treating people like shit and he never gets punished for it anymore so he simply doesn't care.

If there was, ask yourself if there was anything you could have done to head the toxicity off. Could you have asked people to calm down? To stop insulting the jungler who got his buffs taken early? Then next time you see someone being toxic step in and try to get people to vain down and play.\n\nI see a lot of posts asking Riot to fix the community, but they have a different perspective then us, the regular players.

Lyte asked for people to give an impression on their past 10 games, and then he'd compare it with their match/chat logs for the past 10 games.

A reddit mod mentioned that people who often complained about how toxic the community was are people who already have gotten warnings from the mods for toxicity themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2015-05-20T09:49:35.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's certainly bias.\n\nHowever, about a year and a half ago, I played 168 ranked games and wrote down the levels of toxicity in them.

I've played plenty of different online games, and each of them had their fair share of terrible people. Most of these games people who are assholes or constantly bully people were not ever punished either. It's why some people have issues with Riot banning them, they were able to be complete assholes in other games without any punishment and want to be able to continue it on LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"TH Exarthious","date":"2015-05-19T22:56:55.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a lot of PvP oriented games.

A good portion of reports are toxic players spamming reports on innocent players because they are upset and doing what toxic players do best, ruining the game for others. In some cases, the non-toxic players are the ones getting chat restricted and punished while the toxic ones are roaming free, continuing their toxic rampage. Flawed system? I think so. \n\nAnd I can relate friend, I have often gotten warnings that I have been reported because toxic players report me for unjust reasons. Such as having a bad game. I have even had toxic players type lies into all chat trying to solicite reports on me from the other team. Such a pathetic ploy but Riots crappy system plays into it perfectly.\n\nAnd yes I definitely agree with you. It feels as if reporting the toxic players does nothing. Riot needs a much stricter system with harsher punishment. Some of these people need IP Adress bans. They don't deserve the privilege to play.
