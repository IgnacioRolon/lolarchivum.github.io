Do I get 1 damage at 1st time I touch it and finish my speed after resolving damage card (maybe i&#039;ll not take the second one) ? Or do I go forward 4 space and draw 2 damage card after ? (On mission 7-8 this point is important because a damage can force us to move into lava)\n\nWith some picture :\no = empty space\nX = mech\n< = spiky wall\n\nFrom this \no\no <\no <\nX\n\nI want to have with 1 speed lvl 2\nX\no <\no <\no \n\nDo I take damage when I'm at this position ?\no\no <\nX <\no\n\nOr do I take 2 damage if I'm on this position ?\nX\no <\no <\no\n\nFor now, I consider not stopping in a spike wall deals no damage.\n\n2) a repair pad is on a spike wall, how it works ? We must draw damage card and if we move, can&#039;t repair ? We must draw and if we stay, we can repair because ? We must repair first and draw after ?\n\n3) Not about spike walls :  When I must deal 1 damage on a target (with hexmatic for example), and a minion is over a crystal, does my damage destroy both of them or I need chose crystal or minion ?\n\n4) About push and tow :\n a) If I towed a mech through an active rune gate, the other mech is blocked I suppose. And if I towed the bomb, is it blocked other side (do I need open and tow or push again ?)\nRules says I can't push through an active rune gate, but what about towing ? (I think we can tow but not push)\n b) Does the bomb deactivates rune gate ? (I think not because rule say \"Mech\")\n c) In lava : If lava is in front of me, can I use 1 movement to go in lava and 1 for towing (are they grouped as 1 action ?) or when I'm in lava, this is blocked ?\n\n\nSorry for the number of questions, but thank you for explain all of that to me :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2017-01-18T00:22:42.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) A Spike Wall only deals damage to you when you actually **move directly into it**, not when you pass by an adjacent space (which I believe is what your examples illustrate). It behaves as a regular wall otherwise, which means you could potentially bump into it multiple times in one go for each point of movement you have.\n\n2) I hope the above explanation helped with this as well, but if you travel over a Repair Pad that is next to a Spiked Wall, you wouldn't take damage from the wall unless you actually bumped directly into it. You'd heal as normal on the Repair Pad.\n\n3) If an ability only deals one point of damage (like Hexmatic Aimbot), then you would choose which thing gets destroyed. If the card is an area effect (like Flamespitter), it would hit everything in the square.\n\n4) As soon as a mech crosses through an inactive gate, it becomes active. This is the same for either pushing or towing (it would just change who actually got through the gate). A bomb never activates a gate and can be pushed through active gates as well. I'm not sure I totally understand your question about lava. Basically lava stops your movement completely for that slot, even if you had more movement left (like a Speed card). If you were towing something they would stop behind you. After stopping, if you have subsequent movement from another command slot that allows you to move or two you can continue to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"LuckerNoob","date":"2017-01-18T01:25:40.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Catzpaw,realm=NA,application-id=AMxvhsRt,discussion-id=y4bIKoLK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-18T00:22:42.928+0000)\n>\n> .... which means you could potentially bump into it multiple times in one go for each point of movement you have...\n\nWait, what?\nDoes that mean if I bonk a spiked wall with speed3, I'd get three damage? One for each movement point?\nWe've been playing it that a spiked wall interrupts the move command, just like lave would. So Speed3 would do one damage, if a skewer was up next, that'd be another one, and so on.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2017-01-18T01:31:48.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad!  Let me rephrase -  you could potentially bump into the wall for each movement card you have (not point of movement) if you're facing the wall. So a Speed 3 card would only ever trigger a single point of damage from a Spiked Wall, but if your Skewer is next up and you're still facing the wall, you could take damage from the wall again.","replies":[{"poster":"Jej","date":"2017-01-18T08:28:29.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, That's quite clear now. My illustration was wrong, I would say that I'm walking along the wall (in same space) but spikes are at my right.\nWhat I understantd is : Spike deals damage only if we bump into it (movement blocked by it).\nSo, just one more detail please (read after, only if my sentence above is wrong) : if I was in a free space, went in a space with spike wall in front of me with skewer lvl 1, I don't bump, but do I take damage by stopping in this space facing the wall (no bumping) ? I think I take no damage, because I don't go directly into the wall (only the space with the wall)\n\nAnd a last word : Thanks to all rioters worked on it for making this game and for helping players to make it better to play!","replies":[{"poster":"LuckerNoob","date":"2017-01-18T11:02:36.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your assumption is correct.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
