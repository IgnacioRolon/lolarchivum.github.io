By this I mean characters aren't actually \"dying\" when you kill an enemy champion/player.  Now yes I know there is lore outside of the game like characters \"dying\" in cinematics but this isn't even really true death, how can they honestly - it would destroy their business model if they threatened to remove heroes/aka all those skins you bought/backlash.\n\nThe problem is the death \"lore mechanic\" doesn't make sense if they return back to the battle field after 30 seconds - because they never actually died.  Now obviously this is true to any pvp game - but Riot seems to want to REALLY make us understand that we just killed a champion with all the \"your DEAD!\" type of voice lines and their own lore where characters \"die\".\n\nI think character \"death\" both in game and lore should be rethought or re-explained, like for example maybe the gods don't let these \"champions\" every die.  Instead they are caught in a never ending cycle of life and death.  To me that would make the most sense for this game, with maybe heroes pulled into this arena to be watched as they battle over and over for entertainment of others.\n\nHeroes of the Storm realized this problem and basically has the nexus \"revive\" heroes when they die for another example.\n\nI know this is minor and nobody cares about the lore but I think they should have come up with something more interesting then shallow \"your dead!\" but not really \"really\" dead mechanic I keep having to listen to in my headphones.","replies":[]}
