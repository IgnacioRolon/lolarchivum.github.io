I truly believe Yasuo&#039;s **windwall** is severely broken and its actually not so much the ability but riots definition of a projectile. A projectile is usually defined as: a body projected or impelled forward, as through the air. Hence the important wording through the air, but Yasuo&#039;s **windwall** stops more than just things flying through the air, like Braum&#039;s ult which is literally a fissure in the ground, Nami&#039;s ult which is a wave and rolls over the ground, yet for some reason Nautilus ult does go through the **windwall** so riot is at best inconsistent with the **windwall** If anyone can PLEASE tell me if you know another basic skill that blocks **28 different Ults**. This is undoubtedly broken and needs to be fixed, I know its an old topic but I don&#039;t think it has been properly addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2016-08-28T20:19:30.041+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"A projectile in game is defined as having a travel time, travel speed, and travel distance.

As for Noc and Sivir yes they can block ults but the timing has to be very good as the SS does not last long not the 4 seconds of yasuos Windwall. Makzahar just has a banshees viel so he does not choose what spell is blocks. Yi does not prevent ults he dodges them same as a flash dodge.
