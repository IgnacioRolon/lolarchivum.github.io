Unique skill\n\n-Invulnerability, AoE ultimate. Buggy but generally satisfied with this skill\n\nOne of Fiora's key points is that she must go all-in to trade. This fits with her theme nicely; fighting in short, aggressive bursts adds to the duelist aspect of her. However, after she uses her Lunge, she gets kited hopelessly until it's off of cooldown. It's unfortunately on a high cooldown, like her ultimate. Her ultimate cooldown is ridiculously long too, but I'm not gonna go into that.\n\n\nI have two ideas that I think would benefit Fiora greatly:\n\nI think Fiora would become a decent pick if her reset on Burst of Speed (E) was moved to her Lunge (Q). Getting a kill and having the ability to jump to her next target is much better than getting her E reset. \n\nA second idea is to give her Q stacks, like Akali's R, that recharge over time. One of her Q's biggest problems is the fact that there is a very small window to use the second Lunge after activating the first one. \n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"NeroUS","date":"2014-02-20T04:40:28.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My view: fiora has everything she needs already and should actually be in line for a nerf.\n\nHer global win-rate is somewhere between 51% and %53 and this puts her on the overpowered side of things. She seems to get a bit weaker in lower mmrs but never falls below the 50% mark.\n\nIn my experience, Fiora's lategame is too strong. It punishes players too much and she is too hard for other champions to duel. I would decrease the duration of her ultimate or give her more counterplay in some way that would be effective even at higher mmrs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-02-20T02:37:47.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a fairly different view of what makes Fiora weak, as well as what her kit gives to her in terms of theme.\n\nFirst, Fiora is weak because her PQWE make her a duelist, but her R makes her a team fighter. Second, she is weak because her itemization isn't dependent on one or two stats, it is dependent on more like 8 stats.\n\nLets talk about her abilities first:\n\nPassive - Her passive is kinda neat, but ultimately much of its power is hidden and dependent on her ability to survive through other means first. Fiora gains a life regen buff for every attack she makes that stacks a few times. This means to get up to full life regen she needs to have a high attack speed, and have already been in the fight for several seconds. But there is an inherent problem with that. She is squishy. She becomes easily burst down and if that happens she basically loses any benefit for her, she is a melee ADC, not a full fledged fighter, but this ability makes her dependent on being a full fledged fighter. In order to have this ability contribute to her kit she needs to buy HP, Attack Speed, Armor and Magic resist. For a passive, that's a lot to ask. If you want to fix this ability, you need to remove the over time component, and just give her life on hit.\n\nQ - This is Fiora's gap closer but that's really the only reason she has this ability. It isn't supremely about fencing, it has a fencing name, but the actual thing she does in combat is very not fencing. So thematically it *could* go. However, we're in super high mobility land, and so she needs it. Unfortunately this ability is supremely hard to use as an escape because she can only use it on enemies, so its not really providing her the mobility that she needs for re-positioning as a melee ADC. She cant just dive in and not die like other fighters. In order to do its job this ability needs AD, Physical Pen, Movement speed, and potentially cooldown reduction. In order to fix this ability she needs to have the first use of her dash not require a target. This way she can create a gap fairly alright, but she is still REALLY good at closing that gap. Doing this would make the ability much less dependent on Fiora's movement speed to ever be useful.\n\nW - This ability is actually the single most troublesome in her kit. While the rest of Fiora wants to build AD stats, this ability wants to build AP, Magic Pen, and CDR. This might be fine on a Fighter who would want to use some of those stats anyway, but Fiora does not, it is only for this ability. That needs to change. This needs to be made an AD ratio, and physical damage. But why stop there? This ability has so much potential for cool. This ability is Fiora creating a parry and riposte situation. This means that she deflects the attack, and creates an opening for attack. If we want to thematically make her into the awesome fencer she is supposed to be, this ability could use a touch-up. First, we need to shorten the timing window. 1.5 seconds may not seem like long, but for the power we're going to place in Fiora's hands in just a moment, that's a lot. 1s will do just fine. Next, the ability should apply a mark to the target that is affected. The mark lasts for only 1s itself, but it refreshes the CD of Fiora's Q, and if consumed provides a stun that is .75s long. The idea here is that Fiora uses this ability for punishing her opponents for an ill placed attack, and that her superior training and timing as a fencer allows her to not only parry but to really make an opening for herself. Because of the added utility and overall damage that this would add to her kit, the damage on this ability would likely need to be nerfed, but not only would this separate the good Fiora from the great Fiora, it would also really mesh well into her \"I'm the best fencer there ever was\" theme.\n\nE - This ability while thematically a little weak is honestly just fine. If the other changes I've suggested are made then this ability could be left alone, its already one of the largest steroids in the game. \n\nMy word count has run dry so I'll expand in reply.","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-02-20T02:49:53.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R - Fiora's R is a serious problem for her. The fact that the R encourages you to build on-hit, but very minimal parts of the rest of her kit support that idea, and the fact that Ravenous Hydra exists really forces Fiora to build almost entirely with her ult in mind. This means that not only does she want to build all of the AD stats, some AP stats, as well as the typical defensive trinity, she also wants to build on-hit. See how the Itemization is becoming a problem? Every stat in the game is good on Fiora, but none of them are particularly fantastic. Thematically this ability is very weak as far as the fencer identity goes, but it is a cool ability, so why take it away? We leave it there, we leave the on hit effect because we've already mostly addressed the stats issues elsewhere, and we give Fiora some stats after ulting ala Urgot, because just like Urgot she places herself in the middle of the enemy team. For each enemy surrounding Fiora after her ult finishes she gets 10 armor, and 8 magic resist, this lasts for a few seconds and then goes away. This prevents the ability from becoming ridiculous in duels, but also helps protect her just a bit from her own ADC status. \n\nSo lets talk about stats now:\nBefore the rework I provided, Fiora wanted a little bit of every stat under the sun and felt lackluster for it, her kit was thematically weak when compared to her identity, and often detrimental to her status as an ADC. Post rework she wants mostly the ADC stats, while benefiting alright from HP, Spirit Visage (healing effects,) and still being alright with picking up on-hit effects. Her theme is stronger than ever as a fencer, duelist, and master of the rapier, and honestly will actually probably need some numbers nerfs due to that potential for getting to Q three times instead of two on a given target (One Q would consume the mark, so she would get three uses at best, never four).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hinagiku33","date":"2014-03-04T13:28:32.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a dedicated Fiora player since her release, I feel the need to clarify a couple things:\n\n1. **Fiora is NEVER invulnerable. Her ult makes her *untargetable* but she can in fact take damage during it from AoE abilities**. Last game I played Fiora I died 5 times during my ult because they had a lot of AoE and I can't control how Fiora jumps once she starts. It's like spy-checking in TF2, you can't hurt your team so drop AoE on Fiora when she ults - especially AoE CC like stun-Tibbers (ugh).\n\n2. **Burst of Speed is a critical skill for Fiora and moving the reset off it will severely hurt her.** Lunge is one shot of damage, if you get a kill you can Lunge once to an enemy...then realize your ult, E, and likely W are on cooldown. *An ammo system and refresh on Lunge is just trying to force Fiora into being an AD Caster which doesn't really make sense since she has only 1 physical damage/AD scaling basic ability - her strength is auto-attacking and E is a fantastic and under-rated ability for that.*\n\nAlso can we please, please, **please** stop trying to give Fiora a stun? Fiora has DPS like Master Yi if she builds carry instead of trying to be an ult-bot, would you like it if Master Yi could stun you for any length of time?\n\n@NeroUS\n\nWhat on Earth would you nerf on Fiora that wouldn't render her unplayable? She already has a bunch of weaknesses to counter-play her:\n\n1. No ranged poke/last-hit\n2. No utility\n3. No CC\n4. No escape\n5. No innate tankiness\n6. Her only sustain requires her to hit you in melee range while being squishy\n7. *Her ult can be stopped during it's cast time, cancelled by AoE CC effects, she can be killed during it by AoE and DoT, is stopped by dodges like Panth passive and Jax E as well as spellshields like Nocturne's, and it can be ignored by Zhonya's, stealth, blinds, and dashing/flashing out of range (yes, even in a 1v1 you can flash out of it if you time it)*\n8. No wave-clear, pretty much forces her to get Tiamat\n9. Can't block on-hits with her defensive tool\n10. Her only sustain is heavily delayed so she can be easily poked down from range\n11. Her defensive mechanic only works on auto-attacks and has enough of a cooldown where you can poke her down after she uses it\n12. Uses mana and has decent costs, she *will* go OOM if she trades a lot\n13. Long cooldowns, especially early game\n\nShe gets to deal absurd damage late-game because if she didn't she'd be literally useless. If you think she is too strong, where would you like to nerf her and what compensation would be get?","replies":[{"poster":"Myster10","date":"2014-03-17T01:29:10.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally somebody said it all.\n\n1 We can ignore this cause she can poke nicely with Q but then you have number \n\n12 where she can go OOM with 2 trades during lane phase \n\n13 after 6 lvl i really need my ulty to kill somebody cause mostly every other top lane champ has an ulty ready in every team fight and fiora doesn't so it's impossible to win trades unless you are fed\n\nand also what i would highlight is that she has no damage if built tanky (and mostly every top laner has)and has no sustain if built damage.\n\nYou are rigth about all those weaknesses but those are the ones i would say are the worse","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JackAqua","date":"2014-02-20T14:57:55.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since Yasuo's release Fiora is just a massively weaker Yasuo.   \n(Sorry for the advertisement) But I still think Fiora should be somewhat similar to [this](community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/balance/6XUbI9g5-rework-suggestion-fiora-the-grand-duelist), especially the proposed passive.
