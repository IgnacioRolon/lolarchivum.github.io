I do live in country area and use satellite connection, my ping is usually around 30-60 (In game), download speed at best is 4-5.50, but sometimes goes as low as 0.90, and upload speed is always around 0.90. I have played with my ping being 30-60, download speed at 5 and upload speed at 0.90 and it worked fine, but lately i have been getting a lot of issues. I also run at 60 FPS, so i dont know if the issue is my pc or my internet connection. I was thinking of getting a hotspot from 3G but don't know to much about it, i dont know if the issue is packet loss or what. Any help would be very appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T23:20:20.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This certainly does sound like packet loss, which is often caused by either local network settings or problems along your ISP routing to the server. I strongly recommend going through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are 100% solid.\n\nIf you continue to have issues with this after taking those steps, we can take a look at your network routing to the servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ishidar","date":"2016-10-13T02:43:16.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, so I have gone through the guide, many times, and done everything I can through my computer and router settings. I have fine ping and FPS through the entire game, but just moderate-severe packet loss. I just had a game as Syndra that I could barely play because I couldn't see where her orbs go and champions kept skipping. At one point I died to a Ziggs ult that I couldn't even see until after I was dead.\n\nI've repaired the client, defrag'd my hard drive, even tried playing from a different computer. I have a wired connection and pay for better-than-average internet. This happens if I am the only device connected or if there are multiple devices online at one time.\n\nAnd with how many people I have found that are having the same symptoms, I really don't think it's a localized issue to that many different computers/networks.  Is there any way you guys can look into this a little bit from your side?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T21:24:09.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've ensured your local network settings are aligned with our guide, then we'll want to take a look at your network routing to the servers. Running a traceroute should reveal where the issues are happening along the way to the servers. I'd like you to use a program called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) to complete the traceroute. Once you've opened the app, simply plug in **104.160.131.1** into the host IP/target address then start the trace. After the trace has run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues completing that traceroute.","replies":[{"poster":"Ishidar","date":"2016-10-14T05:19:00.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Targons Blade - I appreciate your attention and not just writing me/us off.\n\nHere's what WinMTR gave me after ~5 minutes:\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.0.1 -    0 |  486 |  486 |    0 |    0 |    8 |    0 |\n\n|                              10.156.0.1 -    3 |  442 |  431 |    5 |   10 |   42 |    6 |\n\n|          ip68-101-128-112.sd.sd.cox.net -    5 |  415 |  397 |    6 |   10 |   33 |    7 |\n\n|        fed1sysc02-get0006.sd.sd.cox.net -    5 |  411 |  392 |    8 |   13 |   34 |   10 |\n\n|            langbprj01-ae1.rd.la.cox.net -    4 |  423 |  407 |   12 |   17 |   90 |   14 |\n\n|                          72.215.224.162 -    3 |  439 |  427 |   11 |   16 |   39 |   13 |\n\n|                          104.160.133.35 -    3 |  439 |  427 |   12 |   17 |   45 |   13 |\n\n|          ae36-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    2 |  451 |  442 |   56 |   61 |   81 |   59 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    6 |  403 |  382 |   55 |   61 |   80 |   57 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-16T22:53:29.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your packet loss starts on the first hop outside of your home network and continues along your entire path to the servers.
