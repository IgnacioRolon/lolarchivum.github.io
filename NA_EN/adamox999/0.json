Or how Riot promote bullying because they banned them for \"defending\" themselves while using negativity to fight negativity. Or how these banned players are blaming others players or Riot for their lack of self-control, or how the banned players say Riot shouldn't be focusing on banning punished player's negativity, they should focus on banning other player's negativity.\n\nThat's the bigger joke.","replies":[{"poster":"10641003DEL1","date":"2018-01-10T03:59:10.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"alot of people now days get banned for almost no reason take  alook at my recnt post about my vchat logs it even has one of there Emissaries try to help me out alot of people have legit arguments to have their bans revoked but riot throw us out into the dirt they do not give a shit about there player base they just want $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-01-10T05:02:47.430+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've been here since beta, with the same account since 2009.\nI've asked them for many things and they've given it to me for free due to great understanding. They've given me advices, they've taught me lessons, they have punished me for my own faults, I've given them advices, I've played with Riot members, Riot Members gifted me things more times than I can count, I've been part of this community for over 7 years. I got 287 skins and I've never lost my honor once. Riot never cared about my money. That's never anything they've ever mentioned to me nor applaud me for it nor rewarded me for it. But I can tell you something.\n\n** My account will never be permabanned. I say that with great confidence and without the slightest worry. **\n\nWhy? No one will ever be responsible for my ban. Not Riot, not the community, not anyone. Only I would be.\nOnly I can be responsible for my punishments because it will be based on my actions and my responses in the game. Only **I AM** responsible for the outcome of my account. That goes for everyone's account who plays this game. Everyone is responsible for the outcome of their account(s).\n\nI know for a simple fact, no matter what happens, no matter what position I am put in, no matter how bad my games are, and no matter how bad anyone trolls me, grief me, or flame me, I won't ever break, and I won't ever do anything against the summoner's code or code of conduct. I know the ToU, and I know what I signed up for. So I know how not to be banned and I know I won't ever be banned. Because I don't ever argue with my teammates, I don't troll my teammates, I don't flame my teammates, I don't curse at my teammates, nor will I ever do anything negative to my teammates. The Mute function has been my greatest ally. But I type A LOT every game. When necessary that is.\nI am not perfect but the rules are not even a tad bit complex. \n\nSo whatever they did to get banned, it's because they're either being protected from hackers or they DESERVED it. No in between. So I don't care how \"legit\" any of your arguments are, Riot doesn't care about your money.

It's irrelevant. On top of that - as Xidphel said - you have no way of knowing who has what issues, whether it's medically related or personal.\n\nFun fact: I have anger issues. Lots of them. I am always angry, all the time. But, I grew up learning how to control it and channel it in constructive ways, and I also learned how to hold myself back from letting my anger get the best of me.\n\nRiot isn't obligated to make accommodations for people who can't or won't control themselves.
