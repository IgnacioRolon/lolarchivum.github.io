The league community is referred to as toxic and most of this toxicity comes from the irritation of players who work their asses off to climb the ranked ladder. We can all agree the main trigger for toxicity in league nowadays is players feeding whether it be intentional or not. Feeding is a SERIOUS problem on league, I understand feeding is part of the game but when one good player can't necessarily carry a team but one bad player can lose the game for everyone, I think there is an issue. You can't really blame someone for going on 10 loss streak only to encounter another player that goes 5/14 on Jhin and expect them not to be irate. I feel as if these types of players need to be cut some slack because its mere frustration and sure you can say \"take a break from the game\" but what happens when one leaves the game and comes back to the same base of feeding players? {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-01-06T17:51:26.621+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intentional, sure.\n\nUnintentional?

And also, if you are inting, but since the system is impossibly lenient, forcing you to win 2 bot games after you inted, would reduce the number of inted games. \n\nI mean, yea, it's stupid to permanently ban anybody who is just bad at the game or has a bad day (well, we ban for flaming..), but letting all the soft inters or clear braindead players or boosted noobs ruining game, just because \"it is allowed to be bad\" is a very stupid thing too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"illusìon","date":"2019-01-06T17:56:11.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's understandable","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2019-01-06T17:45:53.310+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree Intentionally feeding should get a harder punishment to deter trolls, but unintentional feeding is just one shitty player, he is still trying his best, but his best is just not enough. dosen't make him a troll .\nwhat you are basically  saying here, is that RIot needs to create a \"minimum skill requirement\".\ntruth is, if your team is losing, you have atleast 1 player feeding.\nand it aint fair.","replies":[{"poster":"illusìon","date":"2019-01-06T17:51:09.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"I think minimum skill requirement is the correct term but there should be some kind of suspension from ranked if someone's dumbass goes 0/10 for more than 3 games","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2019-01-06T17:54:08.946+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=illusìon,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=uPBHbVZE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-01-06T17:51:09.721+0000)\n>\n> I think minimum skill requirement is the correct term but there should be some kind of suspension from ranked if someone's dumbass goes 0/10 for more than 3 games\n\ntheres too many factors to count in when unintentionally feeding, is the enemy a smurf? is your internet spiking on this one day? did you get interrupted? \n\nGetting dominated in lane isn't the same as wanting to make your team lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-01-06T17:53:27.678+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"so you want to punish people for being bad? \n\nshould i go and look at your match history and point out games you should be punished for playing badly?","replies":[{"poster":"illusìon","date":"2019-01-06T17:54:39.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Go ahead and add me to the list, it'll still contribute to feeding problem","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-01-06T17:59:20.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"seeing lots of games with double digit deaths or negative kda \n\nso how should you be punished ?","replies":[{"poster":"illusìon","date":"2019-01-06T18:06:10.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Put a harsher punishment down on my account, I don't care it'll contribute to less toxicity coming from players who are annoyed with feeders","replies":[{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2019-01-08T12:04:57.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh okay, lets play your game.
