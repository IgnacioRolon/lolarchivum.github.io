When you were in TX your connection didn't need to travel so far, which is why you're seeing higher numbers after moving further away. \n\nEthernet was a great first step, and I'm glad it helped some, but this *might* be normal for being that far away. You could try hitting up our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your network logs to see if they can think of something else though!","replies":[{"poster":"72729128DEL1","date":"2017-12-01T08:13:37.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am currently sending them a ticket with my network logs, thanks for all the help, at least now I'll know I tried :(\nI just really want to be in top condition for the {{champion:39}} rework, I want to learn her and play her as best as I can","replies":[]}]}]}
