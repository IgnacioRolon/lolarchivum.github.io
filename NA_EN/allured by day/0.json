It just makes the game very frustrating to play. Then, I brought a new router that had 5G- wifi. I also got a laptop that supported the 5G wifi, so my internet spd should be faster. I also have a wired connection with an Ethernet cable. But, for some reason, I'm still getting 250+ ping. No one else is downloading, using YouTube, or anything while I'm playing. The only other person is my brother who also uses League and he's experiencing the same lag. Please tell me why I'm lagging. I want to try to solve this problem :/","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T20:25:50.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big changes in latency (ping) are often caused by poor ISP routing to the server. There are quite a number of issues along the way your connection could hit that cause it to hit high latency. We can take a look at your route by running a traceroute by running [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) for 5 minutes with the IP Address 104.160.131.1\n\nAfter the traceroute has run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Our tech team can take a look and point out any issues they see along your routing.","replies":[{"poster":"Allured By Day","date":"2016-08-12T19:14:30.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, and I think I was able to solve the problem. Turns out that I wasn't the only one using the wifi. My brother sometimes uses it and I don't know","replies":[]}]}]}
