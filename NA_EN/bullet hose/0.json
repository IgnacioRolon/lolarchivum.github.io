It outlines a lot of the questions surrounding this type of thing. \n\nTL;DR: \"*If you ask players to pay you for something that’s based on our IP, however, you’ll first need our prior written consent. Submit a request for consent by contacting us at 3rdPartyRequests@riotgames.com so we can inspect your work and decide whether your Project’s gonna be allowed.
