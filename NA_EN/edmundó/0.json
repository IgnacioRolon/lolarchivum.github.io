Ravenous Hunter grants healing per bounty hunter stat, and all we get to see is how many stacks we&#039;ve gotten that game, it would be very beneficial to see the healing we get as well.  The other bounty hunter runes in that tier don&#039;t really need to show us anymore than the stacks received ,but for RH it is crucial to have.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-03-09T21:01:37.166+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hear ya.

Just a buff with a timer, for example. \n\n- Last Stand could show its current damage amplifier instead of the total damage dealt. \n\n- Pinging some runes could give information about them rather than \"Has [x] rune\". Most importantly, the Hunter runes, but also Electrocute/Predator/Comet/Aery/Lethal Tempo/Guardian/Aftershock's cooldowns. Or Dark Harvest being up or down. Same about Fleet Footwork. \n\n- It would be nice to have the number of Comets fired. It is really a good number to have - compare how many times you can throw a Comet on Veigar or Orianna, and on Cassiopeia or Rumble. The champions in the second category are able to send many more of those, but we lack a metric to measure that.  \n\nLethal Tempo's AS shown shares the issue with Sterak's Gage. Especially when Sterak's follows a formula that can't be guessed, such as the fact that the health threshold first increases at level 8, and not before.\n\nEdit for what I mean about Comet: Normally, a spell shows \"Flat number\" (+ AP scaling) (+ AD scaling) (+ Any other potential scaling). Comet shows \"Total damage\" (+ AP scaling) (+ AD scaling). Which makes the thing misleading. http://puu.sh/zEJaa/fd07953197.jpg: Comet, here, is dealing 433 damage and not 721.

And with relentless it gives you flat ms per stack so you know just how much you're getting. That's why in saying with ravenous its much more crucial to know the amount of healing you've received like second wind or other healing runes do, the other two are flat bonuses. Although it would be nice to also see those bonuses as well.
