You'll have to use another **valid** email address before you can change it to the primary email you want to share across your accounts. If your little brother needs help changing the email on his account, he can simply reach out in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll be happy to help.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Mihkol","date":"2017-09-11T05:28:43.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This answer was entirely confusing...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-02-05T07:24:01.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can change it to your Email, but you'd need to know the Email the account is currently linked to in order to do so.","replies":[]}]}
