You may be able to reset your resolution through resetting your config.  Keep in mind that doing this will require you to redo your bindings as well:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
