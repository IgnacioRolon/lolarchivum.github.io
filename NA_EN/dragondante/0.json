No, but they should still be deported.

You might think that Riot has to simply recruit individuals from the Food Stamp line in order to field CS Employees, But Blizzard Customer Support is amazing. Its the Bernie Sanders of Customer Support, extremely delusional and fanatically striving for ideals that can't be reached. But that passion and vigor makes Blizzard Customers feel really appreciated and loved. \n\nI think Riots next round of improvements should be in Customer Support. \n\n\"Make League Great Again\"\n\"Make League One Again\"\n \nSailor Moon Ball Z","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nami in Bush","date":"2016-06-09T12:12:03.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a surprise a Trump support has been banned for toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nami in Bush","date":"2016-06-09T12:04:17.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when rito thinks they've seen it all","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-06-07T21:16:41.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Extremely non relevant chat can get booked as spam in chat if you are reported enough. Doing that every game can greatly increase those chances. If that was the \"worst thing you said\" it clearly means you were spending quite a bit of time spamming chat with your political views.

I am pretty sure you did it in some aggressive way that annoys people.\n\nAbout Trump: I can see why people would like him. Charismatic and funny but achieved nothing in his live (except that Trump got enough from his father to at least look lime something). If he handles the US as well as his business than NA will still be great but less great than before him. I see why people would not like you to talk about him or ask people to vote for him while they want to relax and have some fun.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf69774614","date":"2016-06-07T17:49:18.650+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Holy crap someone who's not opinionated and brainwashed by the news into hating trump, i thought i was the only one ;0;{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-06-07T18:28:43.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"...why do people automatically have to be brainwashed if they don't like trump?","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf69774614","date":"2016-06-07T18:31:34.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"shhhhhshhhhhhhhhhhhshhhhhhhh its ok now ;3","replies":[{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-06-07T19:06:47.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Phew that can of worms was a dud.
