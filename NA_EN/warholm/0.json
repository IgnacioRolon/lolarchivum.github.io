I would like to change my name to something much less profane and in compliance with the rules. However, I do not know if I need to pay RP to do so which I actually cannot do. I sent a request to the supports form linked to me via message and I&#039;ll wish to change my name without RP/IP.\r\n\r\nI feel this is fair as my only issue throughout my career was my inappropiate name which I made in my immaturity when I was testing League out.\r\n\r\nIf I could speak to any moderator about this information as this is my first time being disciplined, I&#039;d be grateful.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Curator","date":"2016-12-30T01:06:43.045+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's up to Player Support via the ticket you submitted.
