Morello left and Ghostcrawler took over. Meddler became head of game balance. New guys like Repertoir got added to the team.

At least both teams no longer have to be forced to pick a Marksmen in this mega-burst meta. The worst season in general has to be season 6 Dynamic Que era. Having said that yes there are still major problems in the game, and now to answer your question, or most of it hopefully.\n\nA new team took over League. The old guard had no clue what to do with League, BUT they sure as hell knew what not to do. The new guard have no clue what to do, AND no clue what not to do with League. The old team made changes that were strategic and balanced focused. New team hates strategy and prefers flashy, and even stated they make changes for the sake of change. Change for the sake of change? No wonder League is slowly breaking apart. Change must have a purpose or else it will fail.\n\nRemoval of old masteries and runes to be replaced by new masteries, and then these new runes we have. Threw strategy and unique play styles out in favor of flashy play styles. Balance is destroyed, people pick the op runes instead of any runes that fit their playstyle or else they would lose. Towers are useless and kept receiving nerfs which forced snowball and short games. 1 mistake can cost the game which causes a lot of stress.\n\nI believe it was stated that the Aatrox rework was not meant for Aatrox mains and was for everyone else. That was because the % of Aatrox mains was small. Which is one of the many reasons why it is the worst rework of all time. What's the point of maining a champion you love? You might as well just main the popular champions because they'll stay around forever and never have drastic changes both kit and lore wise. \n\nTopping off Aatrox's failed rework statement is how can this be stated AFTER Warwick's rework? Warwick's rework not only kept his kit and lore, but vastly improved both. Not only were the mains happy but everyone else, with the exception of the haters, were happy with it. It was done well because someone was able to keep CertainlyT in line with the rework, kept control of his imagination in a balanced way. Why can't they do more of that? Warwick's rework is in direct competition with #1 rework with Sion's rework, which is Riot's \"Golden Rework.\" That speaks volumes on the success of the rework.\n\nBasically long story short, new team causing a lot of screw ups over the past 3 years that are catching up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PowerSlave993","date":"2018-07-27T17:23:37.284+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot was sold to China company > gg wp. this is what happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar ArcS","date":"2018-07-27T20:03:00.381+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"They got bought by tencent in like s1, shut up.","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2018-07-28T02:01:32.221+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean in iirc December of 2015?","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar ArcS","date":"2018-07-28T07:16:41.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Are you daft? 7% in 2015, 93% in 2011?\nBut OF COURSE.

Get ready for the most mobile champion in the game.\n\nSeriously though...I feel like the Season Of Our Discontent (Season 8) is being caused by two main issues:\n\n1.  A fetish for burst/proc damage that triggers on dashes, fueled by {{item:3147}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3078}} and inspired by teh flashy LCS plays.  The issue of Riot favoring what makes a flashy game for the pros over a balanced game for the masses has been discussed before, but I have to say I feel like it is true at this point.  I know these items are broken because I abuse them, I watch others abuse them, you have to abuse them to win, and to me they seem to be a fundamental cause of the so-called \"damage meta\".\n2.  The zone control/mobility creep in new champions and champion reworks.  Compare {{champion:142}}  {{champion:266}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:516}} or new{{champion:84}}  to champs like {{champion:60}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:80}} and it immediately becomes apparent that anyone released or reworked in the last year or two has more chains, combos, dashes, and generally active buttons that do things during fights than older champions, and if you do them all properly with the new ones, you generally win.  Again, LCS flashiness helps fuel this.  Many buttons give commentators lots of cheers and catcalls for those who hit or miss them, but it starts to make the base game feel like something other than it used to be.\n\nThe poster boy that throws this all into stark relief is {{champion:20}}.\n\nIt makes sense that he's the next remake, but I also want us all to take a moment and remember the simpler, cleaner, and in many ways more enjoyable game that the old version of the yeti represented.  \n\nGoodness, I remember when I could take him top (back in S2), and when I could jungle with him (what he's still supposed to do) without getting utterly dumpstered by early-game skirmishers fighting over scuttle crabs. \n\n Remember that?
