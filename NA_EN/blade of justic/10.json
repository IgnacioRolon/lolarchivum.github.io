Unless you were in love with the guy for some reason, NO ONE liked an undodgeable point-and-click AOE mini-nuke. Even when it fell off, it was just irritating as hell.

Since he only has one skill shot damage ability. They made it a skill shot which took away it's reliability and sapped damage from it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-02-27T23:38:19.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bets are that Riot is pushing Zil into support.
