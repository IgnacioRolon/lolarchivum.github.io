First game I have a Sivir ADC who was actually rather pleasant, at one point I used E to soak damage from a creep wave of like 18 creeps or something ridiculous while my ADC walked back to lane and I didn't take a single creep, just soaked every hit so she could have all of it and grow up to be big and strong. She was really appreciative and at various points in the game was complimenting me in all chat even *gasp*. Next game I have an Ezreal ADC, I do the same thing, he gets back to lane and starts hitting the creeps at random, he kept missing them because he was typing in chat \"What the actual fuck Braum, why were you just standing there getting hit, you just cost us the lane, they're going to just murder you now and you're going to feed\" I was at 3/4 HP afterwards, I had a whopping 4 biscuits in my inventory, and with that and base regen was full HP by the time anybody showed up. The enemy ADC flashed away as Ezreal blinked in and missed quite literally everything, Q, W, ult, EVERYTHING and was out of auto range, so I flashed in and hit her with Q getting the kill, immediately in /all chat \"GG, report this trash fucking Braum, taking my kills\"\n\nYou get one of three ADCs as a support.\n{{champion:81}}  The rager: Gets pissed at literally everything you do and spam pings the entire game, you could have 18 wards on the map and be force feeding him HP the moment he gets scratched and he'd bitch at you for not diving the enemy turret so he could get a kill and promptly get you both killed.\n{{champion:67}}  The mute: Says nothing the entire game, doesn't actually mute you, is just completely silent the entire game, doesn't even ping.\n[404 error: player not found] The actual decent human being: Is akin to a unicorn, you think they exist, and occasionally you'll see one from a distance, but you don't actually remember how high you were at the time so it could have been a trick of the mind.\n\nJokes aside, it is seriously rare to get an ADC who isn't either completely silent all game or an entitled little shit who thinks everything should be given to them on a silver platter because you only exist to ward for them and keep people away from them until they want a kill. ADC is on average the most toxic role in the entire game, second on the list is mid lane, followed by jungler. ADCs are just used to being pampered  and protected all game so when it doesn't go according to plan they snap, and junglers can't really do much if their team gets trashed all game, I dunno why mid laners are ass holes, they just kind of are most of the time. I spent the majority of most games trying to get my team to stop flaming at each other more so than actually playing the game, one game I had someone flaming our top laner saying he was \"Just a gold 3 scrub who doesn't know anything about the game\" while I was the Bronze 2 support that had been saving his ass all game long when he made stupid decisions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2015-09-11T16:58:24.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, a very large number of people.  I have to agree though, if I'm playing ADC and you're my support, I don't care if you get even 1/3 of the kills, as long as I get the assist if I'm there.  Conversely, if I'm playing support, and there is no way that it is possible for you to get the kill without you dying, I will do everything in my power to make sure they die, even if it means that I take the kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yormaughm","date":"2015-09-11T22:42:45.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Every time I get an ADC who insults me as the support in any way, tells me I'm bad, blames me for them dying, I mute them, leave their lane and go support someone else. I don't agree with the entitled mindset that some ADCs have where the support is there just for them, and they're the only person on the team who can possibly carry. The support supports the entire team and the only reason they go bot lane is because 99% of the time the enemy team goes duo bot as well. If the ADC is so much better than me, and I'm to blame for every mistake, then they can 2 v 1 with no problem right? Oh and if you're being toxic to me because you overextend and got yourself killed and that's somehow my fault -- well have fun learning how to play safe under tower once I leave the lane. I swear some ADCs don't realize that they _need_ to know how to do this cause you can't go hyper aggressive in every matchup. You hate it? Tough, I'm teaching you how to be a better player. And if you AFK or feed instead, have fun getting reported.\n\nIt's been my experience that the moment one person on your team starts tilting and typing more than playing your game is doomed anyway, but hey sometimes I get someone else fed and we win anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2015-09-12T00:32:18.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You don' agree with the entitled mindset that until the lanephase is over, you're the adc's bitch and you called that role?\n\nWow.
