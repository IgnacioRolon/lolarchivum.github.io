Also, if you do this and your carry is Draven then I hate you.\n\nDepending on the support, this isn't always a bad thing.  For instance, when I'm Annie or Sona support and I accidentally steal first blood at lv 3 cuz i q'd an enemy lucian or something when it was uncertain whether or not my adc could get him, that adc better not complain too much.  When I come back lv 5 with a sightstone and an amp tome while their sup has a ruby crystal and lucian has 2 dorans, the adc doesn't need to worry.  There will be plenty more kills in lane.  Of that, I can assure them.  same with Sona.  Once my team was invaded and I got a triple with Sona with my q.  used it twice, got 3 kills.  The adc got all kinds of angry at me, but I walked back into lane with a level advantage and a fiendish codex. I didn't ks those kills, I fired an ability into a moshpit and got lucky.  That lane was mine and it was only my consideration for my carry that stopped me from q-auto-ing until the enemies died from my harass.  Occasionally, I'll get an adc who yells at me for picking Sona cuz they think I'll ks and then get angry when one of my q projectiles hits a cs and takes it.  Once they start the insults I skip the sight stone and get Sheen ->Ludens ->Lich bane ->Haunting Guise with sorc shoes and give them a real reason to fear my ks.  I don't tolerate toxic af carries who think they're gods when they lock in MF or Varus and feed whilst trash talking.  Aint havin none of that.  If it's a Draven doing this to me, I'll show leniency if they quit being toxic and dedicate my AP to helping him get kills rather than to getting them myself and all will be fine.  I am not unreasonable, I just have standards.","replies":[{"poster":"Sozan5","date":"2015-08-19T03:06:49.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I completely agree that flaming for a kill \"steal\" (or at all to be honest) is unforgivable.\n\nSecond, I did write that it depends on champion type you pick and even made emphasis on \"if you are playing a support champion\" rather than just support. Champions like Annie or Brand are mages, even if they are played on a support role. Sona can be both. And then there are picks like Leona, Nami or Braum, which are the support champions (as they tend to build support items (generally items that benefit the whole team, rather than only themselves). I mean, sure... You can build Braum as a mage, but it won't be as effective as support build or tank build).\n\nAs for the Draven, the important part is taking the kills on **purpose**. If it happens by accident, then it's all right, but if you are playing that Annie that waits with her freaking Tibbers until enemy is on 15% health (sadly, I met a support like that) then you are severely reducing effectivness of your team (as his passive can easily be worth another kill or even two).

I spent the entirety of season 4 as a support main only with no other skills (my friends brought me onto League to be their support, so that was all I knew) and the biggest annoyance was flaming adcs.  I once played with a Trist as Leona and for some reason, my w going off got every kill.  I was an 11/0/? Leona at 20 minutes and was so tanky I could 1v3, and by that point I couldn't stop my own base damages from being high (I was easily 4-5 levels ahead of her cuz i started roaming to try and give her time to get killls).  Idk what happened that game, but Trist spent the entirety of it calling me a trash fag.  I have never accidentally stolen so many kills in any other instance, but being an 11/0 Leona sup is a feeling I can only describe as the equivalent of fed Mundo with hard cc and a gap closer.  It was so fun after my entire team muted trist.  Likewise though, I get the flaming in that situation.  If I could've stopped my w, I would've, and it must've been incredibly frustrating to be an adc that went 0/0/? (i think it was 7 when I left lane) with a fed Leona that seems to get every kill.
