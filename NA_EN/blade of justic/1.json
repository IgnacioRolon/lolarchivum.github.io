I feel like I could more appreciate the epicness of the characters if I can see what they mean to regular people.\n\nAre some of them too dangerous in the public&#039;s eye? Are some the only reason their lives are even held together? Would the general public be better off without them? Do they solves problems that a normal person couldn&#039;t? Does that cause laziness and dependence? Do they create more problems than they&#039;re worth? Does that cause the public to see them all in the same light? Ex.: &quot;How long before Garen becomes the next Darius?&quot;\n\nMaking champions as awesome and amazing as you can doesn&#039;t amount to much when people only view that level of greatness as the standard.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2017-10-23T23:57:45.407+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quite a few are told from the perspective of rather ordinary folk.

What would suffering be for them exactly?\n\nI'm not sure what's coming up for those champs specifically, but in terms of what their suffering looks like - for all of them, it would be hunger/starvation.  They all exist to consume (pain, misery, magic, or biological matter) and if they were prevented from doing so, I strongly believe they'd experience suffering as powerfully as they experience satisfaction from sating their hunger.\n\nWe get a hint of that with Evelynn - as she is continually seeking greater and greater sources of pain to feed from, but is unable to get satisfaction.  There's the sense that her needs are becoming stronger - perhaps even stronger than she knows how to seek out - which may drive her to more and more extreme methods until she's stopped.\n\nIt's probably unlikely that we'll see a lot of that though - the champs you listed are so valuable as opposition to many of our other champs that they need to, for the most part, be powerful and incredibly dangerous.  Also, their power is a lot of their draw for many players - there's something very attractive about picking a champ that's just.  so.  unstoppable.","replies":[{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2017-10-25T17:39:44.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just the kind of response I was hoping for, thank you so much!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2017-10-25T17:17:43.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the Piltover stories ^^ Also love Magga's POV in [A Good Death](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/good-death)","replies":[]},{"poster":"zaire90","date":"2017-10-25T00:33:21.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh I feel like the reason people want more interactions is because there barely is any.I love seeing the views from the common people as well (training day also being my favorite) but I know I would love to see interactions with the whole du couteau family more than anything.
