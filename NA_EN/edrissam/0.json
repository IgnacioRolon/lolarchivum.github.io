The thing is, people usually say no and that you have to play a lot more normals before you're ready to dive in to ranked play, but why is that? What separates normal play from the mysterious land of ranked?\r\n\r\nWhat I'm really asking is, what differences should I expect when I start ranked play? Is there a huge jump in skill level? Are people expected to play in a more team-oriented style or is it still every man for himself (as it is in most normals)?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-18T02:10:08.547+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally didn't start playing ranked until last season, and I've been playing since Season 1. That's just been my personal preference. \n\nI agree with a lot of what's being said here, as far as how to prepare yourself. \n\n**Be able to play several champions (well) in several roles.** Between picks, bans, and not always being first pick, chances are, you won't get your first choice all the time. It's always good to have a back up! \n\n**Stock up on runes, and fill out masteries!** Although it may not seem that important at first glance, runes and masteries give you significant stat increases! \n\n**Understand counters.** I best learned this by playing ARAM, honestly, haha. Be aware of who counters your picks for champions, and visa-versa. Learn how to play against them. \n\n**Don't let one bad play kill your mood.** Don't get tilted! It's only a game, and if you give first blood and beat yourself up about it, chances are, you won't be as focused. Learn to let small errors go, and learn from them. The same should go for your teammates ~ let them know their 'bad play' wasn't so bad, and it's not a big deal. :] Just stay positive and do your best! \n\nGood luck! :3","replies":[{"poster":"Razamanie","date":"2014-08-20T11:01:47.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All this is agreeable, I suppose. As a gamer, i do agree. You've Got to have a good understanding of champions, their abilities, team fights, cool downs and kiting especially. if you can keep someone chasing so your abilities can refresh this will turn the tide of a fight so quickly its mind-blowing. Sadly though, this still isn't enough.\nIn your placement games , break out every lucky charm you've got because if you end up in bronze, you might as well go back to draft until the season ends. The level of Trolling and child tantrums in bronze put{{champion:32}} to shame, and make the game a detestable, sickening train wreck. You cant stop it from happening, but you also can't look away because you can't believe what you're seeing.\n\nIn summary, be a team player, keep your head up, play smart, and have a good knowledge of champions/responsibilities. If you aren't the top 3 picks i suggest having an internet browser open to lolcounter.com and as someone picks champs, depending on where you're going it makes counters very easy. This is especially true for players seeing new champions for the first time or when you're going to Top/Mid/Jungle.\n\nLastly if you get bronze ranked at all, quit ranked and return to draft. The level of players there is higher, there is not an LP punishment for dodging and the play is just better.\n\ngood luck!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-08-17T02:44:20.622+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't worry much about skill level.

People do take it much more seriously though, and won't hesitate to show it in chat half of the time.\n\nI'd only give a few pieces of general advice before walking into ranked. First, ensure that you have *at least* one rune page full of greater runes. Double check your mastery pages as well to make sure that you have all 30 points spent on each one. Finally, I'd advise being comfortable with 2 to 3 champs at a minimum, and double checking their popularity in terms of pick/ban in draft queues, ensuring that your favorite champs aren't always banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CharQueen","date":"2014-08-17T02:35:51.579+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on what division you end up in, you could enjoy Ranked matches the same way you would a Normal.

It means its an option now.  I don't know you, so I can't claim to know if you are, but KateyKhaos touched on some major points. These are, in order of importance to know, what I and I think many others feel are the major things to know going into ranked.\n\n*First and foremost* RANKED IS THE SERIOUS GAME MODE. Don't go into ranked and be that shithead who's like \"lol u guys are so tryhard\". NORMALS are for fun, NORMALS is for relaxing. Nothing wrong with normals if that's what you wanna do, I play at least 5x as many normals. If you're going into ranked, ***HAVE THE RESPECT TO TREAT IT AS SERIOUSLY AS THE 4 OTHER \nPEOPLE IN YOUR TEAM***.  It's common friggin' courtesy. You're not \"cool\" for not caring. You're an asshole wasting 4 other people's time. \n\n1)** KNOW HOW TO PLAY EVERY DAMN ROLE,** and know how to *play at least 3 on a level that you feel you could carry a game* while ahead (excepting support ofc, more like \"impact your team powerfully enough to win them some teamfights\"). You're wasting 4 other people's time if you go in being a dickhead who throws a fit cuz he can't play mid Yasuo every single game. LEARN THE GAME, not just a champion.\n\n2) **YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR ROLE OR CHAMPION EVERY GAME**. Suck it up *now*, and be aware of that, and be a ***contributing member of your teamcomp***. If you want to play the same champion every game, go to team builder and do so. Ranked is not for this.\n\n3) **LEARN WHERE THE FRIGGIN' MUTE BUTTON IS**. There are going to be angry people, particularly when you play badly (which everyone does sometimes) and not only waste an hour of their life, but make them lose LP. This is unavoidable. The best thing you can do is be a big fuckin' adult and hit the mute button. You're not going to convince them and they don't give a flying fuck about you. Mute them, cooperate with the rest of your teammates. Don't sit there throwing the game because you can't stop typing paragraphs nobody gives a shit about.\n\n4) **MAP. AWARENESS**.  So many games could EASILY be won, or lost, if people had better/worse map awareness. If you're mid, and you see your jungler go for a level 2 invade on their red, and your enemy mid leaves lane, let your jungler know and follow the mid. If you decide to solo dragon, but 4 people all look like they're walking ***straight toward you***, get the flying fuck out. if your mid pings 4 times that the enemy kat went MIA, ***don't*** be trying to have sex with the enemy tower in bot lane. BACK UP. This'll win you far more games, and save you from looking like a complete moron.\n\n5) **LEARN TEAM COMPOSITION, AND CONTRIBUTE TO IT AS BEST YOU CAN**. If you've got an assassin jungler, an immobile mage mid, and a caster support bot lane, your team doesn't need a damned top yasuo. Your team needs a tank/fighter, your team needs peel and a frontline. Learn the basics of team composition and contribute to it with your picks out of the champions you know how to play. If you feel you don't know enough on this subject, youtube has an endless amount of videos on it.\n\n6) **COUNTERS**. You can win past a counter, but you have to be outright and wholly superior to the other player. Don't let your ego give you and 4 other people a loss. Don't pick mid as firstpick. Try to avoid picking top as an early pick. Ask to trade with people to delay these two lane picks.\n\n7) **GENERAL NUMBERS KNOWLEDGE REGARDING CHAMPIONS**.  You should know some of the more simple numerical stuff you'll encounter a lot. As an example, if your main is an immobile mage in mid, know Talon hits a power spike at level 5 and 6. Stuff like that.\n\nHopefully that's not *too* aggressive, but this **basic knowledge** becomes stuff you wish had physical existence so you could shove it literally down peoples throats until they learned it.\nTry to learn all this stuff. Or at the very least, the first three. You can probably make it out of bronze without the last three, but past that, those are important as well. Wish you the best!","replies":[{"poster":"Edrissam","date":"2014-08-18T23:06:32.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed and, um, candid reply.

Just in general at the selfishness of many people going into ranked.\n\nDespite the \"candid\" wording, please also keep in mind that raging at people, even if they fail to grasp ANY of the above points I mentioned, is still not okay. It's perfectly okay to be absolutely infuriated at the guy who as last pick throws a fit and picks mid anyway and proceeds to intentionally feed all game before going onto the forums to complain about \"how bad his teams are\" (true story), but throwing out a storm of anger and cursing  doesn't actually ever fix the problem (ever).\n\nWhich is a massive problem in itself Riot seems all-too-eager to ignore as long as possible: The trolls and selfish pricks own the game, and can hold good natured players hostage with threats of AFKing or feeding. Riot pretends being a good person helps you win games, but frankly, that's only if everyone is a good person on your team. One douche and tada! He has (almost) all the power in deciding whether you win your promo series or not.\n\n\nAll that in mind, ranked is a lot of fun in the (unfortunately few) games where everyone can play something close to what they want, and has the basic game knowledge I pointed out. It's well worth the anger and frustration at an archaic ranking system and childish community when you finally succeed in some goal you set (like Gold for example lol). Those of us who genuinely care about each game and respect each other, and each other's desire to succeed as well, have great games together, win or lose.  \n\nI would like to say from my personal experience, most people are perfectly happy to accept a loss with grace, even an important one, as long as it was  *good* game, as in fair (5 v 5, no trolls, ragers, or afkers), and of relatively equal skill (No Plat V's in someone's Silver II promos), and everyone legitimately trying their best. If I'm honest, many of my favorite games have been losses. Most people in ranked just want to play a game where everyone is taking the strategic game as seriously as they are, and are more angry at the fact they feel their teammates are wasting their time and disrespecting them by deciding \"lol it's just a game\" while losing the game for their team almost by themselves. Very rarely are people angry about a loss or someone losing the game for them, they're angry because they and 3 other people are giving it their all, and one guy is just too much of a dick to do so as well, yet queue'd up in the game mode specifically made for giving it your all.\n\nLike I said, first and foremost, ranked is the \"tryhard\" mode, if you take playing it as seriously as the other 4 people on your team are taking it and are thick-skinned (or quick enough to hit the mute button when they get to you), I ***guarantee*** you'll have a fun and rewarding experience. Especially if you learn some of the stuff people in this thread suggested, as you have a far better knowledge of the game (and higher skill level) than most who you encounter in the game.\n\nOnce again, all my best wishes!\n\nP.S. if you can, find someone who \n  1) Is as cool-headed as you or more, \n  2) Has roughly your ranked rating and/or skill level,\n  3) you synergize with well both as players and individuals, try doing duo queue. Having someone you know you can rely on every game, and mutually vent with (AFTER the game), does wonders for climbing in ranked :D\nalso, PLEASE don't bring your Gold II buddy into your Bronze III games, it ruins it for everyone else, teammates and opponents alike.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Max Q Then E","date":"2014-08-18T17:35:22.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things you need (SHOULD HAVE) to enter ranked:\nSkilled in 2-3 roles\nSkilled in at least 2 champs per role\nAt least one FULL 'tier 3' rune page - *I've got 15 full pages that covers ever role in the game and extra circumstances for my preferred roles.
