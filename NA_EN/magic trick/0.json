I'm sure they will get to it promptly if you let the ticket get to the front.","replies":[{"poster":"ramarsterking","date":"2016-11-14T18:51:11.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did they fix your account?","replies":[{"poster":"Necroscide","date":"2016-11-14T21:14:07.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ramarsterking,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Jso1OJV1,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-11-14T18:51:11.237+0000)\n>\n> Did they fix your account?\n\nNot yet unfortuantly, I have only confirmed with a member of staff that the problem still persists.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Necroscide","date":"2016-11-13T21:45:18.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I got the same issue, I payed the rp for the transfer on my main and the account can no longer be accessed on the NA server but I cannot log in on the EUW server where it was moved to, I'm hoping it's just due to high traffic of account transfers as there must be Â£1000+ worth of content on the account.
