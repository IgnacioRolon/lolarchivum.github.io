I know this was lag.\nBut weird thing happened, the keyboard is working well while I lost control of the mouse cursor. The cursor was not moving smoothly when I was moving my mouse, in the worse case, I couldn't move it and I couldn't see it at all, while the keyboard response was perfect. Then can you say that this was a lag? The keyboard response was instantly, it was not a typical lag. \nJust wonder do you guys have ever run into this kind of problem. I doubt there is something wrong with my hardware, but I can't believe it, because it's perfect when I play other games.","replies":[{"poster":"llIlllIIlIlIIIll","date":"2018-03-12T19:12:07.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was using mac for league after I update to s8 My mouse was out of control every game, It was running around all over my screen","replies":[]},{"poster":"RG Support","date":"2017-05-31T05:33:25.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have similar problems in last 2 weeks.
