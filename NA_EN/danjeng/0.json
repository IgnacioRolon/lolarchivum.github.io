I generally told those who did complain that Ryze was weak that he's perfectly viable and simply needed more effort to do well with.\n\n&quot;Ryze doesn&#039;t need buffs tbh&quot; is something I would say often. &quot;He&#039;s balanced around LCS and high elo. If there&#039;s a challenger Ryze player that means you can do well regardless of elo. Sure he&#039;s not that strong but he&#039;s viable.&quot;\n\n-----------------\n\nBut then, today I went on the Ryze subreddit, and there were some posts saying something about Ryze nerfs. &quot;Haha&quot; I thought. \"The Ryze nerf joke is a bit overused tho&quot;. \n\nFirst I saw a text post, \"Ryze Nerf on PBE&quot;. I&#039;m not falling for that shit again. Nice try.\n\nThen another post, an image, a screenshot showing the nerf. Man these shitposters really put a lot of effort into making these.\n\nFinally, the third post. A link. I clicked on it and indeed. There it was. I couldn&#039;t believe it. \n\n----------------\n\n10% AP ratio lost on Q is massive, considering it is his primary nuke spell. His kit revolves around Q resets, and E empowering Q. They are essentially cutting down the AP ratio of his main damage spell by about 22%.\n\nSo along the multiple heavy hitting nerfs from last season, piled on top of the nerfs this season, plus nerfs to tear and archangel&#039;s, Ryze is being nerfed once again. If I recall, correctly, Anivia, who has consistently had a 50%+ wr in my time of playing, was buffed to compensate for archangel's being nerfed. Ok.\n\nBut see. SInce changes to mage itemization this season. Ryze was nerfed and nerfed again. Then his item and components nerfed. So thus currently, Ryze is in the state of double nerfs to him and the item that warranted nerfs in the first place. But right now on PBE he&#039;s not being compensated for his item nerf. In fact, there are even more nerfs. For those who think I&#039;m overreacting, take a look at all the changes he recieved since this rework. It&#039;s painful to look at how much a champion can be nerfed. http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ryze/History\n\n\nI&#039;ve been very laid back in the past. Never toxic, never blamed the state of my champ. Even chided any ideas about buffing Ryze. But then they repay me with this agghhhhkkkkkk. Whatever. It&#039;s okay. I&#039;m okay :)","replies":[{"poster":"Thimes","date":"2018-08-21T22:58:06.088+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"They can't balance him around pro play and solo queue at same time without reworking him again and they gave up on trying.
