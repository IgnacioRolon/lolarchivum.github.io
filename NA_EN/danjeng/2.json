Camp spawn times were made longer, so I could farm there, then head over bot quickly. Tracker&#039;s knife has wards, can replace sightstone. Or I could build support, and a jungle item. If the enemy jungler is bot, top-jungler invades. If enemy jungler is top, support-jungler invades.\n\nI would REALLY like if I had a team to play with which is open to different strategies.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-11-15T02:14:49.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"There just isnt enough camps, each side wouldn't sacrifice one camp for another, and now the camps are different in XP and Gold thanks to Krugs, one sid ewill definitely have a better advantage than the other.\n\nAND THEN\n\nIt means they would have to cross the river when there no left.

Side sharing takes advantage of deep wards to constantly take turns jungling one side and counter jungling the other. This method puts a lot of easy pressure on the far lanes. \n\nDedicated counter jungle: the second jungler is an early duelist with a lot of self peel or getaway potential. their job is to harass the enemy jungler and make them useless. \n\nRoaming: This kind of double jungle is similar to side share, with the major difference being in that the roamer is a champion who has a lot of early gank potential (level 2 or 3). Roamers take small monsters, and always leave the large ones. this kind of double jungle puts a TON of pressure on two lanes. \n\nYou know whats also pretty selfish? Expecting other players to bend to your whim.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-11-15T03:07:28.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell that to Riot, i'm just stating what your down voters aren't.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ratpocalypse","date":"2018-02-22T01:10:55.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrazyBear1987,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tTfK6Wet,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-15T02:14:49.445+0000)\n>\n> There just isnt enough camps, each side wouldn't sacrifice one camp for another, and now the camps are different in XP and Gold thanks to Krugs, one sid ewill definitely have a better advantage than the other.\n> \n> AND THEN\n> \n> It means they would have to cross the river when there no left.

It would be replaced with asn while Supp champs would either go mid or top and recreate a new role. Back when Dota was still a WarCraft 3 game, 2 jg did exist, it functioned somewhat but the game mechanics were far more different than this game. You had 1 jg that was considered \"mid\" jg which consisted of 6 jg camps near mid lane. This jg could technically be considered it's own lane because the jg creeps were highly contested and PVP was far higher in this role than any other role against the other Mid jg. It was by far the most difficult lane to play in while ganking. I can see why it would no longer exist especially in this game. Whoever would show more dominance would snowball like crazy while the other would be unable to assist the team in any way and fall far behind. In WC3 Dota, you could catch up, and snowballing like crazy didn't cost you the game. In this game, it would just be broken. In the other JG, the JG would pretty much would just Jg until he got his ultimate and then would focus on sieging. He would pretty much just siege all game. He would go JG until his ult came back up off CD and then returned to siege. That was his only job. It created very repetitive game play. Could Riot introduce this? They could, but I don't see any reason for it. The game as is is hard enough to balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2016-11-15T02:36:05.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering most jg's are building support items anyways (sighstone smite, aegis) can't we just eliminate that role entirely and have each team with two supports?
