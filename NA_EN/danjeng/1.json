My friend said it was a free to play game already installed. We wanted to rush into a PvP game real fast, so I skipped over Basic Tutorial and went into Battle Training. There, I was told to select a champion to play, and I chose Ryze, my first champion ever. I ran through it in a half hour. I was already familiar with Ryze, so I played him in the next game too, because my friend was incredibly aggressive and did not like me to feed, even against AI. I thought Ryze was weak at first, but the blue dude began growing on me. \n\nSo, I played Ryze again and again and again. I had his range, his base stats at every level, scalings on every ability, his cooldowns, cooldown resets, animation times, all imprinted into my mind. Going mid? Got Ryze. Top lane? Ryze works. Jungle? Why not Ryze. Support? Ryze got that snare. ADC? Ryze. Had a dream where Ryze was running in the Olympics with MS quints and Mobi boots.\n\nI went on Hiatus during the spring, because the weather seemed just lovely after a hurricane, and the flowers smelled nice. Then by the fall I was very busy. I played LoL some months, sometimes I did not. The amount I played began decreasing with each subsequent week. I forgot my username and password, forgot about the game. Then I stopped going to IC&#039;s altogether until\n\n&quot;oh sht ryze is getting a rwork&quot;\nI received this from a text from that very friend who introduced me to LoL. It&#039;s been 2 years since we last communicated. I immediately downloaded LoL onto my computer, made a new account, and began grinding to Level 30, day and night. You can guess what champion I was using most of the time. There was this new class called Juggernauts, and they were pretty strong. But I kept using the reworked Ryze in the toplane. By the end of Season 5, I made it to Silver 3.\n\nCome Season 6, I hear Ryze is getting yet another update. I pay no attention to this and build him the same: RoA, RoA, Rylai&#039;s, Spirit, Deadman&#039;s, WotA. The midyear mage update came, and the only difference was replacing WotA with Abyssal. Started in Bronze 2, but I climbed to Silver 3 again, and stayed there. My win rate was a solid 50%, and it looked like I was a true Silver for life.\n\n----But then comes the Ryze update. It was a real big one, and his new animations looked beautiful. I played some ranked games on him. Because I was in ranked, I began using stat sites. Looked on op.gg for last 20 Ryze ranked games: 55% win rate. Pretty good. I thought it was just a short trend, but as the months pass, it began going up. 58%, 63%, 68%, 74%. I was dominating my lane every game. Even supposed counters like Cassiopeia were beat down. Soon, I made it into Gold! The funny thing was, most games, I did not even touch my ultimate. Not once. \n\nI am not bragging. I am not a good player. Go onto op,gg or lolking or similar sites and see how I do with other champions. What I think is that Ryze is a bit too powerful at this moment. Please listen to me. I wrote a detailed post before, about how he should be toned down, but that got disliked with no comments at all, and probably won&#039;t be seen ever again. I&#039;ve kept up with this VGU. Rioters and YouTubers said he was powerful, and that he should be getting nerfs. I wrote a post few months back http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Mus1LWrm-do-not-buff-ryze-yet, and lots of people agreed. \n\nWell, Ryze got buffed. \n\nhttp://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/data-and-champion-balance-part-1\nThis link describes Riot&#039;s policy on balancing champions. A main point is that they balance around high level play.\nTake a look at faker&#039;s Challenger smurf: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=mid+fekar\nThat&#039;s a whopping Ryze 86% win rate with 22 games played. \n\nBut not only faker, but a low gold like me can use Ryze. I am a bad player, mid silver level. While my Ryze is good, it&#039;s ridiculous that I&#039;m carrying games without even using my ultimate the whole game. I know now that I don&#039;t play Ryze to win. I play Ryze to improve from previous games. This is my most sincere plea: nerf ryze. This is coming from a Ryze main since S2.\n\nEven if you do not play Ryze, I want to hear your opinion. If you disagree, tell me why. Call me stupid, agree with me. I&#039;ve become attached to the Rune Mage, I say to nerf him, just slightly, because I care for this champion. \n\nI think Ryze feels the same way\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/21/Ryze.move22.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20160709141136","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-14T02:46:36.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze is truly terrifying in the right hands, he always has been.\nAll the rework really did was lower the amount of superhuman finger ninja magic and timing needed to reach Ryze transcendence, and make his kit a lot more balanced. All the QQ about him being terrible stems from the same reason kassadin, aurelion and taliyah have bad winrates: people divebomb feed with their ults.\n\nPS: TF just sucks, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2016-10-14T03:05:07.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twisted Fate a solid pick. Or at least in higher levels, according to some smurfs I've been playing with. \n\"Ryze is truly terrifying in the right hands, he always has been.\"\nHow do you explain that you also do quite well on Ryze according to your op.gg profile? You don't main him, but managed a 9/9 kd with 75% win rate. \nRyze being an intensive champion is a misconception. He's one of the three tutorial champions.\nIf the amount of superhuman finger ninja magic and timing needed to reach Ryze transcendence was lowered, this further proves my point he's even stronger than ever.\n","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-14T19:42:05.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mash buttons while playing ryze, totally serious. I cant say i have played him enough to have accurate winrate statistics.\n\nThe few times i have played him in ranked (because rito, my ranked elo is about half of my normals, roughly, so i see really awful players, especially in top), people never, ever respect the awsome destructive power of a fluxed minion wave, and get really confused when they get hit with 5 or 6 spells through a now-nonexistent double wave.\nIt is sort of like aurelion - everyone hears he sucks, so nobody takes him seriously until he is stomping them.\n\nAnd intensive? he used to be incredibly complicated to play (at maximum potential), widely regarded as one of the most mechanically complex and intense champions. that was reduced by the last two reworks to what he has now. pre-2016 ryze, most players just did simple combos and waiting out cooldowns, very few people had any idea how to manage his abilities to achieve effectively no cooldowns at all, including on his ult, as a result he seemed weak to most people and had a perpetually awful winrate.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
