When i try to open it the badge shows up but nothing after that. I have tried searching online and changed the compatibility settings but so far none of em have helped.

This is because League requires a lot of specific privileges in order to run correctly, so working through our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) is a good next step.\n\nLet me know if you have any further issues with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Penanggalan","date":"2016-11-01T03:09:29.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been running client as administrator.

At this point, the patcher is attempting to pull files from the patching servers, and an error here usually means there's an issue maintaining a strong connection. Working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) would be my suggestion, as local network settings often cause these types of issues to occur.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
