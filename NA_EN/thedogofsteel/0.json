I resolved this issue by taking the game off of fullscreen mode but found another issue in the process. Now weather I go borderless or windowed the game appears as a fairly small window in the center of my desktop. I think this happens because of the 1200 x 800 resolution of my laptop is lower than the 1920 x 1080 of my monitor. I went into the settings menu to look for the proper resolution but all I got were laptop resolutions. Does anyone know how to change the resolution to 1080p on a laptop, or has any other fix ideas I could use?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T17:50:03.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're using your monitor to play the game then the laptop's screen shouldn't really impact it too much.  You could have some bad settings that's not setting your resolution properly, though.  Try [resetting your config](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues#mq2) to reset your resolution to default, then re-adjust it afterwards.  \n\nBy the way, as a heads up keep in mind that if your monitor is a 4K (or retina) which isn't currently supported, then you can run into some trouble like this.  You can always swap monitors or disconnect it to rule out hardware possibilities.  Let me know how that works out for you!","replies":[]}]}
