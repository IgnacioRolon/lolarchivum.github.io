I can use the legacy client and the summary screen pops up immediately. I have tried my best to troubleshoot this on my own but I am not very tech savvy. Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. In the mean time i will just use the legacy client\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. I tried uninstalling and re-installing and this did not fix the issue. I also tried running a full repair in the settings. Nothing has worked so far.","replies":[{"poster":"skyhiflier15","date":"2017-04-16T03:01:03.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"connection tool does not fix the problem did absolutely nothing to make game summary load any faster.
