First of all, I know that you click cancel, and then reconnect which is simple and I have done it. But on rare occasion it won't reconnect so I have to fully restart my client. Today, I had to restart the whole client and it would pop up with the League Of Legends logo and then never load until it pops up with a white screen saying some weird thing along the lines of \"Unable to connect to url league of legends\" or something like that and eventually I have to restart my computer and so I get an AFK count to eventually get a leaver buster. I think it's really dumb that I now have to wait 5 games of 20 minutes because if this issue soooooo yeah.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T04:30:16.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What you experienced is *unrelated* to the known issue of having to hit *cancel* and then *reconnect* inside the client.
