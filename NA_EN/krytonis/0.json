This will be my first time I created a discussion.\r\nBasically, I played on NA server for several months. I was very committed and had many Item Sets and such ready for each Champion I owned. After moving houses to the EUW, I transferred my account to EUW server. I was fully aware of the consequences, but what did NOT occur to me was that the item sets did not move with it.\r\n\r\nSo at the moment, I am stuck with few Item Sets I PREVIOUSLY created before I transferred my account to NA. Is there a method to replace these set of Item Sets with the Item Sets I had with me back in the NA server? Where can I locate the files, and how should I go about this issue?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T23:17:18.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Per the[ Transfer FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751924-Account-Transfer-FAQ), items sets can only transfer as long as your Summoner Name has not changed.  Unfortunately, there's no way to recover item sets as it's technically on another account and not something we have access to.  It would be necessary to create a new set in this case.  I know that sucks to hear, but hopefully it won't take too much time to do and even inspire you with some new creative lists!","replies":[{"poster":"Krytonis","date":"2016-09-17T12:21:32.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply!

We aren't able to manually restore item sets, but we can review the situation for any issues to determine if it is a one-off situation or  help preventing it from happening again.  The report would be appreciated!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
