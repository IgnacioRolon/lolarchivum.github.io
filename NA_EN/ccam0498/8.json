After this happens too many times, you are completely locked out of purchases to help prevent people from stealing your card and committing fraud by brute force methods. \n\nAt this point, any additional attempts to make a purchase will delay the time period that you need to wait. The only way that is going to lift is by waiting a full 24 hours, and honestly, it might be best to simply wait longer (I'd say 48 hrs) to make sure that all the failed attempts have cleared out first. Your best bet for getting this fixed is to not try buying RP until 10/7/2017.","replies":[{"poster":"ccam0498","date":"2017-10-06T10:55:03.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"last time this happened it wouldn't let me buy rp on my account but would let me buy it on other accounts now it won't let me buy it on other accounts and i never once typed my info in wrong so i don't know why it's doing this again","replies":[]}]}]}
