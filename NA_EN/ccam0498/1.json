Has this happened to anyone else? if riot don't get back to me soon i'm not going to be able to buy the skins i want it seems like they just don't want my money anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T23:02:13.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a ticket I'd be happy to check on the status for you.  If there are too many attempts made then this issue can come up, though I've sometimes seen it randomly happen as well.","replies":[{"poster":"ccam0498","date":"2017-09-22T23:07:39.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i typed my cvv in once wrong bc i had just woke up and tried to buy rp now it gives me the 24 hr thing but this was like 2 days ago that this happened. i do have a ticket in that i posted at 5am this morning #31879325 that should be my ticket number. just annoying that i want to buy the championship skins and some new champs and i can't even do that because it won't let me buy the rp to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T23:19:31.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it's an account sensitive issue and on EU, there's not much we can assist with here on the boards.  I was able to confirm your ticket was received .  A billing specialist will reach out as soon as they can and help you get squared away!\n\n-- I do see another ticket was created, duplicates can sometimes cause delays and confusion.  Replying to the ticket before hearing from us can also bump you back down the queue.  Hang tight, and we'll reply back as soon as we can.","replies":[{"poster":"ccam0498","date":"2017-09-23T07:05:42.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i didn't create another ticket i posted on the same ticket. this is a joke honestly how long does it take to look at an acc a fix a small billing problem. i'm going to end up missing the championship skins and that's really very annoying. i probably won't spend money on this game again now if yous can't even reply to or fix a simple problem that i've now had for 3 days. Absolute joke.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
