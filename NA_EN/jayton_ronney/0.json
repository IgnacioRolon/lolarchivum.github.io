Riot Eambo--in this [thread](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/E9zqYNlk-your-personalised-snowdown-store-faq-and-issues)--pointed out that any skin in your Snowdown Shop cannot be purchased if it is on sale within the standard Store; it just happens that Matador Alistar is currently on sale in the standard Store. I recommend checking the Store sale price and seeing if it's worth waiting until tomorrow to pick it up in your Snowdown Shop instead; Matador Alistar is only on sale in the standard Store today--December 18, 2015.\n\nThe rest of the Snowstorm Sale Schedule can be found here: \n\nhttp://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/caution-snowstorm-sale-incoming\n\nI hope that helps and I hope you enjoy Matador Alistar in Legend of the Poro King!","replies":[]}]}
