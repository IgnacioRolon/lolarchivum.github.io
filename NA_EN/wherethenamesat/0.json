But then everyone hates on Lee Sin, because he has to much mobility and that he is \"the perfect champ\" but terribly falls off late game and must have a great early game to be useful. But then Lee Sin QQ threads pop-up and suddenly everyone and their mother all agrees and hates him and demands nerfs. This also happens to Yasuo, who i believe has one of the highest skill ceilings in the game, and people complain \"his double crit passive is stupid, he dashes around too much, why should he get a shield refresh on his ult\". And the funny thing is that both Lee Sin and Yasuo have less than a 45% rate and if the person doesn't know how to play them right can feed epically and lose the game. While Fizz has a 51% win rate and the person backflips and kills me then in all chat says, \"brooo u just got outplayed\".","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2014-12-09T04:25:04.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> both Lee Sin and Yasuo have less than a 45% rate and if the person doesn't know how to play them right can feed epically and lose the game.

For example, Talon has or had one of the highest winrates however he is objectively one of the weakest assassins with the lowest feast and one of the highest famine.","replies":[{"poster":"WhereTheNamesAt","date":"2014-12-09T04:33:23.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you could say that win rates are part of team comps. Your Yasuo isn't going to do good if he has the only knock-up and Lee Sin isn't going to do good if his team doesn't know how to follow up when he insecs a carry. Meanwhile, to me Fizz can just do everything himself with zhonya's and decent cool down reduction. About Talon, I play him quite a bit and I wouldn't say he is weak at all. I run armor pen runes and when i get a brutalizer and lvl 7 I can pretty much 100-0 the other midlaner with a full combo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2014-12-09T04:21:53.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except this community (or GD at least) hates all 3 of those champions. \n\nWith a burning passion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2014-12-09T10:07:50.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really understand why fizz needs a 1:1 ratio on his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-12-09T04:20:52.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me neither","replies":[]},{"poster":"FyshinaTux","date":"2014-12-09T04:28:14.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Simply put, if Fizz is THAT OP, I want you to get him if you don't have him already.

AAAANNNNNYYYYYYTTTTTHHHHHHIIIIINNNNGGGGGG other than dodging one of your spells while simultaneously counter-engaging on you, you can harass the ;SALKDJAF;LKJASD;LFKJ out of him and there's nothing he can do about it (unless you're melee, in which case there are other ways to abuse his weaknesses).","replies":[]}]}
