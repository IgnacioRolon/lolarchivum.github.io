I got permanently banned for toxicity, but created a new account since I was so into the game. On that account I try'd really hard not to be toxic. I thought if I'd start all over, people would understand. So far, I've only gotten 1 chat restriction. But that's it.

Sorry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-06-09T02:06:53.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Like other reformed players which have gotten there ban uplifted, shouldn't mine be lifted up?\n\nLike who?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knihovak","date":"2019-06-09T05:44:25.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MortalOblivion,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IKdn1VEg,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-06-09T01:56:19.447+0000)\n>\n> So far, I've only gotten 1 chat restriction.

You don't have a leg to stand on in this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-09T02:58:25.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Riot sees an account that's had up to three temporary punishments and then shows poor behavior yet again, they conclude that that player will never reform, so they just permaban the account. It's not an arbitrary punishment.\n\nThe fact that you've gotten punished on your new account further verifies that a permaban was the right decision in your case. I don't even know what makes you believe how getting another punishment demonstrates reform.","replies":[]}]}
