I got really fed in the first ten to fifteen minutes, but that meant nothing. Veigar could one-shot me with his ult from eleven minutes on. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}  I&#039;m not posting this as a formal complaint to Riot, as the problem was definitely avoidable, and I should have just built life-steal, etc. Really, I want to make this a discussion about Veigar and the unhealthy (or healthy, depending on your opinion) spot he&#039;s in. Please offer your input, and if any Rioters wish to speak on the issue, I&#039;d love to hear it.

There was so much counterplay i forgot to use it. also he was 2/2 when i died","replies":[{"poster":"LordBrasca","date":"2017-06-20T21:17:59.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it's sounds extremly hard to believe. Even as a midlaner i don't recall ever being able to oneshot someone with just R at full health, the max i was able to do was Q+R but i was so fed that i could solo carry that game easely, like any champ would do at that point.\n\nAlso as a support it's kinda hard for him to get stacks on minions.... \n\nMinimum damage is 175 / 250 / 325 (+ 75% AP)... you can see from here that is impossible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-20T23:03:18.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult has huge scaling with missing HP.
