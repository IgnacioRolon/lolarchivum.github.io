I&#039;ve been in elo hell for about a little over a week now, and from what I noticed is, you literally can&#039;t get out. I tried many different roles, but it doesn&#039;t matter. You get matched with low mmr people and no matter what you do, your team will feed and their team will absolutely destroy you. That&#039;s what I learned from being in the elo hell for over a week. Literally, your teammates are always I MEAN ALWAYS bad... I can&#039;t do anything lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-20T04:35:07.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">You get matched with low mmr people and no matter what you do, your team will feed and their team will absolutely destroy you\n\nYou get matched with people with the same mmr as you.  The enemy is as likely to get feeders as you, you're just failing to take advantage of that.","replies":[{"poster":"G6od","date":"2017-04-20T22:26:57.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except the enemy team doesn't feed as much as mine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Genjab","date":"2017-04-20T10:08:59.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is it impossible to get out of elo hell when people are in plat+??\n\nAlso, there's one of your problems. You are playing too many roles. Be a one trick and you will climb. Just play a carry and actually carry the game. Don't just get fed and then blame your team. Get fed and make shot calls.","replies":[{"poster":"G6od","date":"2017-04-20T22:26:34.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey. I am a top main and I've been doing that until I got into elo hell. It doesn't work like that, and I don't just blame my teammates for no reason. I am not necessary a flamer either. I just play my role but it is very hard to win the game when everyone besides you are feeding for every game. You look at my match history and damage dealt. Every game im up there. I don't deserve this.","replies":[{"poster":"Genjab","date":"2017-04-22T18:10:43.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Be a one trick top main then. It takes practice to get out of elo hell.

Really I am being serious. Yes. It sounds like im just blaming my teammates but really it isn't. I lose every single game because they are just bad and opponent beat my team every single time.
