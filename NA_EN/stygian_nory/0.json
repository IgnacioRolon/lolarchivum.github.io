On top of all this, it would have to be Balanced for all 120+ Champions (which is no trivial task).\n\nAnd, most importantly - _**It would require its own Queues**_.\n\nThis is certainly the hardest part, because every time a new Map or Mode hits the Servers, it splits the Community into subdivisions. And, if there are not healthy-enough Player Populations for each of these Queues, then it becomes a downward spiral of increasing unpopularity as Queue-times increase as the Population struggles to stay afloat - and the **_ENTIRE _** effort of making the new Map / Game-Mode takes a steady path down the tubes - at least in the relative sense to League's Already Healthy Queues gone right - being Summoner's Rift (which has Several Sub-Queues depending on Mode) & Howling Abyss. From my understanding, Twisted Treeline's Populous is small in comparison.\nBut then there's _Dominion_...\nPoor Dominion is what _could_ happen to the next Map/Mode - if things were to go wrong.\nIt has only 2 Queues - one of which is _literally dead_ (Draft Dominion) - in that, if you join, you will **NOT** be able to find a game, unless 9 other people with unrealistic expectations decide to join at the same time...\nAnd the Regular Dominion Queue is already pretty long, due to the small Player-Base.\n\nTHAT is why Riot is reluctant to expend all the effort required to even TRY a real New Map.\n\nBut, say even then, with the whole boat-load of risks, the Gamble pays off, and it's a new Hit Mode!\nWhat will happen, then?\n_It'll suck Players from the Other Queues, making those Other Queues less healthy._\nHow come?\nWell, if it's a really successful Map/Mode with great Depth and Replay-Value just like Summoner's Rift, then it will require not just Normal Queues, but also Ranked (which is needed for a Strong Community), and possibly Draft [which helps foster the Ranked Community by giving them a more laxed environment free(er) of the Casuals in Blind-Pick].\nIf this happens, these Queues will require a good number of Players, which will siphon _yet more Players_ from the other Queues - and if we're talking about something _near_ or _at par_ with Summoner's Rift, that's going to be a huge chunk of the Player-Base, which will dilapidate the other Queues.\n\nSo what if it's just _ok_ - not attracting too many or too little Players.\nWell, in that case, from a Business Standpoint, it probably wasn't worth it - and you have to remember, Riot _is_ a business after all. There are other ventures that are less risky and expensive (although, seeing the amount of content they put out, I can't help but imagine the Riot Offices running similar to _The Office_). So basically, there are 3 Kinds of Outcomes:\n\n1. The Map/Mode dies quickly and the Whole Effort largely goes down the tubes - effort which could have been spent else-where.\n2. The Map/Mode is a huge Success, spawning a healthy Player-Base for it - but at the expense of the other Player-Bases.\n3. The Map/Mode is kind of popular, but doesn't really make it that far. Good job, you've given _some_ Players a bit of extra fun, but not enough replayability to keep them hooked for ages.\n\nSo to recap:\n1. Wasted Effort - Bad outcome for Riot and arguably the Whole Player-Base [Likely]\n2. Good Out-Come for _Some_ Players, but not Riot. [Least Likely]\n3. Mediocre Out-Come for _Some_ Players, but not Riot [Likely]","replies":[{"poster":"TheFirstGokun","date":"2015-07-10T16:04:09.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make some good points. I'd say you're thinking too pessimistically, as there is no need to make ranked queues or new items for this mode. The player base and Riot are always expanding, and while Riot may not have the resources to make a new map _now_ we don't know what will happen a few years down the line.\nAs for Dominion, we know it sucks, but it just looks SO BAD in comparison to everything else. Dominion needs a bit of a rework before it regains popularity.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Intambulance","date":"2015-07-06T00:23:58.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That looks awesome!
