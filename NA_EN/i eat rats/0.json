I mean god awful. So they kept playing the blame game on me and saying everything was my fault. (I could tell at least two of them were duo queue). So then they type in all chat and say that I am being toxic and to report me.... So now, because of trolls, the oblivious fools who run riot chat restricted and restricted me from ranked games for 37 games...... Seriously, this game has the worst community ever. Even Dota has nicer people. This game makes me sick.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-05T23:50:57.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really think Riot needs to hire a large team of people who work the tribunal.  This is why you don't leave it up to a computer, or why you don't leave it up to the same community that causes problems in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"I Eat Rats","date":"2015-01-05T23:54:07.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, the idea of a tribunal being run by the community who obviously started the problems is so stupid. Just starts a hate train and gets people restricted for no reason... Thanks for the support. Hopefully riot will see and lift my restrictions , but I doubt they'll even care.

You're projecting.\n\nAlso, you have no idea if the offenders were banned or chat restricted. None at all. So why bring the point up? Did you report them?\n\nI see you're STILL dodging the point, and any personal responsibility. Well, continue to be confused as to why you get chat restricted until you're willing to take responsibility for your own actions","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-01-05T23:57:09.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop lying OP.","replies":[{"poster":"I Eat Rats","date":"2015-01-06T00:01:21.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol... \"stop lying OP.\" If only you knew bud.
