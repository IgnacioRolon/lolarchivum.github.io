It doesnt affect the actual game when I am playing but at the end of the game I have to restart the League client and login again. I tried updating my video drivers and nothing seems to be fixing the problem. Anybody have any tips? Also it seems if I leave my client on for some time without playing a game the client also crashes. I have been having this problem for a few months now. It is doesnt affect my game play but it is so annoying not being able to see the end game lobby and  having to login again almost every game. Any tips will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-14T01:07:49.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your description, it definitely sounds like some sort of issue with the connection between our PvP.net Servers and your computer.
