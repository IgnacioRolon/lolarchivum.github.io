Our team also had no autofills, except that our ADC was on support, and our support was our ADC. Our bot lane played poorly and lost their lane, and that was the entire reason we lost the game. And to think that we had a good ADC, and we had a good support! But they weren't on their damn roles! We had all we needed to win that game!
