Zyra used to be more fun. Her old passive on death was just fun. She was the first champ I mained and the first champ I ever got a penta with. (Penta with her old passive on aram) I know her new passive is nice but the old one was just better for her. I hope others agree with me.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-22T21:17:45.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her old passive was so utterly useless that i usually forgot it existed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"x R U K A x","date":"2017-02-23T08:38:57.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I know how you feel, she was my first main too and still is to this day but her new passive is just a lot better for her, in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-02-22T21:42:23.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, Riot had a few reasons for changing Zyra's post-mortem passive - for one, having a passive that relies on dying to do something is bad enough, as it incentivizes reckless play, and it was made even worse that you only had one shot, unlike Karthus' being able to cast his spells or Sion being able to drag someone down with him.\n\nAnd, also, don't quote me on this, but I think I recall Riot saying that the post-mortem Passive and official death animation made it fairly difficult to produce skins for her - but again, I could be totally wrong in saying that.\n\nAnd, on top of all that, it is better that her current passive drops seeds near her consistently, because it opens up a lot more options for play. It's no longer just \"drop seeds and throw a spell\", or \"drop seed as bait, throw a spell\", it's more along the lines of \"do I rely on my passive seeds to present threats, or use them as bait, or use them as zone control? Do I want to add some more seeds, or should I combo them in certain ways\", etc. Having a lot more seeds out on the playing field opens a lot of options for both Zyra _and_ her opponents.\n\nSo, in the shortest sense, I think her current passive is fine, and I don't think she needs her old passive back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaos Milk Tea","date":"2017-02-22T21:28:56.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't a fan of her old passive, but she really does need a better one.  They probably should have just given her a third type of plant that spawned if she walked on the seed, or different plant the only sprouted if a seed was placed on a wall.  The intention was to increase the \"plantmancer\" fantasy, but all they did was give her more seeds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gundaman","date":"2017-02-22T21:28:28.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But it happened every death lol.
