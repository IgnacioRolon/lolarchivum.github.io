I hopped out of bed (at 9) and powered on my computer, unlocking my iPod to check the e-mail. Sure enough it was sitting in there. Open League, log in...user/password combo incorrect. As I look back down at my iPod, it starts updating from the mail server and the e-mail I'm looking at goes poof. I check the trash, not there, but the push notification says it exists.\r\n\r\nHop over to my e-mail account settings...seems there's a strange login location from china that had been accessed recently. Completely different login credentials from my League account, so that has me baffled. Either way, after changing the credentials on both, I have to come back here and ask for any sort of info on my account that transpired within the last day. After my jungle Kled game from last night I logged out, so...any activity between then and now I'd like to be aware of.","replies":[{"poster":"Oh Look Kaede","date":"2016-09-28T17:33:28.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was reading this and understood that you are being account hacked or someone tried to and saw the word \"Baffled\" I didn't read that correctly and almost had a heart attack dad I didn't do anythinggg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sauvagess","date":"2016-09-28T16:23:53.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did, it's request #23504023","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T15:49:31.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did look into this for you, but due to the nature of sensitive information on a public venue, there's not much I can confirm without further discussion.
