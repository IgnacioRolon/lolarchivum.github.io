Unless the zed player is really good and punishes every mistake you make then sorry you just got outplayed. Zed will only one shot a squishy target with his ult-e-aa if hes like 10-0 in which case sucks to be you. hes an assassin, he is meant to delete squishies. But saying he is the easiest assassin is like saying ezreal is the easiest adc. Totally untrue when you compare him to say another ad assassin like Talon who is miles easier to play. And before its said, yes I play zed a lot mainly because hes my favourite character in the game and is ungodly amounts of fun because he truly feels like an assassin. That doesnt mean I am biased, its a known fact that the longer you drag games out, the harder the game is for him to carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AfterTheFall","date":"2017-07-06T14:10:50.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol thats what his ult is supposed to do. Learn how to play against it. Thats the idea. Learn when to flash during his ult to mitigate the most damage. Buy zhonyas first item if playing AP. Zed is extremely vulnerable to hard & soft CC. If your team cant CC him, he will run roughshod over your whole team.

Nerfed to the pits, why not zed?\n\nBecause if you know how to play and itemize against him, he's not that hard to deal with. His q is easy as heck to dodge, his w is on a really long cooldown that you can punish him for, and you should never be hit with his e if you're playing right. The zed player has manage his w correctly, (which if he uses it to gapclose the target can just use some escape ability after his ult  and now he can't do anything to close the gap to hit e and q) and pay attention to where his shadows are and position himself so both q's hit the target to get more dmg so his ult won't be a light tickle.","replies":[{"poster":"Naching","date":"2017-07-06T14:20:46.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I play zed sometimes when free rotation and  i killed people so easy hahah and with teleport too, its not fair at all hahah\n\nI dont hate him, but if others champ less rewarded and harder needs nerfs everydays here ..zed too then.\n\nI didnt talk about yasuo  or riven...

ZED? He's the worst assassin. Statistically, and that's a fact. He literally has only gotten nerfs for the past few patches he has been in, excluding Lethality because that was a Stat Buff. Git Gud. \n\nAnd easy? EASY? LUL Zed is one of the most mechanically complex assassins in the game. His W has literally almost half a minute's CD, you need to hit all of your skillshots to successfully proc TLD, whereas Heimer can plop down a turret and shoot his rockets and autoproc it while he jacks off. Face it. Zed has been nerfed to the ground already, and whoever calls for further nerfs are shit at fighting a terrible champion. Yasuo and Riven are mechanically complex as well. They're easy to pick up, but you better learn to git gud if you wanna master them properly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2017-07-06T14:54:26.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Always someone from eu...","replies":[]}]}
