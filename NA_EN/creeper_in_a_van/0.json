To both of our surprise though, he had the Riot Kayle skin available to use. He has not purchased any RP/skins since he started playing, he never received a gift notification, we were not playing ARAM, and he was not playing when Riot gave everyone a free skin for good behavior. \r\n\r\nUltimately this is nothing to really be upset over, but it is a bit confusing and has me a bit jealous :P Has anyone else experienced this?","replies":[{"poster":"llamasx","date":"2015-06-03T23:20:31.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also something to check is Riot's good behavior gift from a while back, if you didn't meet certain conditions (have enough champs) I think Riot Kayle was one of the default give aways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NotDevan","date":"2015-06-03T22:20:20.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He didn't get a Riot Kayle code from an event and forget about it or something?
