I personally been feeling pretty burnt out from the game from changes and I'm just pointing out things that I disagree on and agree on with the state of the game.\n\nAs a player that has been around since the end of season 1, this game has changed.\nWell no *&amp;$%! Okay, You&#039;re not wrong, but... not just like a patch note every Tuesday.\nIt was not even too long ago I could sit down and play about 10 matches of this game without getting too bored, or too frustrated.\nIt just feels like every game is just so serious, it&#039;s so easy to become tilted and to be flamed each match, even before the match starts.\nEven playing with friends isn&#039;t fun anymore. We have the same champions, the same map, the same goal of the game everyday, every match.\nI know what you&#039;re saying, what about the &quot;rotating game modes&quot;? Hear me out.\nThese modes do feel fresh and are nice to come back to and play once and a while, but how often do you play, let&#039;s say, &quot;urf&quot;?\nAs Riot has explained, the game gets a huge spike of players when urf is available, then descending player count as the game mode rotates.\nBesides that, let&#039;s say your favorite game mode is ascension.\nYou&#039;ve played a few games, had some fun, games over. Repeat, repeat, repeat. You leveled up and opened your champion capsule to find an Ashe shard.\nDisenchant for 90 BE. Time goes by, the game mode is done. What now? \nThere&#039;s some issues I have with this. I... HATE. How riot decided to turn IP into BE, it makes no sense. I did some testing and played until I leveled up. I played 15 games until I leveled up including first win of the day. I earned a champion capsule and received an Evelynn shard.\nMost of the time I earn champion shards of characters I already own, or champion shards of characters I don&#039;t prefer to play.\nOkay, now comparing to the old currency system I would earn about 90-180+ IP. Do the simple math of multiplying the amount earned to the x number of matches played you will almost always get a higher number of IP currency compared to how earning BE is.\n\nTo rant about some other things, here we go.\nReporting toxic people doesn&#039;t seem to get them banned ever anymore, unless they are toxic on a stream and the streamer is friends with a riot member.\nMuting is a risk of important game knowledge of what&#039;s going on during the match or if they are calling a shot.\nThere are 100+ champions but it feels like I play against/with about the same 30-35 every game.\nWhen someone leaves/dc from the match and it goes on to a loss, the remaining players aren&#039;t compensated from loss or rewarded extra for winning a 4v5 if won.\nPeople are playing ranked games for &quot;fun&quot;, playing champions they are first time playing or under bad conditions of computer or time/environment.\nFun items have been deleted or reworked into boring garbage.\nI feel like there isn&#039;t enough runes, or enough runes to give power to under played champions to make them playable.\n^ You can only seem to play meta characters/team comps or you lose/flamed.\nNot enough events or rotations are coming out or take for ever to happen. We don&#039;t need missions only available from new skins coming out to champions with already 5-6+ skins. Some characters only have 1-2 skins still.\nThe game HEAVILY requires teamwork and cooperation, there being different types of people in this game, this can be hard to accomplish and if not done correctly, you lose pretty much every time.\nCool/fun summoner spells or situational summoner spells have been removed.\nWeird plants in the river and in jungle...\nI feel like the jungle is closed in and in a tight space, especially near baron and dragon and this is a really awkward place to teamfight a lot of the times.\nDeath timers are VERY long and 1 death can be the end of the game, heck old runes had -% time of death timers, this should say something.\nIf a game goes on too long gold feels really useless, not much more items to buy to make your self any better, while at the same time in the early game there&#039;s not enough gold for anything big, you&#039;re best buying some hp pots and just farming for 6 minutes to get 1 item.\nI also feel like jungler respawn timers are VERY long and the buffs don&#039;t last a long time, on top of that you can only get buffs from dragon, baron, blue and red/ scuttle. We need more variety.\nThe &quot;fill&quot; system that automatically fills people into roles they don&#039;t play/don&#039;t want is VERY stupid and VERY frustrating! Games are lost because of this! I would rather wait another 3-5 ,minutes than waste 30-50 minutes because someone or I didn&#039;t get the role I&#039;m good at/ being forced to dodge or deal with a troll that tried to make others dodge.\nThe elo system of allowing lets say, plat players play with gold&#039;s and diamonds is very controversial! These elo&#039;s are completely different with different people, different skill levels, different strategies, different about everything! People in gold should play with and against others in gold. Same for any other elo. This is a huge unbalance for everyone.\nThe pricing of skins seems unfair and rather ridiculous, especially chroma packs, like who the **** came up with that.\nMisuse of pinging, chat, in game interactions like /taunt or /laugh - going past the limit of in game &quot;banter&quot;.\nThe toxic community looking up to certain toxic people and even in some cases defending toxic people who were banned or perma banned.\nThis list goes on.. and on..\n\nPeople are quitting this game, most recently Nightblue3. Nightblue, if you are reading this, I don&#039;t blame you. This game isn&#039;t fun like it used to be, it&#039;s very repetitive and stressful. I go to people streaming like Dyrus, redmercy, gbay and honestly a lot of the time their facial expression says more than what the words they speak. They look stressed, exhausted, bored, pained and tired, can you blame them? On top of that all the social pressure they have to deal with being a streamer. The misuse of reddit, these fourms, report system, social media, things that shouldn&#039;t go viral go viral like wild fire. Besides that the trash talk fans have on Esports players. Anyone remember Dyrus leaving TSM? I balled my eyes out, I could feel his pain when ever a post about how &quot;bad&quot; he is or how he &quot;should be removed/replaced&quot;, people judging the crap out of him every move, like do we see you playing in pros? Didn&#039;t think so. I could feel his pain every time he was camped top or when the game was on his shoulders. I don&#039;t blame him for quitting the competitive scene, I respect him for that.\n\n\n\n\nBesides that, there are some good things I do have to say.\n\nI like the leveling system of going past level 30, I just hate how they went extra with it and changed BE with it too. Keep the IP, and keep the leveling system.\nReworks on champions and VGUs.\nNew game modes coming out, lore, champions, updates, information of runetarra has become easier to read and study.\nThe music, art work of certain champions and cinematics.\nNew rune system, old rune system was boring and quite expensive if you didn&#039;t play a lot.\nHonor system, especially honor system, one of the best things to happen in league.\nReplays of cool game moments, funny moments, glitches, inside jokes, etc.\nIn game tips, rework of tutorial, towers, minions, base, in game mechanics. ( to an extent.)\nThe PBE - client testing of new champions, abilities, anything. Also, I have been in the PBE before and the team is very nice and listen to all feedback.\nThe test client where you can spawn in targets, use teleport on any part of the map, infinite gold/xp. This was a very huge success and works well for people trying new things.\nThe positive side of the community is very reassuring, it&#039;s very nice to see someone who is genuine in saying good job or keeping the game together with positive communication.\nRiot teaming with colleges to take people in who are serious with going somewhere in their life with Esports/gaming, this is a big thumbs up.\nThe certain riot staff that have been there and done their job correctly and have showed maturity through harsh times.\nAdding ARAM/reworking twisted treeline.\nAdding rotating game modes/events/quests.\nBalance patches to bugs or things that are unfair. (unlike removing things that are fun.)\nThis list goes on for a little.\n\nIf you are read this all of this, I want to say thank you for your time and hopefully we can have something done to bring back players or just change a part of the game in general to make it feel like &quot;old&quot; league.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2018-03-25T22:45:42.367+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":5,"body":"What some people dont seem to realize is that, as you grow, you start to see what the game (or anything for that matter) is actually about. What you are saying isnt anything new, it has been with the game since it was release. You just dont see it because you are/were brand new to the game, or just didnt think of it at the time. \n\nOnce you start to learn more about the game, and put in more time/commitment. You start to see it for what it truly is. Its the same with a relationship. When you are first with someone, you let some things slide because you are in love and at the time it doesnt really bother you. Then once you start to see how these people actually are its going to start irritating you and when that happens you start to fall apart.\n\nThis is a fun game if you actually treat it as a game. Nowadays people treat it as a job/chores and to them it becomes mundane. People are only playing to improve, or to rank up, but then they forget to have fun. They get pissed off at the slightest things and because of that they become tilted. Not only that but people forget that like with everything else in life, you need to take things in moderation. People will play this game hours/days on end, and that is not healthy. I probably play maybe 3-5 games (depending on the game mode and if im playing with friends) on the weekends because of how burned out I got playing this game basically daily. I didnt want to ruin it as i have done with other games ive played in the past!","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-03-25T22:52:29.879+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":8,"body":"I really think this gets at the heart of the problem. There was *so much* wrong with this game back in the day, and you covered that pretty well.\n\nThis game is so big now, though, and it seems like it's gotten much more competitive as a result. As streamers quit, new ones will replace them. That's just the way it goes. Seeing some people step out doesn't concern me that much atm, but we'll see. There almost certainly *will* be an end point, somewhere down the road, but I think it's really difficult to pinpoint it on the front end.","replies":[{"poster":"Iręlía","date":"2018-03-25T22:54:48.061+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I genuinely don't want league to end.\n\nI don't think it ever even will.

Never take the word of exclusively boards players, because I've heard oppositions from ole LoL friends, feeling the exact opposite. \n\nAll I know, from my own example, is the game simply...wasn't fun any more. LoL became more of a job then a game, and i felt i'd be more stressed out after every match then i'd actually enjoy in it. Is LoL dying?

Look at how Baseball, Basketball, Football (American Football, for our non-American friends), and Soccer (Actual Football for our non-American friends) evolved over time. \n\nVery likely, back when they were first developed, they were nothing but a pass-time. You hit a ball with a stick, someone else tries to catch it and throw it back before the person hit makes it around a circle. Honestly sounds like something a couple of kids came up with in their back yard one day, took it to the park, and it only grew from there.\n\nBasketball is an even greater example, because *it's in the name*. It's called *basket*ball because you would literally throw a ball into a basket raised off of the ground. The bottom wasn't even cut out of it at first, only to be cut out later as more of \"quality-of-life\" improvement.\n\nAnd then Soccer (Football)......I mean, come on. You kick a ball around, eventually making it to one side of field, and kick it in to some made up goal. You could be 5 years old, and come up with that.\n\nIt's just, that over time, as these pass-time activities gained popularity, human nature started to step in. Humans love to compete with one another, we love being at the top. So....activities turned into competitions.........competitions turned into organized events...........organized events turned into fully fledged sports that people train for their entire lives to be the best at.\n\nOf course, you can still play these sports as pass-time activities, but you always have that voice saying \"You're no pro, why are you playing this?\" No matter how much you try to ignore the voice, it does drain the fun out of the sport, and it eventually devolves into very awkward moments, that eventually devolves into people just being mad and yelling at each other.\n\nLeague, and Esports in general, are following the exact same route. Some would say it's a good thing, others a bad thing. But because of this, League may never truly die, as long as Riot, or, hell, any other company continues to support it. That said, the NALCS is just now finishing up it's first split in a franchising model.......so I wouldn't be too surprised if an entirely separate company is made to solely support Professional League of Legends, and Esports in general, while Riot goes back to being solely a game company that just gets royalty checks from the Esports scene.\n\nI know that the idea of separating pro-play balance from solo-queue balance is normally frowned upon, but if Riot one day no longer becomes the sole company in charge of the LCS, than we may eventually see pro-play be a *VERY* different game than solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ðark Knight","date":"2018-03-28T20:59:12.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate your comparisons, very well put.

Example, Warwick has a 52.98% winrate and a 5.55% pickrate. This particular champions is snowballing lanes and just dominating the game. Riot doesn't nerf him for whatever reason, but has the nerve to nerf something else that doesn't need to be touched.\n\nAnother thing that really annoys me is the fact that new champions are put before older champions in every sense. Skins, kit updates, lore, artwork, and much more gets done on a new champion within six months of his/her release . . . . but Karma cannot get a single thing done on her other than a shield buff, for 5 years now. Ahri has been worked on for almost 3 patches now, but Lissandra cannot get a passive that helps her.

Of course, now there's the champ shard capsules, but now that I'm level 101, I'm really starting to feel the squeeze. It's taking longer and longer to level up. It cost too much to get champions. Like for instance, Lissandra, a 6300 BE champ. I have her shard making her cost just above 3k BE. I have a net total of 1k BE. How will i get my BE? I can't simply jump into a game and farm more BE. I need to wait 15 hours to get **_~~50 BE~~_**. This means 40 days or playing to get her. If champ rerolls were still a thing, this wouldn't have been such a problem, but it's not. Also, I'm pretty sure i missed out on quite a lot of good stuff on my way to get level 30, since the BE system wasn't implemented yet.

You will never recieve any advice or learn anything from the enemy players, so why have /all chat enabled?\nAnd as for the toxic teammates, well, a toxic person never wanted to be a team player, so naturally, they will not play like one.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/dpoula9d885.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2018-03-26T03:39:08.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the end of the video he explains that he was not playing for the wrong reasons and went back to it.\n\nJust saying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celiorap","date":"2018-03-26T02:42:31.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If youre gonna make long posts add a TLDR to it.\n\nAlso the reason theyre quitting in my opinion is because they have no impact on the game.

Let players play the game like it used to be over the years. Start with season 0 and work your way up to the most balanced patches of each season. \nOr maybe you better not do that. People might realize how shitty the game has become since then.\nAlso, could you please make ARAM true aram.

There was an entire show called \"My Strange Addiction\" where they just showcase oddball addictions people have. On top of that addiction and obsession are synonyms... People like to say obsession because it sounds like just some basement dweller who can't stop his vidja games. The two very often intertwine if they aren't used to replace each other in general dialog. \n\nLastly, no, I wasn't being defensive.
