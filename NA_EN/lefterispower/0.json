I now have a 30 minute ban from playing >.>. Try using the old client for now, on the login screen you have the option to choose \"use legacy client\" click that and it'll let you use the old client for now. I hope Riot leaves the option to use the old client as it functions a lot better on my computer, and I'm sure a lot of other players would rather use the old client too. Hope someone sees this comment...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChiefBvrcleaver","date":"2017-02-27T21:28:43.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe I'm experiencing a similar issue, I can log in and and go about the client normally but when I try to play I am greeted with a black screen at Champ Select.","replies":[]}]}
