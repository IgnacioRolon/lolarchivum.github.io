Then all of a sudden I get disconnected. I wait for about 4 minutes then I left the game. I could never get back in, I kept trying to access league over chrome. That failed. Over my phone too!! That failed. I went on my mobile carrier network to get on league. Guess what, THAT WORKED. I could see the league websitr over my mobile network!! My network was fine and steady nothing was going wrong. then as soon as I came back to the game in about 10 minutes, the match waa over and I was finally able to get back in. And now I got a leaverbuster for about 5 games and wait time is 20 min!!WTF! I have the recent game info to with all the players.

It cannot prevent you from accessing specific sites (it blocks all stable access to the internet), and doing it over LoL is **impossible**, since there is no way for other players to see your network address.\n\nYou probably have a crappy ISP, or experienced a glitch with your router/DNS, or an IP lease resetting, or any number of other common networking errors.","replies":[{"poster":"Aviatinq","date":"2016-08-17T23:40:05.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You could knock down the internet of anyone you play with in League.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-18T19:22:47.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Explain how you would go about doing that, i would love to hear the strange, magical explanation.
