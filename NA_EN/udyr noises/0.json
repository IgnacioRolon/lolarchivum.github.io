I get into game, but it's small and windowed, which are not my settings, and the graphics are all set to very low, which again aren't my settings. If i switch it to full screen on a higher resolution, it bugs and the minimap goes away, mouse isn't calibrated, etc. Bullshit ensues. Happens every time I load into a game. Can't seem to fix it even after uninstall/reinstalling client and initiating fix and letting it scan all my files. What gives?\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/MDipM\r\n\r\nPics on imgur above^^^^","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-17T17:51:10.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Putting in a ticket was a solid plan, our tech team can help out individually with this.
