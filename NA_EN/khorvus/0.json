It's still in testing so the chat may not be playing fast enough.  How is it for you on the legacy client?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nIf it's isolated to the test version, let our client developers know in the[ client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards, and thanks for testing!","replies":[]}]}
