(See picture above) We're working on a fix, but for now we have a workaround that will allow you to get rid of these giant Lego looking  blocks! \n\n1) Navigate to your League of Legends installation! (Normally - C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config)\n2) Right-click your game.cfg file, and click Edit.\n3) Find the Option that reads \"Colors=16\"\n4) Delete the 16 and replace it with 32. It should now show \"Colors=32\"\n5) Click File, then save.\n6) Restart League of Legends.\n\nIf you're still experiencing this issue after these steps, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can help you resolve this!","replies":[{"poster":"ÃŽnDeed","date":"2014-11-29T20:54:34.125+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way i fixed it was going into NVIDIA Control Panel and setting Anisotropic filtering and every Antialiasing to [OFF](http://i.imgur.com/fiNMPvQ.png). After that i gone back to game and the squares dissapear. Surpsrisingly after that i've clicked the [Restore](http://i.imgur.com/JLmMpIK.png) button to check wich of those options actually fixed the squares bug and when i gone ingame, the squares weren't there, even with all NVIDIA settings Restored to default (Note that after hitting Restore button the options gone back to [ON](http://i.imgur.com/J5oT0ay.png) and [Application Controled](http://i.imgur.com/J5oT0ay.png), so i am not exactly sure how the bug fixed by doing all that... good luck to all)","replies":[{"poster":"zulus","date":"2014-11-30T05:11:04.262+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"this worked for me also...\n\nand for everyone, in Nvidia control panel, under the tab Settings, it is \"Manage 3d Settings\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vaenivo","date":"2014-11-25T02:04:06.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get the red and blue block only when I mouse-over turrets/towers ...
