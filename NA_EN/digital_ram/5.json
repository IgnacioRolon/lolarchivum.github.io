Earlier today, we noticed reports of players disconnecting on NA. Our Network Engineers are currently investigating the cause of this issue and are working hard to resolve this. We currently don&#039;t have a timeline for when we expect this issue to be resolved. I will try to keep this thread updated as we get more information about this issue. For updates about the status of the server, please head over to the [Service Status Page](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na), which will contain the latest updates. \n\nThank you for your patience.","replies":[]}
