Since most of us use a router, all this does is reset the internal connection to the router, and rarely will DHCP even assign your computer a new IP address.  Since most of us aren't even having internet issues, only issues connecting to YOUR game server AND YOUR game server ONLY, this fix would do something only if the issue was a client bug/error somehow tied to your internal IP.  (Is it????)  \n\nHowever ,since restarting the client, resetting your router, and even re-booting your computer sometimes doesn't fix this issue, it nearly has to be a issue server side accepting the connections.  Since my ISP locks my external IP, I can't confirm anything on that side.  All I can do is endless try re-connecting to the server and hope it lets me in before the match ends and I get slapped with a \"LEAVE\", which is absolutely disgusting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"6eoff","date":"2014-12-22T06:56:30.841+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't work.\n\nSo what am I supposed to do here? Just not play until you guys finally figure this out? I mean, you say that it's been a problem since last Tuesday (According to your post on the server status page). I had it happen once before tonight, but I was able to get into the game just by closing and re-opening the game. Tonight I tried this, the reddit solution linked below, and everything else I could think of and just couldn't get into the game. It seems that my team understandably surrendered at 20 minutes and it says that I \"Left\" the game when in fact I did no such thing.\n\nSo even if you fix this, can we expect you to not tell us about it? It's adorable that you're trying to give us these solutions to bypass your mistakes rather than just fixing the errors themselves. And then when people complain that you didn't adequately inform them that this problem was happening you say \"Well we put this on the server status page\" when you should know that people don't go to the server status page really until AFTER they've experienced a problem. People, by default, assume that the servers are running and healthy. But perhaps approaching things as if the product will actually work or the support team will be competent isn't the right course of action for Riot or League of Legends.\n\nTruly sad.

This problem is beyond my control now and if i'm correct only you guys can fix this problem riot please, i really enjoy playing lol and i have spent almost $100 on skins and stuff, never have i spend this much money on any of my other games so please riot don't make me regret it because of some stupid bug that you haven't been able to fix, a problem that has being going on for more than 3 years i think, and all its doing is affecting more and more players, i mean com on there are more than 63 million players who play your game every month, who cares if a couple of hundreds are affected by this problem but what about a couple of thousands or maybe even hundreds of thousands and who knows maybe in a few years it will reach millions than what would you do riot ?????, are you just going to save the LCS players and leave the normal players to rot while you watch your game be consumed by your own bug, compare this issue to real life problems like diseases like Ebola, Cancer or AIDS some may be cured but what about the majority of those that don't ?????, there is something to think about. I know i'm exaggerating a lot but i'm not doing this because i'm addicted to lol i'm doing it because i care about this game and i care that it is successful and can encourage new players to join, and already players to enjoy it more. Well i'm already ban for five matches for 20 minutes because of this issue and i'm sure many others think is unfair to get ban for leaving a game you dint intended to leave, and might as well stop playing because if you keep leaving games in low priority ques you will just get ban for 7 days and who knows maybe more so riot please consider this unfairness of you, but lets say riot \"somehow\" forgive this players and promised to never ban them again when this crash happens, but think about this missing 5, 10, 20 mins maybe the hole game still is a very tragic time loss of advantage for your team and if you luckily manage to join late though you would only have a couple of minutes to play until surrender or defeat and where is the fun in that, (unless you were able to join early enough to catch up or your team was already doing really good without you or you are a pro player and you manage to carry your team even wile the enemy team is fed.) my point is stop trying to dodge a ball that's coming strait for your face riot and just fix this issue and if you cant then just tell us riot tells us how to fix it PROPERLY and PERMANENTLY so that no one ever again has this issue, stop trying to find shortcuts that may help some players but the majority including me is still suffering. Its been a long time since this issue has being going on and i have seen very little being done to fix it in such a long time, so i say the time is now to fix this problem not in a year not in 5 years NOW Riot, i'm fortunate enough to get a new laptop soon and maybe play again normally but those that cant will be left without any hopes. So please fix these problem before its too late or tell us how to fix it, slowly but surely this problem will affect players every day and one of these days it may affect YOU. \nThank you for your time in reading this :)  \n\nSincerely, Jarol99","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leagl Lolicon","date":"2015-03-30T06:29:53.922+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya and i was put in a lower q because of this and im still in a 20 min wait to play","replies":[]},{"poster":"M0useXx","date":"2014-12-22T16:18:53.312+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So because riots system has a bug I get put into a lower que?
