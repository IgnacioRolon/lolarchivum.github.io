Nothing specific seems to trigger it, and it doesn't kick me out of the champ select even though my client freezes/crashes. When reopening the client it needs to load for 30-60 seconds, which unless I've locked my champion usually kicks me out of champ select.\r\n\r\nAre there any known fixes for this kind of issue? My friend also gets the same error so I assumed it's not that rare and there would be a couple of threads on this but the only ones I've found don't offer any decisive solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-02T22:05:38.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this issue happen for players using a 32-bit version of Windows.
