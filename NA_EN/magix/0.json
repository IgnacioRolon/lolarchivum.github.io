Since patch 6.8-10 I experienced weird lag spikes. I'm using the same exact computer since seson 5 (I'm virtualizing with Hyper-V and this computer can handle games) without any lag issue.\n\nI have already reinstall everything, nothing is solved. My brother also plays battlefield 4 and everything is running at 60 fps high res and he don't lag.\n\nPlease Riot, I have been a long time casual players that like the game for almost 3 years now! One of the best PvP I've ever had with casual gamers. The community have been great in general so far! Every year is getting better but the lag spikes...\n\nI believe it might be coming from the game code itself with all the new changes.\n\nThe lags are significantly more happening with others players interactions.\n\nThere is a picture of my LOGS: https://i.imgsafe.org/f0274bf.png\n\nLove from the players and me Captain {{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-25T00:38:06.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game server issues should be pretty easy to determine as all players in the game would be experiencing the same issue.  If you're running into the issue where you're experience frequent lag, but other players in your games are not, it's a sign that there's problems in the connection between your network and our servers.\n\nAs a starting point, I'd recommend checking out our [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) article which contains solutions to the most common causes of connection errors.
