We are now transitioning from that optional notification to mandatory verification, which means you will need to have a verified email before you are able to continue playing the game.\n\nThe primary intention for this is to provide better account security as well as to unlock future functionality like multifactor authentication and automated account recovery.\n\nTo make sure the process is as smooth as possible, we will be rolling out mandatory verification for a test group of players in NA/EUW/EUNE while the remaining unverified players will continue to see the optional notification. Once we've confirmed the initial tests work, we will expand the test group until it becomes mandatory for all NA/EUW/EUNE players.\n\n> If you have issues preventing you from verifying, you can contact player support [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

They dont walk up to your PC and log in physically. All it does is inconvenience you. Unless your entire drive is encrypted (rip performance), it also does nothing to protect you from a physical invader who knows anything about computers.\n\nI have never gotten a virus, let alone been directly hacked. It is a side-effect of knowing how to develop software and understanding security. Aside from extremely rare serious exploits in software, it is impossible for a hacker to just walk into your system, let alone steal an account.\n\nAlmost all random account 'hacking' is either direct phishing, or phishing for things that reveal an account indirectly.

Many companies don't take security invasions seriously.  Even some companies that \"do\" take it seriously hire employees that ultimately don't care.  I used to work for one.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreaktastic","date":"2018-07-17T15:50:09.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get where you're coming from, but to be perfectly frank about it, most companies don't grant access to executives which would allow a breach if phished. Executives should never have access to servers, databases, etc. All of that should be under lock and key, with multiple failsafes, checks and balances, and procedures in place to safeguard users' data. All things considered, it wasn't the end users' faults their data was breached, it was Yahoo's. Even if an executive was phished, and that's to blame for the breach (which I haven't researched so I'm just taking your word on it). Gaining access to a corporate network should never also grant access to sensitive customer information. A lot of executives' egos get in the way of security, but at the end of the day they should not have any more access than the average employee.\n\nI totally agree that a lot of companies don't take it seriously. I've seen it first hand. I'm not a security expert but I often work very closely with them (and somehow found myself involved in 5+ last year) as my realm of expertise is all-encompassing. Most companies are only concerned with self preservation when it comes to breaches. Even the security companies who specialize in mitigation of existing breaches, when it comes down to it, do not care about the users or their information. They really only care about the $20k+ invoice they send to get started, and the subsequent ~$30k+ invoices they send every week thereafter. \n\nAnyway, coming back to the topic at hand, multifactor authentication is something every single company should be doing right now. It's one of the easiest methods to prevent human error/oversight, and multiple layers of service/website errors/oversights (pretty much every OSI layer), from resulting in a super easy breach. Even watching someone enter their password, with multifactor authentication, does not grant a person access. That's both incredibly simple in nature, and incredibly powerful in practice. Again, not infallible, but a very good step in the right direction.\n\nThe days of \"don't tell someone your password\" are gone. To think that the people out there with malicious intent are that incapable, incompetent, and unmotivated is a dire mistake. The industry has underestimated those people in the past, with extreme consequences. In 2018, it's probably about time we all admit that there are very intelligent people out there with the means, capability, knowledge, and motivation to steal information.\n\nAny security measures we can take are only a deterrent. At the end of the day, security measures are like an ADT sign on your lawn. If a person wants to break in, they will. However, the sign is very likely to cause them to go somewhere that doesn't have a sign. Most of the time, you just need to bring yourself out of the \"low hanging fruit\" category. However, at the end of the day, security is inherently a step behind the people with malicious intent. It has to be, by nature. Security is simply employing counter-measures for known threats.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSorry for the long winded rant.

It&#x27;s my favorite.\n> \n> Let me introduce you to 2018. Yahoo was hacked, 3 billion accounts&#x27; info was leaked. PSN was hacked, 77 million accounts&#x27; info was leaked. Equifax was hacked, 143 million people&#x27;s sensitive information was leaked. I could continue, but these three examples make fantastic points alone. Also, you only ever know about a small portion of breaches. The ones that can be kept quiet, are. I&#x27;ve seen loads of them which were never reported.\n> \n> Let me now explain to you how not even having a password associated can lead to your being hacked.\n> \n> This information was inevitably sold. Then, it was likely re-sold several times over. What happens is small interest groups pay a small amount per account/person for the data. Something like a Yahoo account, for example, grants a person access to virtually everything. If a person has access to an email account, they don&#x27;t even need to know other passwords, they simply reset passwords. Bingo, instant access to any account with that email as a recovery email.\n> \n> In the case of the Equifax breach, a malicious group would use that data to reset passwords without a recovery email or password of any sort. Secret questions, for example, would be attempted with the hacked information. When you know incredibly sensitive information (like Equifax has on people), the limits are only theoretical. Consider the fact that they could call tech support (for ANY company) and with your address, social security number, etc., could easily gain access or cause unfathomable damage. They could get a mortgage in your name and have the bill sent to you -- to believe they couldn&#x27;t gain access to a gaming account is so incredibly foolish!\n> \n> Now, we only heard about these breaches LONG after they were performed. By the time people heard about them, a large amount of damage was already done. Essentially, a good portion of what the malicious parties intended, had already happened. \n> \n> Wake up. If you seriously just posted the garbage you did, you&#x27;re no security expert. Multifactor authentication is absolutely not infallible, but is a great step in the direction of general security. Anyone with half a clue on security knows that only a tiny fraction of account hijackings are a person actually giving someone else their password. A good portion of them are actually due to the security being sub-par on whatever service a person holds an account with. \n> \n> A prime example is bruting a password reset form -- they generate hashes until they get a real one. From there, they&#x27;ve gained access to an account, without ever knowing the password, email, or any other information. That happens EXTREMELY frequently, and is no fault of the end user. The service/website is 100% to blame for not employing something to detect brute force attempts on password reset hashes (if they&#x27;re using them), not using multiple hashes (or hashes with salts), not requiring some sort of GUID in addition to a hash, etc. Some services still use MD5 hashes ffs! \n> \n> Bottom line is, you&#x27;re only as safe as the services holding your precious information. That is 100% out of the end-users&#x27; control. Any thought otherwise is foolish and incredibly naive.\n\nI am well aware of all of that, but it has absolutely nothing to do with security on the user-end, as you specifically pointed out.\n\n> > I absolutely LOVE seeing buffoons without a clue try and act smart, superior, and tech-savvy\n\nSo do i.

Creating a new account after getting banned is super easy. Phone numbers are a way to help mitigate this. It's either that, or entering a credit card number to play (or something similar).
