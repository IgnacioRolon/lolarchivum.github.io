Recently Riots reworks have felt like they removed the character entirely and replace them with different character. Yorick and Warwick reworks were fantastic. For example, what made Yorick fun to play was the ghouls. The fact that Riot kept the ghouls but added counterplay shows that they understood what made Yorick, Yorick. Since Galio it feels like Rito just said \"fuck it no one plays them, lets just not care.\" I don't think incorperating vague similarities are the same as keeping aspects of the champ in tact. Galio's mr scaling is not the same as getting ap for mr. Urgot having targeting is basically non existent. This post is focusing on how they play and not anything on lcs. The most important thing to a game is the fun to the playerbase, I am discussing this from that perspective.\n\nGalio was a mage who scaled with MR. His Q was a damage spell and his e was too. His ultimate was an amazing and fun nunulike ult with a taunt. They removed his ult and put it on his resistance but it is not the same. They removed the flat ap for mr and replaced it something barely similar. Galio is not the same feel and plays entirely differently. Even going ap mid is not the same. I feel as annoyed as I do with urgot even though I dont have much to say.\n\nUrgot is worse. Urgot has the problem is that he was a ad caster while also being a fighter. The main fun aspect of him was his ad caster. Spamming his q like a mage was fun and what made him interesting to me. His ult was funny and interesting but i understand why it doesnt work for him. There are no ad ability focus characters that is played like a mage. His old targeting system feels nothing like his new targeting system, in fact his new system doesnt even feel like targeting. Since his old q was his main damage tool and was blocked by minions, the targeting the e provided made you bypass the minions and gave it extra range. It felt like a targeting system. Since his w now is an auto attack base spell and he is wants to be on top of them, it feels like he is just auto attacking and not targeting. The lack of range and the fact that there is not visible change in the spells pre and post target, makes it feel like the targeting was just removed. They just made him a generic juggernaut that focuses on autos, which to me old urgot focused on least.\n\nEve I can not comment on because i never played old ev that much. The spikes feel similar enough and the passive now has counterplay early game. This one feels right.\n\nSwain is not as horrible as urgot but it just doesn't feel right. Old Swain focused on using his free df passive to get the most out of his q. His focus on Lightning is not the same as his focus on his tether. His cc turned from an aoe root to a weird passthrough single root. The free mana is sad for me to see gone. The only thing that feels the same is his ult. It is fun but it is similar enough that I am not as annoyed.\n\nI disliked old irelia for being one of the most annoying champs to fight so I never picked her up.\n\nAatrox is on the same level as Urgot when it comes to removing a champ and replacing them with someone new. Aatrox was a fun and weird champ with a unique skillshot, a three hit passive that shifts its purpose on a triggered ability and a cool dash/knockup. The attackrange increase on his ult was extremely interesting. His heal was cool because it only activated after three hits while also risking damage. His q being a decreasing hitbox was fun and the only spell like it. His ult only getting the revive when his bloodwell was full was an interesting way to balance a free ga. His e dash was more interesting. It felt like it had some weight to it and some dedication, the knock up on the end made it feel rewarding to go in. His rework changed everything from his playstyle to how his attributes worked. His new playstyle is focused on stacking his q instead of autoing. His Heal is now just a free deaths dance with no interesting gimmick to make it interesting. His knockup is now on his q and not tied to his cool dash. His dash is now just a little kalista dash. Having a repeating aoe spell is not as interesting. It feels entirely different to play.\n\nKayle feels the same late game but weird early.\n\n~~Morde is not out yet but the videos show that he is not the same at all. His q is not a powerful feeling three hit auto. generic spell. His shield managing is not longer the mechanic but just a normal shield. his Ghost, the most unique part of his kit is gone. I love his new ult is amazing. I loved old poppy ult and sending people to the shadowrealm is rad as hell but why did they decide to replace it? I will probably love new morde but it is not the same.~~\n\nReworks that feel the same are possible. Yorick and Warwick are fantastic reworks that kept the most important aspects of the character in tact. The focus on making a new character instead of a true rework is a blemish on a great game like this. I am not advocating for Unworks only, a new 3rd rework for most of these champs can be made to align them with how the old ones played. I tried to not sound whinny here but I am working with emotions on this.\n\nEdit: from what yall are saying about morde I can see I was wrong. The revert nature of it is honorable of riot. I am glad they did it now.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-06-02T05:06:28.210+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":7,"body":"Simple answer: because they are often so outdated that the way they play doesn't fit in the game.

Do you think I give a shit that Volibear and Fiddlesticks are getting reworked? No, the only people who do are Voli and Fiddle players, be they dedicated OTPs or people who play them every now and then. \n\nAnd no, that shit will not fly. Champions are reworked for a reason, and as someone who played old!Poppy her old passive and ult at bare minimum needed to either go or be heavily retooled. What they _didn't_ need to do is take Poppy, one of the few melee hypercarries in the game, and turn her into a generic lane bully CC tank. Which is what they did. And now Mordekaiser is getting a healthier variation on her old ultimate which she could have gotten.

Something as fundamental as her basic function, going from carry to tank?\n\nYou people can't think with any nuance, you read my posts and think I'm saying old Poppy was healthier or even more fun than new Poppy or some shit, when what I'm actually saying is that regardless of old kit health and fun versus new kit health and fun, the old Poppy had the BASIC IDENTITY of a late game carry, and new Poppy's BASIC IDENTITY is that of a lane bully tank, and this is wrong.\n\n> I can level with you on them adding in mechanics that are similar to existing ones, but better, though.

Do you think that the extra damage she did to her ult target was there for fun? \n\nHence why new Mordekaiser's is HEALTHIER, because it singles out one person for him to fuck up and makes it so people can't stop him, but doesn't let him kill the entire enemy team by making him immune to everyone else.\n\n> Plus, at the time of Poppy's rework they didn't have the means to make an ult like Mord's.

The examples you're trying to use don't fit the claim you're trying to make, so I adjusted it to what they're actually examples of. \n\nYou can fool yourself into thinking Riot makes decisions that take months of work based on memes, but that's not how it works.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2019-06-02T15:32:37.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do hope they bring back his Current Ult one day.

Irelia, Akali, and Aatrox are the 3 largest offenders of this, and while Irelia has been for the large part toned down to an adjustable level, Aatrox and especially Akali have been facing huge issues in discrepancies between skill levels. Akali's kit has so much in it that she just isn't weaker or stronger at any point in the game, making Riot have to nerf her entire presence. Then comes her actual mechanics, which also made Riot nerf her so that she wasn't overbearing in pro play.\n\nNewer champions that are examples of this include that whole Zoe to Sylas saga. Neeko and Yuumi are perfectly fine examples of champions that have modern kits, but are generally fun to play and don't require extremely high levels of skill. Sylas and Zoe are perfect examples of what not to do.","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2019-06-02T15:31:28.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zoe only does like one new thing though?","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-06-02T18:40:38.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"redirecting skill shot.\nSkill shot extra range through walls \nSkill shot lingers on battle field after missing waiting for people walk into it.\nblink to place and back to spot\nsteals summoner spells with massive damage after use.\n\nI wouldnt call neeko okay massive damage tells you its less if you can get out of the q but the q itself is a massive slow.

Her E is difficult to land if your opponent knows what Neeko's kit is, and her ultimate is also just as hard to land until a hectic fight lategame.\n\nHer Passive is near worthless in most situations aside from baiting. Her W passive is her real passive, and the active on that one is much less useful now that the instant skillshot absorber bug was patched.\n\nSylas has 1 directional dash and 2 dashes to a target, while his E and W have shielding or healing.

Honestly I have no idea why they even bothered to make that her ultimate. A squishy mage that has 0.5 second stealth should not be running into the middle, so Riot decided to add a shield on and call it a day.\n\nIt's not overloaded, it's just necessary. Her Slow is also necessary, I'm guessing after playtesting they realized her ult was dogshit to anyone who can look at a screen.\n\nAs for her W passive for every 3rd hit, at first I disliked its movement speed it granted, but I realized that that's where Riot decided to put her \"actual\" passive. Not to mention that if they removed it they would have to add something else to her W like faster cd's, which is a bad choice thanks to the minimal stealth they gave.\n\nNeeko got the short end of the stick because most of the mechanics she has are bandaids to make up for the utter lacking of a useful ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-06-04T02:28:31.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other mages who need to get in close are forced to buy HP items.
