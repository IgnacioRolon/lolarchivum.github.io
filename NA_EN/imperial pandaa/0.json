Needless to say I didn't do anything of the sort. I haven't clicked the link in the e-mail either due to being so unsure if it is a legit email from Riot or not. If this is the wrong section I am sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-19T16:39:09.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's weird!  I looked into this for you and don't see that it's something we submitted.  This would be a good time to run through the account protection guide to secure your info inside and out of league, in case an unauthorized user tried to gain access to your account.  I suggest resetting your password for both your email and account.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-05-19T17:01:25.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Ip7bnRrY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-19T16:39:09.364+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s weird!

I was just somewhat afraid to do so currently. The account is pandaskinben . I sent in a support ticket, but I was just more curious if that email was legit before I went through the process of changing everything. No point in using the link if it takes me to somewhere bogus.
