I ban him even if my teammates have him selected. I will NOT play a game with Yasuo in it, I just wont. He's not fun to play with or against. His wall mechanic makes him a 100% ban for me, I simply will not play against it.\n\nIt's not that he can't be beaten, it's just so unfair as an ability and I refuse to play around it. Most yasuo's are bad, especially when they're on my team for whatever reason, so I decided I will ban him when I get to ban, ask for him to be banned if not, and quit if neither team bans him if he get's picked.\n\nI WON'T PLAY AGAINST YASUO.\nPERIOD.\n\nThere are many other people just like me, so there is no point in defending him. He could have all of his abilities nerfed, and I would still 100% ban him. Remove the wall from his kit, or he will continue to be removed from every game  I play in. \n/end rant","replies":[{"poster":"VasilisGreen","date":"2016-11-03T20:03:20.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Keyboard warrior\" lmao\nI didn't even say that i'd beat you up, i couldn't care less.
