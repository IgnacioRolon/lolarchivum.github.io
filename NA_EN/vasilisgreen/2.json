Not exeptional, not by a longshot. I&#039;d say decent. Well.. i played some games since the patch came out... and...\n\nI &#039;ve never felt so shitty for playing my favourite champion. i legitimately felt bad for winning, i was disgusted with myself. I felt like i had an unfair advantage over them.... Like, what is this...\n\nRiot, please... Reconsider...\n\nI will admit, i finally felt like an assassin once more since the last whisper change but.. that.. it&#039;s too much... It&#039;s ok to oneshot squishy mids or marksmen or some top lane champions like fiora, top yasuo, tryndamere, that are also squishy... but oneshoting a shyvana with 4k HP at 30 mins??? that is ridiculous. that never happened even with the old last whisper... At least back then i oneshoted the people i was supposed to oneshot... So, before i see zed permabanned and nerfed to the ground... change it&#039;s passive and make it a %armor pen for all armor, about 30%, less than the old last whisper but just as much as the cleaver&#039;s shred at max stacks. This way, assassins can kill carries and squishies even in late game, as they are meant to but they will not delete tanks as well. Tanks are meant to soak up damage, not be instakilled. 30% is enough so that combined with the massive flat values, you will do the damage you should do to squishies and also you will not delete tanks because you are not meant to, since 30% is not  enough to take out a tank that stacks armor. Also, make it melee only so that the op new marksmen can&#039;t use it.\n\nThis new item is completely unfair to play against.\n\nSincerely, a Zed main.\n\nEDIT: Since third party sites like op.gg do not display the item on my builds and because someone here whom i will not name, accuses me of lying about even building it, here is my match history from Leage's site itself http://matchhistory.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/EUN1/205394817","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-02-10T09:24:54.065+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":21,"body":"But now you finally have a way to deal with his extreme energy problems m8","replies":[{"poster":"VasilisGreen","date":"2016-02-10T09:30:32.126+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":1,"body":"exploiting an unfair broken mechanic or item to make up for your lack of skill isn't healthy and proper gameplay....No....

Let's take a vayne... vayne has 76 base armor. let's add 9 flat armor seals to get it ti 85. So, vayne has 85 armor. With the old last whisper and the old masteries, you had 39% total armor pen. with my runes and items, i had 39 flat armor pen, 19 in runes and 20 from the youmu's. So. Vayne would have an effective armor value of about 12.85 and that is a value low enough that allows an assassin to do what he is meant to do, effectively it is a 12% damage reduction. With the old black cleaver that was made out of brutalizer, you would do true damage to her but that doesn't exist anymore. Now, we go to a tank. let's say Darius. Darius has 97 base armor at lvl18 and a common build involves a lot of armor. A deadman's plate, a randuin's omen or a sunfire's cape, a thornmail. something along those lines. And also, scaling armor runes. So, let's sat you have a total of 260 armor, a value easy to get with his insanely high base value. Now, with the old last whisper and the runes and youmu's, his effective armor would be 119. This is a 55% damage reduction. Now, 55% damage reduction is a lot of damage taken away, isn't it? That alone was enough for everyone to understand that you would not kill that darius easily no matter how hard you tried, especialy with all his healing and damage...  Now, let's see the difference between a squishy, in our example Vayne, and our tank, Darius for this instance.  The old last whisper and masteries from season 5 combined with runes and  items, allowed you to assassinate that vayne but was not strong enough to kill darius in a one on one duel. Now, with the changes to last whisper, your assassination potential is eliminated once your targets get to high levels. With their bonus armor being relatively high and  their bonus armor being none existent, last whisper is a complete waste of gold. So, now, what do we do? we get black cleaver. Now, do not get me wrong, the black cleaver has amazing stats, but not for an assassin. Why is that? Because the % all armor shred, (it effectively functions just like armor pen since the other stat you have now is just flat armor pen) from the cleaver needs to be stacked little by little. Stacking it up means taking time and an assassin's worst enemy is time. Time is precious to an assassin more than any other class, you need to go in, take out their carry fast and either get out or die in the proccess. Whatever the end for you, the target must be eliminated fast. So, since you do not have access to that armor shred from the beginning, your damage will not be high enough and nowhere near reliable, especialy if you need to go past the whole enemy team to get to your target. So,  for your first attack, this vayne, drave, graves, corki or whatever, will have enough armor up to cut your damage considerably, enough so that you will fail in killing them if they know what to do, you can't do your job and outplaying them is not really an option, you will survive but you will not get the job done and they will heal up from their lifesteal.\n\nSo, % all armor pen is important, and in my suggestion, it is only 30% not 35 as the old verion was and without the old masteries that made the 35 be a 39, it will instead remain 30%. Combined with your good amount of flat armor pen, it will do your job beautifully and the % pen will be low enough that you can't shred tanks to pieces.\n\nThat's my reasoning behind all this. It is helthier, it feels right and it is viable. You will be a considerable threat throughout the whole game, not just early and you will also do some good damage to the tanks when you need to finish them off after your carries and your tanks have softened them up for you and after you have taken out the enemy carry threats.\n\nAt this point, it will actualy depend on how good you are with it. You have the right tools and it's up to you on how you will utilize them.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaFifer19","date":"2016-02-11T05:44:49.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy hell dude, formatting.

It&#039;s ok to oneshot squishy mids or marksmen or some top lane champions like fiora, top yasuo, tryndamere, that are also squishy... but oneshoting a shyvana with 4k HP at 30 mins??? that is ridiculous. that never happened even with the old last whisper... At least back then i oneshoted the people i was supposed to oneshot... So, before i see zed permabanned and nerfed to the ground... change it&#039;s passive and make it a %armor pen for all armor, about 30%, less than the old last whisper but just as much as the cleaver&#039;s shred at max stacks. This way, assassins can kill carries and squishies even in late game, as they are meant to but they will not delete tanks as well. Tanks are meant to soak up damage, not be instakilled. 30% is enough so that combined with the massive flat values, you will do the damage you should do to squishies and also you will not delete tanks because you are not meant to, since 30% is not  enough to take out a tank that stacks armor. Also, make it melee only so that the op new marksmen can&#039;t use it.\n> \n> This new item is completely unfair to play against.\n> \n> Sincerely, a Zed main.\n\nLink the Shyvana game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laisenberg","date":"2016-02-10T17:55:23.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are disgusting, a zed main","replies":[]}]}
