In my last Aram game, i was playing poppy, everything was in slow motion, litteraly... I don't know how, or why.\nLater, i played a game, as Zed, and at first, when we got in, everyone was invisible, the only thing i could see were my idle particles. I close the game and relog... I spent 2 mins in the loading screen, waiting at 100% with your new loading indicator spinning... I shut down the client completly and relog. Then finaly got to play the game, or so i thought.... I could only move, there were no units but only champions and i couldn't cast ANY spells, only move around. I exit again and reload... And then, finaly, after 6  mins or so, i get to normaly play the rest of the game.... Riot... what is this? My ping was at 77-89 the whole time...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T22:01:07.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having some problems staying connected to the game, so it can't transmit information happening.
