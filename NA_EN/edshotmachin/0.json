To me this implies that Riot is intentionally blocking us from swapping to languages of the 3rd party servers that they don't control, AKA Garena and Korean servers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EdshotMachin","date":"2017-04-16T10:40:07.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the old launcher you could play on korean language .
