Or AP alistar support with maxed out MS to catch Squishies.  Or super scalable armor malphite or tank Fizz xD where I felt so awesome late game cause ADCs would KNOW that I stacked armor lol. \n\nAnyways enough of my addicted times. This isn&#039;t a hate on  the runes but actually a thank you to Rito. By simplifying the runes to become one with masteries I no longer have to spend time thinking about custom builds for a specific champ. I can now use the Meta runes you want me to use so I can quickly play a game without thinking*. Winning or losing is Way faster now like 10-15 min, giving you time to prep a healthy meal, exercise, and perhaps come back to the game later or hang out with friends. \n\nWith that said I no longer feel this obligation to play that much anymore (doesn't feel like work) as I can just go in casually now cause it doesn&#039;t feel as competitive, strategic  or customizable.\n\n I found myself playing less and less since the release. I don&#039;t know what you guys did but now I spend that time I used for theory crafting playing new games and just exploring life. \n\nLeague used to take up 70% of my life but now it&#039;s like 5%!!! (My asian parents will be proud since I have control over my life not league). I simply don&#039;t get that crave or urge anymore mainly from the variety of ways to tune a champion to your very own unique playstyle that made me come home from work and play. \n\n\nSorry if the post came off as confusing and neutral.

You got everything wrong, the game is still massively competitive and all that. But there are still many people cloud to Lol, cause it is their job or it is for the LCS. The reason Lol is popular is that it is competitive, strategic and customizable.\n\nHere is why,\nCompetitive:\nNow that Assassins are strong again (I mean to the level of one shooting people like they are supposed too.), the game has gotten much more competitive. Strong ADC's can now be assassinated by skilled assassin players. Because the ADC is the damage to most teams, so if the ADC out it can cause havoc in team fights if utilized correctly. WIth the old runes, ADC's where way to strong unless if you could surprise one shoot them, which was never possible.\n\nStrategic:\nOh boy, now with the new runes it is finally about skill and not about who ran with a Faker rune and mastery page. Uh, the old system was horrible, two damage masteries where useful, Thunderlord or Fervor of Battle, for supports, if you did not run with the \", forgot the name of the mastery\" you were basically trolling. Everything else was either too weak or never useful for anything really. Unless if we talk about the Resolve tree then, yeah, all three were useful. With the new Runes, you can try to throw off your opponent with building a marksman bruiser, with the resolved tree and go precision or domination, or the other way around. Try Lux with Sorcery and Resolve its fun and works quite well.\n\nCustomizable:\nJust like I said in the strategic. It is way more customizable now.\n\nDude, the reason you are leaving the game is that your not the competitive type. You like to have fun, and now with the new runes your having more fun with your friends. Because you can be customizable, without having to be competitive or super strategic. This new system works for competitive and non-competitive players, and I love it. Because if I had a stressful day I can sit down and play a draft game without having to try hard. (Because most people do not try hard in a draft game. But that depends on game to game.) When I want to be competitive I can now show off my skill with my champion and how I use the runes.\nThe old system was about how good you were with the masteries and runes, now it is about how you play your champion and what type of playstyle you have.\n\nYou want to play one shoot assassin, you can.\nWant to play a busier assassin, you can.\nTank marksman, you can.\n\nTrust me, I play for competition and for fun. I want to try and get into a pro team and win the championship, but when I finally get my OBS to work I want to play for fun with you all.\n\nRiot took the correct turn with the Runes. And to be honest not all games go 15 - 20 minutes, that is if the enemy or your team are garbage. Most games I play, last for 25 - 40 minutes. And I love them long. Truth be told, I hate finishing a game in 15 minutes.\n\nBut that is different form person to person. ;)\n\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-11-20T03:33:00.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Strategic:\n> Oh boy, now with the new runes it is finally about skill and not about who ran with a Faker rune and mastery page.\n\nYou really don't understand what strategy is do you? \nStrategy is about find and exploiting weaknesses of your opponents, it's not about \"skill\" of with the conventional choices (that's call expertise).\nThe most strategic people are those who are often branded as \"trolls\", and other terms, which actually push innovation which are being stifled because people are more heavily discouraged from playing outside of convention.\n\nThe most strategically minded people are the ones who do things like Play zero kill ascension.

Maybe you thought which runepages you wanted casue you were limited to 20. Or which ruens you want to buy next for diffrent playstyles.

Ofc you can do it but actualy you can  now try so much diffrent thigns in runes and still be able to win games. Even in High Elo, not just running the listed Pages or things like \"crit dmg, -%death tim, etc\" in bronze-dia.\n\nThe thing is: You just have to think now even more about it. Maybe thats it, you don't think automaticaly about the actual runes and play less.  It is no longe about just Numbers like damage, Tankyness, cdr etc. Its realy about Utility. Do i want the Damage, the Movementspeed from Phase Rush, the Slow from the Inspiration Tree, the Gold from the Inspiration tree on champ x. The whole Inspiration Tree could be theorycrafted on every champion. Even things like Press the Attack adc Soraka with spellvamp from the Domination Tree and geting real attackspeed from Prescision.

Unless you were trying to go an off-meta build you would take the same or almost the same exact runes and masteries every single game on most champions. \n\nAlso, we have plenty of scaling runes. Legend scales with takedowns, same for the Hunter runes, Gathering Storm scales as the game goes up, Eyeball collectively boosts your damage as you gain assists, ward kills, and kills, Ultimate Hat reduces your ult cooldown with use, Transcendence grants you 10% cdr after ten minutes, Conditioning gives you armor and mr after ten minutes, Overgrowth increases your HP with how much farm you have, and Magical Footwear hands you some free boots after ten minutes too. \n\nThere are tons of runes that scale into the mid to late-game, and you're ignoring them; the most notable being Gathering Storm and Overgrowth.","replies":[{"poster":"BLÖWJOBS","date":"2017-11-19T02:58:54.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cool","replies":[{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-11-19T03:12:22.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Isn't it cool how wrong OP is about scaling runes?
