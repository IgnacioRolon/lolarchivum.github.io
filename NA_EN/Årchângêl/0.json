I was able to get onto Leagueoflegends.com to change my password as the account in my browser  was still logged on. \r\n\r\nThe odd thing about this issue is it says that the region is switched, but on op.gg it still says my regioon is North America as well as on the main 'Na.leagueoflegends.com' website. \r\n\r\nI submitted a ticket about recovering my account, but I'm just curious what is going to show up for them when switching regions back(?). This is a first for me, so I'm just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMoneypkers","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T18:55:01.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll have the resources to help us with determining what happened, so don't worry!
