Think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nWhile I have no idea what you were punished for, unless people have the same behavioral history as yourself, it is unlikely they'll get punished in the same game as you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cind3rkick","date":"2019-07-17T00:43:28.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Logs or it was deserved :)\n\nNot posting logs shows you are hiding something","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatGuyFTP","date":"2019-07-17T04:59:37.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Okay: Here's the logs\nIt doesn't show what they said, but, if you pay attention to the context, you'll notice I only said anything in response to them\nReading my original post gives you an idea of what they said, and you can match it up to my responses\n\nYes, I got tilted.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ThatGuyFTP,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KAGeBPfc,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-07-17T04:59:37.632+0000)\n>\n> Yes, I wasn't very kind, but, they were infinitely worse\n\nHmm, it looks like you broke the rules here. What's that you say? Your teammate or opponent did or said something even worse? Definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-07-17T11:54:25.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, a manual review wpuld probably issue a punishment still.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2019-07-17T11:21:27.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"True, you probably should have been 14 day suspended.

Just like in most establishments if multiple people are acting up then they all get in trouble.\n2) You don't know which of them reported you or even if they got off Scott free. Everyone's punishment level is different, with yours being at the point where a punishment was in order.\n3) You don't have to use swear words to be toxic, and there have been valid punishments where the punished used no swear words.\n4) It only takes 1 report to flag a game for review, and the game is thrown out if nothing of guilt is found.
