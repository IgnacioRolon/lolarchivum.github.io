Everytime I get in queue or I have to wait for a moment and start doing something outside the client it just disconnects, however I dont get the usual red disconnect notification. It looks like as soon as I leave to do something else it just can't refresh all the new data, I have gotten about an half our in penalties already......\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas what might cause this problem, I dont have it with other games besides LoL","replies":[{"poster":"DrDDO","date":"2016-08-12T19:01:32.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried the connection issues, unfortunatly it did not work. My brother started playing league as well on an older laptop on the same network, however he doesn't have the problems. so I doubt it is the network. Also the problems seem to be getting worse because I cant join any game anymore without the server disconnecting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T15:48:05.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you enter the queue and accept a match, the server gathers everyone in your group and moves them all together.  It sounds like your network is having trouble maintaining a stable connection, causing you to get left behind or outright disconnected.
