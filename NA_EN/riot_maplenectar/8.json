Thanks for keeping this productive :) lots of great ideas coming in, and a fair amount that overlap with some tuff were already talking about which is great to see! Also some cool unique ideas that I haven't seen before so keep em coming! \n\nAbout a month ago I replied to a post stating that we don’t always pivot to requests/demands that come up on social media since it can be pretty disruptive to \nour usual development plans. While I still stand by that, I thought there might a productive way that we could work together with you guys, our players, to continue \nmaking League the best game it can be now and into the future. You’re just as passionate about League as we are, so \ndeliberately tapping into that more than we currently are could help surface some really killer ideas. We’re starting to hammer \nout our roadmaps for the next year, and while I can’t promise we’ll be able to get around to anything that comes up in this \nthread, it’d be awesome to actually plan for some of the cool ideas you guys have if they seem realistic for us to do, are impactful \nfor players, and don't overlap too substantially with some of our other plans. Squeezing ideas in randomly \nthroughout the year when we run into them on social media is great, but going about it deliberately may help us be more consistent with \ngetting around to more of them.\n\nNow, to put a little structure in place, I want you guys to think of \nthis as though you ran into Tryndamere on an elevator somewhere and needed to quickly sell him on your idea and why \nit’s one of the best things we can make for players. Pretend you only have 30-45 seconds to do it, so be concise, be convincing, \nand think about each word you use!\n\nDisclaimer: While my primary day to \nday focus is around actual gameplay, feel free to make suggestions for anything League related - just know that ideas will \nget a highly variable amount of scrutiny from members on different teams internally. I’m also not creating this to be the next \nmeme machine - it should just be a fun, organic way for the community so show what ideas they have to make League great!\n\n\nNow...how to structure your pitch for us and other players to see!\n\n\n**Feature/Suggestion Name:**\n_If you were to tell someone the \nname of your idea, what would it be?_\n\n**Opportunity/Problem \nStatement:**\n_What problem are you trying to solve? 1-3 sentences_\n\n\n**Brief Description:**\n_Describe your idea in 1-3 sentences._\n\n\n**Target Audience:**\n_Who cares about this? Ranked \nplayers? New Players? LCS viewers? Everyone?_\n\n**Mockups/Screenshots:**\n\n_If your pitch requires something visual to get the point across._ \n\n\nSince few of you have probably done something like this before, if you're stuck feel free to use \nmy example at the bottom of this post as a reference point! It's below the next section around guidelines and expectation\n\n\n**Guidelines/ Expectation Setting:\n1. Once again, there’s no \nguarantee we’ll do any of these, but if there’s something that comes up that seems really really cool, I’d \nbe surprised if we didn’t find a way to make it happen in 2018 and beyond!\n2. We may end up implementing \nsomething that has no upvotes, but pass on the three most popular ideas - but ideas with a lot of upvotes by nature will probably \nget more visibility/discussion\n3. If you like someone’s idea - please just upvote it as opposed to replying with a +1, or \nreplying with suggestions for how they should change their idea - I want to keep this as focused as possible.\n\n4. Don’t spam post your idea multiple times to drown out others.\n\n5. Please don’t troll with your posts, I want this to be a fun idea generator and will probably \nlook to get troll posts removed\n6. Balance opinions are off the table - Telling us to delete Teemo or to gut Twitch are not ideas and \nwill not be actioned on.\n7. Champ rework requests also not applicable **\n\n**EXAMPLE IDEA PITCH:**\n\n**Feature/Suggestion Name:**\nEnemy Vision Here Ping\n\n**Opportunity/Problem Statement:**\nAs a jungler I constantly find myself walking through a bush on my way to gank a lane only to be told “oh that was warded” after the fact. I just want a way for people to quickly warn me that there’s vision so I can find a more creative path that skirts around it, or just go elsewhere. Nothing sucks more than sitting in a bush for 45 seconds hoping the enemy moves far enough forward for you to gank, only to have a ward die right underneath you.\n\n**Brief Description:**\nLike the rest of the pings that already exist, it would be great to have one that has a unique symbol/minimap icon/audio queue that lets it stand out from the rest of the pings so that players can easily communicate with each other, maybe even leading to less toxicity! \n\n**Target Audience:**\nAny player with good map awareness!\n\n**Mockups/Screenshots:** \nhttps://imgur.com/WBXWzvV\n\n\nWhile I can’t guarantee a reply to any posts, several of us are going to be paying attention to this thread over the next few weeks and beyond, so don’t feel like you’re being ignored\n\nEnjoy your time with friends and family over the holidays!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-12-19T20:29:32.276+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey guys, these Rioters are going out on a limb to include the community in their development process here, so follow their request to stay on topic and not troll post.

I'd love to be able to alt-click my R to ping \"Gnar Ultimate (R) - Ready\" and immediatly after, ping the green circle above MF's head to ping \"Miss Fortune Ultimate (R) - Ready\". That would signal to my team that I'm about to jump in and stun and that MF should be ready to Ace them with her ult. Also helps your team if a player isn't good about pinging cooldowns. Would be nice to let the team know that the sona ult will be up in 10 seconds, even if she isn't pinging it herself.\n\nTarget Audience:\nPlayers who don't play on comms.

I'd like a feature which helps you get back onto the Fields of Justice by minimizing shopping time.\n\n**Brief Description:**\n\nThe Pre-purchase feature would simply be a few slots in the store, in which you place items you want to buy as soon as they are available. Clicking to buy an item while not in the shop will put an item in the purchase queue, or you can drag the item there. As soon as the first item in your queue is available to you (due to required level or gold in your bag) it is immediately purchased upon reaching the shop.\n\nGold required to purchase that item (and all items before it in the queue) is shown underneath it.

It's a small addition, but certainly something I'd love to see!\n\nBrief Description:\nSimply put, add a tab where we can see what wards we own. Perhaps, like with champion ability demonstrations, we can see the spawn and despawn animations upon selecting a specific ward?\n\nTarget Audience:\nAnyone who loves looking at their collections and the average player who wants to plan out their aesthetic before getting into queue.

Currently it is hard to trust a system that gives no information. You just press a button that can feel like it does nothing, and that's it. For players getting punished, it just seems like you get a punishment out of the blue.

When champ select begins, it would switch your summoners to your default for the role you selected. So, for example, if you default Flash/Smite for jungle, those will already be selected.

I'm always looking for ways to improve LoL's delivery of PvE as an experience._\n\n--\n\n**Feature/Suggestion Name:**\nHard Bots\n\n**Opportunity/Problem Statement:**\nCoop vs AI as a PvE experience is limited by fast game times, which prevent players from reaching full builds.\n\n**Brief Description:**\nIntermediate bots are fun but easy to beat quickly (15-20 minutes), which cuts off the end game experience. Doom Bots are \"hard\" but not as representative of normal play, roles, and champion diversity. A less extreme PvE hard difficulty with some bot cheats (faster cooldowns, more passive gold earned, free teleport) would fill the gap.\n\n**Target Audience:**\nAll PvE players.\n\n--\n\n**Feature/Suggestion Name:**\nNew player mentoring in Coop vs AI\n\n**Opportunity/Problem Statement:**\nLet volunteers be auto-matched with new players in a guided easy bots game.\n\n**Brief Description:**\nPvE players tend to be some of LoL's friendliest, and the Honor system further identifies the most helpful. Use this and custom matchmaking queues to let mentors be paired with new players in Coop vs AI games to teach basics like towers, last hitting, warding, and even nontoxic communication. Custom in-game UI or pings could make teaching even easier.\n\n**Target Audience:**\nNew players, PvE players looking for new ways to interact with the game.\n\n--\n\n**Feature/Suggestion Name:**\nOpen source Coop vs AI bots\n\n**Opportunity/Problem Statement:**\nLet the community develop AI for new and harder coop bots, to increase the bot roster and its gameplay potential.\n\n**Brief Description:**\nTaking a cue from StarCraft II, give the community access to the bot AI and the tools to develop new ones for new characters and more bot skills. This also has the potential for algorithmically trained bots. A submission process or custom queue could be used to introduce these bots into the Coop vs AI pool.\n\n**Target Audience:**\nComputer programmers, artificial intelligence researchers, colleges, PvE players.\n\n--\n\n**Feature/Suggestion Name:**\nMastery and partial chests for Coop vs AI\n\n**Opportunity/Problem Statement:**\nPvE \"doesn't count\" even though it's a valid social and training environment. PvE players end up with excess keys and no chests or mastery.\n\n**Brief Description:**\nChests in PvP are already rationed by grades and drop rates. Applying percentile grading to Coop vs AI would still work to reward the top performers, and consuming a full chest drop to achieve a partial chest would discourage PvP players from grinding in PvE, while rewarding PvE players in the long run.\n\n**Target Audience:**\nDiehard PvE players.\n\n--\n\n**Feature/Suggestion Name:**\n3v5 (or 5v8, or 8v10) Intermediate Coop vs AI queue\n\n**Opportunity/Problem Statement:**\nIntermediate bots are \"easy\" for a balanced 5v5.

However, this can lead to effective 3v5 matches that are... actually really fun.
