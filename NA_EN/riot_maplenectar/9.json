Here&#039;s an outline of the patches that we&#039;re going to do:\n\n**7.24 - Ships December 5/6 **depending on Region\nthe content for this patch has already locked and was on pbe over the past cycle. No changes or surprises here other than that the 7.24 is **usually** the last patch of the year. Leading to my next point..\n\n**7.24B - Shipping December 14th **\n The holiday patch if you will - With how disruptive introducing a whole new system like Runes can be, we weren&#039;t super comfortable with the gap between 7.24 and 8.1 (December 5th - January 10th), so have added a new patch that&#039;ll ship on a bit of a weird timeline compared to usual patches. We&#039;re still going to do patch notes (albeit with less context than usual), and it&#039;ll look like a normal patch to you folks. You can expect these changes to be less complex in nature - no mechanics changes and easy to understand. Thinking tuning numbers to base stats, abilities, and items. Right now we&#039;re actually looking at a fairly sized chunk of champions / items, but we&#039;ll see what we end up shipping. Primary focus is on top lane/fighters, but expect changes to impact every role to varying extents. THIS PATCH IS ONLY FOR BALANCE - NO SKINS/FEATURES/MAP MODES!\n\n**8.01 - Shipping ~January 9th/10th**\nDue to the way holidays overlap with the usual development time for a patch, 8.1 is likely going to be smaller than a usual patch, but we&#039;re going to try our best to get some quick reactionary changes in based on what we see over the holiday break. After that we&#039;ll be able to resume patching as usual.\n\nHope this information is useful!","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-11-30T22:21:01.787+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=AEUAnnMI,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-11-30T22:09:39.613+0000)\n\n> **7.24B - Shipping December 14th **\n You can expect these changes to be less complex in nature - no mechanics changes and easy to understand.\n\n\nSwain rework, AP item rework, and the next new champion confirmed for this patch","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-11-30T23:21:07.202+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot about the Summoners Rift Update 3.0.","replies":[{"poster":"iahim98","date":"2017-12-01T00:28:02.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the client update :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-12-01T01:25:27.158+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And League of Legends Website 2.0","replies":[{"poster":"iahim98","date":"2017-12-01T20:16:38.087+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the origin of the meme, the new Ryze rework.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2017-11-30T23:39:54.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has there been any consideration on making a split on the melee/range benefit for the precision runes?
