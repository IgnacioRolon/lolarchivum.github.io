You’ve been playing a ton of games and been providing a ton of great feedback! We figured it’s a good time to discuss some of the hottest topics we’ve seen so far, and outline our future plans with the mode.\n\n# The rest of Patch 9.13\n\nAs we continue into this patch, and our Pre-Ranked Beta, we’ll be making swift adjustments and balance changes every few days as new things are discovered. By the time you read this, we’ll have already made adjustments to Garen, Yasuo, Morellonomicon, Kennen, the drop chances of all units, and more. We’ll be at this pace and as much as needed all the way up to 9.14. Our goal is that when the season starts, Teamfight Tactics will be in the best possible state. We’ll also be on the lookout for any nasty bugs that need immediate attention, so keep pointing them out to us when you see them!\n\n# Patch 9.14 - Ranked &amp; New Content\n\nWith the official start of our first season (we’re calling it the “Beta Season”), you’ll be able to join the ranked queue and climb the ladder to see just how great of a tactician you really are. Something worth noting is that while you can’t win every game of TFT, if you place in the Top 4 you’ll typically gain LP and move up in rank. So even if you aren’t quite able to find the units or items you were looking for, don’t give up!\n\nWe will also be adding our first new champion to Teamfight Tactics in patch 9.14! Twisted Fate, a Pirate Sorcerer will help you dubloon seeking tacticians flesh out your team comps and think about your early game differently. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sztWqWl.png\n\n# Patches Beyond\n\nWe plan on adding new content almost every patch. Our first new origin should be coming up quickly, opening up even more build paths and options for you to get crafty with. We want to keep TFT fresh, exciting, and as fun to play as possible every time you log in.\n\nAll of this will be leading up to the end of the Season, which is currently slated for around 3 months. At season end, we will be releasing our second set, which should kick off a whole new round of gameplay and excitement with new units and origins to shake up TFT!\n\nSo, now that you know some of our longer term plans for TFT, let’s talk about some of the biggest feedback points we’ve heard from you.\n\n# Feedback #1: Item RNG feels bad\n\nTo be up front about this, we think RNG is good for Teamfight Tactics in the long term. It prevents every game from feeling the same, and makes high moments and stories when you happen to get everything you want. We’ve already seen player stories of that one game where they managed to get 3 Force of Natures! This is a good thing.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cbvGbOb.png\n\nThat being said, we agree that the range of variance right now is a touch too severe. Getting absolutely nothing goes against the spirit of the game, especially when the item system is really fun to interact with. Getting nothing robs you of the ability to engage with a really fun system and make cool strategic choices (and finding some nutty broken combos).\n\nSo, we’re making some changes. We’re still ironing out the exact details, but there’ll be more guaranteed drops. We’re also experimenting with dropping other things besides items, such as gold, XP, or even champs. You can expect to see these changes in 9.14. Once they are in, let us know how it feels.\n\n# Feedback #2: I wish there was more info in the UI\n\nWe agree. We wanted to get the beta in your hands as soon as possible so that everyone could start enjoying TFT. Now that we’ve launched, we’ll be adding a bunch of new UI elements to provide more clarity on how things work. This includes:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pd312NO.png\n\nDamage Meters, Stat panels for units, Streak Indicators, Item Previews from the inventory, adjustments to current UI placements, and much more. It’s a high priority, so you should expect the first round of UI updates to start rolling out in 9.14 . We’re still listening, so keep giving us feedback on things you feel are missing!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Qk5HDMk.png\n\n# Feedback #3: I should get rewards like XP from playing\n\nWe hear you on this one. Certainly the lack of rewards/progress since we’ve launched can be felt, though by the time you read this the Beta Pass will have been released and you should be well on your way to earning some nice new personalization content like board skins and a free Little Legend. We’ll be working on longer term progression plans for TFT.  We’re also thinking  about how we can best integrate Summoners Rift, ARAM, TT, and TFT into one cohesive experience when they all offer considerably different gameplay.\n\nBy the time you’re reading this players that have purchased the Arcade Pass will now also be able to earn Arcade tokens by playing TFT. We’d leaned away from this approach initially, but you made it clear this is something you wanted, so we revisited our thinking and made a few pivots to make it happen. \n\n# Feedback #4: Player Damage/Items/Other things don’t feel right\n\nOne of the best things about launching Teamfight Tactics as a beta is the opportunity to get feedback from all of you. Please continue to let us know if there are parts of TFT that don’t feel great to you, and we’ll continue to make changes.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat’s it for now. We’re planning on being open as we can with our comms around TFT, so expect many more articles like this as we move forward. We love all the feedback we’ve been getting, and want to make sure you feel heard. Thanks for your support so far, and good luck out there!\n\nThe TFT Dev Team","replies":[{"poster":"MrSnowman0","date":"2019-07-04T01:23:59.469+0000","up_votes":515,"down_votes":18,"body":"get {{item:3161}} {{item:3161}} {{champion:555}}  out of my games -_-","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Gafgarion","date":"2019-07-04T02:51:57.212+0000","up_votes":187,"down_votes":20,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrSnowman0,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=4HOMjBEE,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-07-04T01:23:59.469+0000)\n>\n> get {{item:3161}} {{item:3161}} {{champion:555}}  out of my games -_-\n\nI honestly think you shouldn't be able to stack items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DennisESfuerte","date":"2019-07-04T01:56:04.412+0000","up_votes":96,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrSnowman0,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=4HOMjBEE,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-07-04T01:23:59.469+0000)\n>\n> get {{item:3161}} {{item:3161}} {{champion:555}}  out of my games -_-\n\nHow to I add more up votes here?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Veigar FL","date":"2019-07-04T01:41:18.569+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":9,"body":"Just go {{champion:136}} {{item:3046}} and {{champion:102}} \n\nBut double spear does need a nerf.

I easily thought of 7 ways to counter pyke instantly and I am sure there is more\n1. Cornering your ADC or carry, basically just not letting the pyke use spell cross map and not into your area.\n2. Glacial, easily stronger cc and freezes easier with 6 glacial\n3. take the pykes off the market, if you really want to just stop them just force them to have tier 1 pyke because most ppl don't get 2 shojin pykes off the bat.\n4. Pyke isn't tanky, assassins easily 1 shot him\n5. Take the tears and the B.F sword off the carousel before them, I doubt they would be at the bottom when they have shojin pyke\n6. Disarming blade and guinsoo on carry or graves or a tanky character (like Gnar or Cho'Gath)\n7. Get a kassadin on him with guinsoo.\n\nHowever, I do agree pyke is rather overpowered in the sense that if you do not have the luck or never tried or thought of these easy counters to shojin pyke, there are so many more broken builds out there and you just focus on pyke when {{champion:38}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3085}} exists\nor even just sejuani with 2 shojins is stronger than pyke with 2 shojins, I understand your point but I think pyke with 2 shojins is easily countered","replies":[{"poster":"Zoomiest Yuumi","date":"2019-07-04T09:17:21.604+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't think you've ever fought a Pyke with one spear, let alone two.

This is a good thing.\" No, it's not a good thing. Yeah it's fun or whatever but for competitive play it's totally unfair, there is no strategy involved when you get less items that someone else. There is however if you get worse item than someone and then you need to find a good use for them. All players should get the same amount of items. \n\"we think RNG is good for Teamfight Tactics in the long term\" it is good but too much is not good. Getting random items is enough randomness in itself. But getting random amount of items is just unfair and not fun at all. When you can just make 1 item and you see someone who already has 3 items, it's hard to beat them with your strategy alone. It's simply too much randomness. Just make everyone get the same amount of items. That's the first thing I hear people complain about when they try this game. \nItems should work on the same principle as you get champions. Imagine if the amount of champions was also random. Some people get to choose from 2 champs and some from 5 champs. It's just nonsense. It's neither fair or fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2019-07-04T01:49:51.644+0000","up_votes":122,"down_votes":2,"body":"RNG items from drops is fine, rng number of item drops is bullshit if it is more than 1-2 difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Forevergogo","date":"2019-07-04T06:33:32.232+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had games where I had over 8 full build items at the end.\nAnd other games where I only had 2.\nDefinitely needs balance when before the first round of pvp some people have 4-5 items and others 1-2.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"newbeÍ","date":"2019-07-04T01:20:03.458+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":5,"body":"Please add a DPSmeter","replies":[]},{"poster":"Straitéis","date":"2019-07-04T01:21:14.783+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please fix this delayed loading issue at the start of games.

I would imagine so as it will be harder to find champs you want if there are more champs in the pool, but at the same time it’ll be sad to see them go. It’d be neat (imo) if available champs were those in a random and limited amount of origins/types determined each match. That way you’d have the possibly of seeing every champ, but each match could sport a different champ pool with few enough champs to build a comp. Maybe, the random pool only being available in non-ranked.\n\nOther feedback:\n\n* Little legend rng: this is a big topic of debate and it would be nice if we could get some response. Personally, I’ve always been proud of Riot for not forcing people to use lootboxes/rng to get what they want. Even when the loot system came out, skins remained affordable and attainable without loot (minus the prestige skins). But now, with TFT, only 6 “skins” can be attained without rng and even then they are extremely overpriced compared to the quality of normal League skins.\n\n* Damage immunity: PD and Dragon buff are way too good in the right circumstances imo. Last game I played I managed last long enough to get the full sorcerer buff with karth and lost because my team could blow up everyone except the dragons who took literally no damage.\n\n* Item management: I’d like to be able to combine or at least hover combines without equipping items. Also it’d be nice we could unequip an item or something similar. Sometimes I get a rare champ with a spatula on the carousel and it feels bad if I have to waste an item (to combine) and lose the spatula for later use just to equip other items on that champ.\n\n* Pathing and melee comps: obviously there are some pathing issues, pls fix. Also, melee comps start to feel really bad as the game progresses. For example, a pure assassin comps just fails late game because there is not enough spaces for them to attack and so some champs will just sit and watch until one of your own units dies. It’d be nice if the board were bigger and/or melees could attack if all spaces are occupied (maybe they could share a space if that is the case).\nAlso, tanky comps can be bad because they can exceed the round time limit.\nAlso, Bitz gets countered pretty hard by assassins. If a assassin is the furthest unit he doesn’t bother pulling until the assassin lands and then he just pulls someone else anyways, probably after your team has agro’d on the enemy frontline.\n\n* Small thing: it’d be nice if the little legends are not forced to look in a different direction when they lose the round. It’s kind of awkward when my bird decides to turn away and stare into the abyss after getting hit with a loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"allARAMallday0","date":"2019-07-04T15:47:22.157+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":5,"body":"The cakewalk is completely dumb. \n\n-Draft order is undermined by yet another random element of where you are on the circle relative to your champ.\n-If my first choice is taken in front of me at the opening draft, I routinely run out of time to make it to my second champ, and end up with a random\n-people just stand around the circle of champs and bump you into champs you don't want/box out for others to take the ones you do.

RNG will be important to TFT but there is such a thing as too much. you don't need to make it so that everyone gets all the op items all the time, but everyone should be getting _SOMETHING_ at least","replies":[{"poster":"BWG REFORMED","date":"2019-07-04T06:53:19.326+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":9,"body":"\"i've been playing this game mode almost non-stop since it's release and i've only won 4 times\" I think that says more about you than the game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlecSoysauce","date":"2019-07-04T03:04:46.848+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"pyke spear of shojin is so broken honestly!!!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bdog100","date":"2019-07-07T01:52:13.367+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a table where you can see the remaining units in the pool so no one ends up blowing 100 gold looking for a unit that is taken by everyone I know you can check by looking at other players but you would have to remember the number of each tier of unit and check if that unit is owned by 7 other people I feel like having a table would just make it alot easier and it could also add counterplay if you see someone with 2 Aurelions you can grab the last one to make sure they dont get tier 2 and blow your whole team to smithereens","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dimpl","date":"2019-07-04T18:33:18.636+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please remove attack move click from TFT!

Sad to see this is the way going forward. I don't like games where half of your chances of winning depend on rolling the right thing at the right time. The difference is like playing Yu-Gi-Oh! like they do it on the show, and playing the game properly with a deck that is meant to work with a strategy. Every single TFT game I've played, sooner or later I feel like the game doesn't care about supporting a strategy and instead throws random stuff at you and good luck with that. I really hate that form of game flow. I may play it for the free loot but no more. Someone seriously needs to explain to me what's so fun/addicting about this game cause I just don't get it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoupDetate","date":"2019-07-04T02:11:36.176+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":31,"body":"Im actually more irritated at the champions i get to pick from.  I can't begin to tell you how many times i've selected a champ from the carousel, even one of the common ones, and then never see them in the champ buy list from that point on.  I played one game today where i plucked a darius from the champ buy, intending to build him up and go for the Imperial buff, but throughout the rest of the game i NEVER saw another darius appear, even with rerolls.  Meanwhile, everyone and their mother has 4 3 stars, and 3 2 stars.  It's absurd how rapidly unbalanced the game gets.\n\nAlso, you should allow some sort of FF for players.  I'm genuinely sick and tired of having to play round after round when a very clear winner has already been decided thanks to the 3 full items and two 3 star champs one player winds up with before the 2nd carousal.","replies":[{"poster":"Raven Redeemed","date":"2019-07-04T04:34:38.881+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a limited number of champs in the pool and the pool is shared between all players.
