I queue up again. Loading into game: 700 ping. I load into the game in a normal amount of time and I still have 700 ping. So I decide to restart my router because there is no way on earth I am about to play a game with 700-800 ping the whole time (I usually have about 50). When I reopen the game, I have been punished with 20 minute queue times for 5 games. Now, this is fine and all until I realize that (1) Nothing but league was having issues with connection, and (2) there was 3 people having connection issues the game before the one I disconnected in. Also, when I was logging into the client I couldn't connect to the servers for a while. I refuse to believe all of this is a coincidence, and therefore believe that I have been given a heavy penalty for something that wasn't my or my internet's fault. \r\n\r\nRITO PLZ  {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T21:22:12.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Restarting your router mid-game is going to disconnect you, which may very well make you end up getting an LPQ if it happens too often.
