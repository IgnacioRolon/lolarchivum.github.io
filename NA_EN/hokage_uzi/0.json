You're going to run into some visual issues especially on 4K.  Your best bet would be to reduce your resolution in-game and native.  Otherwise you may want to swap to another screen.  If needed, a config reset can default your resolution:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.","replies":[]}]}
