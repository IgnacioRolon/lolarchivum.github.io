That's why you can interrupt the dash but the damage hits you anyways (you usually can't break up an auto attack).","replies":[{"poster":"Myren Quiddle","date":"2019-03-19T15:55:56.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Myrmiron,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=pPBwBxWv,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-03-19T13:40:08.542+0000)\n>\n> Hi, 2 year old thread btw.\n> Anyways, Heca's E works like an auto attack and his \"dash\" starts when he is in auto range, so his dash happens after the auto already went through.
