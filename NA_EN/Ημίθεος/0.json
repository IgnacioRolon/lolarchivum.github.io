You can pay a small amount of riot points... or 6300 be for something like a new rune page... \n\nI'm on a low level account and I can't get any new champions. When I hit 12 I got 400 blue essence.... what am I supposed to do with 400 blue essence or a really bad champ shard once every 4 days? Riot is just greedy, there's no other logic that you could throw behind this nonsensical transfer. \n\nAlso, before this patch was released, they started a \"rune sale\" so that new players would get rid of all of their old IP points trying to get runes. You thought Riot was being nice, but they were actually just still being greedy and trying to get you to waste IP so you got lower BE with the conversion. Can't let people get fun, new champions without paying $10 on a (kind of low quality) game. Notice how there are a bunch of crappy features on the launcher, plenty of issues in game, etc., but all riot is concerned about it raking in money from people who want new champs, new skins, or more rune pages. \n\nAnother noteworthy greedy point for Riot, with mastery pages you could build up to or over 20 (i believe); good thing they got rid of that too so that you were more likely to pay for rune pages. \n\nTL;DR, Riot is s*i*, and this game would be infinitely better if they sold it to Blizzard/Battle.net or some other company.","replies":[{"poster":"eNelms","date":"2017-12-07T02:52:43.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"WTF NO THEY WOULD NOT BE ( I THINK )BLIZZARD HAS HORRIBLE GAMES  ESPECIALLY  WOW IS HORRIBLE SO IS THERE HEROES OF THE STORM THAT GAME IS GARBAGE  I hope riot just learns.....

People aren't stupid it is so obvious, the first few levels went relatively quickly but after though it was a slow grind-fest and I've gotten so many duplicates(which is hilarious given that I own like 30 out of more than 100 champs, fuck you for that riot) AND it was duplicates that disenchanted for a pathetic amount because mostly who i own are from the cheapest brackets of champions. Champion shard lootboxes is now how I have to unlock champs while I disenchant duplicates like an asshole until I slowly crawl my way to a 4800 champ or open up my wallet and shell out some rp?

It's really frustrating not gaining currency in game and only getting 50 a day (if I even have time to play). Or if you, Riot, believe so strongly in this new system, make the rewards for mastery, honor and leveling more so. I really like the idea of getting chunky amounts of essence for being honored, this would greatly incentivize players to engage teammates/enemies in a collaborative, understanding and civil manner. \n\nThoughts??","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdcInsight","date":"2018-01-21T17:26:01.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm very disappointed with the BE, people say there are studies comparing incomes with IP and BE stating the second gives you more. For my experience i can say in 30 levels i hardly managed to buy Caitlyn and Varus. 2 holy damn champs in 30 lvls and God knows how much time spent on this game. It is frustrating. I really hope Riot will change this sistem. Let's say you get 1 lvl by playing 10 games (even though they'd be much more) and you used to get an average 100 IP for 1 game (even though they'd be much more): it used to be 1000 IP for 10 games. Now you get 500 BE for 1 lvl, so now you have 50% less purchasing power.\nI guess Riot had imagined people would have got angry with this non-rewarding sistem","replies":[]}]}
