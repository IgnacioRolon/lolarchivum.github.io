I expected this but I when I played another game and I checked my game on lolnexus, it said I was still in the promos. I won that game then I knew I was in promos again but the message didn't pop up to tell me. So I just figured that it was a glitch and that since the servers were a little freaky during that time. So I played a game today, thinking I was in promos but when I won, in the postgame, it said I had 19LP. Where did all my LP go? Where did my promo go?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T22:13:50.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounded really funky so I took some time and looked up your account.\n\nIt sounds like there may be some confusion about what division you were in, since you definitely got a promotion.  Back in late April, you lost a game at 0 LP dropping you into Silver 4.  When you won your series (as you thought you did) you did enter Silver 3 again, which is why you have 19 LP when you won after that.\n\nI hope this makes sense!  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
