Especially in Ranked, it's not the best feeling at all. Kinda makes you feel like a puppy that's been told to fend for yourself, or maybe a wolf without a pack.\n\nActually, wolf without a pack is a much better analogy. We're better than puppies.\n\nSadly, it's not really doable to reduce how much LP players lose in games with AFKs. Doing that could be open up the system for abuse, and test the integrity of the Ranked queue. For now, the only safe form of reducing LP loss is when widespread detectable issues affect many players in a region and we enable compensation mode. But there may come a point in the future where we're able to work something out. It remains to be seen.","replies":[{"poster":"Degmond","date":"2017-11-16T12:12:25.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another must have feature that's gonna take years to get like the skins owned feature that's finally coming...in patch 7.23 of the game ( 8 years?).\n\nHe already gave you a way to eliminate the \"abuse\" problem. He said if the player has dc'd for at least half the game.Go beyond that and make it 75% if that makes you feel better, i'm sure it's not that hard to code and it is a temporal (after 8 years) fix.\n\nWe already get punished for inters, trolls, afk, smurfs and your hidden elo system isn't exactly helping either.We deserve at least that.\n\nYou won't spend resources on making a complex system that doesn't earn you cash unless your active players number decreases again and then you give people a new \"hope\". Moving this issue to the -soonâ„¢- list is a dirty move.","replies":[]}]}]}
