May even be something wrong with my video card itself since LoL ran fine on my older model with the Iris Pro integrated graphics, but I did a hardware check and got nothing back. When I try to run in on an external monitor tho it's even worse, and makes my champion look like it has creep block just walking around anywhere even away from anything it can touch. Not sure what this could be, but i've tried playing on the lowest settings on any resolution and it still does this. Any ideas? Could it be my HDMI adapter I bought just not pushing the signal well enough maybe?\n\nEdit: And don't say get a PC, I have a desktop PC, we're talking about my Macbook Pro right now lol","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-14T03:46:05.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way you talk about your champion having infinite creep block makes me wonder if your Champion's model file is corrupt or broken. I won't tell you to get a PC, but I will suggest that you try a client repair from the settings menu first to be safe and make sure that all those files are working properly.\n\nIf you're still seeing those problems after that you should definitely consider hitting up my buds in the Tech team [**via ticket here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
