Blizzard is worth 16billion, EA 17billion, Riot is owned by tencent i think valued at like 150billion+.  \n\nWhile Riot doesn't have full access to all of Tencent's cash, they were the 2nd highest grossing f2p game at like 650million.  Don't worry about Riot's financial standing they're killing it and can afford to do away with charging for game balance content while still making a killing on advertising and skins.\n\nNot having runes or certain FOTM champs could make you feel like your at a disadvantage vs your other counter parts.  This is a competitive game, why have grinding/rpg aspects.  The whole point of the moba i feel was to condense WoW pvp aspects and marry it to RTS resource and strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-04-15T19:34:28.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"and how do you think they earned that money?","replies":[{"poster":"Jamnon","date":"2015-04-15T22:23:09.504+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"How do you think DOTA earned money?\n(hint: not by selling rune pages)","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-04-16T00:13:27.380+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Yeah they sell Keys for purely random stuff.

Free week champ: You have to pick from 10/100+ champs.  You will face off against ppl who have unlocked numerous other champs, that you have not access to.  So you can't pick 'em, you can't play 'em to learn their str/weaknesses.  When the week finishes, the champ you are working on maybe be gone.  You either pick the next champ in the role or you pick a different role.  There is nothing to stop you from picking away from the very established meta (so you are essentially playing wrong)\n\n2. Runes/Masteries: You aren't even supposed to buy tier one runes, considered a waste.  You may  match up against lvl20+ to 30+ depending if you party queue.  You are at a mathematical disadvantage the whole way.  The so called flexibility isn't all that flexible, there is a optimal build which rewards ppl with enough grind time and the desire to look it up on the web.\n\n3. Summoner spells: why not let you start with flash, when you hit 12 at least 8/10 players have flash picked.\n\n\nHow they should have done it...(dota has is right, tho it barely helps cause it does have a steeper learning curve..almost unreasonable).\n\n1. summoner spells, don't do it put it on items as actives.  Then make those items recommended to heroes that excel with it.\n\n2. Masteries/Runes, don't have 'em.  This is too RPG grind like when you can show up to fights with SECRET power.  Everyone should the same lvl and known stats when the gong hits.\n\n3. Limited hero mode. 20 of the least mechanic intensive heroes to choose from.  The best part you opponent has to choose from them also (no one is playing against invoker with 15 spells that will just confuse new players).  If you see a hero wreck you, you are welcome to pick 'em in the go around and learn their str/weaknesses.  If you dont' wanna go slow, you can play regular modes and pick any hero that interests you and play him for as long as you need to (choice). While meta exists, there are many heroes who fill multiple roles and lanes so its less likely that you've picked a hero that can only lane 1 way and face 1 type of opponent.\n\nAt the very least LoL shoudl pick 20 or so champs, throw 'em in a noob mode that you can only play till like lvl 20 or something.  The 20 champs are free in that mode, but once you go to other modes you still need to purchase 'em.  That would be a step in the right direction of new players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stark6000","date":"2015-04-16T13:49:57.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tell him years and don't be real specific to how many years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Treyen","date":"2015-04-16T07:44:31.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it all really comes back to the fact they have slashed IP gains considerably. they do it a little a time so fewer people notice, but it steadily goes down, while prices remain the same.
