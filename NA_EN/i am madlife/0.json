This is not me talking about having a team to carry you, but more a team that will listen, and work together, or at the very least, **try.**\r\n\r\nThis is the biggest thing that I see happening in Solo Q, of most Elo&#039;s, as I&#039;ve played in Low Master, Mid Diamond, Low Diamond-High plat (One of the worst), Low plat - High gold, Low Gold - high silver, Mid Silver (Another bad one), and bronze. (Still bad, but able to carry).\r\n\r\nSome people wont agree with me on the way I have pointed this out, and that is fine. This is my opinion. But what I have seen, is my evidence for why I am putting this up there. Now, let me get to my main point of this conversation. Ranked is turning into a game of chance.\r\n\r\nThe game has a new challenge now. Not beating your opponent, working together to get objectives, and winning, but instead it&#039;s come to making sure that your team doesn&#039;t rage at each other over a kill, helping them and agreeing with them most of the time so they feel like they are a big factor of the game (even though most of the time they are not), and overall babysitting your own team, so you have a slight chance of winning. Though, that is not to say that sometimes you get the team that works through all the problems, and are naturally all trying in the game. Those are the teams that should be in almost all of our games, but League has been taken to a level where people feel the need to try their hardest to win, instead of having fun and working as a team. Instead of thinking to climb the ranks, think to get better. That is, in my opinion, what ranked was about. To see how good you are, to place you in a division that the game thinks you deserve, and then for you to work on your skills to improve and win with your teammates.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is, there is more and more people that are taking the game to a more serious level, which is not bad, until they express their emotions in the form of **Toxicity.** Now that word has been thrown around a lot, and people know of it much to well, but most people say &quot;oh, im on tilt&quot; for one of their reasons of expressing this kind of anger. This is true for some, but not true for all, and for all I believe that there is a way to solve that. Don&#039;t let the game take over your mind. As hard as it is not to rage at people in-game for going 0-17 as yasuo,  or running in 1v5 thinking their gosu when they play vayne, instead there are tips that you can do to stop that. Some include listening to relaxing music, rage OUTLOUD instead of in-game if you feel you have to vent, etc. There are videos online, and I wont get into too much detail.\r\n\r\nBut the main point of this was to say that League is turning into the roll of a dice, whether you get a team that is trying and wants to win, or a team, or even one player for that matter, that feels the need to yell at his teammates when he makes a mistake, and blames others for his lack of mechanics. Sometimes it could get even worse and lead into them leaving the game, or just intentionally feeding, which brings me up to my next point. Riot has implimented the upgraded intentional feeder detection, though I have had 3 in my past games and my team has reported them all (or so they say), but yet no action has been notified to me. Nothing has been done of my knowledge. I know that the system isn&#039;t perfect, and there are many cases, as well as everyone gets these players, but that&#039;s just the thing. Everyone shouldn&#039;t get these players. As there is someone good in the world, there usually is someone bad to counteract the balance, but I feel that people that are ruining the game for 4 other people, could simply get a ban and create another smurf to ruin more games. Sometimes it&#039;s just one game that is needed for a couple players to get the division they desire, but there are always people that want to ruin your experience in the game. An idea I had was to make it so if you do end up having an afk or an intentional feeder, the LP that you loose is either negated, or cut down by a lot, as well as if you are in promos, it counts as a blank spot, for you to have a real match and try again. This might make it too easy for players to rank up though, as I know higher elo players had to struggle with these people on their team, but just something I wanted to say.\r\n\r\nI appologize if I was ranting, and sorry if my point wasn&#039;t clear, because I&#039;m pretty sure 90% of you are going to get lost in my post as I rambled on, but I wanted to get this off my chest and just express my opinions.\r\n\r\nTLDR; The game requires too much chance on if you get a troll/toxic player or not. Don&#039;t be toxic, learn how not to tilt, and if you loose with a troll/toxic player do something to your teammates that had to suffer the loss.\r\nI think that summed it up. If you have anything to say, or some suggestions on what I should put in here, please comment below.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-11-08T23:15:28.926+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":4,"body":"Remove the words \"is slowly turning into a\" from the title, then youre right lel {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ","replies":[{"poster":"I am Madlife","date":"2015-11-08T23:15:55.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Penns,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TFTsoZEr,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-08T23:15:28.926+0000)\n>\n> Remove the words \"is slowly turning into a\" from the title, then youre right lel {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\n\nOkay :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-11-08T23:15:35.620+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"That's why they are bringing in the dynamic queue and updating the champion select to eliminate the issues you addressed.

I've been recently trying to grind out some ranked games and more often than not I feel like i'm acting as \"team mom\" or \"team behavior counselor\". I mean it's borderline depressing that more often than not what will win you a game is making sure your team actually behaves as a team.\n\nThis concept by itself supports the \"role of the dice\" mentality perfectly. Lets assume for the sake of the argument that the ranked system actually works as intended and places people approximately where they're supposed to be. So we can assume aside from smurfs/boosters people are around the level they should be and or climbing out of it. Nobody's skill is going to be tiers ahead of everyone else in the game so it becomes the team with the most cooperative, level headed teammates win. \n\nWhy is working together towards a common interest so hard for people to do? Is it more appealing to rage, troll, flame, etc... than to win a game? It's hard for players as a whole to truly learn from their game experience to self improve when their games are littered with variables that don't correspond with actual game-play, but rather player behavior.\n\nDon't get me wrong, learning to work together with your teammates is a valuable skill, but when what type of players you have on your team (behavior/personality) tends to be the largest factor of winning the game, the Elo ranking system becomes inaccurate and skewed. Of course out-liars will exist, those who belong on top (Pro players, non-pro, top notch players such as Gosu); but for the people who aren't a large margin skill wise above their opponents it becomes impossible to climb without having luck on your side.\n\nI don't know what type of system could fix these issues, but I feel as though something needs to be done to help alleviate the pains of having negative players of multiple facets on your team. \n\nTL:DR - When it comes down to it, you do not control your teammates actions/behavior. Cross your fingers that you are paired with like-minded individuals to have a decent chance at winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Thevoidwalker336","date":"2015-11-10T03:03:01.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agree 100% n in my going from s1 92 lp to freaking s3 lo of 0....in 8 days.

The best thing that I have found success in doing is to remain overly-optimistic in chat, openly appreciate your teammates for well executed moves, and soothing music often helps to relieve internal tension if perhaps I am not playing to the best of my abilities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faded Lich","date":"2015-11-09T14:52:00.994+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Anyone who thinks this new system is turning it into anymore of a dice roll than it already is, is showing a vast amount of ignorance to the state of the current system.\n\nThat is all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2015-11-09T02:09:55.552+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Me as first pick: Alright, im doing good, the last few games have been decent, im doing very well in the jungle, ill jsut keep playing jungle.\n\nPlayer in last pick: \"Guys please, i only have jg champs, im on an ult smurfing\"\n\nMe: \"Well... i was going to go jungle but i guess i can play soemthing else...\"\n\n20 minutes later...\n\nJungler who is 0/20: \"OMG FUCKING NOOB TEAM REPORT, GG, AFK\"\n\nMe: {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2015-11-09T01:34:20.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And we need more bans - Worlds showed us OP champs and only Juggernauts were nerfed.\n Btw Juggernauts still can be defeated only by good team combination, and what team combination you expect in SoloQ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-11-09T15:08:26.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"sooo....riot is fixing this in the next patch and you can Q with all your friends and remove the dice entirely.

People have lives, work, family, etc... Assuming that you're going to be playing every single game knowing your teammates is a bit unrealistic. \n\nPeople's behavior in this game isn't being fixed by a new feature in the game, it just allows individuals to circumvent the issue **IF** they que wih all their friends which as I stated before is simply unrealistic, especially for those who want to commit more time than their friends (not everyone's priorities match when it comes to League).","replies":[{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-11-09T21:20:37.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does remove the dice entirely WHEN you Q with friends, and as you pointed out a game feature is not going to change behavior and neither is this thread or any thread.

Something else to consider is that if queing with many people pairs you with other large groups like that you're going to be facing another team, but they could end up being more skilled than your teammates. Something that come up a lot is that for climbing purposes solo que tends to be most effective because you have less of a chance of being paired with another duo que if you were to.\n\nI see many issues that will persist into season 6, but from the last comment you made it appears that you have a negative bias against this particular conversation topic or possibly just threads related to it. Threads are created to converse about topics, not be the solution to one as your comment expressed that it clearly wouldn't be. I didn't expect it to be, just wanted to be part of the conversation and bring up some points of my own.","replies":[{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-11-10T18:24:58.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">someone who plays league quite frequently, queing with friends for all the games isn't going to be a possibility.\n\nIt most certainly is a possibility as their are non ranked q's for you to play in while you wait for your group. Playing only ranked is a choice that is just as easily made to only play ranked with your group. You dont have to make the choice but it is available to you and thus \"possible\"\n\n>facing another team, but they could end up being more skilled than your teammates.\n\nThis happens now, so i see nothing that has changed here. sometimes i get a bronze Q'd with his silver buddy on my team, and sometimes i get a silver Q'd with his high gold buddy on the other team, and sometimes bitches just be smurfing. either way unfair games occur on the regular, so that dynamic has not changed.\n\n>just wanted to be part of the conversation and bring up some points of my own.\n\nAnd we are currently engaged in discussing those points.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
