You can already ping most UI elements to report them in chat, and that covers about 90% of the info most people need.

There's a pretty big difference between a Sivir with no mana items having 5% mana, and a Ryze with fully stacked RoA and Seraph's having 5% mana.\n\n2. Easier way to quickly ping enemy summoner spells and ult down.  Maybe have a ping-wheel pop up when you try to ping an enemy and hold the button, with the default being targeting or avoiding depending on alert or retreat ping, and then have options to ping summoners and ult as 3 of the 4, with the other one being the opposite of the default.\n\n3. The ability to more readily customize ping sounds.  Right now, it's pretty much impossible to distinguish most pings by sound alone, and therefore I _always_ have to check chat and usually the minimap pretty much immediately when someone pings something.

I've commented a couple of times before that I really prefer SMITE's hot-key based menu for selecting pings.  Using a sequence of about 3-4 keystrokes, you can convey enough info that you can even do some rudimentary high-level strategization with your team (as in asking someone to split push while the rest of the team forces another lane) without needing to use chat at all.  I'm not saying League needs things _that_ expressive (most people in SMITE use about 2 dozen of the ping options, but they have separate pings for each lane because they do vocal callouts for the pings instead of just a simple noise), but at least having the option to ping like that for things that require you targeting part of the UI instead of the map would be nice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1RiceBowl1x","date":"2018-02-27T04:15:33.842+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add the \"ima afk pizza is burning brb\" ping please","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-02-27T05:30:15.828+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I thought I put my food in the microwave for 40 seconds, turns out it was 40 minutes and shits on fire yo, brb\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nyloaf","date":"2018-02-26T21:52:10.450+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I, for one, would highly appreciate this ping.
