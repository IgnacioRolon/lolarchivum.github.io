There are three requirements to earn a champion chest: own the champion, get an S with the champion, and have a chest available to earn (you can earn up to four in a week and your available number is checkable in client under your profile).\n\nYou can also earn chests by queueing up with friends: if they get a chest from playing in a queue with you, you'll get a chest too (assuming you haven't earned a chest for that champ and have one available).\n\nThe system is structured to incentivize diversifying your champion pool; it makes you play more champions and tells you to do well with them if you want the rewards.\n\nAnd honey, I'm  sitting on twenty keys and six fragments, or so. Eight ain't nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"XACAP","date":"2017-11-19T14:11:27.633+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"now 32 madam{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hydra Headhunter","date":"2017-12-12T16:49:12.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"32 is something.

As long as you own the champion you're playing, if **anyone in your premade** get's an S- or higher then everyone in that premade will get a chest as long as one is available for that champion ^_^! \n\nIf my wording is a little confusing, you can always check all the details on hextech chests on our [**crafting guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide)!","replies":[]}]}
