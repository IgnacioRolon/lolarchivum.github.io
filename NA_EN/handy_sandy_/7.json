Something I've always had difficulty with is finding good places to stay safe with softer characters.  One strategy that's given me a fair bit of success has been to work up movespeed items and find ways to keep attacking at great distances to stay out of trouble.  Something like {{item:3285}}  {{item:3100}}  and MS Quints lets you be a bit more selective with your attacks.  Find a spot for a {{item:3151}}  and soft targets start taking alot of damage when the luden's splash catches them.  Aside from that a {{item:3645}}  is always a good pick up.  Wait to use it until you start seeing a group of 2-3 enemies and judge where to drop it based on how things move.  As a rule, if you dont have the ability to ward 1/4 or more of the potential combat zone by yourself then bail on the fight and ping your frontline to let them know your not comfortable with the location.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-07-29T20:17:09.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd really have trouble seeing any of those items really working unless your playing Vlad, or Swain.
