Why didn&#039;t anyone bring this up sooner. \r\n\r\nI have a question, how is a {{champion:101}} with an easy to dodge stun or a {{champion:115}} with a 20 second cooldown escape supposed to kite a {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} ??\r\n\r\nHow does {{champion:30}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:112}} going to kite? Yeah they have cc, but the cooldowns. How is one 10-20 second cooldown stun or slow going to help kite a fast af {{champion:86}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:106}} ?? Enough champions already have speed buffs and gapclosers like {{champion:39}} so now what are mages going to do? Yeah we can perma slow you. THEN TURN AROUND. Who fights a mage at long range? 3 hits from you fighters, bruisers, and assassins and we&#039;re dead! We deserve some type of tankiness and a way to slow you down so we can escape. Why aren&#039;t mages extremely overpowered right now then? Why isn&#039;t everyone picking up some {{champion:69}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:30}} or other mage and becoming a tank while 2 shotting squishies? Why don&#039;t mages go top and ADC and jungle now since it&#039;s so overpowered? \r\n\r\nTLDR; Mages are low movement speed, immobile damage dealers that often have little to no escapes. They deserve some type of slow to let them get away, they already rely on their cc or 9 billion second escape enough.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-14T01:26:09.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cant stop the QQtrain.
