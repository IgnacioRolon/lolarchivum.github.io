Preferably more, but this is a minimum.\n\nCan you play every role adequately? You can and likely will be autofilled (unless support is one of your main roles). \n\nRanked is really not all that different from normals. Treat it the same if you already try in normal draft. If you've played a lot of normal draft and get queued with gold+ borders regularly, you're definitely ready for ranked (that was the case for me, I went 8-2 in my initial placements and got placed silver 1; although in S5 and S6 I played a combined ~130 games just to get gold each time...). \n\nAlso, if someone starts raging just ignore it (mute if you can't). Never talk back - there's no reason to tilt teammates. I've won plenty of games with a raging ally and an early deficit. As long as you stay calm, the team will follow, and you can make a lot of comebacks. \n\nAlso, the single biggest piece of advice I can give from my first two seasons of ranked:\nMatchmaking is actually decent contrary to popular belief. Just sometimes you'll get a team where everyone is worse early game and better late game. These games often become stomps where you \"lose pre 15 min\". This really doesn't need to be the case though - do NOT tilt when allies die early. I've lost plenty of games due to watching allies die early and then getting overly aggressive trying to get a 1v1 kill to make up for it or because I felt I needed to carry. My win rate went up 10-20% when I stopped doing this and just continued playing my lane as I would, and a lot of the time I'd get super fed in the mid game with picks and my allies would know how to play the mid-late game while the enemy threw since their whole team was just good at laning phase. Keep calm - a lot of games get thrown in silver and comebacks are definitely possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2017-01-28T03:21:29.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If you've played a lot of normal draft and get queued with gold+ borders regularly, you're definitely ready for ranked \n\nOh..I actually do XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-01-28T03:03:07.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck to you.

I don't ever go that far down the line, but it happens all the time. It's usually the 0/12 players blaming everyone else that say that stuff. Now, before you start, I would advise learning itemization, as that's a big flame topic for a lot of people. If the enemy you are laning against is an attack damage character you build armor, magic damage you build magic resist. If you don't know the champion, look at the color of the damage you take, red is physical, purple is magic, and white is true damage. You can always do a bit of research on your opponents before the game, like if you fight illaoi, don't engage her 1v2 and with her ult up, run away, tentacles heal her, ect ect. So just some basic knowledge on the capabilities of the most commonly played champions will help. Playing safe is also important, don't feed carelessly, if you lose a fight don't expect to win the next one doing the exact same thing, don't push your lane too far if the enemy jungler is around, ward often, look at your map, follow pings, learn what freezing a lane is, work on your creep score or how much gold you make off of minions. That's the best I got, but as long as you're not carelessly feeding, you won't be the center of attention. That being said I wouldn't get mad at you if you failed a couple times here and there, just throwing out tips. Good luck man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-01-28T02:34:18.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if those things are going to stop you then you aren't ready.","replies":[]}]}
