It's not a terrible idea, but there are some issues that you have to learn to overcome (much like most non-meta supports).\n\nThat being said, it sounds like a lot of fun, if you wanna do it knock yourself out.

Kind of inferior to Zyra from a pure support perspective, but her damage output can be a lot higher, especially at low level. Works well with ADCs that can make use of the wall for shenanigans, like vayne. Just try not to pick her into anyone with a dash that can avoid her Q and W.\n\nTends to be good against stuff like {{champion:222}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:21}} and other low-mobility ADCs, fairs poorly against long-range or mobile ones like {{champion:51}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:115}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zone of Endless","date":"2017-01-05T03:29:47.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She require combos to do damage and it has high mana cost so it's a huge problem if she doesn't land it.
