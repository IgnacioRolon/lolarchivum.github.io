You must survive, it is surviving the pain and violence of life that show your character.\"\n\nFor him, the ones Ekko save are certainly not worthy but Ekko who almost die and endure pain endlessly, he get a taste of what Urgot endured by himself with no rewind, no save thing. Urgot got broken and survived.\n\nI am quite sure they would face each other, the same way I feel Ekko would encounter Warwick and how Urgot would encounter Warwick too.\n\n\nBut honestly, Ekko x Urgot is my favorite interaction/kind of dynamic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-01-19T06:30:47.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting for sure, but you would need to bridge the gap between Ekko being a beacon of Zaun excellence to joining Urgot.\n\nAt a recent panel one of Riots writers said in regards to Ekko he is relatively early in his \"heroes journey\" and he hasn't had his \"Uncle Ben moment yet\" suggesting that his parents might die.\n\nThat could be a good motivation for him to become disillusioned and more pliable by Urgot. Privy to making him believe that it was irrelevant that his parents were \"good people\" because by Urgots philosophy they were weak and because of that couldn't protect themselves and now Ekko can learn from that by compromising some of his values to prioritize strength in order to survive long enough to make Zaun a better place.\n\nA bit like Danys' character in Game of Thrones starts out as a hopeless optimist idealist ,but then confronted with the harsh realities of being a ruler, is forced to drop some of her values to maintain control of the Slave cities in Essos.\n\nSomething to that effect could work","replies":[]}]}
