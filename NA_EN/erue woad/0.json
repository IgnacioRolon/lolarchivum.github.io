[The updates are Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3176936) and Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3176934)] \r\n\r\nI can connect the the game just fine but a few minutes in and all of a sudden my ping goes from 46ms to 170-220. I'm able to chat just fine but my commands I issue to my character take a good 1-2 seconds to register and sometimes they don't even register. Sometimes my character will literally just stand still and no movement happens. I don't think it's packet loss either because everyone else in game is moving, cs'ing , using abilities just fine. I'm just stuck standing still.\r\n\r\nOn occasion I'll get the \"Attempting to reconnect\" window but it doesn't stay up for long. \r\n\r\nSo far the only thing I've found that \"fixes\" it is if i Alt+F4 and reconnect. Then from that point I get into the game with 46ms. Sometimes this lasts for 10 mins sometimes it lasts for 2 mins. \r\n\r\nI really think these issues have to do with the new Updates Windows 10 just put out last night.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-25T22:48:36.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windows 10 updates only generally touch local files on your PC, so they're pretty unlikely to affect your connection. The symptoms you describe are generally an indication of either high packet buffering or packet loss (of outbound packets). Most of the time these issues are a result of ISP routing problems or problematic local network settings. I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step to resolving this.\n\nLet me know if this continues to happen to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Zulu2401","date":"2017-04-30T15:58:26.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same exact problem. Attempting to reconnect about every 2-5 mins during matches and last up to 5-8 mins. Your connection guide didnt help the issues isnt a result of packet loss. I've tried every trick i know and nothing seems to help it.","replies":[]}]}]}
