In the loading screen it just crashes and I keep on trying to disconnect and it will just kick me out of the game or will keep on doing this until they make a remake! This has happened to me twice this week and I do the repatch thing on the launch client but it doesn't work. I have now been placed in a 20 minute queue for my game crashing! :l","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T01:40:49.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of intention, a disconnection negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a key reason why disconnections are all treated equally and why penalties cannot be modified in any way.\n\nThis type of crash often occurs if there are local network settings that conflict with League. I strongly recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a next step in troubleshooting this.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreatKingCurtis","date":"2016-10-18T00:48:55.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happen to me in dis mother fcker rip ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­","replies":[]}]}
