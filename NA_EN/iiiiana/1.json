I've been looking forward to the next Gamescom and the new Arcade skin, so I drew a concept for an Arcade Lissandra skin:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0nJ3xar.png\nHer headpiece would be some kind of stylized virtual reality goggles (sharing visual similarities with Gurren Lagann) and her Ice trail would now be a flowing formation of hue-changing pixels. I also made a gif to have an idea of what it would look like in game:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NKUyZsP.gif\n{{champion:127}}\n\nEDIT:\n\nHere are some sketches and ideas for her Glacial Path (E) skill and Recall!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UnKxC6X.png\nHer glacial path could have \"buffs\" (don't affect the game, just for viewing pleasure) from vintage games such as pacman ( the cherries), being popped as her claw crosses them. In the end of the skill, there could be a finish flag representing where she would teleport to. Unfortunately I don't have an idea on what her claws could look like.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NEY92DK.png\nHer recall could be inspired by dance dance revolution, having lissandra dance and fail the moves (she doesn't have feet! I guess). In the end of the recall, she could get either disappointed (like heartseeker varus recall) or angry (like arcade miss fortune recall)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Galetta","date":"2015-02-02T19:00:52.627+0000","up_votes":134,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP Particle Artists.......but we need this. :P","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-02T20:37:00.005+0000","up_votes":67,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 to needing this!","replies":[{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-08-19T22:55:39.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Battle Boss Lissandra","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blainezy","date":"2015-02-02T20:25:45.781+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"So are you saying.. we need the arcade lissandra  skin or we need particle artists?","replies":[{"poster":"missinggrave","date":"2015-02-02T21:24:55.365+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both.","replies":[{"poster":"SunGold","date":"2015-02-02T23:42:13.041+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"i love the concept","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-02-02T21:26:41.916+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Galetta,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=kUtuaRL7,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-02-02T19:00:52.627+0000)\n>\n> RIP Particle Artists.......but we need this. :P\n\nYou can do it Particle Artists!

Like, have her fall into the fountain/recall away pixel by pixel, sort of like tetris falling and whatnot. Then, when she's all there, have her come into focus.
