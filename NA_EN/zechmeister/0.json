Or try to put push to talk in another button like C and see if it still messes with middle click. \n\nI still believe that you somehow try to give windows a command but windows cant do it cause you are in a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Zechmeister","date":"2019-09-01T20:14:33.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their software is even worse than their hardware, notoriously janky to the point most of the people i know who used it have switched to logitech or steelseries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"giannishannibal","date":"2019-09-01T20:24:17.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your welcome my friend. FYI sometimes software in PC/mouse/keyboard/mobile get error that cant find solution by themselves and may enter a infinite loop like everytime you press Ctrl shit happens. And restarting the devive actually forcefully shuts downs the process and exits loops and generally fixes alot of problems.\n\nMore info  like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lish5QFp81E.

So you are giving the PC the command to zoom in/out but LoL doesnt have such a command so it stops the movement command. I suggest put the push to talk button somewhere else ( keyboard or mouse side buttons) or get an microphone with mic On/Off button.","replies":[{"poster":"Zechmeister","date":"2019-09-01T18:51:34.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i shut off push to talk and turned off team speak 3 that did not fix things.\n\nO i dont use the scroll up down i actually push the button down. and move it like any other rts game aka wc3 starcraft etc.....","replies":[]}]}]}
