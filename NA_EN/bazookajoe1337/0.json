I cannot figure out why or what started it but it started happening right before the season ended.  It basically causes my champ to stay still but everything else is continuously moving and then 3-4 seconds later I'm either dead or I shoot back to where i came from.  All sounds become quiet like the game is trying to catch up with itself.\r\n\r\nI have been playing for 3 years and have never had an issue with ping or lag or packet loss etc., so this is all very new and mysterious.  I ran a ping test to the NA server and this is the result:\r\n\r\nhttps://ibb.co/c4Ur7m\r\n\r\n0 packet loss, 47-43 MS.  \r\n\r\nMy PC is an Alienware Intel-Core i3 3220 CPU@3.30 GHz 6GB Ram, NVIDIA GeForce GT640.  Not the greatest computer but it should be plenty to run LoL, and like I said I have never had an issue before until about 3 weeks ago.  \r\n\r\nAny thoughts or ideas I could try?  It would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-22T03:39:51.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way you describe it makes it definitely sound like packet loss, but yea that traceroute looks pretty clean. I'm not personally seeing any reason between your rig or your traceroute as to why you should be freezing like that, but go ahead and hit up our techs in a ticket. Make sure you submit your game and network logs for them to look through to see what might be going wrong!","replies":[]}]}
