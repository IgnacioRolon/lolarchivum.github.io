Somehow my accounts password has been changed and the email i used is different as well. When my friend tried to get me help through riot support they accused him of trying to hack my account. I have put in several submissions to riot support but none have gotten any replies. This is a serious problem for me because i at least 70 or 80 dollars on my account to get new champions and skins. The account that im not able to log into is Sadragonman213. It is a low elo account but i still played almost everyday. I would love to see someone help me get my account back and hopefully the help i get is from someone from riot who wants to keep me playing there game. If i dont get my account back its hard to say that i will continue playing this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T18:58:50.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The account recovery team won't recover an account to anyone but the owner and are extra cautious to be sure it's going to the right person.  I appreciate your friend willing to help you out, but only you can go through the recovery and restore access.  \n\nYour best bet is to use the [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) form to send directly to our account team.  It's really important that you don't spam tickets or constantly reply to them, as that will only cause delays and confusion.  Don't worry, we'll get back to you asap!","replies":[{"poster":"FTD Dragon","date":"2017-01-03T03:43:35.218+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for replying to my post but i do not remember the email i used for my account and if i have any clue to what it is then it is no longer the correct email. Every time i have tried to recover my password it says its been sent to my email. And all my current emails have not gotten an email allowing me to recover my password. If there is any other way i can recover it i will be glad to do it. I have every little detail about my account straight down to what my first champion was. Sorry for the late response because i was trying to level up this account to level 30 because i felt like i am no longer going to play on my old account.","replies":[]}]}]}
