They seem tailored to a world where W is as is live. What are the changes I&#039;m talking about?\r\n\r\n* Base health and health per level reduced, by 30 and 5 respectively.\r\n* Base attack speed and attack speed growth fluctuations.\r\n* Q AS bonus fluctuations.\r\n* Q armor/MR reduction changes.\r\n\r\nSo my question(s) is (are):\r\n\r\n* Is Kog going to regain his pre-rework statline? Most importantly, what is his base AS + attack speed growth going to look like?\r\n* Is Kog&#039;s HP getting buffed back up?\r\n* Will Q retain its post-rework value of increased attack speed from 15 to 35%?\r\n* Will Q retain its post-rework resistances shred based on percentages as it is live?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2016-09-13T22:49:41.390+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are currently not reverting all of his base stat lines back to pre-rework status, but will adjust them as necessary once we see how the partially reverted kit performs in the current live state of the game. \n\nThat being said, we are planning to revert his base attack speed and attack speed growth for 6.19 as they are more closely bound to to the feel of his reverted auto-attack paradigm.

That's how it worked in Season 5.  Would be pretty shocked if it didn't, since that would be a pretty giant Kog nerf.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-09-14T04:20:50.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot WaveBreak,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fUVZX8eJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-13T22:49:41.390+0000)\n>\n> We are currently not reverting all of his base stat lines back to pre-rework status, but will adjust them as necessary once we see how the partially reverted kit performs in the current live state of the game. \n> \n> That being said, we are planning to revert his base attack speed and attack speed growth for 6.19 as they are more closely bound to to the feel of his reverted auto-attack paradigm.

What do you want him to do?  How do you plan on making him a viable alternative to Jinx?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hadriel","date":"2016-09-14T00:11:59.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a bunch!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nyddhog","date":"2016-09-23T08:41:42.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although I can quite get why Kog maw is reworked (and nerfed), I currently am a bit sceptic. Don't you think Kog'Maw is going to loose what makes him different from other carries ? Is it going to be a less-mobile Jinx or no-jump tristana ? I purely ask it as I was (and still am) a main Kog'maw player and I enjoyed a lot the changes you made earlier. Kog maw truly was different and its weaknesses were as evident as its strenghts. Old kog maw, from the time of Trinity force, really had a different gameplay, power spike, and feeling. I am curious about the reasons (because it could have been nerfed in its 5as state, although that mechanic really was strong) and what are your intentions toward the void spitter.\nAnyways, glad to see you're paying attention to so many things, and I wish you'll succeed in whatever you try.\nSincerely,\nTa dada dada dadaaaa","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-09-13T22:37:01.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said the rest of him would be balanced accordingly to the revert of his kit","replies":[]}]}
