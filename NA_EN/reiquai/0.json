I'd like to request that you reverse this bug so that _**only**_ Star Guardian Jinx can hear her voice lines. Not to discredit the efforts of anyone who worked on the skin or the voice actress, but that skin is annoying as fuck to listen to (mainly because Jinx has an annoying personality).\n\nCan you also please avoid making future legendary skins that have global voice lines for every little thing that the champion does in the game? It can be quite frustrating when I have to listen to Star Guardian Jinx score a kill, or respawn next to me, or destroy a turret, or walk. With all due respect, it's extra noise that can be distracting and not everyone wants to listen to that stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-07-12T17:51:49.337+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NinjaGuy69,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=HQzUkL3n,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2017-07-12T03:55:41.753+0000)\n>\n> Hello good sir/madam.

Nobody besides Jinx should be hearing her first move lines.\n\nWhen we're designing the VO implementation of our champs and skins, we're looking for opportunities to support gameplay and also showcase the personality/story of the champion at the same time. We want to hit that sweet spot so they feel organic without being unnecessarily chatty. In the case of Star Guardia Jinx, I think she's a bit too chatty. That's good feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-12T18:22:16.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One other thing I'd like to add is that it's nice to see Riot giving a unique personality to each champion in a measured way. I've definitely seen an improvement in the quality of champion emotes over the years. If things like Star Guardian Jinx being overly chatty with her guns and troll emotes like Lux/Lulu laugh can be avoided, then I think Riot's design will be headed in a perfect direction.
