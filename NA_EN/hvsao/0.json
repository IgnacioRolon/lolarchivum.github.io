No one can blame riot if they provided the option. Especially when it comes to critical games like provisional or matches that put you into promos. \r\n\r\nAlso when it comes to player dissatisfaction, allowing the option of opting out of autofill is better then forcing autofill. \r\n\r\nIn a competitive team environment adding such uncertainty by forcing a player to play a less then optimal role, will drag the entire team down. Additionally if they are facing and opponent who does excel in the role, it creates an unfair match up. \r\n\r\nAlso there is no real reward for succeeding in an forced auto filled position. You don't gain additional LP, nor are you protected from losing LP when you had no choice in the matter. \r\n\r\nI know that there are efforts being made to reduce auto fill, but it really sucks when you queue for mid or top and end up being forced to play jungle.","replies":[]}
