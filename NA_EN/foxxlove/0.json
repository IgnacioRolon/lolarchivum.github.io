I'm not big on the forums in general but I'm doing this because, odds, ends, and trivial complaints aside, Riot provides incredibly timely support, expansive development, and tons of entertainment to millions upon millions of players. All that for a FREE game. When I played Runescape and payed for it way back in the day, Jagex sucked in terms of serving the community and dealing with the game. When I played WoW shelling out $15 monthly with additional startup costs, I felt the lack of transparency and impersonality of Blizzard was a serious negative. Until I wanted to, I didn't pay a cent towards League of Legends, but having seen the work of the company, I realized putting money towards RP was not just an acceptable, but actually a worthwhile thing to do. Riot deserves our support. If you don't want to spend money, tell 'em thanks and I'm sure it will be appreciated! \n\nP.S.
