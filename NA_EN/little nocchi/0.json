Client Wont Open!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm running windows 10 on some old dell laptop.\r\nMy computer can handle the game fine with medium high graphics with well over 60fps. \r\n\r\nBut the issue I'm having is that the client won't open. Originally it would open but just give me a black screen, I couldn't even minimize or close it at all so I would have to go into task manager to close it. To try and fix the problem I uninstalled the game and then reinstalled it but now everytime I open it, it says it is already open. I've had task manager open while this error occurs and there is NO GAME RUNNING AT ALL. IT said literally nothing was running. Is there anyway to fix this? I would like to play before my rank deteriorates.  I'm desperate at this point :&lt;\r\nThanks! - Nocchi","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-26T00:57:48.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're experiencing is a common occurrence if your connection to our patching servers is *unstable or poor*.
