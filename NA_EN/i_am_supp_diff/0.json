For example: If I choose the fire evolution, I will be unable to select that evolution when I go into the second half when I am back to the base Lux evolution at the start of the 2nd half and I will have to choose a different version like water, wind, etc. Curious if any other players have noticed or experienced this. Thanks and have a great day!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-12T18:34:21.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
