I didn't have this issue with my other laptop. Yes it's not Intel but awd? Anyways besides that the download is around 12000 MB not a typo! Why am I wasting hours on a download?\r\n\r\nAny help would be nice. I tried uninstalling and re-installing. First time it downloaded and then went to the login I loaded in and it never let me play because it still showed in the top left downloading. Then when I uninstalled I'm stuck on the screen before the login. \r\n\r\nPlease help fellow Lawlers","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-13T22:29:50.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Download can vary depending on each PC, with factors like network strength and even the hard drive.  Unless you're getting any errors, it's best to leave the update alone.  Closing it early can cause it to scan your files for corruption.

Figured it should run League just fine but I am trying to download the game and it is stuck at 0% and is loading incredibly slow. Will likely take a few years to download at this rate. I wonder if these issues are linked to the previous patch","replies":[]}]}]}]}
