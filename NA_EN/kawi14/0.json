The steps requested are asking for logs which will help us get context on your specific issue.  Without that information, we'd be grasping at straws so it would be in your best interest to get that over to him.  If you like, you can use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically grab those logs.

It's generally up to the manufacturer to make sure its hardware stays up-to-date on any software changes that may occur during the hardware's lifetime. League is no exception--there is inevitably a feature that clashes with an old hardware's ability to run the game. The game may still function to a limited extent on that hardware, but we can't guarantee it.\n\nSadly I don't know when this fix will be out and I am unhappy with this response myself but I had to be honest with you, there's not much more to be done.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}
