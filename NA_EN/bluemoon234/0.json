Couldn't pull up the chat either to let my team know something was wrong. I tried using the track pad on my laptop too, but still couldn&#039;t click anything.  I just went into the Practice Tool and had the same issue. Had to do ctrl+alt+delete to get task manager up so I could leave - the esc button wasn&#039;t bringing up the window to exit. \n\nI can&#039;t really leave any steps on how to recreate the issue. It&#039;s literally just go into a game and try to shop or move. If nothing works, you&#039;ve successfully recreated the problem. I&#039;ve seen some others have this issue. If we can&#039;t play the game, that&#039;s a pretty huge bug..... I was wondering if there has been any update on this? \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-19T23:23:00.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bluemoon234, \n\nI'm on skins and don't have a whole lot of troubleshooting knowledge, but I've experienced something similar and it turned out that a Discord overlay wasn't playing nice with my LoL client. Is it possible something like this may be the culprit? :o","replies":[{"poster":"bluemoon234","date":"2018-03-20T01:19:17.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, maybe. I did start using Discord recently. I honestly didn't think of that. Today I uninstalled and reinstalled LoL and that seemed to fix it for now, but I haven't tried playing with Discord yet since the reinstall. We'll see. :) Thanks for responding!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-20T15:53:24.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem!
