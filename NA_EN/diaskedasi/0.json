I can move my characters and click on my abilities (if I try hard enough) but I can't move my screen anywhere on the map. It's just stuck at my fountain. The only way I can fix this bug is by disconnected, but by the time I reconnect, 2 minutes have passed and I'm already far behind in the game. \r\n\r\nI would like to know if anybody else is having this problem on their mac and what they did to get rid of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T17:18:33.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have a corrupt config, so it's failing to receive your inputs.  A[ config reset](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues#mq2) should fix this up, but be sure to test it in a custom game.  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
