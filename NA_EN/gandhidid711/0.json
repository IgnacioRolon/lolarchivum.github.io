Wish they'd never touched it though, because it felt so natural given the theme of champion. But what am I talking about? This is the same balance team that lets {{champion:157}} to remain broken for ages. Riot's golden child.\n\nOn the other hand {{champion:17}} is the mascott that nobody gives a damn about and is being mocked. So there you have it. I'd say it'll take probably 2-3 more days for them to fix the bug. Remember zz'rot portal?

It is suitable for server maintenance, but lacks information about issues like disabled game features. I'm not asking for up-to-the-minute updates, but perhaps a daily notice letting players know that you have found the problem, or have a team of people working on it, or that you care at all about the missing game feature. \n\"We are currently working on a resolution\" is something I've heard from government, and they can take months or years to fix simple problems. Sometimes the players get the impression that the game programmers/troubleshooters just pick and choose what they want to work on on a whim.
