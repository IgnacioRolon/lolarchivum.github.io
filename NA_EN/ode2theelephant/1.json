When  I restate the client it will not let me re-connect then give me a deserter penalty. Please fix this or at lease give me the chance to remove it by putting in a bug report.\n\n- Now my friend just crashed the EXACT same way and we have to wait for another 5 min to que...\n\n- It just crashed AGAIN today and gave me a 15 min deserter... please... fix this...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T17:17:56.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you disconnect from champ select, the server sees it as a dodge, and continuous dodges will give you low priority queues. Crashes in champ select are typically caused by your connection being unstable to the server and dropping off enough to disconnect from the game platform service entirely. To combat this, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), which goes over the most common solutions.\n\nLet me know if you still see issues after working through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
