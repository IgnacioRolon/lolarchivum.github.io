Was fine for the first 5 minutes after that i proceeded to get heavy fps Drops, i usually run over 100 easy but for some reason i was getting anyone from 5-25 fps. So i decided to log out and reconnect becasue my ms was completely fine it was at 39ms. But once i logged back in i couldn't connect and my computer said \"unknown error\" and just kept popping up so i logged out and tried logging back in and it just sat there authenticating then said \" Unknown Error\" AGAIN. Finally just logged back on  pressed play button after 2 mins delay showed game modes. Ima try and get into game now wish me luck.\n\n\nEdit: Constantly Dcing client saying \" Failed to create mastery page on server it may be connection issues\" Even tho before it was fps now its my connection... Fyi im not even touching my masteries lol","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T19:32:40.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These error messages and the issue you're explaining suggest a very unstable connection that's failing to hold communication with our game or authentication servers.  Since you're getting left behind, you won' be able to sync mastery pages or even stay in-game.  I suggest running through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this.  Make sure to select the OS specific to you as well.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
