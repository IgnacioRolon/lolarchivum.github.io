Why does Riot even let the players say that when they know that it makes people want to smash their computer into a million pieces? Behavior like this very is unsportsman like and rude when this happens to people on the receiving end of a massive loss. I want to play the game for fun, but it does not end up fun when you're steamrolled by the opposing team and instead it turns into the enemy team recall taunting you and killing you with provoking. Will there ever be any sort of change in the future or being thought of that will stop players from saying provoking phrases or words like \"EZ\"?","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-10-19T10:13:36.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This one again.
