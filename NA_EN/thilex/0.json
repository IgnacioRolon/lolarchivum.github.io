After re-setting up my desktop, making sure everything was plugged in, I thought it was fine. I went to play some LoL a day later, and about 20 seconds into the game, my computer \"froze\". ctrl+alt+del did nothing, nor anything else. \r\n\r\nWhen it froze, blue horizontal \"lines\" appeared on the screen. The way they were formated it looked like a combination of periods/decimals and hyphens to give them a curvature, kind of like a sine wave.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I figured it was a graphics issue, so I reinstalled my drivers. I played a game, it was fine.\r\n\r\nI go to play another game, and it does the same thing. Now that I've restarted once more, my resolution on my screen as shrunk, and the same lines are now ever-present, only their color changes with whats on the screen.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it's a problem with my graphics card, but I'm not the most tech-savvy in the world.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-28T20:33:19.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like this could be a potential hardware failure situation.
