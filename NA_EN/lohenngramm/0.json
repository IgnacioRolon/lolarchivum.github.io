I think Thornmail is fine.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"So I&#039;ve seen a bunch of threads ranting about {{item:3075}}  and how useless it is and I don&#039;t really get it. Thornmail is a very specialized item meant to counter heavy auto-attack focused comps, like a {{champion:107}} jungle, {{champion:157}} mid and {{champion:236}} bot. In those situations you would be stacking large amounts of armour, including {{item:3047}} , {{item:3068}}  and {{item:3143}} , which would both further reduce the enemy&#039;s damage but also increase the damage Thornail deals to them.\r\n\r\nSome math to illustrate:\r\nSay a Lucian with 100 AD attacks me. If I only have Thornmail, then it will reflect 40 damage (15 + 25) back to Lucian where original Thornmail would only reflect 30 damage. Combine it with Ninja Tabi and now I&#039;m reflecting 47.5 damage (15 + 32.5) and have 12% DR against auto attacks. As the value scales with both enemy damage and armour, the value only increases as the game goes on and since it&#039;s calculated BEFORE armour pen, it won&#039;t be reduced by the Last Whisper line. Throw an {{summoner:14}} on the late-game enemy adc on top of this and they&#039;ll kill themselves trying to auto-attack you.\r\n\r\nBasically, while the changes to Thornmail will always make it most useful on champions that can naturally buff their own armour, they also made it much better at it&#039;s highly-specialized purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-07-23T10:18:58.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really skewed example.
