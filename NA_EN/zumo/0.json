I mean, with such a big and complex game, there are going to be a lot of broken aspects that are op, or some champs being trash, but like one minor change can make them interact with certain things completely different, like nerfing the ratios on an ability that is used as waveclear can make that champion's roams much less effective, which is a much huger nerf than intended.  i feel like people need to realize how impactful a small change could be.

They&#x27;re simply not true and, real talk from someone on the dev side, I think topics like this can be really discouraging for Rioters who want to come here and talk directly with players.\n\nWhile balancing is difficult, Riot's track record isn't exactly admirable. You might think they do a good job, I feel I'm on the verge of quitting every time they make a stupid change that endangers my champion, like the recent Sudden Impact changes that were reverted on PBE before they even had an opportunity to be released. I understand PBE is tentative, but this kind of thing feels like it happens all the time. \n\nIt should be a clue when a massive amount of people threaten to quit, over certain changes, that maybe there isn't enough forethought to them. I disagree a single player of Katarina would ever 'thumbs up' that kind of change to her balance, so my assumption is none of you ACTUALLY play Katarina, or the Katarina Tester didn't show up for work that day, and so I feel where the OP is coming from, despite being rude, you, as a company, make extremely controversial decisions. With less people to scream \"STOP\" you would have easily tanked my favorite champion to a subpar 40% winrate, for who knows how long.\n\nPeople often considered you(Riot) make balance changes themselves sometimes, purely for the controversy and memes. That is not a good image for your company, if true or not. It also has an origin, so while a meme seems easy to write off, it's still based on some truths from the past. There would be less joking, with less to joke about. \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Sp√¢rky","date":"2018-03-25T14:46:28.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just going to throw it out there that not as many people want to actually quit as you'd think.

I've started with 20 Magic Pen for years, and Riot just joked about making it 0 through most of my rotations. Many Katarina would have -actually- quit over this, not just me.\n\nIt _already_  takes skill to manage its 4s cooldown with 5s a uptime, so whatever Silver player convinced Riot this means 'permanent' is also boosted. It was also nerfed with 0 context...other than Irelia rework being recent, the rune obviously synergizes with Katarina more than any champion- it literally felt like they didn't know this as they nerfed it as Kat continue to take huge winrate drops, they almost end with a nerf worse than everything before it...\n\nYou can't even use many broken kat combos now because of the cast time on E, and the way the system tries to execute abilities between two channeling moves, verses one. Like, it's not the most common knowledge, but you can't even spam Katarina abilities anymore without fear of deleting them from que itself, and this 'nerf' isn't even addressed in any notes at all, just an annoying side effect of the E cast time creating an actual problem more substantial than any of her nerfs. It's very easy to test, just try to cast QWE as fast as you can in training, and you will eventually notice it dropping moves. It's just getting ridiculous as a kat player. Remove my Q cast time, make me happy, or something, otherwise it's just endless misery at this point. I have 4 second pentakill clips, where I'm channeling Q and E over 2 entire seconds between resets themselves, and half the play. It's barely enjoyable to execute.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2018-03-25T06:21:40.818+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"Props for sticking up for your company.

You can back to the Season's where Morello's Team was doing the balancing for the game and compare it to now with Meddler's Team. There is a vast difference between them, whereas one team took precautions as to not let things spiral out of control the other is trying to hide the fact that they may have messed up and know about it. It's a difference between knowing you've done wrong and hiding it and actively hitting the issues that were created to return the game to a balanced state. As it is now there is too much damage in the game and the game has been balanced around that power creep, Champions and Items, that it creates a game where many people even streamers find it being tedious to continue playing the game. We want the Balance Team to communicate with us and take our feedback seriously, though we may have some biases we are still a reliable source for knowing where to make tweaks. As said previous by some other Rioter: \"There are more than a million games played on launch of a new patch, and not every bug will be caught during internal testing as there are a multitude of variables.
