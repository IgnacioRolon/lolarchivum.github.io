I'd like to present you the very first Champion Concept created by me and **UninstallWizard**, to whom goes most of the credit for this creation: **Xaius, the Crime Hunter**.\r\n---\r\n**Lore:**\r\nDestruction, and sometimes death. That is what occurs when someone happens to escape the deadly clutches of Xaius, the Crime Hunter. \r\nOriginating from Piltover, he has developed a great passion and a great dexterity for weapons and explosives, and that since his early childhood, when he sneaked into his father's workshop to toy with the various equipment that he built.\r\nDespite that the great collateral damage he causes when his target escapes is disapproved by the Sheriff (but not by Vi), his efficiency at criminal hunting is invaluable when it comes to catching them for the law.\r\nUsing a kit of weaponry that he himself designed, not without the help of his father, he has everything he likes and needs to keep Piltover clean and rack up the gold. But with the evil-doers in the City of Progress growing fewer and fewer, Xaius now looks elsewhere for more to turn in. And that is how he came to find the League of Legends, where he can use his expertise to bring down even the most dangerous and wanted of bandits.\r\n\r\n\"*Where you see a criminal, I see a bag o' gold.*\"\r\n-- Xaius\r\n---\r\n**Overview:**\r\n\r\n**Primary Role:** Marksman\r\n**Secondary Role:** None\r\n\r\nHaving fought a variety of criminals and bandits, Xaius can surprisingly fit in a fair number of situations (unlike most marksmen), though his goal remains the sole purpose of an AD Carry: deal damage and chase down.\r\nIt was our goal in creating him to make him a diverse AD Carry, relying on toggles, slows and, of course, damage to hunt his precious criminals in the most inventive of ways.\r\n---\r\n**Base Stats:**\r\n\r\n535 Health (+82 per Level)\r\n5.45 Health Regen (+0.55 per Level)\r\n200 Mana (+40 per Level)\r\n7.1 Mana Regen (+0.45 per Level)\r\n53 Attack Damage (+2.8 per Level)\r\n0.625 Attack Speed (+4% per Level)\r\n325 Movement Speed\r\n21 Armor (+3 per Level)\r\n30 Magic Resist (+0 per Level)\r\n----\r\n**Abilities:**\r\n\r\nPassive: ***Deployment***\r\n\r\n> A few seconds after switching his weapon mode, Xaius Deploys the active one, increasing the bonuses it gives to him. This passive resets when Xaius switches weapon modes.\r\n> \r\n> - Delay : **4 seconds**\r\n> - Bonus Increase : **50% for Plutonium Bullets / 100% for Energy Beam**\r\n \r\n~~~~\r\nQ: ***Change of Methods***\r\nNo Cooldown\r\n\r\n> Xaius switches between the two modes of his weapon available to him: Plutonium Shots and Energy Beam. As long as this ability is not unlocked, Xaius will take Plutonium Shots by default, but without the ability's bonuses, and therefore without gaining the bonus of Deployment either.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> -> *Plutonium Shots:*\r\n>  No Mana Cost\r\n> \r\n> Xaius fires precise (and expensive) bullets inlaid with plutonium, dealing additional damage at long range but at a slower rate than his Attack Speed.\r\n> \r\n> - Bonus Damage: **+10/+20/+30/+40/+50 Attack Damage**\r\n> - Range: **700**\r\n> - Attack Speed Decrease: **-20%/-15%/-10%/-5%/0%**\r\n> \r\n> -> *Energy Beam:* \r\n> 2 Mana per tick\r\n> \r\n> Upon attacking, Xaius' weapon continuously fires an energy beam at his target, dealing reduced damage that increases with each tick, **EXCEPT** against enemy turrets. The speed of the ticks is higher than Xaius' Attack Speed. Any enemy other than the target caught in the beam takes damage, although less than the inital target. While firing, Xaius **CAN** move and Anticipate. The beam only stops if Xaius takes any form of hard CC, changes target, switches to Plutonium Shots, moves out of range, or if the Stop key is pressed.\r\n> \r\n> - Damage Decrease: **-25% of Xaius's Attack Damage**\r\n> - Damage Increase per tick: **+10%/+15%/+20%/+25%/+30% Damage from the last tick**\r\n> - Attack Speed Bonus: **+50% of Xaius's Attack Speed**\r\n> - Damage to Secondary Targets: **75% of Main Target Damage**\r\n> - Beam Range: **550**\r\n \r\n~~~~\r\nW: ***Brainbuster/Not So Fast! - Overcharge***\r\n\r\n> This ability has two components: Brainbuster/Not So Fast!, only useable with Plutonium Shots, and Overcharge, only useable with Energy Beam. Each component of this ability appears when the corresponding weapon mode is active.\r\n> \r\n> -> *Brainbuster/Not So Fast!:* \r\n> 2 second Cooldown - No Mana Cost\r\n> \r\n> Using his Plutonium Shots, Xaius can toggle between two spots at which to aim on his target: Head and Feet.\r\n> \r\n> Brainbuster:\r\n> Xaius, aiming at the head, deals additional damage with each shot.\r\n> \r\n> - Additional Damage: **+10%/+15%/+20%/+25%/+30%**\r\n> \r\n> Not So Fast!:\r\n> This time aiming at the feet (yes, Vel'Koz and Anivia (and many others), this still applies to you), Xaius applies a stack of *Not So Fast!* at his target with each stack, slowing the target and capping up to 3 stacks at a time.\r\n> \r\n> - Slow per stack: **5%/7%/10%/13%/15%**\r\n> - Slow Duration: **3 seconds**\r\n> \r\n> -> *Overcharge:* \r\n> 8 second Cooldown - 50 Mana\r\n> \r\n> This component of the ability being an active, Xaius Overcharges his Energy Beam for a given duration, giving it the bonus damage of Brainbuster and the slow stacks of Not So Fast!, although the latter applies only once every 2 ticks.\r\n> \r\n> - Duration: **8 seconds**\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\nE: ***Anticipate***\r\n16/14/12/10/8 second Cooldown - 75 Mana\r\n\r\n> Xaius briefly activates his rocket boots, dashing towards the Summoner's cursor. He also instantly Deploys the active mode of his weapon if not done already.\r\n> \r\n> - Dash Distance: **500**\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\nR: ***Long-Range-Grenade Belt***\r\n3 second Cooldown - 50 Mana\r\n\r\n> Xaius has a charge counter, counting up to a maximum. These charges indicate the number of grenades available on his Long-Range-Grenade Belt. Upon activation, he throws a grenade at target location, leaving it to activate for a brief moment. If enemies are in the grenade's blast radius upon activating, it detonates immediately. Otherwise, it stays in stasis for a few seconds, offering vision and detonating if any enemy enter its blast radius. The explosion damages and slows enemies hit. Xaius gains one charge every few seconds.\r\n> \r\n> - Maximum Charges: **5/6/6**\r\n> - Throw Range: **1500/2000/2500**\r\n> - Grenade Activation Delay: **1 second**\r\n> - Blast Radius: **300**\r\n> - Grenade Stasis Duration: **10 seconds**\r\n> - Explosion Damage: **100/200/300 Damage + 50% of Xaius's Attack Damage**\r\n> - Explosion Slow: **20%**\r\n> - Gains a Charge every: **20 seconds**\r\n> - Charges upon unlocking: **One**\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Quotes:**\r\n\r\n***Champion Select:***\r\n\"*I can already hear the sweet rattle of coins...*\"\r\n\r\n***Attacking:***\r\n\"*You're not going far...*\"\r\n\"*Hello, evil-doer!*\"\r\n\"*I know you're hoping that I will miss!*\"\r\n\"*I'll let my weapon talk.*\"\r\n\"*Let's clean up!*\"\r\n\r\n***Movement:***\r\n\"*Let's hunt them.*\"\r\n\"*Good choice.*\"\r\n\"*Let's keep up!*\"\r\n\"*I can hear them running...*\"\r\n\"*How exciting!*\"\r\n\"*Ready to chase.*\"\r\n\r\n***Taunt:***\r\nXaius takes out a wanted poster, unrolls it, looks at it and frowns.\r\n\"*300 gold for this?*\"\r\n\"*Another mess I have to clean up...*\"\r\n\r\n***Joke:***\r\n\"*Crime hunting is an art. No, really, you still have to look good when I turn you in!*\"\r\n\"*I feel like a housekeeper... They pay me to keep the place clean!*\"\r\n\r\n***Laugh:***\r\nPretty obvious...\r\n\r\n***Upon switching to *Plutonium Shots*:***\r\n\"*These'll do the job.*\"\r\n\r\n***Upon switching to *Energy Beam*:***\r\n\"*Time to burn!*\"\r\n\"*Heat'em up!*\"\r\n\r\n***Upon using *Anticipate*:***\r\n\"*No, you don't!*\"\r\n\r\n***Upon throwing a *Long-Range-Grenade*:***\r\n\"*If you see it, you'll taste it!*\"\r\n\"*These things do wonders!*\"\r\n\"*This'll be the last explosion you'll hear!*\"\r\n---\r\nSo there's **Xaius, the Crime Hunter**. Hope you like his concept, a fair amount of thought and time went into creating him. If you have any thoughts, suggestions or comments, or even additional quotes, post away!\r\nThanks for reading and see you soon for another Champion Concept! :)","replies":[{"poster":"ModelT","date":"2015-03-25T00:48:29.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kit as a whole is over powered, but I like the champ and I'm going to suggest a change that would both not make him a Jinx clone AND make him a bit more balanced, without changing the actual champ too much.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMove Plutonium bullets to his passive, but all it does is ether grant passive extra flat damage / level, or a passive slowing effect.  Both make sense, as Xaius is using a heavier material for his bullets.  It adds some flavor to the character as a whole (I only shoot expensive bullets).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMake his Q JUST energy beam.  Rather just being an very over powered auto attack, it could function kind of like Fiddlestick's Drain ability, but still with the ramping damage.  The damage could increase as it levels up.  \nWhy do this?  Because Energy Beam as an Auto Attack replacement is FAR too powerful.  All you need to do is click an enemy and watch their health disappear.  Just build Mana regen, click a bad guy, and watch them die.  This ability requires absolutely no skill.  Even if you toned down the range to half a regular Marksman's range, the ability to run around and basically not have to worry about auto attacking is way too powerful.\nAnother idea:  Switch the Energy Beam active to his Ult and have grenades for Poke and farm and AoE damage at lower levels, and each tick could also apply on-hit effects.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat being said, the grenade ability needs a bit of work.  First:  what is the actual ability cool down?  You have the charge replenish rate, but no ability CD.  3 to 5 seconds seems kind of fair, but I'd also increase the charge time to 30 seconds.  This allows him to be a bit burst-y with the ability, but gives good counter play when out of charges, and makes him something of a higher skill champion.  As an Ult, maybe go from 3 to 5 charges as you level.  As a Q, 1/2/3/4/5 charges, making it a priority to level.  I'm bad at exact numbers, but the Q version should obviously be weaker.\nI would suggest getting rid of the vision and the wierd detonation timer effects.  It's a grenade.  It lands, and then explodes after a second.  You have a belt that generates grenades, isn't that techy enough?  Right now, you want Lux's E, Zig's W, and Teemo's ult all in one ability.  First rule of champion abilities:  Keep it simple.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRocket Boots, or \"Anticipate\" strikes me as, actually, very underpowered, since I really have no idea what you mean by \"active mode\" other than it activates his passive...  On one hand, it looks like you just gave him flash on a shorter CD, but at the same time, everybody else who has flash as part of their Kit gets some extra effect.  Shaco gets stealth, Ezreal gets extra damage, Kassidin gets OH so much, etc.  If it isn't a flash but a dash... than it's a garbage ability.\n With the rest of the changes I suggested, perhaps put something like a movement speed buff on it that makes sense with boots.  If it's a flash ability, I'd suggest the CD be 20 down to 15.  If it's a dash, actually change it to 10 seconds at all ranks w/ the movement speed buff increasing.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou're probably wondering at this point, \"What about my W?\"\nWhat you have on the W is a cheap toggle between awesome extra damage and a toned down Ashe's Q, and the ability to make Energy Beam WAY more powerful, negating their ability to escape the beam with a slow, and adding extra damage.  You can see why I suggested removing Energy Beam?  This ability isn't exactly \"in character\" from the lore, either.  It's not a gadget of any kind.  I have a unique idea that might be perfect for this champion, that fits with Marksmen, and provides utility and seems \"in character.\"\n\nHolographic Double / Holo-Clone Projector\nXaius makes a Holographic clone of himself in his exact position and directs it to move to target location, providing vision as if the clone were Xaius.  Xaius can command the clone to move again or to change directions during it's duration.  Two auto attacks or 1 turret blast eliminates the clone.  The clone shares all of Xaius' stat's and abilities at time of creation (including current health), but cannot auto attack or use abilities.\nNote:  After hitting W, you choose a destination, and after the destination is chosen, the ability activates, creating a clone in Xaius' exact location, but moving towards the destination, indistinguishable from Xaius.  While active, the clone can be controlled in ways similar to controlling Shaco's clones or Tibbers.\nRange:  \"Infinite\"\nDuration:  2/3/4/5/6 seconds\nCool Down:  30 seconds\nMana Cost:   I'm terrible at mana costs...\n\nThis gives Xaius a utility ability for checking bushes befitting a marksman, something of a misdirection ability, and this function is unique for this type of ability.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell... I feel like I just took your kit out behind a shed and did terrible things to it.  As it stands, your kit is busy, un-simple, and has too many elements that make it too powerful.  I'm not saying you have to use my suggestions... that'd be un-American.  They are just suggestions.  Wordy, thought out, suggestions.  i do like how much thought you put into everything else, and I won't rib on that for a second!\nIf you get a chance, check out my champion [Zuki, the Zaunite Package Boy](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/T9vzAEc8-campion-concept-zuki-the-zaunite-delivery-boy-melee-mage-pseudo-support-art-wanted).  I think you'll like it, since they both share a gadget approach to their kit.  Also... maybe name the E ability Jet Boots... or not use Rocket Boots in the description... >.>","replies":[{"poster":"Zawnius","date":"2015-03-25T18:32:58.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm... Indeed, after reading throughout your reply, I feel the same you did about the kit behind the shed, but in a very positive way. Your suggestions are very good, and seroiusly made me realize and question Xaius' overpowered, unoptimized kit. I have to say though, that Xaius is not entirely a gadget man. I will rewrite the lore about him, because he should feel indeed like a man using his gadgets, but also who, with his experience, adapts and changes to take down his victims in the best manner, hence the weapon mode swap and the aiming choice.\n---\nTo come back to your suggestions, I come to consider them very seriously, they sound very good indeed.\nA combination I could use is Plutonium Shots/Energy Beam/Overcharge for both weapons (damage only, no slow)/Move Speed Buff or Dash/Grenade Belt.\nI would keep the Energy Beam as an activation toggle (similar to Karthus' Defile) where he could gain a buff when toggled off, and also keep it as a replacement to his auto-attack. **BUT**, to balance it, I would put a very high mana cost on it, like 40 to 50 mana per tick, which would limit it quickly. Another thing (maybe better) would be to -like you suggest- make it an active for a given duration, with a moderate-to-low cooldown, and with high ramping damage to be effective.\n---\nAll in all, I appreciate your analysis and suggestions a lot (and BTW, your own Champion Concept, Zuki is very nice ;) ), and I will surely take some of them into account as we rework Xaius to be an even greater Crime Hunter.","replies":[{"poster":"ModelT","date":"2015-03-25T21:29:40.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad  you liked my comment.
