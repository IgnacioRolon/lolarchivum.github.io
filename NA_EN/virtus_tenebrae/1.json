Seemingly by complete chance, I'll get latency of about 120-220 for the entirety of a match-made game. It'll constantly fluctuate for the entire game, getting to lows of around 70 and highs of 300. This occurs entirely by chance, but usually happens once in every 4 games. It happens on both SR and ARAM.\r\n\r\nI've tried the Hextech Repair Tool and repairing the client, but nothing has fixed it. I just start the game with a ridiculous amount of latency. It's not an issue of my family leeching bandwidth or other programs slowing my computer down. The game remains slow even if I'm home alone and force-close all apps excluding League.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T20:22:25.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm yea it's kind of strange that your ping would be fluctuating that much even without anything else using the network. That could mean that the main source of the inconsistency is happening outside of your own network and along the route that your ISP is sending your connection.\n\nLet's run a quick test to see if there's any packet loss happening by using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Let it scan some recent League network logs from a game that had those ping spikes and link me a screenshot to go over with you.","replies":[]}]}
