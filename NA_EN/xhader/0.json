Just want to thank you for your work on Kassadin. Awesome that you spent your spare time working on him! I remember you talking about his VU on the old 16 page forum post about him & you get mad respect for following up. Especially with Harbinger blade fix. Not to mention I'm even more sad I didn't buy Festival Kass when I had the chance - it looks incredible. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI do have a few questions if you happen to read this;\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on his bracers/armguards? I'm so very happy you trimmed down all of his spikes, but for me his bracers are still pretty bulky & awkward. \r\n\r\nIs there any hope you (or someone else) could recolor his Prevoid VFX? Just changing them all to something like blue would ramp up the fantasy of that skin by like 10 fold. If it was left that way intentionally, what's your reasoning? Just the price of the skin?\r\n\r\nWas there ever a thought to do a little extra for his Deep One skin like changing his tubes to tentacles?  Appreciate the spike & kilt changes, but I'm still hoping for tentacles!\r\n\r\nDid you come up with any other versions of his breathing tanks?\r\n\r\nAny aspects you added that didn't make it to final production?\r\n\r\nAny other things you'd like to mention?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyone else have opinions to share? Anything to add/ask/discuss?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tokkelossie","date":"2015-03-06T03:15:28.861+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course!  I really appreciate that.  I'm really glad that I can share my excitement for Kassadin with you and all the other Kass-bros out there :)  {{champion:38}} \n\nI do, however, have to defer a lot of the credit for the update over to Champ Up team.  While I did work on the base model update, the Champ Up team did a ton of work to get it adjusted and working in game.  They also did all of the skins reworks, so I can't claim any of the credit for those.\n\nThe primary goal with this project was to fix the outdated model and texture, and it also gave Champ Up a great opportunity to take advantage of a bit of time they had to give him a new rig and animation set.  The goal was not so much to re-imagine him to the extent of, say, Sion.   \nHowever,  we also didn't think it was fair that some older champs had to wait for a full overhaul before getting some much needed love.   As a result, we kept him true who he is in League right now, but gave him a model and texture update to match our current quality bar.  \n\nThe added bonus in this case is that the 'infrastructure' improvements the team made on his rig and animations has given us a far better foundation to build on for any future skins Kass might get.  \n\nThe Pre-Void blade particle color may relate to price-point, but I'll check with skins team on that. \n\n\nThanks for the kind words :)  I'll make sure to pass the compliment on to the Champ Up team as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Xhader","date":"2015-03-06T04:23:04.025+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please do!
