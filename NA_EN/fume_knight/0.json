My PC suddelny slows horribly, and the whole operating system lags, no matter what. Low spec mode doesnt help, actually; nothing helps. Is there any way to make the client run better, and not slow everything so much? It really drives me nuts. \r\n\r\nBTW, it lagged before i reinstalled my whole OS, and after a fresh install, it does exacly the same, even my hard drive is freshly clean right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-20T16:46:24.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low spec mode should definitely help, but the cause of the issue might vary depending on where this is happening.  For example, if it feels like lag then there could totally be an unstable connection struggling to download client assets for you.
