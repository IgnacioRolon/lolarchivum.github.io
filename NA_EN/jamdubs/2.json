But I really do wanna say this while I have the chance to, before All Chat happens and everyone scatters. Anywho, what I wanna say is-\r\n[](http://i.imgur.com/dwh5A9X.png)\r\n***Thank you.***\r\n\r\nMore specifically, thank you for your response to the art I've posted on this board. It's really been one of the most uplifting things I've experienced, having you show interest in my drawings. It inspired me to [try new things](http://i.imgur.com/fLP8ezt.png). It inspired me to [experiment](http://i.imgur.com/Uxjd71i.png). But most of all, it just ***inspired*** me. I feel more positive about drawing again. You pulled me out of a really long slump in my artistic life, and for that I'm grateful.\r\n\r\nI've never really had such interest in my work before. Barring a few online friends here and there giving me kind words of encouragement and tips, I've mostly just been doing art for myself. And while art for art's sake is all well and good, it does get kind of... \"lonely\" might be the best word? I don't have many interests through which I can connect to others, so connecting with people through my art, even if that connection is as thin as \"I drew them something on the internet,\" that's awesome to me.\r\n\r\nNow, I know this is very silly and really over dramatic. GD is after all just a board that we dick around in and have fun in during our free time. To you, I might just be some twit who asks for ideas of what to draw and occasionally shares his LoL drawings. But, as someone without very many people giving half a turtle tickling fuck about my art, your response to my work? The fact that you take even 3 seconds to ask me to draw something when I'm taking requests? It might not mean much of anything to you, but it means the world to me as an artist, it really does.\r\n\r\nSo, once more, thank you. Thank you for the kinds words, the inspiration, and for not telling me to go inhale a porcupine for shoving my drawings down your esophagus.\r\n######...Like right now. Have a sketch of a Lulu pic I hope to start working on next week.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dwh5A9X.png\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** I drew stuff. You liked what I drew. Means a lot to me. Thank you. ~~OH LOOK ANOTHER BLOODY LULU DRAWING THAT'S A SURPRISE.~~","replies":[]}
