Obviously the perfect time to make a new request thread!\n[](http://i.imgur.com/Vm3hfPm.png)\n\nSo, still got about a month until my classes start (if I can even register. Stupid complicated systems). I&#039;ve been in a little bit of a dry spell. I wanna draw some champions. So, request away! Any champ, any skin- [even ones that don&#039;t exist](http://i.imgur.com/jvIYwT6.png)- doing most anything.\n\nThese&#039;ll pretty much be exclusively sketches, **[much like these](http://imgur.com/a/z2t8G)**. I might color them, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/sXdb7fU.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/zJAnZB4.png), but that depends on my personal emotional investment. \n\nI&#039;m particularly interested in male subjects as I need to practice drawing the less lovely of the sexes (with apologies to {{champion:44}} of course).\n\nI make no promises to what will and won&#039;t be drawn. Update frequency will depend on overall interest. If activity dies down, I&#039;ll deliver any requests I finish through target threads or by hunting you down in other threads.\n\nCompleted-\n[Vi boxing with Shyvana](http://i.imgur.com/kHkkWfs.png)\n[Pool Party Annie](http://i.imgur.com/E6afHFX.png)\n[Academy Darius](http://i.imgur.com/FtS7IXl.png)\n[Soul Stealer Vladimir](http://i.imgur.com/DEVLXUF.png)\n[Pool Party Nidalee](http://i.imgur.com/1OBqDtZ.png)\n[Blood Moon Yasuo](http://i.imgur.com/9rH2ARn.png)","replies":[]}
