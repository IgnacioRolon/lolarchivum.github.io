It&#039;s still very much an early concept but I need some outside opinions on where to go from here.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WOQn3OL.png\r\n\r\nBesides changing it entirely, I did try to maintain a few elements from the current design; mostly just spikes and some coloration. Otherwise I wanted Whomper to look a bit more ornate and complicated, and not just be this silly hunk of metal with spikes on it. Opted for a handle that one could actually grip, and went for something asymmetrical in the overall design to give it a small bit of &quot;weight.&quot; Those scribbles indicate ornate carvings in the gold-tinged base in the middle of the hammer.\r\n\r\nSome concerns of my own are mostly just its size, though as it stands in comparison, it&#039;s about the same size as her current hammer. I&#039;m also not sure if I like the spike on top and it&#039;s very possible it&#039;ll be gone by tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBe honest with me. I need a solid design for Whomper before I even begin trying to design the shield so that their styles match. So if you have a thought, a criticism, an idea, or a &quot;wtf sideburns,&quot; please lemme know, cause once the hammer is decided, that&#039;s it. No changes.\r\n\r\n######Yes, I was lazy and copy+pasted stuff IT&#039;S A CONCEPT.","replies":[]}
