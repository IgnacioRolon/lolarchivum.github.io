Reaver King?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like, from the Epilogue of Bilgewater event, that Gangplank was the only thing holding Bilgewater together. However malevolent as he was as the uncrowned king, he seemed to at least have a strong sense of keeping things in order. He was the final, most important cog in the well(?) oiled machine that was Bilgewater, keeping people from getting too wise for their own good and giving the city a powerful, if unpleasant, reputation.\n\nNow that he&#039;s been dethroned, the whole place is a mess. It kinda reminds me of the Lich King from Warcraft: Without proper direction and control, nothing in Bilgewater really gets done, and it instead devours itself and everything around it. \n\nDid Miss Fortune goof? Did she just straight up ruin her home for revenge? It seemed like she was doing it for more than personal reasons, even seeming somewhat benevolent in making sure all of Bilgewater saw Gangplank&#039;s fall. But if Bilgewater is just going to be in the throes of chaos now that Gangplank is not such a visible authority, it appears that she might have damned everyone in the city to a life of conflict. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions and all that, y&#039;know? Gangplank, for his viciousness, seemed to be precisely what Bilgewater needed to keep everyone straight(ish).\n\nGangplank is no doubt going to try and reassert his dominance, but at this point will it help? Will his return be seen as a sign of strength that the gangs will pledge loyalty to? Or will he simply become a big dog in the fight, and Bilgewater will remain in a state of civil war?

It's clear from his new VO and the epilogue that the whole experience has made him colder and more ruthless than he was previously. Before, he was methodical and knew what needed to be done to keep everyone in line and he did it in ways truly terrible, but there was still a bit of warmth to him, a respect for his fellow man (assuming they haven't crossed him). Now everyone is suspect after losing what he thought was absolute control. \n\nI personally like(d) Gangplank despite his viciousness. There's a depth to his character that goes beyond bloody violence for the sake of bloody violence. \"Every cut has a purpose.\"","replies":[{"poster":"JamDubs","date":"2015-08-03T10:32:53.432+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely agreed. Gangplank was efficient and ruthless, but he didn't show explicit malice. When a young boy tips him off to some important information, he thanks him with some coin and good food; he doesn't have to, but he knows that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. A little kindness or at least a show of gratitude goes a long way in earning respect, just as much as strength I'd say.\n\nBut now he has no reason to be sweet, generous or thankful. He has more reason now to be murderous and merciless than ever before. You're right, he's probably going to be even more of a menace now than before.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-08-03T00:35:03.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JamDubs,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=9XwEu7ri,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-02T20:50:11.649+0000)\n>\n>1.

Did that scarlet wench ruin everything, or did the old sea dog need to be put in his place?\n\nHolding a grudge for as long as she has, or for however long, dominates logic. She wants revenge and, at last, she got it (or some of it). She must have got goosebumps when she lit the sky up around Gangplank. He's still out there ... and she's hunting bounties.\n\nDense majorities of Bilgewater residents were Gangplank's gangs, maybe. 'Who cares anyway?', she may think. It's a lawless shit-hole with no integrity anymore. Let it ruin.\n\nMiss Fortune and Gangplank both track Gangplank's gang members. When things settle down; it won't settle down. There will be a power struggles or an empty husk. For Bilgewater to be useful again may need foreign influence ... and Bilgewater has its own Sea Monster trade and stolen stockpiles.

Who cares if everything goes to hell if you get the revenge you want?  But they took different paths.  Graves reconciled with the guy who destroyed his life, because they met, fought, and bled in person.  They had time to redevelop the old friendship and realize they both still wanted the same thing.  Miss Fortune acted at a distance, though.  She didn't realize Gangplank was the glue holding Bilgewater together, the one thing giving the place the order she wanted, and she couldn't put revenge out of her head.  She got her revenge, but at what cost?  Bilgewater is self-destructing.

She dosent seem to give to shits that Bildgewater is in chaos, hell, i think she might even enjoy it.

Her little revenge plot destroyed the pillar of order that Bildgewater needed, and she had no intention of fillin it in or caring who would get hurt from the consequences._** All she cares about is Revenge. She like Kratos, with GangPlank being Zues (For all ye God of War fans)**_.\n\n\"Zues must live for Olympus to prevail\" well, Gangplank must live for Bildgewater to Prevail.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2015-08-03T05:25:07.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have one of two ideas on how this scenario is going to play out in the future. \n\nEither 1: Gangplank will be consumed by a burning desire for revenge that rivals, if not surpasses Miss Fortune's own desire to kill Gangplank. Trying to kill the Pirate King, only made him mad. He will single handedly cut a path through Bilgewater, and indeed Valoran as a whole, just to kill Miss Fortune. Once he does, or perhaps something else happens, he returns to Bilgewater and begins to rebuild the empire he once had. Or,\n\nOption 2: Gangplank finds out who tried to kill him, (Miss Fortune) but instead of chasing after her like a mad dog, he attempts to keep a calm head. He decides that the best course of action is to reassert his dominance in Bilgewater to get back to power as much as he can, then once he has amassed enough men, gold, and other resources, he will THEN go after Miss Fortune with a vengeance.\n\nBoth of these stem from a single idea that Gangplank seemed to hold very dear to himself: Respect. All he asked for was respect, and if he got that he was appeased with the residents of Bilgewater. But now that he has seen that everyone doesn't respect him anymore, on account of he almost died in front of the whole city like a damn fool, he will go after anyone who does not swear loyalty anymore. These two scenarios would play out depending on how highly he held the idea of respect. I personally believe that number 2 is a more realistic option, but I also think number 1 could happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NegaDKR","date":"2015-08-03T02:28:23.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should have guessed that the lore team had some Discworld fans, I mean, talk about Vetinari job security.","replies":[]},{"poster":"J4kzy","date":"2015-08-03T00:23:34.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think Gangplank is going to be obsessed with revenge for MF destroying his body and reputation. he had it coming tho","replies":[]}]}
