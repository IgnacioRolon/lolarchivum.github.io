I'm gonna have some free time for a while, and I wanna draw some more champions.\n\nSo, if you want a champion drawn, lemme know! **Try and be creative!** I want to spend *a little* more time on these drawings, meaning there'll be some long periods without a new picture, but they'll hopefully be higher quality! Something you could erase my signature off of, post on reddit, claim as your own, and get, like, *4 whole upvotes!*\n\nI can't promise everything will be drawn. If I don't draw your request, I assure you, it's nothing against you. I am but one man, after all. Gotta prioritize.\n\nDo you have no idea how I draw? >[Check out my old thread.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/X0oQiHE9-i-wanna-draw-some-champions)&lt; The doodles there are a few months old, and I think I've gotten better since then, but those doodles will give you a general idea!

I just got news of the board organization business going on. I don't know how I feel about it, though my primary concern is losing this thread. I don't know if posts are being deleted in the merger or not, but in the offchance they are, I'm spending tonight going through every post here to write down the requests I've been given.\n\nI can't promise I can ever get to every request. I've flat out said that I wanted to be picky-and-choosy with this thread so that I can make more quality pictures. But some of the requests are really neat ideas and could help me out of an art funk in the future.\n\nAdditionally, I want to share myself with you all. I've been mostly hush-hush about it because I'm a shy fellow, but I genuinely like the lot of you. So, if you want to find me elsewhere online, you can find my tumblr ***[HERE](http://wwwjam.tumblr.com/)***.\n\nI rarely reblog anything, mostly posting my cartoons as well as the drawings from this thread that I particularly like. But I also occasionally (rarely, nowadays, thankfully) bitch and moan about my silly little life. So just a heads up on that.\n\nFinally, I want to talk to you, GD. I know this board might just be a fun little place to crack jokes, shitpost and more, but I want to tell you that you inspired me. You really made a difference in my artistic endeavors, and that is no lie. It means the world to me that you took an interest in my doodles, back when I was still thinking I wasn't much good. And now? Now I can finally look at my own work and say \"I'm really happy with how this came out.\"\n\nYour response has been overwhelming to me. It's melodramatic, but you helped me crawl out of a very deep hole. It means the world to me that any interest was ever shown in my work.\n\nI understand to most of you, I'm probably just some dag on GD who draws. But all of you, anyone who has ever commented on on my work, or requested something from me, you mean more to me than I can explain. It's hard to say that when I don't really even know any of you. But, to put it plainly, I'd be happy to have a beer with just about any one of you. If only I drank.\n\nThank you so much for your response to my work, and God fuckin' speed.","replies":[]}
