Instead at the taskbar [windows 10] it has a small empty but highlighted box as if something opened. When i click it nothing happens, nothing pops up whatsoever. Closing it tells me the program isn't responding and gives you that prompt to wait or force close. Even when I disconnect it opens and does the same thing. What can I do to fix this problem? What can be the problem? I just got a new laptop as well I don't understand how this can be an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T05:03:29.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is crashing for some reason, and that weird popup is most likely a popup trying to tell you League stopped responding is what it sounds like.

However even when i play the next day like if my laptop is on sleep, standby, restarted, or shuts off the problem persists making me repeat the process over. Is there any way to nip this in the bud to prevent this from happening? Is it an OS thing?","replies":[]}]}]}
