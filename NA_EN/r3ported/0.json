BS ult or not, her new kit is awful.  Her new visual update sucks too.\n\nI miss old Cassiopeia, before they dumpstered her and had the rework her again and again and again to \"fix\" her.\n\nI miss old Skarner, before spires were a thing.  \"We had to get rid of that permaslow, it was unhealthy!\"  LOL {{champion:245}}.  \n\nI miss old {{champion:82}}.  When he was the master of metal, and he didn't have to cheese you with dragon or a three-hit Q to do well.\n\nPeople are down on league because the things they like about it are getting changed, gutted, reworked, deleted or forgotten about ALL the time.  The dunk squad is fallen.  The full revive boogaloo is done.  Five supports can no longer troll-win a game and Xin Zhao is no longer a man.  New champs are overloaded as hell, and old, beloved champs are constantly changed into new things that their fanbases aren't attached to.  If you kill off a person't favorite character, they'll stop watching a show.  If you gut their favorite champs, they'll probably stop playing the game.\n\nImagine say... Walking Dead.  Now imagine that they re-cast Daryl Dixon.  The character is still supposed to be the same but the new guy just ISN'T the person that fans like.  Imagine them re-casting Tyrion Lannister.   Who still watches the show to see another dude attempt to mimic the guy that you liked?  No one.  that's how fans feel to see their favorite champ dancing around after a sloppy rework.  It just isn't the same character.  It ruins it.  It's crap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"R3PORTED","date":"2016-04-21T16:59:36.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is an easy fix...
