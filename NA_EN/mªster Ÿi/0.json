For 2 games? at most I was expecting a chat restric/ban, I did not even int, troll, or grief, only thing I did was chat related, why am I restricted from playing the game as a whole on this account, for 2 weeks? \r\n\r\nEven if there is more supporting my 14 day ban than just toxic chat, I'd like to know, I feel like a 14 day ban is a little overboard for 2 games of being a crapbasket in chat,","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2018-05-11T21:47:52.026+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, racism will net you a 14 day ban with no prior punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Mªster Ÿi","date":"2018-05-11T21:52:57.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"thats weird, but alright","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-05-11T22:05:14.999+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mªster Ÿi,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sb8lsufj,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-05-11T21:52:57.557+0000)\n>\n> thats weird, but alright\n\nIt's not actually that weird. If you went into a coffee shop, a restaurant, or a movie theater and you started using racist language and disrupting the other customers with it, you would be asked to leave. If your  friends find that behavior acceptable, that's fine, but you should leave it in other chat programs. Using it in League chat where others can see it is the equivalent of saying it loudly enough that other patrons at the movie theater are forced to experience the racist content of your speech. It's really just not okay.","replies":[{"poster":"Mªster Ÿi","date":"2018-05-11T22:44:33.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ya but they have chat bans/restrictions for chat related offences, that is whats weird about it I mean","replies":[{"poster":"Dolyna","date":"2018-05-11T23:03:07.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mªster Ÿi,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sb8lsufj,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-11T22:44:33.594+0000)\n>\n> Ya but they have chat bans/restrictions for chat related offences, that is whats weird about it I mean\n\nRiot has a zero tolerance policy for anything they consider to be hate speech. Using hate speech (or telling people to kill themselves) skips the two chat bans and goes straight to a two week suspension.\n\nKeep in mind that ANY negativity after this can get you a permaban.

Or that is sure how it seems when I go through the 15 or so threads on this exact topic today.  So many people who sit on their high horses and act like they've never made a poor decision and done something they regret.  In this case what the cat did was say a bad word a few times...a bad word...its a word...it's air.  Now words have power, but only when people allow them power.  He knows what he said was wrong, he just would like you to understand that it's his first offense and therefore maybe you should use some actual human judgement and not a bot on the situation before banning the cat from something he clearly enjoys for two weeks.","replies":[]}]}
