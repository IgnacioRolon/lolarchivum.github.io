I gladly pick Elise every time I get to jungle. My one downside to Elise is that she only has one skin, along with Jinx. The only other skin for Elise is the victorious skin which if I'm not mistaken was a season 3 reward for gold and higher. For some of us newer players that would love to earn the victorious skin for Elise along with the others can't get these skins because of them being season rewards. However, the other victorious champions have a large pool of skins to use. Jarvin IV, Janna, and upcoming Morgana, all have multiple skins to use whereas Elise does not. Elise and Jinx both only have their default and one other skin and I believe that if Yasuo can get a new skin (PROJECT:Yasuo) then Elise and Jinx should be able to get new skins as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2014-09-03T21:33:00.004+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do need more skins.

Hope you can share it with your friends in the company as it just lays everything I have on the table, as it were:\n\n1)  **Lore:**\n\nBeing a lore nerd for almost as long as I started playing (It was a Rioter who directed me to the story), I fell in love with the champ backgrounds and the JoJ and I started really caring about the game.\nThen, after getting burned by Narrative after:\nâ€¢ The end of the JoJ and the League Judgments\nâ€¢ The first apology for the lore team's silence after that happened without warning (January 2012)\nâ€¢ The way Karma's new story didn't seem right.\nâ€¢ The way Katarina's rework removed references to her father and made her feel like a generic assassin with red hair, big boobs and a thing for leather.\nâ€¢ The way Soraka's rework also changed Warwick and totally messed up Singed (who hasn't been fixed in two years despite numerous pleas).\nâ€¢ The Shadow Isles event that totally forgot Evelynn (a very interesting character) and messed up Maokai's origin (which wasn't fixed until after Freljord several months later).\nâ€¢ The Freljord event, which messed up even more champ stories, destroyed Trundle and tried to remove the Ionia references to Udyr, *and* how \"holier than thou\" we were treated by numerous Riot staff and how indignant they got when we expressed how much we hated how new Trundle felt like the Wampa from *Star Wars*.  \nâ€¢ The following year-and-a-half, where we were given nothing from the lore team, not even a \"Yes, we're still here, we're still reading your comments and we **thank you** for keeping the discussion going!\"\n[Note: That last one really hurt because as we were desperately trying to engage the company for something to prove our \"faith\" in them, we were getting bombarded with comments like \"Riot doesn't give a shit about the lore anymore\" and \"Riot can't make money off the lore like they do with eSports.\"   Meanwhile, the lore team sat silent on their pedestals in their ivory tower, not having our back as we were trying to defend our faith in Narrative and treating us, it seemed like it was beneath them to even say \"Hello\" to us, even though Riot claims they're for the community.]\nâ€¢ Tom Abernathy saying that \"plot doesn't matter in games\" and not really clarifying it to any satisfying degree.\nâ€¢ Being told, repeatedly, that what now counted as lore was marketing devices like the \"Get Jinxed\" music video, the \"Trials of the Poro\" cartoon, several comic strips (Quinn, Zac, SG Udyr), Voice over taunt Easter eggs and everything else except actual text-based stories.\nâ€¢ Rioters (who all claimed to not be part of the lore team) that would say anything about the story would direct us to the fan fiction section (with one trying actually to *promote* his personal series).  This was especially insulting since, as a League cosplayer and part of the creative community, what I wanted was actual story from the company, not some fanmade nonsense.\n\nAfter all that **abysmal **treatment from Narrative (along with the other points I'm going to make later on), I was ready to put anyone at Riot to task for making promises.  I was ready to give up on a game I spent over three years supporting, playing and cosplaying (despite how wonderful Riot staff treated me and my Braum cosplay at Anime Expo).\n\nThen, the dev blog and the, frankly, weak excuse for not saying anything to us.  The first feeling I got reading TommyGnox's post was, the lore team didn't care how loyal I was.  They were more interested in making empty promises, doing a less than token effort in communicating and, most insulting of all, trying to attract new lore fans instead of making amends to their most loyal ones.\n\nThe last straw came when Opeli used a really bad \"Big Lebowski\" reference and seemed to dismiss a comment about how bad the new Amumu short lore was, I was ready to fight anyone and everyone.

As they lost the right to my blind faith and destroyed my overall faith in Riot, I feel I gained the right to demand they act seriously about their own promises and lofty goals and press them when I feel they're not.  They got me to care again, and damn it, they're going to care just as much as I do.\n\n2)  **Zilean's \"new\" skin and the problem with ChampUp:**\n\nWhen I hear about the skin team making/planning new skins for \"forgotten\" champions, I'm reminded of what ChampUp team members have constantly said in the past.\n>\"We don't work on new skins for champs in the rework queue, since it would mean double the work for the team.\n\nZilean, despite not receiving a new skin since September 2010, was put in the rework queue because Meddler wanted to improve the \"time lord\" aspect of the champion.  It was then announced that Zilean's rework would only happen after Sion, Poppy, Yorick (another champion that needs some skin love, btw) and Urgot.  Evelynn and Taric are also in the same boat.\n\nNow, Sion's always been a goal of ChampUp to rework, but in the three years (and his Warmonger skin) we get reworks on Garen, Katarina, Soraka (now twice), Twisted Fate (and his Gangnam Style dance), Sivir (and her god-awful dance), Nasus (see Sivir), Sona (who needed a texture update more than a kit rework), etc.  The team has also failed to finish reworking a number of champs, most recently Fiora.\n\nDon't get me wrong, some of those other reworks were good Karthus and the Pentakill relaunch, Twitch, Heimerdinger, etc, but they weren't going to get me a new Zilean, Evelynn or Taric skin any sooner.\n\nThen, there's Celestine Soraka.  Riot memes like \"Soonâ„¢\" and <insert champion> REWORK WHERE\" came from Riot's inability to get their shit together and do something about a champion they considered a problem for years.  Morello just never bothered to pull the trigger on it.\n\nHowever, when the rework was finally released last year, it was without the teased \"Battle Priestess\" skin.  Months later, we would finally get a new Soraka skin.  What we got was a \"Final Fantasy white mage\" homage that was, frankly, not remotely worth the three year wait.  (In comparison, Udyr got the Spirit Guard ultimate skin after waiting nearly as long.)\n\nIt seemed that Riot knew they had generated high expectations for an epic skin with the three year delay and purposefully failed to try to deliver on that just to get *something* out for her.  Hell, most of my cosplay friends who like Soraka won't touch that design because it was so disappointing.\n\nSo, when I hear the skins team say \"We're working on stuff for Zilean/Evelynn/Taric\" I have all that history floating in my head.  And, ironically, the skin team is one of the few departments at Riot that seems to have their shit together (Final Boss Veigar being one of the best ever!)\n\n3)  **Dominion**:\n\nI loved Dominion when it came out.  Awesome story, faster games, everything was pretty good for me and my attention span.  Riot also seemed to be excited about the map, promising a ranked mode and support for the map.  The champion spotlight videos even had tips for Dominion.\n\nI even started shoutcasting Dominion tournaments for NESL in April 2012.\n\nThen, it seemed to get phased into the background.  Dominion champion tips disappeared from the spotlight videos, a de-emphasis on promoting the map (on direction from Morello and continued by Ghostcrawler) happened, promises of a Ranked mode were made and didn't happen,  Dominion tournaments were canceled and the community had to keep them going.\n\n(continued)","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-09-09T11:23:27.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"*(Continued from above)*\n\nThen, you hear that Morello is paranoid about promoting more than one map in League and that Riot won't be having a ranked mode because there aren't enough players to support it (a self-fulfilling prophecy and a situation Riot created).\n\nFrankly, Riot has done nothing but shit on the Dominion community, only offering a token effort (one guy) in balancing the map and even saying that's not worth the effort.  So, as a lore fan who felt the same way by Narrative, I can empathize with how that community must feel right now.\n\nThere are more grievances, but it's 4:30 in the morning and I need to get to work in a few hours.  I hope you were able to power through all of it and I hope you're able to share some of it with the relevant parties.

It doesn't feel like it because they are technically the same theme, name, and cost, but it *was* an upgrade we made at the cost of a lot of work.  Karma and Skarner both need new skins, yes; but first, Karma's rework needed time to soak, to rest, and so everyone can enjoy her new look & feel... and Skarner, well, we know the epic story of his kit changes.  Usually, we try not to make a skin for a champion that is having a major kit change, because it may alter the model/animations/particles significantly, which has a huuuge cumulative production cost.
