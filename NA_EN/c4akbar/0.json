Although it is novel to get a random keystone at set intervals, there are moments where you as a player are forced to play your champion in ways that are ineffective or awkward in order to proc a keystone. This is a blaring inconsistency that champions like Ezreal will struggle much with, as Kleptomancy had provided, while still random, a consistent source of income that fit extremely well with his playstyle. Having to force proc keystones like Phase Rush and Conqueror are tacky at best, and are not nearly at the same consistency that Kleptomancy provided. Taking this keystone sacrifices the consistent utility/damage that taking a singular keystone will provide over the course of an entire game. \r\n\r\nRiot, please consider reworking this item or reverting Kleptomancy.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-11-28T03:36:53.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not a keystone for Ezreal anymore. Take Conqueror.\n\nIt's amazing on champions that can easily proc any keystone, like Pantheon or Senna. You generate a ton of value by getting the full benefit of multiple keystones when your enemy might get only one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-28T03:27:05.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered using a different keystone?
