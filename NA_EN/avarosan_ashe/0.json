The icon I unlocked is the \"rengar plush in the jungle\" icon, however once received, it's just black. I tried restarting my client, that didn't fix it. I'm unsure if this is a bug or if it's something I can fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-21T05:05:07.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like that icon is celebrating black friday a little early xD!\n\n......Okay yea I apologize for that joke....\n\n\nThis is something we know about, and it sounds like the art may not have been uploaded on time. I've been told it should be added correctly either once the patch drops or at least by this Friday!","replies":[{"poster":"Avarosan Ashe","date":"2017-11-21T05:20:35.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Amazing](http://31.media.tumblr.com/01b378a0318d10574f4b4ec629bac088/tumblr_ml28q1818O1rqztkao1_1280.gif) thank you! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rainboom","date":"2017-11-21T04:24:48.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!\n\nUpon purchase, it did say that it could take up to 5 days for the icon to appear - which is probably why it looks \"just black\".  It's happening for me as well. Don't fret! It will pop up soon enough :) \n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"Avarosan Ashe","date":"2017-11-21T04:37:49.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reminder!
