When I click launch, the game patcher closes and tries to open up the login page of the client, but it fails to do so. I noticed the lock file, in the same folder appears and then disappears after about 5 seconds. This problem never happened before this patch. I was on League the day before 6.10 came out, and it worked perfectly then. I tried some of the Patching Issues Article suggestion but still the problem won't get fixed. Anyone know how to fix the problem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-18T20:34:09.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible that there is some sort of corruption with the patcher itself where it isn't letting itself launch.
