Just regular playing and having fun.\r\n\r\nPeople say, &quot;Oh, but I had 500 honor in each category and won&#039;t be recognized.&quot; \r\nUm, no.  They&#039;ll get every icon, then.  Cause I didn&#039;t have that much and it looks like I&#039;m going to get all the icons once the disbursement ends.\r\n\r\nThe icons are just a little something extra for fun.  And remember, the honors originally didn&#039;t have a reward at all, but Riot decided to randomly give us something for free.\r\nIf Riot promised since the beginning, a reward for awesome degree of honors, then their complaints would make sense.  But there was literally no expectation until they announced it this season.\r\n\r\nSo what are the complaints really about then?  People just like the complain or nah?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-09-01T15:43:28.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are surprisingly easier to get than expected.

I got all 5 of them, so yay me I guess. I think I will use the book one.\n\nIf there are people complaining about not getting an icon despite having a lot of honors then maybe Riot isn't talking about how many times you were honored but the invisible honor score that dictated if you got a ribbon or not.\n\nI could be wrong cause it has been forever since I cared about it, but I think premade honor was worth less and the more you honored people the less it meant.","replies":[]}]}
