I'm sure in a frustrated, even hurt circumstance it might seem that way, that Riot wants you to just report everyone and let the trolls of your team ruin your matches and your day while they don't really take care of what you just went through, but i'm sure they don't like working in the office getting emails about this crap just as much as we don't like dealing with it. Remember that when you take the mature steps to deal with the issue maturely you make the community that much more ideal. Strongly recommend that ignore button for the better, it works.","replies":[]}]}
