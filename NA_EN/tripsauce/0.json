It is made for split pushing with the passive it has.  He does not split push, his kit is horrible for split pushing and it is not worth taking up a whole item slot for stats with small numbers compared to other tank items.  It only has 300 health, that's not that much compared to other tank items with health 450+.  So, no Ohmwrecker.  It is good on bruisers, like Jax or Yorick, or anyone who is trying to split push and has some attack speed and attack damage and can destroy turrets quickly, because of it's passive, but not on pure tanks.  Sunfire cape had 450 health and 45 armor, and with the 25% bonus health increase on the jungle tank item, it makes it worth even more health.  So, the numbers are just way too small to be useful much for a tank IMO.  For a bruiser looking to split push it works great though.\n\nMy suggestion?  They need some new tank items.  They need a new armor health item, and they need a new MR/health item.  Besides the 2 they  have for support (Banner and Aegis) tanks only have SV and Banshee.
