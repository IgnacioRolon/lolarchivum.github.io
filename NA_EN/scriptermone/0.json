Fair enough.\r\n\r\nSo I create a ticket whilst logged out, after a bit of back and forward they can verify that I am the actual account owner.\r\nBut wait - here's the kicker... They either didn't read what I wrote or they simply didn't understand it, I explained the whole brute-forcing thing and in the reply they wrote this: http://imgur.com/a/QKbYg\r\n\r\nThey completely ignored my request about getting my name changed back and RP to be refunded, as far as they were concerned I needed help accessing my account which I didn't.\r\n\r\nAnd on top of all this, they've responded a few times the last 2 days but for whatever reason the ticket is glitched and I cannot see any replies anymore and any reply they send is not being sent to my e-mail inbox, I can still reply and I've said about 3 times now that I cannot see whatever they are writing and for them to e-mail me, but every day I just see the ticket as of when it was last updated. http://imgur.com/a/3WNP2 http://imgur.com/a/X63DC\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure what to do, but the person who has been helping me with my query (tomahelps) has not helped me in any way whatsoever.\r\nIf this can get some sort of visibility, hopefully someone from Riot can help move this along faster.\r\n\r\nSorry for the extra long post but I'm beyond pissed now and I'm really not sure where else to post about it as they don't seem to be able to help me.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T02:58:30.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like the specialist has reached out to you again today on your ticket.
