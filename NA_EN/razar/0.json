The first time this never happened. My internet connection is pretty fast (30 mbps +), and I have a high end laptop (a Dell XPS 15). The Specs are as follows:\r\n\r\ni7 6700hq\r\n16 GB RAM (DDR4)\r\nNvidia GeForce GTX 960M\r\n256 GB NVMe PCIe SSD (Samsung PM951)\r\n\r\nThe first time I installed this program it was pretty fast, and just zipped through the process (took 30-60 minutes). FYI, I have already tried closing and reopening the installer, and have no other programs open except for my web browser which I am typing this on, and task manager. It has been 4+ hours already. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T22:28:05.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update time can vary on a few factors like connection strength, but even how well your hard drive can write them.  As long as you're not getting any errors it's best to leave it alone, otherwise restarting it can prolong the process as the patcher would have to scan for any corruption.  I recommend using the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide just to maek sure that your network is tuned up and can grab updates smoothly.
