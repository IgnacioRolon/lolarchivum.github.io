Everyone going into the game knows exactly what their role and position is.  It allows me to practice new roles and try out new champions.  I feel like a dick if I go into a Blind Normal game spamming &quot;MID MID MID&quot; if I&#039;ve played 2 games ever as Zed.  I feel like this is the true purpose of Team Builder, because how can I ever get decent at popular roles (Top, Mid) if you have to just spam them in the chat and hope you got them first? \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s one problem though.  It takes forever, because no one wants to be Support or Jungle (and sometimes adc).  I propose a simple solution.  Add incentives to picking the least chosen roles!\r\n\r\nI have 2 simple ideas, and I&#039;d like to see other people&#039;s ideas and hopefully maybe a staff member will take notice:\r\n\r\n1.  Simple extra IP (nothing crazy, but enough to get people to think &quot;hey maybe I should play a few games as support to get some extra IP)\r\n\r\n2.  Daily Quests (shamelessly stolen from Hearthstone, give people a quest/goal like &quot;play 3 games as Support, earn 1,000 IP&quot;)\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to see if other people feel the same way and if anyone else has some clever ideas!","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-04-15T20:41:49.825+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd actually go so far as to say that Team Builder is meant to give you a tool that let's you play what you WANT to play.

They tried doing something different with Bard. Look what happened.\n\nWell, the community liked to play Gnar, Azir, and Kallista. Bard is just the support followup to the set of complicated champion pool.\n**They really did blow it on the Bard release though.** However, when I say diversity, I don't mean like that. I mean like...\n(according to leagueoflegends.wikia.com) There are 62 fighters, 32 assassins, 52 mages, 23 marksmans, 24 supports, and 36 tanks. If you queue and request a mage mid/assassin or a fighter/tank top, odds are, people are going to be playing them. There is a lot to choose from and plenty of differences between each champion in their respects. Support and Marksman, not as much. It is a real stretch to the 62 fighters you can take top as to the 23 marksmans and 24 supports you can take bottom lane, 47 to 62. This all is counted as sub-category too. So most tank-supports are already in the 47 possible choices for botlane. You can take your tank botlane like nautilus and your mage botlane like Brand, its just that between assassins, mages, and fighters in the other two lanes, I feel that they are inflated in champion choice in contrast to botlane in its entirety.\nIn conclusion, I just want Riot to focus on the roles with the least amount of champions in them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MightyRevenge","date":"2015-04-17T00:07:00.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a fair point actually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rescued","date":"2015-04-16T03:49:27.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"M0RDEKA1SER","date":"2015-04-15T21:10:42.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So much of this... +1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ghiefelstein","date":"2015-04-15T20:57:29.479+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My incentive to play support is because I enjoy it.

Increase jungle diversity, make sure different playstyles are viable. Revisit utility scaling on supports, the values haven't changed since the introduction. Give supports and junglers the xp and gold to participate in the game. What we need is another update like in preseason 4. Show us that supporting and jungling is awesome, enjoyable and appreciated.

Doesn't want to wait? Ok, he queues up as a Support. There is no intention there to play an actual support, but someone will accept him eventually, if only to get away from the wait times, and now he doesn't have to wait for the team to find a support. Hell, people queue up to Jungle and then go and lane all the time right now. This would just exacerbate that issue.\n\nReally, I'd just like to see the teambuilder matchmaking system fixed. If I have \"matchmaking adjustment\" active for a new champion, I probably want to be placed with and against people who are also learning new champions. If I don't, it's the other way around. Instead, what tends to happen is that people who just picked up a new champion are placed with and against people who are already considered \"skilled\" with the champion they're using.\n\nThis isn't fun for anybody. I can't tell you how many times I've had mirror matches as Vlad v Vlad (A champion I've been playing since s1 and most assuredly have played enough teambuilder games on to not have the matchmaking adjusted), and won solely because the other guy thought Abyssals was an acceptable item rush or something. I also can't tell you how many times I've had a close lane, but managed to come out on top, only for it to not matter one bit because someone in another lane had just picked up their champ for the first time today and was playing against someone on their main. Or how often I've had a support player get touchy when asked to build a sighstone 30 minutes in, because they'e \"never played support before and didn't know\" or some crap -- Again, the matchmaking seems seriously off in teambuilder.\n\nI don't mind waiting for unpopular roles. I just wish it put you on teams that fit your level, and put you against teams that matched that. It doesn't, at the moment, and the end result is that it's a really horrible place to learn.

So in the mirror match, you are being paired with somebody who has an overall MMR higher than you but is being match adjusted into your game because he has never played that champ/role. That is the theory anyway, certainly there have been matches where it doesn't feel like matchmaking worked at all. \n\nThe system you are proposed would either increase waiting time to an insane degree (e.g. only players who are the same MMR AND learning a new champ) or would be even more mismatched (e.g. players of drastically disparate MMRs who happen to be learning new champs). \n\nThe MMR system can be incredibly frustrating though, and I'm not saying it working optimally, but that its the reasoning behind what you're describing.","replies":[{"poster":"test account","date":"2015-04-16T19:45:37.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">So in the mirror match, you are being paired with somebody who has an overall MMR higher than you but is being match adjusted into your game because he has never played that champ/role.\n\nI find it hard to believe that someone with an overall higher mmr wouldn't know how to properly itemize just because the champion is new to them.
