This was even brought up while it was on the PBE and Rito didn&#039;t say or do anything about it. Everything else about the skin is great but this is a letdown.","replies":[{"poster":"Vonderhamz","date":"2017-07-29T01:51:52.457+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're totally right.

He literally waves the motions and it accomplishes nothing at all. No sound, no animation... =/  As the first twitch skin released in a long time (other than the championship one) I was really hoping for a more complete experience. Makes an otherwise great skin feel rushed tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"blackfootedfox","date":"2017-07-29T04:04:07.403+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"That was brought up when it was in PBE too, but the team pretty much just brushed it off.
