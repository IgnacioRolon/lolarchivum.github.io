There isn't any additional tax added onto those purchases, the prices you see are what will be charged (with the odd exception for currency conversions). \n\nDouble check that you're entering the card in the right place, and if so take a screenshot and shoot it over to our billing agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). With that, they'll be able to see what's going wrong!","replies":[]}]}
