I did not switch it back before I left and now that I am home I am unable to buy RP to do so.  Any RP purchase from my card gets declined because my card holder thinks somebody is stealing my card and buying things from Europe.  I bought RP from amazon but it says that I cannot use it because I am in the wrong region.  Would it be possible for me to transfer regions, then use my region exclusive RP card to pay for it?  This has been quite frustrating, has anybody else had this experience?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-19T03:00:29.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, welcome back from your trip!
