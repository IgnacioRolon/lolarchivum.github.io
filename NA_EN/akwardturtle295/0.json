I downloaded the new League Displays app, and set up a wallpaper set. I noticed that none of the settings actually allowed me to make the different monitors in my dual monitor setup have different wallpapers, contradictory to what was said on the League displays page. Any idea how to fix this? Or am I just not seeing the right setting?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-05T23:06:38.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That app definitely works for dual-monitors as other players have had success with it, so I wonder what's going wrong here for you. Reach out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to walk you through setting it up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-05T07:07:21.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a dual monitor setup, with one ultrawide. It displayed different wallpapers on both monitors without changing any settings. Just pick your images and apply it. However, the ultrawide screen was basically an enlarged 1920x1080 image with the top/bottom cropped off to fill the screen, which I didn't like. If they offered higher resolution images, I probably wouldn't have minded the top/bottom being cropped. But as it currently is, I personally decided to remove it and go back to the wallpaper I was using.","replies":[]}]}
