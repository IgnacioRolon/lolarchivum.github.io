Was your support actively bad, or were you just tilted by their admission of being high?\n\nThat said, you didn't mention if this was a reg or ranked, but I think it'd be pretty shifty to get messed up for a ranked match.

It's only a game. I'm pretty sure that you just posted this to rage and not for actual input, but I will leave you with this. Cannabis is decriminalized in several states. Odds are you have played quite a few games with high people. Chances are also good that you have played against quite a few high people.\n\nIs it bannable? I would think not.

There is no proper way to play the game. It's a game, everyone has their own ways and ideas of how things should be.\n2. It's not there fault they're incompetent. But let me ask you this, why are you guys at the same elo if they're incompetent, and you're not?\n3. The best way to get stronger is to carry \"lead weight\" for example, in real life if you wanna train your muscles you don't just lift your hands up and down. You pick up a weight. and you lift that weight up several times. Learn to pick up that dead weight and carry it, and you will become a better player","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-07-05T03:19:17.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If im 4/1/1 draven 10 minutes into the game and yet overall my team is loosing 7 to 22, then its not realistic for me to carry that game without a competent support.\n\n\"properly playing league of legends\" can be defined as landing skills, doing dmg, avoiding needless deaths, among optional other things.If you want to argue with that statement be noone's guest and just gtfo the gameplay boards.","replies":[{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2016-07-05T03:24:35.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"forget about everything else in the game.
