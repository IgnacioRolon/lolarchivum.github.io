Morellonomicon now builds out of Lost Chapter, which has both Mana and AP, so you can get a bit of each if you want.

In a \"diminishing returns\" model, your first flash gives tons of extra power, your next flash gives you somewhat less additional power, and so on. This might the case because, for instance, a match contains a sequence of \"flash opportunities\" that can be \"purchased\" by using a flash, and people who play smart will naturally tend to reserve their flash for the highest-value opportunities; additional flashes, then, simply let you buy second-best options, and third-best options, and so on. For example, let's say there are three opportunities: (1) Flash-baron-steal-ace (2) strong teamfight initiation (3) escaping a gank. A hyper-mobile Champion with two blinks might use the rocket belt to also pick up the third option, a moderate gain. But an immobile Champion with only one blink to start with would pick up the second option, a significant gain.\n\n# If mobility gives increasing returns, then more-mobile Champions gain more from these items\nIf giving a Champion +1 blink has increasing returns, then it's quite the opposite, as already-mobile Champions will gain more from these items than their less-mobile peers. An increasing returns situation would be one where, e.g., you can do awesome things with two flashes used in sequence that you could never do with just one, and thus a Champion going from one flash to two flashes gains more power than another Champion who goes from zero flashes to one flash.\n\n# In a diminishing-returns scenario, this item might be a good way to help less-mobile Champions\nMy intuition is that, on most Champions and in most circumstances, mobility has diminishing returns, so I'm tentatively for something like the rocket belt. I say \"tentatively\" because, as you yourself are obviously fully aware, it could have all kinds of unforeseen, complex outcomes. (Cue Jeff Goldblum.)\n\n# Concluding note: the PBE is (in part) for wild and crazy experimentation, so why not try it?\nBut I'm unambiguously in favor of *trying* it, at least on PBE. Isn't this part of what PBE is for? Getting large-volume, rapid feedback on sometimes quite revolutionary proposed changes. Sometimes I almost feel like Riot should distinguish between PBE updates, e.g., as \"first-run\" versus \"pre-release\". With the former being \"hey let's see what happens\" initial changes, and the latter being \"okay, we're pretty sure we want this on live, so we're just running it through PBE for bug checks and stuff\" revisions. That way, people might not freak out so much when they see \"first-run\" changes that give Tryndamere an AoE knockup ultimate and retcon Amumu's lore to a story about a trick-or-treater cursed to wear his bad mummy costume forever.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-04-07T22:32:50.076+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"> But I'm unambiguously in favor of trying it, at least on PBE.

Then we had to deal with the consequences for far too long.  Graves is still ridiculous and it's literally been months.  The reason we react so bombastically to terrible, ill-conceived ideas is that Riot doesn't acknowledge failure and revert a bad change.  They double down on the idea and we have to deal with a myriad of tiny changes to other parts of a kit instead of simply undoing their mistake.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2016-04-07T21:17:30.855+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":6,"body":"Maybe it's because anytime anyone gives ACTUAL critique it gets ignored if there isn't at least SOME ego stroking thrown in.\n \nPosts with only negative feedback, REGARDLESS of whether it's correct and totally logical,  historically get no response.\n\nOnly posts that are primarily inquisitive (so y'all can look smart), positive, (so y'all can feel good) or, ironically, thoughtless shitposts (so y'all can paint it like anyone giving negative feedback is a shitposter) get red responses.\n\nSorry if it's a hard pill to swallow, but it's the truth: Rioters can't handle their work being criticized or scrutinized. \"Praise us or you're wrong\" has commonly been the attitude for a couple years now.\n\nSo now you get stupid posts like OP because it's apparently the ONLY time you guys actually pay attention to players who DON'T like what you're doing these days.

Mobility isn't necessarily bad, but it's a huge advantage for those who have it, and the value of mobility isn't always centered around offence. Immobile mages should be more powerful and not just compensated with utility. \n\n{{champion:34}} and {{champion:112}} IMO are examples of good immobile mage design. Their damage isn't oriented around 100% landing skillshots, they have a fair amount of range to their abilities, and can be a threat to an entire team if not dealt with. I'd add {{champion:143}} too, but she's becoming a support. \n\nAdding an extra {{summoner:4}}  item for mages, highly favoring those who can snowball like {{champion:7}} and {{champion:131}}, while reducing the AP on most items further reducing power is not the answer mages need.","replies":[{"poster":"D rok","date":"2016-04-07T22:09:33.403+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agreed.

On the other hand, let's assume there is a point to be made and address it instead of responding with a generic \"you're being non-constructive\" which while correct and not ragey is equally non-constructive. You are thinking about introducing a tool which would allow mages access to a 300 range dash at the cost of building a kindlegem instead of a more damaging item. You are doing this as part of a project to increase the competitive viability and game health of a number of characters you have labelled \"immobile mages\".
