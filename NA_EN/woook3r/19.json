So yes it should be harder for you to climb if you have an eternal duo, because either way if you played alone it'd be harder as well, you're just hacking the system by playing with someone else.\n\n-breaking down LP gain will only reveal a lot of things that goes unnoticed, you wouldn't fall down into bronze but it'd be harder for you to climb up, imagine two players with the same MMR and skill level, maybe it takes the duo player a week and a half to climb from gold 5 to gold 4, while it takes a solo player almost a month to climb from gold 5 to gold 4, how is that fair?","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-06-01T21:03:32.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

That's the exact opposite of what you want to have happen with a boosted player, you want them to keep playing with their friends so they don't ruin someone else's game. Gaining more per win and losing less per loss will result in him staying at a higher rank for longer than he should after he leaves his premade.\n\n2. When I've wanted to climb faster, I've played more solo ranked games. Playing with my wife guarantees one fewer idiot on my team, but drags down the MMR enough that I get matched with more idiots as a whole. Same situation as last year, nothing unique to Dynamic Queue about that. It's not easier to win together, it's just better to play together.\n\n3.
