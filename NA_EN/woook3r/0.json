Because of this, it's likely that there's something up between your PC and the servers that is causing this to happen. I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in its entirety so we can confirm that your local network settings have been configured properly for League.\n\nIf you still encounter further disconnections from matches after taking those steps, we can look into your network routing to our servers, alright? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2017-01-31T17:00:12.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nThings are worse than ever. I don't have an issue playing streaming from youtube. I don't know what it is that makes your game impossible to run smoothly. It makes zero sense that my computer cant form a stable connection to your servers when that's the only thing the computer is running. The packets this game sends over the network are tiny and shouldnt interact with my firewall. Machine is literally doing nothing and its still getting in its own way.\n\nYou need to make your connection guide automated one click process. If the problem is with windows, please release a version of this game for Linux Ubuntu. All I do on this machine is surf the web, apply for jobs, skype, league. \n\nWhy is there so much garbage like Xbox app, Cortana, bullshit I cant uninstall that clearly interfere with what I do want to do? Whenever the xbox app randomly appears in my process list the game goes to 150 ping. I don't have any control over this shit and you don't need to ask me to work my way through a connection guide to fix it. There is one step the user needs to go through to connect. Plug in Ethernet. That's it. \n\nIf I had a partition on this machine that literally only ran league, it would be a preferable experience. There should/could be an option to run league in isolation.\n\nLet me know when you have a one click solution going. Cause I'm not playing this game anymore. Ive got a book that's equally as fun and I don't have to troubleshoot it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2017-01-18T04:20:18.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its the windows update, i suppose. thanks for checking the records. i still get packet loss but after re-installing, things are better. ill let you know. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
