Do not let mobile champions build the items with super efficient stats. MAKE THEM PAY. Let &quot;Grounded&quot; be a debuff applied to the best items in the game. If you buy them, you better be good at positioning cause you are not going to be able to use these stats without having those fundamentals.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-19T04:11:28.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For fucks sake.

How you deal with mobilty creep? \n\nIf you look sort the list of champions based on ban rate, you find all the immobile champions at the bottom of that list, and all the mobile champions near the top. In fact.\n\nOf the 20 most banned, 15 are mobile. Of the 20 least banned, 16 are immobile. Its an exact mirror. What you going to do about this? And if youre not going to do it with item lockout, then you have to spend time developing the solution. What about in the meantime? Item lockout would change the ban list. Changing the ban list to include more immobile champions and fewer mobile champions would INCREASE diversity in this game because immobile picks would be a priority. \n\nI do understand game balance to some degree.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-20T01:39:31.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well a brief look at champion.gg shows that in the top 10 highest win rate (yes win rate isn't everything but bare with me) are {{champion:245}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:104}} .  Only graves and ekko can really be called mobile so thats 2/10.  \n\nOn a side note mobility is power yes. And there is a certain amount of mobility creep in league but overall I still see immobile mages and adcs played all the time with no problems at all.  Typically they have something to counter their lack of mobility.  Kog has stupid damage if his team protects him,  jhin the same but he also has ways to set it up where the enemy can't reach him, ashe has stuns and slows, lux was all the rage on the boards a couple weeks ago (shield, cc and no mobility), brand is still strong and his new mage update looks really nice.  I could go on but you get the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-04-20T01:41:01.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure man. we ban champions that arent good at winning the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2016-04-19T05:20:27.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whereas I'd personally like to nerf mobility creep.

Explain the trade off for mobility spells. \n\nExplain why you wouldnt want to lock mobile champs out of the strongest items in the game. \n\nCause based on the pick ban list, it looks like we STRONGLY tend to pick/ban mobile champions and STRONGLY do not pick/ban champions without mobility. 15/20 of the MOST pick banned are mobile. 16/20 of the LEAST pick banned are Immobile.\n\nSince we tend to want to ban champions WITHOUT significant weaknesses and pick those same champions, that would suggest that champions with mobility do NOT have significant weaknesses, and champions without mobility have the MOST significant weaknesses. \n\nIf you want to say that I need to get better at positioning, to be safer, then I would say that being better at getting safe positioning makes you  WORSE at positioning to DEAL DMG and CARRY THE GAME.\n\nIF YOU HAVE MOBILITY that would mean that SAFE positions are also positions in which you can CARRY and if you have no mobility, then that means SAFE positions are not positions from which you can CARRY. So then. Why pick immobile champions?","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2016-04-19T17:40:12.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well first off, you're mentally retarded if you think anyone is going to listen to your foolish ranting on thing you clearly don't understand.\nSecond off, you've noticed a pattern..... So let's see here.... How to fix it..... Oh, I know either give everyone mobility or severely limit it. Your solution is quite honestly 100% retarded, and make literally no sense...\nOh let's see here, if you attempt to build items you die. Hope your base damages are good enough though......\nThe way you limit mobility is to emphasize the weaknesses these champions have. As I suggested, try looking at what the supposed trade-offs for champions like {{champion:105}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:104}} \nBetter yet, if they don't have one, MAKE ONE.

Only 4 are mobile and the rest are immobile. \n\nYou CANT position against the meta. No immobile champion has the range for that. You have to dodge or someone ELSE has to peel it or heal it. \n\nIts NOT all about your position. \n\nYou cannot position an immobile adc in a spot where no one in the game has the ability to attack them, except against a few champions that never the less have itemization to get to you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-19T04:01:35.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You really don't understand game balance.
