Negative cooldown reduction based on armor rating. If you have 400 armor, any mobility spell has an additional 40 second cooldown.\n\nFor a lot of champions, this allows you to reduce the cooldown on their mobility, increase armor values of most items and in general will require a re-balance of the game. It also allows you a &quot;lever&quot; (i guess you asshats like that word) to tune champs like ekko and gragas who both do a shit ton of dmg while also being hard to kill. More armor means less mobile. More mobile means less armor. Thats called balance.\n\nIts a sweet sweet thing I just did here. Take your time. Appreciate me.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-19T03:54:37.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's called stupidity.  You really seem to be quite full of yourself.\n\nHey wanna here a joke?\n\nHow many teenagers does it take to change a lightbulb?  One, he holds the light bulb and expects the world to revolve around him. \n\nHaha.\n\nAnyways enough with the insults.\n\nTo address your actual idea I can spot a bunch of problems immediately. First off you would straight up destroy any tank with mobility.  Hey malph you like that ulti? HA its now a 10 min cd,  yo sej you like that dash? Bam now its 2 min.  Hey zac you like that slingshot engage and ulti?  NOPE, its at least a 4 min cd for both. Shen, hecarim, nautilus (his q is mobility), maokai, poppy, irelia and the list goes on.  All immediately unviable.  \n\nAlso a lever is something specific they can use, like a key item that eveyone in the class builds.  For adc this would be Ie or any of the interchangeable zeal upgrades (you can buff/nerf all of them at the same time due to build path), mid lane has a bunch of new items coming, for jungle its the smite items etc.  \n\nIt would be a massive effort to even sort it out and would solve nothing, the real problem with tanks right now is the combination of sunfire for aoe consistant dmg, iceborn for slow and proc damage and grasp giving champs like ekko sustain when then shouldn't have any sustain.  Best way to fix off he top of my head (don't take this too seriously)  would be to find a new way to scale sunfire or grasp (maybe healing based on enemies hp? idk just throwing out ideas).  Honestly sunfire has been a problem its entire life as an item. Either its top tier due to the aoe damage plus armor and hp or its shit because something else is better (like how  dead mans ruled back when it gave 600 hp, 60 armor and like twice as much movespeed).\n\nAnyways thats just my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"TrÃ­dent","date":"2016-04-19T04:17:16.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">How many teenagers does it take to change a lightbulb?

I'm quite tired of the Hypermobile tanks that's \"outplay\" you by dashing around.  {{champion:157}} Who me?  Yes I mean this trash with his 0.1 sec cool down (that's fucking crazy), and many others.  Building 2-3 damage items then tank the rest and being able to dance around and take virtually no damage because skill shots miss and melee auto attacks can't proc fast enough and ADC's get nuked to fast.  Watching Yasuo and others do this makes me want to delete client and you can't ban them all.  I enjoy a good fight/duel but when I can't catch you or run from you it's not fun and your not out playing anyone.  It's just abuse of that system.  This crap is the anti fun.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-19T04:09:45.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok clearly I forgot to mention this but, there is zero reason to apply this massive of a change to the balance of the game.  We have no idea if it would even help, it might just make a new meta just as annoying as the old meta.  Also in terms of game balance you should NOT be punished for buying defense.  Defense is supposed to do exaclty that. Help you live longer.  If suddenly your cd go up after buying a chain vest to counter build they 2/0 renekton then you are probably better off just using your mobility to avoid his damage and just buy damage yourself.","replies":[]}]}
