ADC's typically have really low base damages to compensate for superior scaling with damage items on their abilities. I believe the rule is damage and crit first then AS/life steal.

If you fuck up the equation of what style they are playing to your own IE you pick rock but they play paper, you lose. So if you fight Mundo within him being able to close the distance you die.

Well so do assassins. And mages. And bruisers. Who do the adcs counter?\n\nADC's can kill anything if properly positioned and built. Your reading comprehension is seriously in question  by me at the moment. I am saying that each champion plays at different strength and weaknesses given a certain situation. If you played in Mundo's melee range advantage is him but if you played him at your range then advantage you. There are no true hard counters or stomps. Your limitations are self inflicted and you are tunneling on an aspect of champion, that yes he is strong when he's in melee and has his combo, but not seeing the fact you let him be strong by your own decision making by being out of position with no vision.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
