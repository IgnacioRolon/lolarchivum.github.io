Rageblade is broken as heck. The last time we asked them to buff Rageblade or make my hybrid items, they complained saying Hybrid champions are too hard to balance since they'd have to balance them around the items so they'd be worthless until the item, then have a HUGE power spike when they finished that hybrid item for a snowbally mid game just to fall off late because Hybrid damage doesn't have any penetration...\n\nThen they go and buff Guinsoos and return AP Yi to us when we don't want him to EVER come back on top of breaking Irelia and Jax. Squishy killers already kill squishies and Rageblade being a Hybrid item means it's a squishy killer item since squishies won't have enough armor AND magic resist to beat it.\n\nYou'd have thought they'd learn from Akali who has one of the biggest power spikes in the game off of a Gunblade, the hybrid item they've balanced her off of for ever.","replies":[]}]}
