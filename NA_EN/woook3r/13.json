Changing the system is over-complicating things, because that means you have to rebalance Tenacity, and possibly rebalance CC around the rebalanced Tenacity if things aren't as they are now. The only reason you don't see it as complicated is probably a lack of understanding mechanics.\n\n2) Comparing Tenacity to CDR is like comparing Health to Mana Regen. Entirely unrelated stats with entirely different purposes, have rarely been on the same item at the same time, and don't have any scaling relevant to each other. *And why not just view the 35% Tenacity as a cap on item tenacity?*\n\n3) I did not say that reducing Tenacity would be hard. I said that it would be difficult and convoluted to find the right numbers for a stack-able Tenacity stat, because it already scales multiplicatively with the few sources that do stack. **The math behind it is more complex than you think, in very small words so you understand what I mean.** 25% Tenacity plus 25% Tenacity does not equal 50%, it equals 43.75%, because multiplicative scaling.\n\nConsidering that there's a jungler enchantment for Tenacity, we'd have to balance 3 Tenacity items to give a total of 35-40% Tenacity when stacked together, because players would want to stack it. That means these three items would grant 13.35% to 15.5% Tenacity apiece.\n\n\"No they wouldn't--\"\n\nYes, they would. **Because Tenacity is already balanced around being 35% from items.** They would need to rebalance the system if passive CC resistance from items could go above that.\n\n4) Not really.

Because of how Tenacity is currently scaled, designed and balanced, making this one change would require either a lot of number-juggling to find the right balance, or it would require rehauling the system. It's difficult to find the exact balance point for stackable Tenacity, and convoluted, considering the system already works.\n\nThe actual change of the numbers is not what's difficult. Calculating how those changes affect balance, and figuring out the perfect numbers to use, *that's* difficult and convoluted for the purpose of this change.\n> I am also capable of talking on the internet without using the f'word.\n\nBecause it's *so* much more mature to play the idiot than it is to swear.

I don't want to waste time and writing on a person who's not going to read a wall of text explaining exactly what I mean. I mean, look at you; you couldn't read the whole sentence before stopping at the word \"Difficult\" because difficult and hard are synonymous. How can I trust you with a wall explaining exactly what I mean if you shut down that fast?\n\n2) Frozen Mallet has its niche. It doesn't need to be more widespread, which is most likely why Riot removed Phage from its build path. And making Tenacity stack is not going to make Frozen Mallet any more important than it is now.\n\n3) This change doesn't get anything that you wanted, except for champions capable of ignoring CC that isn't Airborne or Suppression. But everyone who actually knows what that would imply *doesn't want it*. CC-proof Irelia is terrifying enough. Giving that to Shyvana, Jarvan, Vi, Xin Zhao, Malphite, Trundle and pretty much every single bruiser on the roster is going to bring back the League of Bruisers, which nobody--nobody who went through that and wasn't a bruiser main--wants to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2014-12-17T23:59:28.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Balancing tenacity is rolled up into reducing tenacity.

Strange, but true.\n\nJayce is hit and run because he is ranged....that is my evaluation. Melee hit and run is what I would like. I.E. Hecarim if he was done the way i think he should be.\n\nThe problem with melee champions is the level of commitment that is required if you want to do some damage. High MS mitigates this, but if i have to worry about stun after stun then there's nothing I can do until my entire team commits and the enemy is distracted with several targets who can cover for me. Or so I think.\n\nNow, heres another idea. What if you put an enchant on a melee only item that reduces the effectiveness of subsequent stuns. So its like tenacity that builds as you are stun locked for longer. It basically puts a cap on the duration of obnoxious stuns. I would b ok with that. \n\nI dont want to be immune to stuns like irrelia. I dont really want to be op like darius.

They both have kits that allow them to either go all in, or just jump in and out.\n\nYou *could* have come with a thread asking for such a playstyle, and it wouldn't have started with people pointing out that stackable Tenacity would be broken because, unlike DotA, most CC lasts 2 seconds instead of 5. Asking people for advice is significantly less likely to get ridiculed than suggesting a change that would require rebalancing of the entire system.\n\nEzreal kites all day because he's Ezreal. His design is to skirt the edge of combat, going all-in or firing shots as he escapes, per the situation. If you want to be Ezreal, be Ezreal. If you want to be a bruiser that goes in and out of combat, ask which bruisers are good at that (Vi, Shyvana, Wukong, Lee Sin, Jarvan, Jayce...).\n\nActually, Jayce is probably exactly what you want, if Lee Sin isn't.
