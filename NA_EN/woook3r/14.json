Your logic can go the same for literally _any_ other game. Lets just remove the support role from other games too, why should it exist?

Supports have a broad variety of champs and utility they can pick from, and the play is diverse.\n\nADCs are weaker starters, and spend a good portion of the game PvEing at all stages. Regardless of champion your game experience is basically the same everytime. You will farm, farm, farm, sometimes roam, show up for teamfights, farm, farm farm.  Your job in fights is pretty much to stay alive, and shoot things when it wont get you killed. Sure, in mid-longer games you will/should be the primary damage dealer on your team, and you'll get more pentas, but its a fairly limited role.\n\nSupport is a fun and active role, its not as popular because kids like to feel god-like and support just doesn't feel* powerful. This was the entire logic behind the Taric rework and I'd rather not see them undermine the support role just so there's more explosions and buttons to press.","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-05-11T20:06:01.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i also think this is true. cs'ing is boring and the support just spends all their attention harassing the enemy which is fun. its also easy as hell cause that player has to focus on both you and the minions and maybe your adc as well, and also the minimap (check for ganks).\n\nThats really difficult to keep an eye on all at once and it makes supporting really easy.
