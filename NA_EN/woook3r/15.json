My teammates would derp off, leave the objective alone and then die at the enemy blue buff. So. After winning every fight, soon enough my entire team would die and I would be at the fountain as the only member of my team alive. The enemy was able to push all of our lanes during this time and group under our inhibitor tower. As a draven against vi and malzahar. I had to watch this happen until they killed our tower multiple times. \n\nAfter a certain instance of this happening, my team respawned and then we killed their team. I pushed an objective. I backed. My team overstayed. The enemy team pushed. We lost two inhibitors. I was the only one alive for an entire minute and I spent most of it clearing super minions. When my teammates respawned they ran past the superminions to do god knows what. Teemo died at the enemy blue buff while I spammed danger pings at him. The others died one by one in various places. I continued killing supers. Enemy team takes baron. I get a quadrakill. After getting all of our inhibitors back up, my entire team decides to group at red buff. I tell them to leave. They don't.

This is why ppl either feed or carry every game. No one adjusts their playstyle to what the game calls for. They play retardedly aggressive and end up feeding cuz its the only way the majority of ppl know how to play this game...instead of using their brain and making smart decisions. Top laner goes 0/6 in laning phase??? Its cuz he doesnt know how to play from behind and be passive in lane after getting killed the very first time. He keeps playing like HE has the lead when hes extremely behind, which is how ppl feed all the time....they dont know how to play smart.
