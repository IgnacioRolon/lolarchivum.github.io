Probably not by this post.\nThe difference? He isn't whining and blaming his suckyness on champion balance\"\n\n^^A conclusion jumped to based on three or four lines of text written on the internet.  It has little value and is overly personal. I will remember to report you. \n\nCho'Gath is a champion used for elo boosting. What criterion would someone use to select a champion for this purpose? Because he is \"freelo\".\n\nMy opinion of cho'gath is due to this and is shared at large.\n\nMy opinion of WuKong is due to opinions of friends.\n\nMy opinion of Tryndamere is shared by some riot employees and is in line with balance philosophies of riot. Tryndamere has hidden power. I only just found out secondary effects of his w. ( I think it is w that reduces 80 AD in an aoe)\n\nAs for the relative relevance of our posts...yours is pretty off topic too. You dont really express any opinions of the champion. Instead you express personal opinions of people on the forum.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-21T07:10:55.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MightySaturn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mEzIeXEs,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-06-16T16:32:07.320+0000)\n>\n> an interesting comment from the guy who lost his last 12 ranked games. \n> \n> EDIT FOR CLAIRIFICATION: (I mean to say that this person could be a troll.

But you can't win them all so I'm not to bothered by this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-21T07:12:55.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Darkmind1212,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mEzIeXEs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-06-15T20:50:16.182+0000)\n>\n> I have a better idea why not just become a better player?\n\nI should explain this a little better, my bad my bad. What I mean is acquire more knowledge before screaming nerf.

I dont understand the attitudes! I meant this to be a thread about champions who are never talked about on the forums as needing nerfs, but who clearly deserve one or two nerfs. I think tryn is probably the least deserving of a nerf.\n\nYes, His ult can do what you just said. Although, i think some of his winrate is inflated due to his synergy with yasuo, he seems to be a little too easy and stronk.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2015-06-16T17:39:51.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=stealthfox94,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mEzIeXEs,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-06-16T17:09:15.749+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:62}} Is fine \n> {{champion:23}} Is annoying not OP \n> {{champion:31}} fair enough I say reduce silence duration and he's fine.\n\nI think WuKong needs a ms nerf on his ulti now that black cleaver grants phage","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-06-15T18:29:44.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"in a game state where Ekko is a champion....you are whining about tryndamere and wukong?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-06-15T18:28:05.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that silence *bugfixed like Darius's E.","replies":[]}]}
