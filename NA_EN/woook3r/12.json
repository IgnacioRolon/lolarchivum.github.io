Nassus puts two or three ranks only into his e and casts it on the caster minions when they are full hp and when the enemy is standing near them. Jhin immediatly throws q onto minions and the grenade will kill all three. Theres a good chance you will catch the enemy off guard with 200+ magic dmg from nassus, 15 armor reduction, and 350 physical dmg from jhin. If the enemy is immobile, nassus can even whither to make sure they dont dodge the grenade. This strategy will leave the enemy saying &quot;what the fuck???!&quot; and you saying &quot;LOLOLOLOLOL&quot;.\r\n\r\nIts important that nassus doesnt over level the e because the minons will just die to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-03-19T16:27:29.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but nasus is shit without stacks. why wouldnt you just do that with morganas w? she has enough utility to be relevant on 0cs. nasus doesnt.\n\nyou dont have the armor reduction, but you have cc/burst chains, so whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-03-19T16:37:23.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5VKYa0wF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-19T16:27:29.269+0000)\n>\n> but nasus is shit without stacks. why wouldnt you just do with with morganas w? she has enough utility to be relevant on 0cs. nasus doesnt.\n> \n> you dont have the armor reduction, but you have cc/burst chains, so whatever.\n\nBecaaaaause shit like this is hilarious and funny to see? If I want to go see Morg/Jhin, I'll just watch pro scene. \n\nLeast Bot lane is somewhat unpredictable unlike top lane.\nOops, typo, meant Trundle v.s.

He will just bitch about adcs in every game.\n\nEdit: It is hilarious. The first time we did it was after backing for big sword. Neither side expected ezreal to become instantly chunked to half hp. That single trade won the lane and got us a kill. Noone was expecting it least of all me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-03-19T16:41:00.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because its instant with nassus. You dont have to wait for the dot. You can do a simultaneous cast of the grenade and sands and it will clear the backline. Jhin has the hard cc to secure the kill because of his w which the sands will help proc. \n\nI dont remember morganas aoe being fast enough at getting the minons low. Nassus sands have a burst component which is all you need to get the minons low enough.\n\nYou mean morgana doesnt have the armor reduction?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2016-03-19T16:52:28.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> these two actually have some hilarious synergy in bot lane.\n\nWell: in lane.\n\nOnce you move past the lanning phase, using champions as a support that have mediocre scaling without items/CS tends to force them into a win lane or loose game position where they're a complete non-factor if you didn't successfully bag a sizable advantage in-lane.\nWith Nasus's kit he's not as bad as something like support Talon, where at least you can still be annoying with Whither and helpful with Spirit Fire's armor/mr shred: but even with his point-click slow I'm not sure he'd be the best champ to pair with Jhin. \n\nLooking at his kit Nasus doesn't look any worse than Trundle support: but I'm not sure accurate sniping is really worth picking support Nasus over a support like Alistar, Thresh, or Janna that brings a lot more to the team late-game when their kits maintain impressive levels of power even with low gold and levels.","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-03-19T16:55:09.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you completely misunderstood.
