You should be able to resolve this with one of the workarounds listed below:\n\n1. Go to your installation directory (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and delete the **LeagueClient.exe** file (if present) and then launch league from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (right-click, *run as admin*) to retry the upgrading/patching process. If this doesn't work, move on to step 2.\n___\n2. At this point, your League installation is pretty borked, so you'll want to complete a *clean reinstall* of League to resolve this. I recommend completing this using our [**reinstallation guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to confirm this was done correctly.\n\nLet me know if this worked for you.","replies":[]}]}
