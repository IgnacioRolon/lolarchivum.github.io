If I get legit help I WILL stop trollin","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":18,"body":"So there is a guy where me and him hit it off hard and fast, we share a lot of the same opinions and thoughts and goals and desires.  The only one we didn't gree with is the fact I love Hawaiian pizza and he finds the pineapples on pizza an abomination.\n\nWe met up a bunch and yesterday he called me after we cuddled and told me he is confused and doesn't know what he wants or what he feels.\n\nYesterday he had to fire someone, his roommate got fired (serperate case, two people total got fired here.), he doesn't know if he will still be able to keep the roof over his head without the room-mate (despite being well-off) and he just got back from a trip back home and was pretty emotional- saying he only came back for me. \n\n\nSo all that happened yesterday.... And he said if he didn't respect/like me he would have just not replied to anything. \n\nHe outright said, literally, that he would NOT have replied at all to anything I said, he would have blocked me on facebook and not said a single word. He still has me and did call and did reply and talk though.\n\nHe called saying he is stressed out by work, that he just got a raise that day too (so much in one day would make me explode) and how he came here in the first place only for this (very high up in business) position and work and money. So he felt that he was better off focusing on that. He says I've plagued his thoughts and how after meeting me he isn't able to think about anything else. \n\nFurthermore he's been demanded a lot at his job because he has a massive authority position, so he has had to cancel out on meeting me a lot... he said he feels miserable about it and breaking so many promises. However the reality is I was okay with it! I told him it was totally okay and I had no issue with it.\n\nNow to me I understand all the stress, etc. That would make for a hellhole sort of day, really. \n\nBut on the other hand he made it clear he wants a LTR, he finds me cute and smart and determination and spine sexy but now he doesn't know if he wants me or not. When we're together he gets horny, smiling, excited, everthing. But he said he 'thought about it and didn't feel a spark'. \n\nReally? After leaning in insisting to kiss me?!!?!!?!? WHAT!?!!?!?!?!?!?!? After everything? There sure as fuck was tension and everything. \n\nHe said he'd get ahold of me later, and he needs time to think (days he said). And I supported it because I mean he literally just has had a fucking HELLHOLE week. Like super hellish, and he has the board of directors rammed up his ass sideways this week. So he's freaking the fk out. \n\n\nSo idk what to do. I feel miserable over it ._.\n\nWHAT DO I DO?","replies":[]}
