NO punishments.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"TL;DR Your freakin' load screens are STILL crashing, and forcing people to be AFK for 6 minutes. You haven't addressed this, and only make it worse with /remake. Until this issue is fixed, no one should be punished for leaving during /remake.\r\n\r\nThis /remake update is probably the worst update for me personally.\r\n\r\nI never had leaverbuster problems that were my own fault aside from dodging queues to prevent my team from having a horrible game with toxic teammates. Maybe I got a warning or something, or more.\r\n\r\nI have a rather unique bug that some others have, where the loading screen randomly crashes or refuses to appear at all.\r\nI usually wait for a while, the screen is black, and it never appears, and I have to alt tab and relog. It's entirely at random when it happens, so I usually forget to warn my team that I'll sometimes end up being \"afk\" for around 6 to 16 minutes because logging in takes forever. The loading screen usually lags my comp even though its not doing anything, which makes shutting it down even worse.\r\n\r\nSometimes its so bad I can't even alt tab. I have to shut down my laptop via cold shutdown and everything.\r\n\r\nThen /remake came out.\r\n\r\nI can't reconnect because it takes 6 damn minutes to log back in. usually the bug on its own costs us an early advantage, or the game entirely.\r\n\r\nIts happened 3-5 times since the update. It usually happens once or twice every two days. I posted it on other forums, and vowed to post the exact same thing EVERY time it happened. Still haven't gotten a response.\r\n\r\nIt didn't seem to harm much during normals, just \"hey, that's fine, i'll just go make another game\"\r\n\r\nno.\r\n\r\nI started getting into ranked, and doing fairly well.\r\nThen, a crash. Thanks, riot. Lost some LP, got a five-minute low priority queue thing.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, another crash on ranked. Ten minutes. I thought it was ridiculous and stupid enough there.\r\n\r\nThis time, I get a damned 20-minute leaverbuster for something that wasn't my fault at all.\r\nI used to like this game, but I don't like have to wait 20 damn minutes, then wait for the queue time, just to start a damn game. ONE game.\r\n\r\nI'll have maybe two-three games without this low priority queue. Then another.\r\n\r\nI don't want to do it anymore, I don't like being punished for riot's buggy system, riot's poor balancing on the enemies I face, being punished for not doing perfectly in a ranked game, being punished for being SLIGHTLY inadequate in ranked, punished for just having a piss-poor team in ranked that you can't carry, etc. Maybe once or twice I'll get a good experience, at someone else's expense.\r\n\r\nMastered my favorite champions, poured hours and days of my life to mastery them, and I'm being kicked in the groin by riot for an issue they can't fix.\r\n\r\nI'm done, and I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nBASICALLY:\r\nI queue up, select champs, etc, all going well.\r\n\r\nScreen changes to signal load screen.\r\nI wait to see the first splash arts load up...\r\nThey don't. So I...\r\nWait...\r\nAnd wait...\r\nAaand wait...\r\nAlt-tab.\r\n\"you have been disconnected\" even though my connection is extremely good.\r\nI have to boot up league again, even though its lagging a lot from the fake loading screen.\r\nTakes around ten minutes to finally log in.\r\nLog in just in time to see, in big red accusing letters: \"LEAVER (remake)\".\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst it didn't do much, other than make me angry.\r\n\r\nThen after the latest three times it's happened..\r\n5 minute leaverbuster.\r\n\"Ugh. This system is pretty dumb.\"\r\n\r\n10 minute. - Sidenote: This costed me LP, cause it was ranked.\r\n\"What in the hell? Really?\"\r\n\r\n15 Minute.\r\n\"Come on now..\"\r\n\r\n20 Minute.\r\n\"I'm done. Screw this game. Poured hours of my life into this for this BS. Thanks for not fixing this bug, riot.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not waiting 20 minutes + queue times just to play one game. Then repeat this five times. Not to mention the further punishments I'll get for more crashes.\r\n\r\nThe problem happens at entirely random. One of three things happen.\r\n1. Loading screen usually remains black, and it does not actually force an alt-tab if you get registered as disconnecting.\r\n\r\nSplash arts and everything show, but it remains at a certain point forever, until you alt-tab.\r\n\r\nLoading screen doesn't appear at all.\r\n\r\nI think by now it only happens every 5+ games, but it still doesn't have a clear pattern. I don't think its ever happened more than once a day, or side-by-side. I'll probably still play league. But if the punishment escalates the next time, I'm done.\r\n\r\n(I'll probably post this on other forums too.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T21:55:09.735+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"I know how frustrating it can be when your PC issues prevent you from enjoying a proper game in your off-time. There can be many factors to troubleshoot, and pinpointing the issue can be tricky. I wanted to let you know that the /Remake feature isn't able to determine the exact reason for you not connecting, therefore it cannot pardon the leaves that are caused by your technical issues.\n\nI'm more than happy to assist you in getting this resolved for good. My recommended first steps would be to take a look at [our connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), which goes over a lot of solutions for the issues you're having. If you get stuck with any of these steps or have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-07-07T23:32:08.757+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not an individual's pc that's the problem.\nMyself and a number of friends have all had the same issue pop up randomly. Crash during loading screen, and it says \"Check your internet connection.\" We're all also in voice chat, so are 12billion% sure it's not our connections. The game will continue to say this, and not let you load into game untill the match actually starts. We're also not all near each other. Some are, one lives a few hours away, and yet another lives in a completely different country.\n\nIt's absolutely not a connection issue on the player's part. It lets you log in just fine, but when you try to rejoin when everyone else is in loading screen, it suddenly thinks you have no internet connection.\nAlthough this issue seems to include another problem, I think the core issue is still the same, causing disconnects during loading screens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robin da brave","date":"2016-07-09T02:34:38.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmao? My PC issues? You mean that although I've tried playing from different computers and networks and still get the same result it's somehow my fault? Or do you want me to use the \"tips\" on your forums for the 10th time and pray that I'm finally gonna get results? \n\nI had no issues with game crashes until this update, and neither did any people on my FL, and now I'm getting them nearly every game I play. As I said before, my laptop has no issue running anything, and I've replaced the HDD with an SSD already. Stop giving us your scripted bullshit about running connection issues, as there are none. Your guides don't have the answer to this. No one has the answer to this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sozan5","date":"2016-07-09T12:25:54.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Ritoman.\n\nHow about adding an additional system that will cancel the game if a player (or players) don't connect to the game (or disconnect within 15 seconds of starting it - that is before the gates near the spawn platforms go down). Give them like 30-60 seconds to reconnect and if they don't, the game is cancelled and the leaver(s) suffer either dodge or defeat penalty (whichever you think is appropriate).\n\nBy cancel I mean that the game ends and doesn't show up in any player's match history (no LP gain or loss).\n\nAbuse case is rather small too (since you could already dodge in champion select, and this is basically the same). Maybe add the penalty to whole pre-made that leaver was a part of.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"L0G1C B1T","date":"2016-07-08T05:33:52.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is annoying when that happens, and it happens occasionally to just about every person that I know that plays this game.  I doubt they can disable the punishments though because people will abuse it.  Overall /remake does a ton of good.   And unfortunately to the rest of us that play ranked, we don't want to get punished because it is 4v5 either.\n\nThere are some things you can do yourself though.  It shouldn't take you 6 min to log back in.  When this happens to me, I can restart, and get back in and playing in less than 30 seconds.  Look into getting a solid state HD or something.  They have come down in price and can load a game in just a few seconds.\n\n\n~David","replies":[]},{"poster":"WangMaster9000","date":"2017-07-06T17:20:20.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half a year passed, still not fixed.

I am a fellow player in EUNE and I STILL also get similar symptoms with the game once a while and so do my friends, our internet is PERFECTLY fine, NO CONNECTION PROBLEMS whatsoever, only black loading screen that loads forever unless you alt+tab it and completely close the game from windows task manager. In other situations, when it wont load the loading screen and mouse won't appear, I force close the game as well and press reconnect button, only to be greeted with \"You have been disconnected. Please control your connection and try again.\" I know my internet is OK so it's not my problem, it's this game. Also i seemed to notice that it won't allow anybody with similar errors to connect until the loading screen disappears and game starts for people that managed to get past the loading screen, but if the game is still in loading-screen phase for all players, it won't allow the players with the error to reconnect. Fix this please, and fast, I got low priority from it again thanks to the damn useless /remake command that punishes players with technical problems not the actual afkers/leavers... And PLEASE, react to the problems not tell people to check your goddamn FAQ's that wont fix anything at all.

Then on the third game, ta-da! League crashes and freezes so hard that I can't even ctrl-alt-delete, or turn my laptop off via the power button, which resulted in me having to take out the battery just so I could get my computer functioning again. And after that, another 20 minute low priority queue. In fact, out of all the low priority queues I've ever had, most of them have happened after this /remake update due to my client crashing.\n\nI play Smite, Dota, CSGO and League, with league being the only application i've run that has actually managed to crash my computer. I'm using an Acer Aspire Nitro, so I doubt my laptops specs are the issue here. My internet sits at a comfortable 50 mb/s, so I don't think that's the problem either. Since riot removed my previous post on this, after i stated that none of their fixes on the forums had worked, I figured I should post again right here. \n\nIt's no secret that Riot's servers are absolutely appalling compared to any other major MOBA out there, and with the amount of money this game is making, one could expect at least decent servers or a response to an issue like this. I've been playing since season 2 on NA and EUW, and I can see why people are beginning to leave this game and move towards others like Overwatch. \n\nTl;dr Riot fix your /remake system because players dont deserve to be punished for your spaghetti coding.","replies":[]}]}
