Some of them are random. The blocks are really white and distracting, and it kind've hurts my eyes to see a Nami ult and have to guess where the actual ult is amongst the flashy white mass.","replies":[{"poster":"xXpsychonautXx","date":"2017-04-17T11:37:00.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just install the latest version of java and netframework and its sort out the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-12T22:08:10.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this issue a few times, and each time it was caused by corrupted League assets. It's possible that you need to complete a clean reinstallation of League in order to resolve the issue. If you'd like to give this a go, Grab our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi) and check both the box for 'Reinstall' and 'Clean Uninstall', then hit the Start button. This will wipe all files associated with League to ensure corruption doesn't carry over, then reinstalls the game.\n\nIf this didn't cause a change, take the log file it generated on your desktop (LoL Logs.zip) and attach it to a [ticket submission](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Our tech specialists will be able to dive into those logs and work with you to resolve this for good.","replies":[{"poster":"HungryJack619","date":"2016-12-21T15:23:45.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta love when you spend 3 hours installing a game, and get to play one game before you have to reinstall it.","replies":[{"poster":"DatguyOverdare","date":"2017-04-02T22:59:55.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i just experienced same thing but it occured due to me wanting to try the legacy client. i recently built this pc so its messed up , its my first build, and so it blue screened as the legacy client was trying to install or something and when i got back on my pc it was all messed up so i had to reinstall only to be greeted by these particle bugs, im not sure if i need to reinstall yet but i hope i dont have to. ive already had to reinstall twice today.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
