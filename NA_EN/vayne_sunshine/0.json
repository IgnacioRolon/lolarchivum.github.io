Once I am in game it is immediately there. Ive dropped all the settings to low and there is no fix. In addition, my hotkeys are completely different and i cannot change them. When I check my hotkeys in the client before the game loads, they are correct, but once I am in game they are set to default. I don't know what to do from here! I am so frustrated with the client updates and the consistent issues!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-08T23:44:54.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, it sounds like you've got a combination of issues here.  It sucks, but I can help!  The bindings issue could be a resultt of a corrupt config, but resetting them should help:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nThat should get your settings resync'd to our servers.\n\nRegarding your FPS, it might not be your settings causing it.  Other factors could involve outdated drivers or even bad game files.
