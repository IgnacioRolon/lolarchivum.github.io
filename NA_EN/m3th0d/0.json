She&#039;s not as OP as she used to be. HOWEVER!\r\nThat does not mean we should forget about this little lady! After all, she got back your wife&#039;s cardigan.\r\nIn all seriousness, Fiora is an incredibly fun champion to play. She&#039;s fast, flashy, arrogant, and packs a HUGE punch.\r\n\r\nHISTORY TIME:\r\nThe Grand Duelist was released on February 29th, 2012. Since League&#039;s inception, Fiora is generally considered as the first champion designed to be a full-on AD hyper-carry. \r\nStill used today, although typically overshadowed by champions like {{champion:24}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:92}} , Fiora presses on in her desire to prove that she is tougher than the rest.\r\n\r\nAnd in order to do that, my friends - she needs SKINS!!!\r\nSkins, skins, skins, skins, skins....did I say skins yet?\r\nFiora hasn&#039;t been awarded **ANY** skins since **2012.** And to make matters worse, she&#039;s only got three of them.\r\n\r\nI understand that there are other champions who have three skins. And I understand that Fiora&#039;s claims to fame only play a small part in the grand scheme of the League of Legends. But it&#039;s a claim that I&#039;m willing to support, and a claim that I&#039;m more than willing to fight for :-)\r\n\r\nHelp me, League community! Let&#039;s get Fiora some skins!\r\n#skinsforfi-fi","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-01T21:20:51.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora is in the process of a rework (the details of which I'm unsure of).
