Not sure what's causing it. Might be related to a ton of memory usage from the client. It's also a huge problem that when the client crashes after you pick your champ, but the game will still go through as normal. It will say [x] person has left the room, but they're not going to be able to change summs or masteries at that point. This doesn't happen to me daily, but a couple times a week it happens to someone on my team.

I tilted because of this: Lost a 4 v 5 game (teammate afk)- was winning before afk. left with 3 lp. client lags in Champ select and I can't ban. Literally lags to the point where clicking does nothing. looses that 3 lp because apparently i \"dodged\". Then i disconnect as the game starts. I assume there is a wifi problem and turn on 4G Data hotspot on phone but the new client refuses to reconnect. Waited a whole minute. Then closed client and restarted and client is a pitch black screen. Had to find a thread that helped me delete some files in the RAD folder under the League of Legends folder. I ofcourse didn't make it in time and I was marked to have left my game. Got demoted loosing 25lp. I'm like dang... what is this game","replies":[]},{"poster":"slurob","date":"2016-08-14T07:25:43.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never had this problem until recently.  It has happened twice to me in the past few days and also to my duo friend.
