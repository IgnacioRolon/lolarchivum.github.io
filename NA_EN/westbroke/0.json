How well your ISP does compared to your neighbor&rsquo;s? Feeling curious about your connection is perfectly normal, and now we have a tool for that.\n \nWe&rsquo;ve recently started beta testing a brand-new min-maxing tool for your internet that attempts to answer those questions, and we&rsquo;d like y&rsquo;all to join in. It&rsquo;s called [**Lag Report**,](http://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/) and you&rsquo;re invited to help us test, improve, and give feedback before the full version is available in Riot regions later this year. This beta has tested on a region-by-region basis, and today we&rsquo;re very stoked to get NA involved.\n \n**What is it? [Lag Report](http://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/) **is a website that provides you with visibility into the quality of different internet connections to League of Legends, based on actual games played in your area. It also includes a bunch of tips on how to get the most out of your connection and info on what&rsquo;s at the root of lag (and how to fix it). It&rsquo;s not a real-time connection test or speed test - it uses the last 30 days of games played to give you a big-picture view of things.\n \n**How does it work?** We&rsquo;re aggregating data from millions of recent League games to let you compare your connection to League against your ISP and other ISPs in your area.\n \n**How do I check it out?** [Slide on down to Lagreport.com.](http://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/) Log in using your League of Legends account to get your Personal Connection Score based on past games you&rsquo;ve played.\n \n**How can I help?** If you have questions about the  Lag Report, please drop them in the comments below. If you have feedback on the accuracy of information that&rsquo;s returned through the Lag Report, please use the **Provide Location and ISP Feedback button** on the website.\n \n**Anything I should keep in mind?** Yes! If you live in a remote or less-populated area, it&rsquo;s possible your location will be incorrect in this beta. This is expected - by using Lag Report, you&rsquo;re helping us improve location accuracy for where you live, and every data point helps improve the tool.\n \nWe want Lag Report to empower you to get the most out of your internet; something new and transparent that lets you see the best ways people are connecting to League in your area so you can make informed choices with all things internet-related. With the community&rsquo;s help, we can make this mad dream a reality.\n \nThanks, and enjoy!","replies":[]}
