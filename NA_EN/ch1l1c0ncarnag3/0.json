Honor Checkpoints Question","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, I've spent the past few days reading everything I can about Honor Checkpoints, and I for the life of me have been unable to see ANYONE give an accurate answer as to what the requirements for each checkpoint is.\r\n\r\nJust saying \"Honor 2 Checkpoint 1 of 3\" is about as useful as just saying \"Honor 2\". It tells me nothing. It doesn't give me any clue as to what I need to do to reach the next Checkpoint, how close I am, nothing. I get what they were going for, but when you're this vague about the system, then it makes me wonder what the point was in the first place. \r\nI've been playing quite a lot recently, averaging at least 1-2 honors a game. Yet I'm still the same Honor Rank as I was at the start of Season 8. Honor 2 Checkpoint 1. Yet my friend who is toxic for the sake of being toxic, and I love him for it is sitting at Honor 3 Checkpoint 2. It makes absolutely no sense.\r\n\r\nNeither of us know why we're at what ranks we are. It'd be nice if Riot would put in a progress bar showing how close you are to the next checkpoint, or a mission saying \"You are 12 Honor away from your next Checkpoint\". It would give us something to work towards, rather than just randomly, out of nowhere after a tiltfest of a game, you randomly rank up in honor and are left even more confused than Mundo when he doesn't go where he pleases.{{champion:36}} \r\n\r\nIf anyone could enlighten me to those requirements for the checkpoints, I'd greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nP.S. I don't even know if this is the right board, if it isn't Sue Me. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}
