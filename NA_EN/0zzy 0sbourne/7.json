Stop fucking calling people bad when they go 0/1 or 0/2 in lane.  Stop flaming teammates for every fucking mistake.  And stop pretending like you are the fucking source of all league knowledge where the only thing that works is &quot;the build you know&quot;, and then I&#039;m &quot;fucking bad&quot; if my build path isn&#039;t what you thought was good.  If it&#039;s working IS IT ACTUALLY FUCKING BAD?  How come when I go onto Mobafire, IT DOESN&#039;T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THERE BEING 1 ITEM THAT YOU HAVE TO GET FIRST FOR SAID CHAMP, OR YOU&#039;RE JUST BAD AT LEAGUE.  DEPENDING ON WHAT CHAMP YOU PLAY, YOU CAN KIND OF BUY ANYTHING AND IT WILL STILL WORK IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU&#039;RE DOING.  I see guides on there for a ton of champs where it's literally a wide variety of items and build paths are considered. You&#039;re fucking bad at league if all you do is criticize build paths, and flame teammates telling them &quot;oh I&#039;m gold, 1v1 me, noob, you&#039;re just a bad bronzie&quot;. \n\nNot everyone has fucking 3 hours per day to spend in ranked for months and months.  I could be gold, I just don&#039;t play enough.  So fuck you, you&#039;re bad for flaming people.","replies":[]}
