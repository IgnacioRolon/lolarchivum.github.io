Everything was going fine, I think I was 1/1/2 hitting lvl 7 heading into mid game, we had 1 drag.  I see enemy Yi heading to my blue, so I head there as well to try to counter him.  He instantly jumps me and goes head first with his Q, so after I pop my E, ghost, and even R to escape this motherfucker.  and HE STILL KILLED ME, LIKE WHAT!???  HE EVEN DID IT WRONG LIKE..  So i look and this motherfucker is LEVEL 11, WHAT THE FUCK?  HOW..... I... I.\n\n\nAre there such things as experience hacks?  How in the magical fuck does he just happen to have that many levels on me??  I&#039;ve been about as present as him.  I was taking camps. I was holding lanes.  I was ganking.  I even helped team take a dragon.  I WAS DOING EVERYTHING I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING, AS A JUNGLER.  But he just HAS 4 LEVELS ON ME???  WHAT?? HOW?  WHY IN ALL HELL DO I JUST HAPPEN TO GET LESS XP FOR THE SAME FUCKING SHIT????\n\nIs there like a secret to getting more XP that i&#039;m just not getting, or like new runes/masteries, or like the fact that they had Zilean and was duoing with the YI?  I.  Just.  Like wtf, how do you just get.  less.  XP.  how?","replies":[]}
