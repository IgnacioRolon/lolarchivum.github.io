Meaning, it sounds like you've got an an issue that needs to get fixed up so your timer doesn't continue to escalate.  The only way to remove it is to play your match without interruptions.  Even if it's out of your control leaving or dodging causes negative experiences for other players, so I recommend troubleshooting the issue.  \n\nBased on your description, it sounds like you are losing sync at champion select and getting left out.
