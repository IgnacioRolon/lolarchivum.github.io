You should try not fighting with your teammates and/or enemy team, if it seems like you get too easily provoked try turning off all chat and muting all your teammates if you feel like they're not making any valuable team communication, I've seen high elo players do this constantly to help them focus on the game and not get distracted from their goal of winning the match. \n\nWhen I'm in a match I always tell myself that it's not worth fighting with someone during a match since I can be most likely punished for it and it would cause the team to focus more in fighting with eachother then actually winning the game but sometimes I do feel the need to correct my teammates if they feel I did something wrong and if all fails I will just ignore them no matter what they say to try to provoke me back into the conversation.\n\nJust remember you're already winning the argument if someone is desperately trying to get your attention and can't seem to get it, plus just report them in the end.\n\n\n\nAlso for the Bronze issue, try watching some League of Legends videos on youtube, there's actually a streamer I enjoy watching called gbay99 that gives great advice on how to play the game and helped improve me a lot.

This free mystery skin gift was given to players that actually didn't hurt the game in any way. \n\nAn example of what you're doing.\n\nThere's a bakery sale for charity going on in your neighborhood, you come in  because you're hungry and give $1 for a cookie that they're selling and then start fighting with the people walking around in the event which may cause some of them to leave out of stress or dislike of your behavior but you donated right?

No one is perfect. I have tried to contribute positively. I have supported Riot's game. There is no reason to not give me a thank you note, other than deciding that I don't matter to the game. **\n\nDo you know why Riot calls it toxicity? It's because it spreads. They said that 95% or so of the players in this game are not consistently toxic, yet almost every game has toxicity. Why is that? It's because almost every player has little \"outbursts\". It's a particularly high stakes game, you're not doing well, one guy is feeding pretty hard, maybe you didn't get your main champion or role, and you freak a bit.   Everyone has those little outbursts, prompting others that it's okay to do them too. The community has mostly decided that if you don't make a habit of it, it's forgivable. So we get toxicity 90% of games, because 1/10 people is almost guaranteed to have a baby outburst.\n\nDo you see how your analogy doesn't work now? If this is a bakesale going on, they would have difficult customers that had bad times 9 times out of 10, but it's all worth it to help the charity (or make bank, in Riot's case). \n\nNow to really make this analogy work, I would need to consistently go to this bake sale, pay $1 for a cookie, and cause problems to the point that the owners are like \"you're only getting a cookie if you say less than 3 things every 5 minutes\". But I like these cookies, so I grit my teeth and do it. That ends and things resume to the way they were before.\n\nThen X amount of time later, the sale ends and they send out thank you letters. \"Thank you for our top spenders, you get a special cookie we designed just for you! Also thank you to 90% of our customers, even though you had some bad days and generally created a bad environment, you get a random, generic cookie.\" Oh, but those 10% of the people that we decided were overly contributing to the negative environment that everyone created? Yeah you get nothing, not even a thank you note, even though you contributed to the charity too.\n\nFfs. I don't know why I even bother trying.
