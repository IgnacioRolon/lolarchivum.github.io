My goals this season were to:\r\n1) Reach at least Gold (this is my second season playing ranked.  I climbed from Bronze 4 to Silver 5 0 LP last season.)\r\n2) Get an S rating on as many champions as I could.\r\n3) Get my champion mastery score as high as I could.\r\n\r\nI currently have a mastery rating of 335 with level 5 or higher mastery on 17 champions.\r\n\r\nI have gotten chests on:\r\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:5}} \r\n\r\nI have gotten an S rating on (but didn't have a chest available):\r\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:106}} \r\n\r\nAnd finally, I'm proud to say I just got promoted to Gold and am on pace to possibly make plat by the end of the season.  While I know Gold isn't that high I'm pretty happy that I carried myself all the way from Bronze 3 this season with a decent win rate and KDA dispite not having that much free time to play ranked.\r\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Randomonium\r\n\r\nSo what are you proud of this season?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-15T21:08:46.452+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm proud that I was able to make it back to Plat this season!

Hopefully, with enough time (IRL gets in the way), skill (always learning), and a little luck, I'll end the season as a Plat.

I managed to get plat 5 and stopped playing ranked all together. I mained jungle and adc to reach it. But after 4 seasons of playing this game and playing every role thoroughly, I've decided I'd start maining Top, and Jungle as secondary. So I stopped playing ranked all together and practice in norms. Turns put my norm mmr is super high and I play most of my games with high plat and diamond. I even get the occasional master/challenger. So that is great practice for season 7. \n\nMy second goal was to unlock all remaining champions. Im missing around 25 right now and I don't see this happening without buying an ip boost since most are 6300 ip and all are over 3150. \n\nMy third goal was to improve my anti-tilt mechanics, and I've got to say I am very happy about the results so far, though I'll admit to being pretty toxic when I go loose. \n\n\nGood news is, my gf is leaving on a study trip tomorow so I've got all week-end off work and no one at home. Guess I'll be practicing a good 40 hours.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xebenkeck","date":"2016-09-15T04:04:58.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm most proud of making Attack Speed, On-Hit Bard the reason I got to Lvl. 7 with him with over 170K EXP with him, but still manage to be stuck with Bronze.
