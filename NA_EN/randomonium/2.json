Considering Freljord is colder the route is likely to curve north and may even lead completely around Demacia.\n\nBut the interesting part here is that they indicate the western route, which goes straight across for a long stretch rather than the east route which turns north much earlier. This indicates that the west route is shorter, meaning as you said that Freljorth is somewehre northwest.","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2016-12-04T16:07:47.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's exactly what I thought too but you did a better job explaining it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2016-12-08T06:18:25.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooo, anyone else curious about the note on the right side of the map about men/women with purple feet?
