For example, if Kled is 100 HP away from being dismounted any you have an ability that should deal 500 damage that ability only deals 100 damage and dismounts Kled rather than doing 100 HP to Skaarl and 400 damage to Kled.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-08-23T23:14:48.518+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is not a bug.
