It would just mean you can&#039;t only play well in your main role and then tank your others with bad play and still promote through the ranks.\r\n\r\nMy second suggestion is linked to my first and its actually having an overall rank.\r\n\r\nNow this rank would be influenced more heavily by your primary and secondary roles but the others should still factor in.\r\n\r\nI think this would even more heavily discourage others from tanking other roles as combined with my first suggestion it would just mean they wouldn&#039;t actually promote. This would also be useful in allowing players to play above their level more easily without constantly running up against actual promo matches (if that&#039;s even going to be a thing after this) and I think it would also improve the quality of promotion matches themselves as even if you&#039;re auto-filled in your promotion matches you would have already proven yourself capable enough at the game itself, multiple roles.\r\nBasically, under this system there would be only one promotion per division, similar to current, when the a certain requirement in average lp/mmr of roles is met and your overall rank reaches promotion as a result. This would mean that maybe if you&#039;re extra good in your primary and secondary roles, even if your other roles are relatively weak. You could be say plat 3 in your main role and gold 4 in your worst role and still be able to promote. Alternatively you could even have situations where someone in say gold 2 high lp or gold 1 low lp in ALL roles may be eligible for promotion.\r\n\r\nNow these could all be tweaked but its just an example of the changes to the system I had in mind. In fact I would like to hear your opinions on how exactly you would tweak this system or rather what other different changes you would suggest to the one covered in the league video.","replies":[]}
