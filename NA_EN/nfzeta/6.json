It seems like a good type of damage for the tankier champions in the game but somehow riot has just seemed to drop it.\n\nI think Ornn was the last champ to try it but instead of giving him a minimum damage they just changed it into max health damage then nerfed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-08-26T21:55:01.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:516}} did no damage when he was first released and he needed it changed to maximum health...

Its just that because it was current health it scaled down and people kept overcommitting. What was needed was just a minimum damage or a base damage along with it. The fact that they had to nerf the max damage so hard only proves my point.\n\nCurrent health damage is viable, its just something people would need to get used to and usually needs a base or a minimum so it wouldn't literally end up doing nothing when the enemy is low health. Heck maybe it could do almost no damage but once it falls below a threshold it could have a utility aspect.","replies":[]}]}]}
