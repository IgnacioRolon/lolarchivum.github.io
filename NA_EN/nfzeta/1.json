I hope that Riot brings back **% Current Health Damage** and makes it a prevalent damage type for tanks.\n\nEdit: Add Note, seemingly there has be a bit of confusion but this is basically a change in a bid to get tanks back into the meta without either making them SUPER tanky and 100% unkillable, giving them too much damage or giving them even more and/or longer, reliable cc. The current health damage is just my idea for making a change to them which would make it easier to make them useful without being overpowered.\n\n I hope we can agree that what most people - other than those who like playing the tanks during their strong phase - hate about the tank meta is that while they're super tanky they also do a seemingly unfair amount of damage, while also keeping their utility.\n\nNow I feel this problem is brought about in large by few things.\n1. **% Max Health Dmg** - This damage type is pretty versatile and because of that its taken over the tank world as a means for tanks to duel other tanks while still doing damage to squishy characters. The problem arises here when tanks are tanky enough that their % health damage is enough that as long as they live for more than one rotation they still take away most of anyone's health.\n2. **High base damages** - This one is fairly self explanatory and base damages on tanks in general is something of a constant struggle as you have to keep rebalancing them around current overall tankiness or damage in-game.\n3. **Damage tied to tankiness** - Now this one I'm not prepared to cover in-depth in this post but that could be said to be arguably the #1 cause, especially when paired with my first stated contributing factor.\n\n\nNow a champion that could have been said to try this method of damage and failed is {{champion:516}} . However I believe it wasn't given its fair shake. As those playing during that time would know the problem with Ornn was that his current health damage was inconsistent to the point that at full health you would do a good amount of damage to your opponent but as they got low and you were in an extended trade its damage was reduced to next to nothing as 20% of 2000HP is peanuts next to 20% of 50HP.\n\n\n**The Easier Option** (with some drawbacks)\nHere I think would just be to give most current health dmg abilities a nice minimum damage threshold, this would at least prevent things from getting to ridiculous levels of variance in damage, to the point the low point is pretty much a waste of an ability in terms of damage. This would therefore still give them a chance in a duel situation. The drawbacks would be that you end up with a similar base damage balancing problem, it would just be a minimum damage balance issue.\n\n\n**The Extensive Option**\nNow this would be to change most % current health dmg abilities to have **a secondary utility effect** of some kind once the opposing champion falls below a certain actual health value. \nThis additional utility effect would also interact with the other abilities to shore up damage. In {{champion:516}}'s case it could be that the Bellows Breath (w) on low health champions would immediately proc the brittle it applies therefore augmenting both damage and utility. \n\nIn the case of a champ like {{champion:113}}, although it would probably need additional changes her perma-frost could be the additional effect at low % current health values and it would allow her other base damage abilities to do more.\nAnother obvious hiccup with this option is that it would require yet another tank update.\n\n\nOverall both options still would require players to get used to this type of damage, something that may bring about dissatisfaction, I do think we can try it though as it would cement tanks as the engage and playing field levellers without just totally killing all targets one by one as their initial damage would be high but then it would actually be better to spread your attention as a tank, both peeling and doing damage. \n\n\n**Now to finish**, my question is this. **Now would you guys be okay with such a current health damage system for tanks?** If not what do you think needs to change about %current health for it to seem fun to play or what other ideas do you have for changing tanks in terms of their damage systems?","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2019-01-11T22:23:22.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved! <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2019-01-14T15:10:04.439+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their are many issues with tanks. But my biggest concerned is how tanks have evolved over the years and how the champions as a whole changed:\n\nBack the in early days tanks used to be one of the only classes (beside supports) that have an decent amount of cc in their kit. Let's just look into the champions that where released in 2009 with the role they are currently playing the most on: \n\n* **Supports:** Fiddlesticks, ~~Alistar~~, Morgana, Soraka, ~~Taric~~, Janna, Blitzcrank\n* **Mid:** ~~Annie~~, Twisted Fate, Zilean, Karthus, ~~Anivia~~, ~~Veigar~~, Kassadin, Katarina, Corki\n* **Botlane:** ~~Ashe~~, Sivir, Tristana, Twitch, ~~Heimerdinger~~\n* **Jungle:** Master Yi, ~~Nunu~~, ~~Warwick~~, ~~Evelynn~~, Amumu, ~~Rammus~~, Shaco\n* **Top:** Jax, Kayle, ~~Ryze~~, ~~Sion~~, Teemo, Singed, Tryndamere, ~~Cho'Gath~~, Gangplank, Malphite, Dr. Mundo, Nasus\n\nI crossed out the champions that where reworked while giving them (in most case) more cc to give an better overview of the situation. Back in the early days. Their was cc but overal when cc was used their was a lot more downtime to it. If we would have an cc score back in 2009 the average champion would score haf of what he get's right now. The game evolved for the better but as a result this created problems for the game ballance. Cdr needed to be buffed and what used to be power semi ultimate abilities are now karthus Q's you spam with your eyes closed. If whe would have urf in 2009. We would play the game how it is today.\n\nBecause cc became that common more & more defensive items had to be introduced and even non support/tank that had cc in their kit. I must say that riot managed to keep cc relative ballanced until 2012. But that year everything changed. With the release of  Hecarim, (Jayce), (Zyra), Syndra, Elise, Vi. The road was open for other classes to be stacked with cc in their kit.\n\nOn 2012-02-14 that Vanguard (ex Jungler, support) Nautilus was released. That claimed the title of the king of cc. This was a champion that had a Passive, Q and R that provided hard cc and a E with soft cc. Back that this was something really unique for a champion. Not a single champion could even dream about having this amount. Now let's seen some competition:\n\n* {{champion:154}} rework\n* {{champion:12}} rework\n* {{champion:154}} rework\n* {{champion:57}} rework\n* {{champion:516}} \n* {{champion:164}} \n\nO I still known the day they released {{champion:245}} do you?\n\n----\n\nOveral to get towards the point I try to make: The average cc a champion is able todo has been cast over a periode of time has been increased to a point it's not longer unique for a non support/tank to have it. And as a result their decreased value forces them into directions outside their own design.","replies":[{"poster":"C0LdBLooDeD","date":"2019-01-14T16:45:00.964+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed that's one of the core role problem for champions.\nEach new champion and iteration has to be stuffed up with all kinds of cc,steroids and more important high mobility that blows up the definition of a role.Then he is only defined by his base stats/growth and his ability scaling.\n\nIf riot was making champions based on roles that fell under certain criteria then you could genuinely say that's a tank,a mage, an assassin, a marksman,etc.\nAs an example of specification for roles they will need to fall into categories.\n \nTanks requirements:High hp/defense/magic resist, potent cc, a sort of sustain, mid to high base damage and low scaling , no mobility\n\nMages requirements:High mana,Medium health,high burst damage or low cooldowns for poke, minor cc , low mobility , low self sustain\n\nAssassins requirements:Low health,low defenses,High Burst , high damage,high mobility, minor cc, high scaling\n\nAdc requirements:Medium health,low mana,low defenses,low damage , high scaling , medium mobility, self buffs/steroids\n\nSupports requirements:Medium health/mana,medium defenses,low damage, low scaling, low mobility,high sustain self and team,moderate cc\n\nRoles in between or mix (Bruiser, mage assassin,Tank support)share a a portion of given stats based on champion.\n\nThat maybe take away multiple roles for a champion.But lets be honest here having over 100 champions means new opportunities to learn a different role.You wont have to play 1 champion for all the roles and succeed in only half of them.You will be forced to become more flexible and who knows you will maybe enjoy new champions and playstyles","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-01-26T02:46:10.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I take issue with mages and adcs having medium health they should both be low hp classes and mages cant have high burst damage and low cooldowns or we get the unbalanced mess we have now. if you have high burst damage you then must have long cooldowns for there to be windows of retaliation. \n\ni also have an issue with ranged champions having lots of mobility  range is supposed to be your safety net you get a second one in cc thats fine but it shouldnt be stronger cc than melees like it often is and you cant then also have mobility.

Its practically something that could have been a 'or' situation with the current queue system. After all, before, you just queued up and had to fight for a role leading to people playing many roles and needing many different champions. Now however you have the queue system to limit your attained roles somewhat but you also have champions whose kits are overloaded to serve in many roles.\n\nThis compounded into what we have today where, while not on the level of one-tricks, a lot of players can only play one role, maybe two. This limits game knowledge a lot and while in the short term players may complain about not getting their role I think they enjoyed the variance overall. Especially since you were sometimes forced to play that very role you constantly complained about when playing your main role.\n\nThis is all why I want tanks to differentiate themselves more. Its why I'm especially fond of the implications of my second suggestion in terms of playstyle of tanks. Its moves them further away from the usual single focus or aoe playstyle of damage dealers, instead they would be rewarded for constant changing of targets and suppressing the teamfights, all the while not losing damage. Even then though, they could also focus one target if its really required and do less damage but have greater utility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-01-26T02:40:15.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thing is damage was also about half of what it is now too Or actually damage was about 30% lower and defense about 50% better stat wise (but defense stacking is also deminishing returns for the same amount of defense bought)  and 'squishy champions' were actually squishy cause their defense was actually worse  (adcs assassins and mages). and had longer down times. cc is only lower cooldowns because they need damage spells to keep up with other damage spells. otherwise riot stypidly put all the cc on tanks because thats where the community said thats where it was supposed to be quoting mmos which league's classes are designed refrenceing but in mmos mages are in charge of cc tanks are in charge of aggro. \nI also count 6 -8 champions in that rework list that got more cc","replies":[]},{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2019-01-14T20:48:00.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically you don't think going for even more cc as in say my secondary suggestion would work as it would make things much worse?

This is one of the reasons why so was to effective as a support even on release. I never said that is was bad that Zyra had so much cc. In fact she made a hugh impact on how supports evolved over the years and that's why she's still my main champion. I do have to admit that Zyra probally would never have ended into the support role if her kit would have been less cc centered. The thing with Zyra is not how much cc she has but more on how potentional cc she can have. Overal Zyra was one of those champions on release that actually had a fair amount of low cost , low cooldown cc abilities with a kit that could utilize {{item:3116}} so effectively she was able to perma show her targets without putting to much focus on resources in order to use them.\n\nAn cc-score is not only determent how on much cc you have on your abilities but also on the duration, cost and cooldown on these abilities. I think you would be supprised what cc-score champions could have with just one low cd, low cost , regular cc ability.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TakaDama","date":"2019-01-13T14:41:25.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as a Tank meta vs Carry meta goes, I believe it should be simply a matter of when a Carry's ability to kill a Tank is better than the Tank'd ability to kill the Carry in a single match. Carries are supposed to the best in sustained damage output and objective control outside the jungle after a certain point, but until then are somewhat reliant on their support and ganks to do well. Tanks on the other hand always maintain some form of utility in the form of CC/Engage/Peel even if their durability doesnt outlast the carry's survivability.\n\nUnfortunately, carries can't get the items needed to hit their power spike if they are constantly bursted down by assassins and certain mages (especially now with towers the way they are); to that effect, maybe increasing the base stat scaling of carries could be an option, or somehow allowing more gold to enter the carry's pocket until a certain item threshold (like until first tier 3 item, passive gold income is doubled or something more reasonable). Of course the latter would require a fourth part to each rune page or elsewhere; but it may be useful outside of carries.","replies":[{"poster":"Bot robot","date":"2019-01-16T18:28:56.556+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is clearly not adc but really tanks which are not played.

If you're saying that adcs die because towers have plating and they want to destroy it but then get caught it's being bad at the game not an actual flaw in the game.\n\nI think the issue is the \"bruiser\" role with high dmg, high sustain and high resistance like Kled, Gnar.... who have access to \"Conqueror\" that gives a doubled Infinity edge's passive for free in addition to AD to make it even stronger. Every single one of them goes for it and that makes playing tank too difficult and forces to play it too or at least not a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"TakaDama","date":"2019-01-17T04:02:27.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then that is still basically a damage-focused class of champions overcoming a resistance-focused class of champions too early in the game (thanks to Conqueror being a rune), which was my point, not anything to do with pushing too hard (you can still get caught with a frozen lane).\n\nCarries and others who specialize in sustained damage should be the premier tank killers, but in order for them to do so they need gold. Not saying that this is a problem, but it is part of the reason why tanks are hardly in a healthy place as if tanks are too strong, then the objective control classes cannot contribute much if at all, resulting in stale gameplay, and if they are too weak, then the tanks cannot contribute much if at all, resulting in games decided by a single team fight.\n\nTo that effect (and to reiterate), I believe Tanks should be good early game where the gameplay is a bit more tedious and then fall off in terms of damage and resistance (not utility) as the game progresses.\n\nAs far as bruisers go, they should be the ultimate early game champion class based on what I've suggested and how you define them; the lack of utility combined with high damage and high resistances should make them lane bullies by nature, so long as they fall off at some point.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"C0LdBLooDeD","date":"2019-01-12T22:45:41.835+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to ask and no offense but what game are you playing?\n\nThe Tank meta died many seasons ago.If you have noticed riot slowly changes all kind of tanks to damage dealers with a bit higher defensive stats.\nCurrent pure tanks already struggle to survive 1 single encounter.They have less cc,less regen,less health than their previous versions and more damage.\nFor my guess your problem is certain bruisers that ditch out huge damage while having big shields or healing options and are difficult to deal with.\nTanks aren't there to ditch damage they have no need to this king of thing.They need good cc,some form of sustain/shielding themselves and heavy migration.They initiate and protect the team.But currently that's hardly a ting nowadays\n\nAnd bork is a core item for almost all adc that melts tanks.Mages have their liaras torment.Binding % damage types to abilities just gives the option gives damage in exchange for something useful. \n\nSo no i don't think that tanks need that.They only need good base damage in their damaging abilities,with very low scaling but moderate if its health/armor/magic resist.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2019-01-14T20:59:07.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you misunderstood me because of my title.\n\nI was speaking of the **complaints** and not the actual meta where tanks are good. I realise that tank meta died a while back and many times what people call the tank meta are the juggernaut meta or the meta where carries build tank while still doing tonnes of damage. I don't think its been dead for that long though, its not necessary for the **pure** tanks to be in the meta for people to call it a tank meta, as long as tankiness is what seems to rule the game. Due to these the actual pure tanks never get a chance to raise their heads for long.\n\nMy problem is that tanks have been shoved out of the meta because of such tank meta complaints. Because of that the game has lost its somewhat formulaic gameplay to a possibly excessive extent. This results in today's problem bruisers/fighters like {{champion:39}} , {{champion:266}} , etc along with yesterday's problem juggernauts like {{champion:36}} , {{champion:420}}. \n\n\n> So no i don't think that tanks need that.They only need good base damage in their damaging abilities,with very low scaling but moderate if its health/armor/magic resist.\n\nThe problem with this I find is that the game no longer makes such a simple setup valuable. I think its mainly because of mobility and its excessive importance in the current game. If you bind damage scaling to resistances then you end up with tanks doing more damage than necessary until they eventually get their tankiness removed and become like today's {{champion:516}} or they just get nerfed back down.\nThis is because with just altering damage and tank numbers its seemingly impossible to balance tanks in this current mobility environment, they end up needing to be overly strong to have a proper effect.\n\nAll the same I don't think people would be ready for a blanket of having tanks just having better cc. Hence my suggestion of inversely tying cc to the current health damage abilities as a way to prevent instances of tanks diving in and immediately locking down a target for a long length of time. By limiting it to only when they're at low health it means they don't have major cc up front but still have more than other champions in this mobility and therefore cc heavy situation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gramps69","date":"2019-01-18T19:24:26.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think another thing they could do to improve the tank experience is removing some of the CDR from mage's kits and bruiser's kits.

Less mana regen and mana restore options (this would be changed so that it's more noticeable in midgame, lane phase should still have similar mana regen rates imo) would mean that mages have to be more conscious of how they manage their mana, or need to invest in mana regen items (Archangels, RoA, if Rito would buff Athene's so mages could use it again that would be fantastic).","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2019-01-20T00:38:05.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would hard gimp mages too much, you can't take away their mana, mana regen and cdr all at once, that would just make them useless. \n\nThe only way this goes through is if assassins also lose their wave clear and fighters lose all but their tank option CDR choices.

Mages are there for high and **reliable** burst damage that depends on the mage's itemization and not anyone else's.\n\nTanks having current % health damage makes their damage slightly reliant on enemy builds and stats but keeps their tankiness reliant on them.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-01-26T20:02:01.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are control mages dot mages and burst mages in the Mage category but there is no difference atm its not surprising that you would think that all mages are burst mages.\nYou cant have High and reliable damage at the same time thats how you get broken shit.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2019-01-27T02:42:53.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I say reliable I mean that doesn't fluctuate with the enemies health or items. I know the difference in mages, in my comment there I was specifically referring to burst mages that's all.\n\nDot mages just have base damages, doing % dmg is very risky on dot mages as liandry's torment would show. That little bit on an item is already super powerful. Imagine that on rumble with rumble's flame spitters also doing % health dmg.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hallajuice","date":"2019-01-18T17:57:34.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they could fix the problem by making all tanks get less damage as they level up and more defenses post level 10.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2019-01-26T18:18:02.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that happens then their leads disappear too quickly.","replies":[]}]}]}
