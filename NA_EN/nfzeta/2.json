Its better to not take the cc in the first place even if before upgrading to banshee&#039;s you still take the dmg.\r\n\r\nsry if I put this in the wrong area.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-10-12T00:23:41.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The good AD items are more for the assassins and bruisers, ADCs actually don't have many REAL options. For example {{item:3087}} , a good split push item however most ADs can't afford it because not only does it give less AS than most of its counterparts, the very champions who need it need the extra AS and passives the other items give. A vayne or even graves for example, both would be good with shiv but for vayne both {{item:3046}} and {{item:3094}} are mechanically better for her.\nAs for defensive items this is even more apparent in this meta. For example making {{item:3139}} the qss items means you are getting an offensive defensive item which usually still takes up ur defensive slot. I'm not saying {{item:3139}} is bad but i would like to have both options properly with both having their own weakness. It would also help with those click to win type ults.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2016-09-07T19:56:46.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know what we need...
