I don't know how this happened.. I felt like a game of league and tried out the new game mode.. after I finished the game I left the client open and just went to watch a couple of videos to chill.. all of a sudden I got disconnected from chat and pvp and since sometimes it happens I just waited a bit until everything is back to normal.. but what happened was that I couldn't connect back to chat or pvp so I just closed the client.. after that I started having these problems. What's going on? is there anything I can do? Also I tried the repair thingy before logging in and it's still doing the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T16:59:43.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are experiencing a pretty weak connection issue to our server that is unstable or doesn't connect at all.
