The burst from killing with your ult could begin to become significant.

Having so much of its utility revolve around killing the target enemy causes some problems - namely, it feels terrible to use unless you're certain it will kill the target. \n\nVeigar's identity is much more the \"farm AP, burst down targets\" variety anyway. He deals damage and _doesn't afraid of anythign._ Lategame his whole schtick is just that you can chunk everything with anything, and his ult should really factor into that - its current iteration on live actually does that pretty well, it just irks me that the enemy-AP thing is at all involved. \n\nHow about instead of increasing the scaling and adding the death-explosion, you do something like have it remove (0.1*AP) of the target's MR for 3 seconds? That way, you can open a fight with it to amplify your burst. Early on it might be equivalent to Sorc Shoes or something, but when you hit Lategame Badass Veigar you're suddenly busting their armor to the tune of -100MR.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCabes","date":"2015-04-07T02:24:23.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you're saying but I have to disagree. Veigar doesn't need to shred any MR from the carries to kill them so that would make that pointless for bursting the carries. Instead you would be ulting the tanks to shred their MR and shredding too much makes Veigar able to burst carries AND tanks which would not be healthy. If it isn't enough MR shred to burst tanks then it's useless because he doesn't need it to burst the carries.","replies":[{"poster":"MagentaHawk","date":"2015-04-07T04:34:47.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there is something backwards here. %MR shred would be good against tanks. Flat MR Pen is best against carries. Taking a carry from their 40 MR to 0 makes you deal TRUE damage. Much better than taking a tank from its 140 MR to 100 or higher.

In late-late, you can nearly OS an APC, and 100-0% anyone with full combo unless he's full tank.\n\nI don't think veigar's ult is a problem right know.

IMO all Riot needs to do is remake his E into some other kind of stun, because the cage isn't working with the rest of his kit since it requires them to be immobilized to land.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-07T13:57:45.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole point of the .8 enemy AP ratio is that it allows a Veigar who is behind a chance to catch up, and a Veigar who is ahead is supposed to be an *anti-mage* whose sole purpose is to annihilate the enemy's APC.

His current one doesn't work with his kit at all, which is a huge issue. The W requires CC to land and Veigar just can't do it anymore unless the opponent straight up chooses to be stunned, so I would agree that they should keep the 80% because that's really not the issue anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-07T15:06:44.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"early-mid game, the enemy AP has around 200 AP.
