If Veigar&#039;s W gets buffed so that it can land on targets without stunning them or even if it&#039;s only when they&#039;re trapped in his event horizon, Veigar could be even BETTER then before he was nerfed. It used to be you had to stun to land that skill because it deals massive aoe damage, but if you remove the necessity to stun then it can easily become overpowered. If they do make the W landable without a stun then they would have to nerf its damage which could hurt Veigar even more.\n\nI personally think that a simple change to his E could solve all of Veigar&#039;s problems. Make his event horizon appear instantly on the single point of the horizon closest the him when he casts it and over .75 seconds it gradually forms around the edges to the far side. This would make the stun usable to punish players that run to close and actually allow you to defend yourself without being able to stun people from far distance.\n\nAlso, making the Q a single target spell so you can actually harass the other laner would help bring him back as well. If not that then the Q should go through minions and be able to hit at least the first champion on top of damaging two minions. As the Q is now you can&#039;t harass with it against a competent laner.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-29T16:52:04.885+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was SUPPOSED to be better after his changes.\n\nAlot of people do not seem to understand that.\n\nThey did not want to nerf veigar","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-03-29T17:42:48.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"49% win rate in 5.6\n\nLooks like the recent changes helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-29T18:10:05.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They did.\n\nHis buffs were really nice.\n\nAll he needs is a w or E tweak and he will be golden\n\nEdit: Someone is already downvoting you.
