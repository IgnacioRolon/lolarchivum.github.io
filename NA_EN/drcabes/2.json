That Get's Countered By Every Mage.....","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":109,"down_votes":20,"body":"Two primary types of AP champions, assassins and poke. Right now Veigar gets beat by both and his only counter against them is that he can ult them late-game for nearly all of their hp. Assassins like Leblanc Ahri can 100% Veigar pre-6 while he has to wait to 100% them until 20-30 minutes into the game, and that&#039;s only if they run into his stun. Poke champions like Xerath and Ziggs are the same. They can poke him and Veigar cant poke back. he can only 100% them if they are way out of position and it&#039;s late game.\n\nI think it&#039;s time Veigar lost the \"counter mage\" identity considering he doesn&#039;t even fulfill it right now.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe reason for this post is because of every post regarding a change to his ultimate. They all get down-voted and receive negative comments because it would remove his identity as a \"counter-mage\", which was already removed from him. I'm not saying his ult needs to be changed. I'm just saying the argument of him still being a counter-mage doesn't hold.","replies":[{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2015-04-14T11:54:07.816+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Veigar's pretty good okay?\n\n.. for a caster minion that is.","replies":[{"poster":"BeerOfRoot4843","date":"2015-04-14T21:10:43.097+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least caster minions can't miss their shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"10Tickler","date":"2015-04-14T19:09:49.368+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ginnjii,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XA1JE0T2,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-14T11:54:07.816+0000)\n>\n> Hey, Veigar's pretty good okay?\n> \n> .. for a caster minion that is.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/a9A6vI9.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blancmark","date":"2015-04-15T09:59:15.797+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}} IS THAT A SHORT-....never mind.... {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2015-04-15T10:09:34.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, but you know what is?\n\nYou.","replies":[{"poster":"Blancmark","date":"2015-04-15T10:44:09.266+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}} Prepare to meet your dooooooommm!\n\n.....would you kindly stand still for a bit?

If he really doesn't bounce back though, at least he can kill the mage he likely laned against.\n\nAs well thought out as this post is, you clearly didn't know him before his rework. Or really in the past at all.\n\nHis power fantasy was THE anti-mage burst-mage. His Q stacking minigame, to my knowledge, has actually never been particularly used by players who are good at him. They've always used his Q to harass so that come level 6 they can instantly kill the enemy and get snowballing.\n\nLook at his release kit, please. Realize that he was **definitely intended to be the game's anti-mage.**\n\n*     Entropy (Passive) - Veigar's attacks steal 5 Ability Power per strike for 8 seconds. This effect stacks.\n\n*     Baleful Strike - Unleashes dark energy at target enemy dealing Magic Damage. If a unit is killed, Veigar gains 1 Ability Power for a minion or 5 Ability Power for a champion.\n\n*     Dark Matter - After 2 seconds, dark matter falls from the sky to the target location, dealing Magic Damage.\n\n*     Event Horizon - Veigar twists the edges of space around the target location for 3 seconds, stunning enemies who pass through the perimeter for a short duration.\n\n*     Primordial Burst (Ultimate) - Blasts target enemy champion, dealing Magic Damage plus 25% of the target's maximum Mana. If Primordial Burst deals a killing blow, Veigar regains Mana.\n\n\nHe stole AP and did damage based on the target's mana. The next ability rework:\n\n*  Entropy REMAKE\n       Auto attacks lower the target's ability power by 25% (non-stacking).\n\nHe lowered the opponent's AP by **25%.** Clearly antimage.\n\nNext up!:\n\n*  Entropy REMAKE\n      Veigar steals 20% of each nearby champion's ability power. The amount stolen per target cannot exceed five times Veigar's level.\n\nThat seems pretty antimage to me. Passively stealing 20% of everybody's AP.\n\nEventually they changed it to the current equilibrium. That same patch, to maintain his anti-mage identity, they changed his ult to 80% of the enemy's AP and his AP combined. Next patch, it was 1.0 of both of their AP's. Next, it is what it was until the rework, 80% of theirs, and 120% of his.\n\nHe is very, very clearly, historically an anti-mage that is meant to burst them to death. That was and should be his entire thing. He was never intended to be this Q-stacking thing. That was just a bonus when farming after you blew up the enemy champion (why do you think killing them also rewards 1/2/3/4/5 AP?)\n\nLooking into the past gives you a good feeling of what the champion was intended to be. Riot just changed their minds a few patches ago because he was being played as support and they just won't have that, now will they?\n\n(Also, just a side-note, his meteor doesn't take 50% of anyone's HP away right now, its impossible to land just like his E is)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vayne Mechanics","date":"2015-04-14T17:16:06.206+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":16,"body":"He is not a counter mage.

It may not be for the longest of times but 1-2 years is still a good amount.\n\nLet's clarify my thoughts on him being an anti-mage. Firstly let me say, I don't understand why people consider him to be one. He's an anti-anyone who builds flat Ap with no utility champion if anything. So people like leblanc was what veigars ult was truely good against.\n\nNow here's why I don't think he should be an antimage or even considered one. There are **a lot** of champions who are played mid who are AD or don't really build that much AP. It's actually to the point you don't even consider the bonus damage from enemy AP, it's just too inconsistent, and if something is too inconsistent you just don't add it to the 'plan'. \n\nReferring back to pre dfg removal, the general rule was, if you didn't have a decent amount of health and/or MR, veigar would instantly kill you. It didn't matter if you were Zed, khaz, leblanc, ezreal, caitlyn, oriana, syndra, or wh ever, without health and/or mr you were going to die or you were going to live. \n\nFrom all my experiences I've never once noticed the bonus enemy ap damage really mattering. I've played veigar at a fairly high level for a couple of years and I've never considered tabulating the enemy AP as damage. \n\nI never looked at the enemy AP and tried to figure out if it'd kill them. I never considered him an anti mage, I considered him an anti-anyone with low hp/mr, because that's what he was. He was a nuker, no reason to attach anti-mage because he was just as good against the AD casters.\n\nNow what are my proposed changes? I've thought about it a couple of times on how to make him more fun with his current skill set, but I haven't really thought about a real rework.\n\nHis passive needs to be changes. As it is it sucks, and I've never liked it. It gives you much less than you think when you consider his overall mana costs. Useless passive.\n\nHis E needs a rework just flat out. Just keeping it as a cage I would add augmentations to his pre existing skills. \n\nWhen his Q passes through the walls they penetrate all targets within, and maybe gets a jayce treatment in that it speeds up, and gets bigger with more damage till it hits the other side of the cage and disappears. This would fix the issue where people can just kill you in return if you trap them inside for them to 'dance' around. \n\nWhen you use his W inside the box, drop time is instant, maybe more damage. \n\nR change, I'd like to have the enemy AP scaling removed, it was always a stupid mechanic, and then increase it's scaling up to 130%, then have it do 150% when hitting an enemy in the box.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2015-04-19T09:00:00.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've literally lost my response to you twice to accidentally backing the page when I meant to open a new tabbed.
