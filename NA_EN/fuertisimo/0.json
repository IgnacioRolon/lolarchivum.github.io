I'm not sure if this is solely related to League of legends or not but it seems to happen when I'm using League. What will happens is that my screen will suddenly flash and lock in a pattern, could be say green and light green stripes or a solid white screen. The audio will keep working for a while but eventually the whole thing will lock up and the computer will restart. It's caused me to get an afk penalty a few times over the last 6 months and I don't know how to identify what's going wrong. \r\n\r\nAnyone can help?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-09T02:53:17.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're experiencing is most likely caused by either a driver issue or a hardware one, but a few things will need to be tried to determine which is the culprit.
