Crit is probably fine, after all, random mechanics like tripping in SSB are what make watching a professional E-sport dynamic and fun. In fact, bring back dodge. And while you're at it, introduce an item that has a .2% chance to kill a random enemy champion every second but which gives no stats, I'd buy five on Teemo. \r\n\r\nC'mon riot your players have spoken!
