Powerful ganks. Initiates teamfights with a single target skillshot gapcloser and follows up with AOE damage and a potent cc ultimate that can win teamfights. The same general pattern as Lee Sin, and Amumu tends to boast a much higher overall winrate. \r\n\r\nHere's a little guide for Riot as to why this little guy is generally considered okay by your players while Lee is consistently among the most hated champions in the game. \r\n\r\n1) An actual weak period. You know that Amumu is going to become a monster late game. That's why he has a glaring weakness early on you can capitalize on. Conversely, players feel that there is never a time where Lee Sin is vulnerable. Why?\r\n\r\n2) Safety. Amumu and Lee Sin both throw a Q. \r\n\r\nAmumu goes in. \r\n\r\nLee sin has a several second window to consider, and even then may cancel immediately with a ward hop, and his ult is there as well for a disengage. Every element in Lee's kit he can use to make big plays he can use to prevent them as well. \r\n\r\n3) Rewards for Counterplay. \r\n\r\nAmumu and Lee Sin miss a Q. \r\n\r\nAmumu can do nothing-his long cooldowns mean that he has been outplayed for this fight. \r\n\r\nLee Sin can W+slow+R to accomplish the same thing then use his minute CD on Q to jump out to safety   \r\n\r\nThere are so many redundant systems in lees kit to prevent Counterplay that there's almost no point in trying-you're not going to waste any resource or stop his \"bigplays\" from happening, you may as well just accept it.","replies":[{"poster":"Leafie","date":"2015-02-01T17:41:07.600+0000","up_votes":75,"down_votes":3,"body":"Amumu has to build damage to do damage.\n\nLee Sin with his high bases doesn't have that issue.","replies":[{"poster":"supes the lost","date":"2015-02-01T20:22:39.709+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"oh yeah, that ones my favorite, I'm camping under my tower then lee hops in, dragon kicks me in the face, I die, then he ward hops out.","replies":[{"poster":"Left Hook Larry","date":"2015-05-25T15:06:04.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You do realize he has cooldowns right?

Machete covers your crying enough that you base mana regen plus it almost negate the costs. You run out of mana from using E and Q (Q being the biggest cost). E is generally what I get second and I can spam it until I clear blue for 3 then its back to not having mana issues again (I generally have about 25% mana left, so not enough to be considered a problem). Now once blue is gone you will start draining mana, but I mean you shouldn't be powerfarming too long as a really gank heavy champ.\n\nAll I can say is avoid using his Q too much. That is your biggest mana drain and usually isn't worth using for clears (especially more so if you fear counter jungling) unless you have blue buff active.","replies":[{"poster":"JevelFaithful","date":"2015-02-02T18:23:04.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much same as I do.

Easily get to blue that way. \nThen after you get blue you have a few options, since you shouldn't have taken much damage, you can take Q and go for counter jungle/gank. Or level up e again and continue farming or back. \n\nBiggest thing to avoid later on is using q to leap to camps. It's faster but will trash your mana. Unless of course you have blue. \n\nI prefer to stay Ranger's machete. However you can switch to chilling when you upgrade if you want. However ranger's lets you gank and clear almost non stop with the mana regen.

Lee gets two. One has more utility. Other one he can choose not to go in after he lands it. \n\nLee has sustain\n\nLee can put a champion in harms way. Amumu has to rely on his team to make use of his CC. \n\nReally cannot compare the champions too much. Amumu is a teamfighter with situational picks. Lee makes picks and plays with fewer restrictions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-02-01T19:37:42.995+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Amumu is a poor duelist and unlikely to be able to punish over extended or just solo farming a lane individually.\n\nLee Sin can do both, while having the freedom to start anywhere in the jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am the Remedy","date":"2015-02-01T21:18:35.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"1)  A: Amumu has a weak period?

Amumu's late game is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better than lee's it's ridiculous that you even make this statement.\n2)  Agreed.  Lee sin is very safe both while counter jungling (which is crap this season) and when being counterjungled (again, which is crap this season).\n3)  Lee sin q's in, he gets knocked up (janna q, blitz hook, wukong ult, vi q, etc.)  HE DOES NO DAMAGE.  Amumu's q tries to get interrupted?  Damage is still done, and you're still stunned.  You forgot that amumu's Q stuns as well?  Oh and amumu's q has a WHOPPING 1 second longer cd than lee's Q.\n4) getting lee's kick to be aoe is SIGNIFCANTLY harder to do than Amumu's ult.  The trade off for this is that lee can kick carries into your team.  Ofc amumu has 3 seconds of lockdown which is pretty similar.  \n5) \"Lee Sin can W+slow+R to accomplish the same thing then use his minute CD on Q to jump out to safety \"  That is horse shit.  Good luck doing that even in plat without getting interrupted into oblivion.\n\n\nAmumu is actually stronger than lee in the current jungle and meta.  That's why his win rate is so much higher.  It's almost unbearably hard to carry games with Lee this season.  I can do pretty much all of his tricks (which I've spent A LONG TIME to learn).  All of this still doesn't make up for the late game where he becomes a glorified support with some burst potential.  Add to that fact that his greatest strength, counterjungling, has been nerfed to hell because of the xp loss from not farming your own jungle (camps give you more xp depending on how many times they've had to respawn), and the ridiculous XP bonuses granted to you when you're underleveld this season and he's a far cry from his glory days when he was hands down one of the best jungler in the game.  \n\nHe is still very very good in competitive play.  But competitive play might as well be a different game from solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Autrah Fang","date":"2015-02-01T22:48:36.862+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Modevasion,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QooGhQos,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2015-02-01T21:18:35.027+0000)\n>\n> 1)  A: Amumu has a weak period?
