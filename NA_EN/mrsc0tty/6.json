I'm going to hypothesize that in the world of league of legends it is common martial Knowledge that a spinning object will always deal more damage than a non spinning one. With that in mind, I will add a few champions. \n\nThesis: upon examining the available source information I have come to the conclusion that SPINNING IS IN FACT A POTENT SOURCE OF MAGICAL POWER IN RUNETERRA. Spinning on most champions actually costs them magical energy (mana). But some, the true \"spin masters\" of the league of legends like Garen, Riven, Katarina and Tryndamere actually use frequent combat spins to power their moves and enable them to launch massive magical attacks without the need for mana at all.\n\nConclusion: Garen is indeed the most powerful wizard in Runeterra. \n\nSpinning for combat effect clearly has some deep roots in  Runeterran culture. We see spins in champions across all nationalities implying that permutations on the Tactical Spin are employed and practiced as accepted military tactics across Valoran. \n\nNotable combat spin users:\n\nDemacia: Garen (continuous damage mobile crit enabled multi-spin) and Xin Zhao (a variation on the Ionian style utility spin single rotation)\n\nNoxus: Darius (AOE single spin damage rotation coupled with the tight-body single target \"flourish spin\") Katarina (A single rotation spin as well as a ranged variation on the continuous damage spin-perhaps hinting at an affection for the demacian style spin?, Warwick (Single target flourish spin as well as a critical hit spin) and of course \n\nDraven: Draven (a double continuous ranged damage amplifying aerodynamic-enhancing spin)\n\nFreljord: Tryndamere (a quick mobility spin used for swift repositioning and damage) and Sejuani (uses a weapon clearly designed for the sole purpose of spinning around her head which , when thrown spinning, causes great devastation)\n\nIonia: Akali (single rotation simple spin) Zed (another simple spin), Irelia (whose spinning blades grant her a utility spin for a powerful stun) and Wukong (the true spin master of Ionia employs the signature utility focused Ionian style spin coupling it with mobile continuous application spinning)\n\nIt's clear that combat spins have a deep history, as Ancient shuriman warriors Renekton and Amumu both employ the more primitive single rotation spins which we can also see reflected in the ancient ninja arts practiced by Akali and Zed. The Yordles with their insular culture seem to have disregarded the spin as a valid tactic and indeed the more modern empires of Piltover and Zaun disdain spins-so combat spinning is an ancient traditional art. \n\nOne can also use spins to form clues as to the origins of some champs. Jax, the grandmaster, appears to have pioneered a dual-stage defensive to offensive spin, but note that the offensive portion is a traditional single rotation Ionian utility spin. Also worth noting: what is the only type of melee combat technique not block able by Jax's defensive spin? Yeah. You guessed it. \n\nThe spin also clearly has roots in the nature of Runeterran magic as well. Many champs spin to manifest magical energy, including: Ahri, Lulu, Janna, Velkoz, and Twisted Fate.\n\nCan someone at Riot enlighten us on the significance of the spin in Runeterran martial history? Who initially pioneered the trick of the continuous spin? Has the need for rotational balance influenced the design of heavy armor in the nation states of runeterra? It's clear from Darius' joke that the mobile continuous spin has not been mastered by Noxus, how has this technological deficit affected their plans for expansion?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2014-12-25T07:07:03.966+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrSc0tty,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uhpKpAWb,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-12-25T05:19:13.787+0000)The Yordles with their insular culture seem to have disregarded the spin as a valid tactic and indeed the more modern empires of Piltover and Zaun disdain spins-so combat spinning is an ancient traditional art. \n\nNot entirely!
