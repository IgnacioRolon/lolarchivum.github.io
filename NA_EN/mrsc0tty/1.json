It's us, the non-support tanks. Regarding your latest jungle changes, you've added 100g to the combine cost of our basic jungle items, and it's giving us the idea that not only do you really not want us jungling, we can no longer defy you and do it anyway. \r\n\r\nSee, after pitifully clearing two to three camps and going back, we're lucky if we can scrape together 450 gold, and without any potions at all our second clear will be just as sad as the first, at which point we will be several levels and hundred gold behind everyone else. Given that our itemization tends to only be 80-75% gold efficient anyway and that's before penetration...trying to jungle seems like it'll give us about as much success as trying to be the ADC. \r\n\r\nSo here's our resume again, Riot. Tanks: Rammus Sejuani Hecarim Zac Volibear Amumu Chogath Maokai Nautilus Galio. Currently unemployed, our goals are simple. We would like to be A) hard to kill, B) capable of engaging the enemy and applying strong crowd control and C) flexible enough to trade off our survivability for a bit of damage somehow through tank/damage items  if we absolutely have to hurt things. \r\n\r\nWe would like a new designated lane. May we suggest some ideas, Riot? Maybe throw us in as a counter to those assassins in midlane, or strengthen our early game against ranged tops? Those are a couple lanes that could really use another point in their balance triangle. Really, we'd be happy anywhere you'd agree not to aggressively nerf us out of again. \r\n\r\nTalk to us, Riot, let's have a constructive conversation. We make up a whole unique class of your game, we have considerable trade offs, we make big flashy plays, let's figure out where we can be.","replies":[{"poster":"NoFunWithNunu","date":"2015-01-23T15:21:39.343+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"tanks nowdays are forced into supportish role no matter the lane, and still get killed really easy since penetration items are cheap, dragon provides free damage stats and the mobility on new champs","replies":[{"poster":"doubleguac","date":"2015-01-24T18:57:30.379+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">tanks nowdays are forced into supportish role no matter the lane\n\nWell, their role is, by definition, supportish. They're designed to protect their carries by soaking damage/CC'ing divers, and lock down enemy targets so they can be picked off by higher damage allies. Protecting allies and locking down enemies is what a support does.\n\nA \"tank\" who isn't supportish is just a really tanky bruiser. Volibear/Mundo are both incentivized to build straight tank, but their play pattern is closer to that of a bruiser--they're more about diving and murdering carries than supporting allies with CC and utility.\n\n>and still get killed really easy since... the mobility on new champs\n\nI totally agree with this though. I've recently gotten into Sion. I don't have too much of a problem with late game tankiness on him, but it definitely tends to scale down over time (and he's about as tanky as you can get in the late game). More importantly, there are so many popular champions right now who are practically immune to my kit. The only way I'm ever going to hit a kalista with my Q or R is if she screws up incredibly hard. Same goes for Azir and Leblanc, and even to a lesser extent Zed.\n\nRiot has been systematically phasing out point-and-click CC over the last couple seasons. That's all well and good--point and click CC is understandably annoying to play against. But how in the hell am I supposed to ever land something like Sion's Q or R on a champion like Kalista or Leblanc?\n\nTaric has a surprisingly high win rate right now. I don't think Taric's kit is holistically very strong at the moment. I think the only reason he is doing well is because reliable point-and-click CC is so rare and so strong against the super mobile champions. Once a champion is already CC'd, you can layer whatever other skill shot CC you want on them. But landing that first stun on Kalista is so difficult. \n\nBut ya, in closing, I think the tank class has been hit pretty hard by mobility creep. Tanks are CC oriented champs, and Riot doesn't like point and click CC, and mobility creep makes it exponentially harder to land skill shot CC on champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Bang Bob","date":"2015-01-24T10:04:49.807+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"{{champion:98}} Day after day, I find myself immune to ad tops (besides {{champion:122}}).\n\nFirst, you annoy your enemy to death by throwing blades until you can leave with 755 (you need a potion) gold.

Shen isn't really played anymore, neither is Singed, and Maokai borders on an AP bruiser anyway).\n\nI think the big problem of tanks boils right down to:\n\nA) tanks want to be hard to kill\nB) to be at all effective/interactive in lane their rotations need to do something. \n\nThe \"hard to kill\" aspect is usually solved through sustain, (in the case of Zac Voli and most tanky items force something of a sustain route particularly vs and Warmogs when it's strong) which leads to frustrating things like the Zac hyper sustain Manaless bully unkillable AP burster shenanigan of S3. \n\nThe problem with jungle tanks is that buffing their power to the point where they're good at clearing makes them somewhat juggernaut-esque come late. That's why you get such inflated winrates historically with Rammus and Amumu until they absolutely fall off when they simply can't jungle anymore.\n\nI would say the sweet spot of tanks is \"interactive sustain\" if you want them to work in lane, or targeted clear buffs if you want them to work in the jungle. \n\nZac's current blob system is a great example of interactive sustain for a laning tank, his damage is just left really undertuned from his period of heavy nerfs late S3, particularly when it comes to scaling. If Zac wants to trade tankiness for a bit of power with a damage/tank item, he should be rewarded for that as it significantly increases his risk as a front line diver. \n\nAs for jungling speed, it's a great way to tune tank junglers to be viable in pro play without being problematic in Soloqueue. What if Nautilus' shield granted him a small anount of %damage resistance vs monsters? Maybe some of his cc could be tuned down to ease up on his hard-cc stun locking late game. What if Rammus' W damage was a much higher percentage return vs monsters? Then he could get a little less armor/mr out of it so he's not the unstoppable engage tank who shoots in fast as light, point click disables your most fed carry and turns into an unkillable brick late. \n\nIn general I think the big issue that recurs with tanks is the shared space with fighters and mages in terms of items. It's hard to grant them good access to items without indirectly buffing one or the other, but many of them make for some of the coolest possible professional plays because of their ability to crack a stalemate wide open. So maybe some targeted clear buffs are in order to make it feasible to bring them to the table while their overall teamfight dominance late game can be slightly toned down? I'm not certain.\n\nEither way, thank you for taking the time to reply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MidEvilKnight3k","date":"2015-01-25T11:52:53.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my observation, the reason there aren't many melees in top lane anymore is because health regen has been nerfed.  At the beginning of S4 the potential regen from masteries was so high that nobody could hope to bully you out of lane so the lanes got boring.

It gives every stat she needs.\n\nIn order to actually do anywhere near the sustained damage that the build I suggested does (That's a 600~ ish ap build if you sneak a dcap in, 400~ ish if you go for a more tanky item) My build Sejuani will do 30% of the targets max health + 520 damage over four seconds, not counting the burn from lyandris.\n\nIn order to even manage to do the 520 damage over four seconds you need upwards of five thousand health.\n\n\nLearn to math before you talk about what builds are good.

Every easy to play champ has a high winrate, anyone playing a more difficult champ has an awful winrate and the power of AOEs is greatly inflated in soloQ. When tanks are barely considered good enough for niche pick LCS play, they tend to have 55% soloQ winrates.\n\nFor every actual Lee sin player with a 75% winrate who knows how to abuse all the free shit in his overloaded kit, there are five who can't land Q's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AbrakaDoodle","date":"2015-01-24T04:58:05.384+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played xin zhao the other day and I got a full clear and came back with 1k gold after a full clear.\nI couldve killed more monsters but I wanted some items.\nYou can build him tanky.\nFighters are the new tanks","replies":[{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2015-01-24T06:05:41.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AbrakaDoodle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mPxl8KIx,comment-id=001b,timestamp=2015-01-24T04:58:05.384+0000)\n>\n> I played xin zhao the other day and I got a full clear and came back with 1k gold after a full clear.\n> I couldve killed more monsters but I wanted some items.\n> You can build him tanky.\n> Fighters are the new tanks\n\nSure you -can- bulid him tanky but you're basically wasting gold.  Midgame an item like sunfire is fine to help you dive harder and set up fights, though past that midgame phase any investment in defense becomes irrelevant since you won't be able to tank the inner turrets, it won't help you clear jungle faster, it's countered by the massive plethora of pen items, and the health that is actually still cost efficient is countered by the massive amount of % hp shred in the game.\n\nBuilding a tank item or two for midgame in S5 is nothing like how building full tank was in previous seasons.
