I am watching, not smurfing with them, but trying to teach them (because apparently I am alone among the player base in not being a tremendous %%%%) and I feel like this experience might legally be considered a form of abusive hazing if taken to court. \n\nWith three real new players every game, they have a 20% overall winrate and get demolished by abusive obnoxious smurfs every. Single. Game. At level 10 there is no light at the end of the tunnel in sight. Until they hit level 30, it seems they will not be allowed to play a single fair game of League of Legends. Oh, and speaking of not being allowed to play...\n\nOne of them has already blown IP on tier 1 runes. I told them afterwards that they'd completely wasted everything they'd worked for and they very nearly just quit. The noob traps in this game are retarded and more toxic than any player. \n\nOh and let's talk about dat IP wall. They've been playing regularly for a month. They haven't earned the IP for *one* 6300 champion. If I played WoW, and by level 40 hadn't earned a single item, I would probably quit. \n\nSo let's chat, Riot. I want to hear someone defend the system that's actively screwing over these three new players. I want to ask how you feel about me telling them that sorry, the champion they liked last week won't bevavailable for two more months and they will never earn the IP for them before level 15, so unless they want to pay 10 bucks for less than 1% of the content of this game they're shit outta luck.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nNearly five hundred up votes, 350 replies. Two months later and I still get notifications from this post. Some express sympathy, others frustration, some are actual new players looking for advice. I just thought, if anyone's still reading, that this might be a chance to provide a bit of an update and a reminder of what still needs to be done. \n\nFirst of all, my brother and his friends have all quit by this point. I'm sorry to say it since it was a nice way to catch up with a sibling I haven't had a ton of contact with since leaving for college, but it is what it is. They got burned out when their favorite champs would get rotated out of the free week and none of them could get them permanently, and I don't really blame them that much. \n\nSecond, it wouldn't be fair of me not to remark on some of the progress that has been made since this post was created. The problem of T1 and T2 runes has largely been resolved and as a result a T1 page is very cheap and great practice for newbies to learn how to use them. I can definitely say fantastic job on that, Riot. \n\nBut there's still a long way to go to make this game work for new players. Smurfing is still an enormous and pervasive problem and probably the toughest nut to crack. The fact that anyone can easily create an account where they do not need to care about punishment and they are matched with lower level players creates a huge amount of toxicity for new players to deal with right away. \n\nAdditionally the problems the IP grind represents has not been addressed. While League is not necessarily \"pay to play\", the huge barrier that purchasing basic rune pages and champs represents turns away a massive number of new players. \n\nFinally, league lacks even some of the basic features that make a game welcoming to new players. There is only a rudimentary tutorial that does not cover even half of the vital systems the game depends on (items, who to pick for each role, stats, the jungle) and even gives players bad and confusing advice. For those that don't know, the tutorial takes place on howling abyss, shows the dragon in the opening moments, and instructs the player to build thornmail on Ashe. \n\nMy only intention with this post was to open communication with riot for some kind of signal that these troubles are being actively considered. Months later we have no indication that any of this is even on the radar.

That little bit helps, especially when learning to last hit.\n\nIf rune combiner, which is actually the real problem, was better, than tier 1/2 runes wouldn't feel as awefull as they do.\n\nIMO runes should be cut down to certain sections, were there is almost no overlap.  \n\nReds cover offense and so there are only AD, armor pen, magic pen, dual pen, AS, Crit chance, Crit damage and scaling damage.\n\nYellows cover defense, so they have flat and scaling health regen, flat and scaling armor, and flat, scaling and % health.  (Can we also buff % health?)\n\nBlues have magic/ability types, so flat and scaling AP, flat and scaling CDR, flat and scaling mana, flat and scaling mana regen, flat and scaling MR, and magic pen (yes, it over laps with reds, but it is really ability oriented as well as attack oriented.)\n\nPurples stay the same.\n\nNow, when you use the rune combiner, it only allows you to use runes from a similar set (aka reds with reds, blues with blues, etc.) and it will upgrade the rune to one a set higher but that is the same type as the set it was made from.

I am watching, not smurfing with them, but trying to teach them (because apparently I am alone among the player base in not being a tremendous cunt) and I feel like this experience might legally be considered a form of abusive hazing if taken to court. \n\n\nI'm a newer player (lvl12 now), and I totally feel their pain. I started with several friends, and only myself and one other friend have stuck around so far after the brutal introduction.\n\nMy first ten levels, it was NOTHING but smurfs, re-rolls, and newbies like myself being seal clubbed. I basically grit my teeth and just pushed through it, but it was hellacious. Now  I'm starting to run into the fun of a much higher level player joining queue with a brand new character and getting stomped by them instead. I'm told 'the MMR is supposed to balance that situation', but that's complete freaking rubbish. When I'm level 10 facing a level 20-something with all those masteries and runes, it's just completely time to be farmed. And I'm told it's going to get worse as my mid teens, early twenties, I'll start seeing ranked players joining with lower level friends and rerolls just completely stomping the matches.\n\nI've also had to go to completely third party sites like 2ez.gg to get a better understanding of items, situational buys, and counter buys because of how useless the in-game tutorial was on items. Same goes for runes (although I'm glad I found out not to buy any more of them until T3 runes), masteries, and just champions as the game is very light on actual information when it comes to actually playing the game. DOTA has a great system where you can load up player item lists, skill orders, combo advice, etc... both outside and inside matches, and each item/skill/etc... can have an author tag explaining why they are doing this.\n\nIP, I'm not sure how they haven't gotten at least 6300 in a month. I have probably 7k in champions, 500ish in crappy T1 runes (whoops), and about 2200 IP saved up right now and I'm not sure when I started, but I don't think it was a month ago. And my win rate is only around 35-40% (I was about 1 in 2, but since hitting 10 I'm getting into a lot of games with DC's, and one sided stomps.). However, instead of the 400 starter RP they give us, they should just give us one free champion of our choice. Maybe exclude the brand new guys like Kalista and the Sand Queen one coming out, but yeah... The new champ rotation is nice, but when you are just starting and don't understand where these guys are supposed to go, what they do, what they need to avoid, etc.. it just makes some horrible matches in the beginning.\n\nI will agree though the IP grind seems a little silly. Knowing I need so much IP at 20 or 21 for t3 runes is just ugh. The game should only have 1 set of runes, even if it means they make it take longer to open up rune slots until 30.\n\nThe bots also teach you nothing in this game but bad behavior. The bots are sloppy, easy, and way too easy to fall into the trap of using them to speed up leveling and IP farming.  You learn bad habits like overextending, not warding, only playing with a gold/lvl advantage, improper times to push for Baron/Dragon, etc...I wish I would have gone straight into live matches instead of doing my first few levels in bots as I was worse than a new player when I did my first couple live ones.\n\nAlso, I'd consider chat restricting the games for awhile in the lowbie games. It has been HORRIBLE. Constant fighting, blaming, braggarts, and just overall rudeness from Day One. This is a problem because it's showing other players this is acceptable behavior, so a lot of the ones who do move on to higher levels will probably carry this toxic attitude with them.\n\nIt may sound like I hate the game, but I don't. I actually really enjoy it, but I can see where the system Riot has in place is complete and utter crap, and for every person like me that sticks around, several others probably throw up their hands and just walk away.\n\n/endrant","replies":[{"poster":"Castanean","date":"2014-11-30T05:52:19.439+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem like a really patient person. Patience is a virtue, so that's a good thing :)\n\nI remember when I was new... I somehow managed to enjoy it.

There was, of course, also the fact that I played with friends a lot.\n\nBut yeah, Well done managing to get past the hurdle that is \"The Early Days.\" League isn't exactly forgiving to new players, and I really wish it wasn't so. Personally, I think one of the main issues of it all can be traced to smurfs. Smurfs should not be a thing that happens. I can understand that if you have some friends on one server and some on another that you would make an account in each, but people who smurf just to smurf... No. And if they start going \"Noob!\" \"Scrub!\" \"You're so f***ing bad, just go uninstall!\" as well, then they are the worst kind of person and deserve a slap to the face with the force of a thousand suns. Why a slap and not a punch? Slaps tend to sting more.\n\nI hope your future games involve good people, and good luck powering through!\nIf there was an easy way to do it, I'd gladly share some tips and tricks I've learned during my time in League as well, but alas, there is no \"Chatroom\" in the boards, and I don't want to flood this thread with irellevant things.\n\nI can give you one simple one though: *There is no such thing as a bad ward.* only *slightly* better wards. Which essentially means that any and every ward helps at least a bit. Including the ones people call \"Badly Placed.\" Also, if you have leftover money after visiting the shop, anything from 75 and up, use some of that money to buy a few wards. Doesn't matter what role, lane or champion you are. If you have the space and the money, there is no REAL excuse for not warding. Except being out of space. That one is logical.\n\n({{item:2044}} If you already knew this, Congratulations! You're already exceptional for your level. There are PLENTY ranked-players out there who never ever ward, besides trinket.{{item:2043}} )\n\n((PS: I'm honestly not trying to be rude with that tip.

During beta I used to main Evelynn (she was my first character to seriously play) and did duo bot with a friend who was also new (as was I). I would take smite and heavily roam from level 4+ grabbing Blue Buff early with smite (which is fairly close to what later became a very serious issue of roaming/jungle Eve during S2 onward I think it was once people caught on to the fact that wards didn't counter her due to how fast she could close a distance before people realize and try to deal with her/flee). I averaged in the range of 40-80 kills almost every single game as her. Eventually I got bored and started maining Teemo where I averaged 20-40 kills per game. I had an extremely high win vs loss ratio back then and I was completely new to League of Legends which was still in beta. The same thing could, effectively, occur for new players who adapt well during a certain point in time of a game's life and may really hit it off with particular characters, strategies, etc. Same thing happened in Darkness and Light SEA easily topping as the best player by a very large margin despite it being in early beta to the point I could solo enemy teams by mid and late game and this was not due to balance issues as the game was extremely balanced. Same thing for other people with Halo series, or fighting games, etc. You see people come from Starcraft/Dota series and try to climb to the top declaring their effort in a short period of time. Some people just adapt extremely well with certain games. Then you have the dunces who just keep dying and dying and dying (no offense to them >.<) and you may wonder how they can be so terrible (had a roomate like that). Thus this issue is no where near as straight forward/easy as one would like it to be.\n\nThere is also the issue of non-30s being matched against entire teams of gold/diamond/plat/etc. mixes with maybe 3-4 non-30s and 1-2 bronze/unranked on their team. Match making has very serious issues atm.\n\nAs for the paywall and noob traps...\nThere are a ton of viable champs for 400~3k ip range and there is the champion rotation. Unfortunately, the 6.3k IP range really isn't friendly at all (but this is one way of Riot generating their revenue). Thankfully, we have most of them being relatively affordable.\n\nRunes...\nT1 are so bloody cheap that they can be an effective choice as you work on getting at least a couple of champions and make your way to 30 despite their low stats they are not worthless (16 ip runes, etc... I mean really).\nT2 are simply far too expensive for their slight boost over T1 and their neglible stats compared to T3 as a final alternative.\nT3 are quite expensive but there are several cheaper runes that work excellently as general purpose (flat AD/armor/mres and scaling mres) with the only real issue being the price on Quints.\n\nIssues I take with new players that Riot doesn't handle properly:\n-Smurfs (not always the case as I indicate but it IS an issue and while Riot has some measures to deal with it I don't believe it works correctly due to matchmaking)\n-Match Making is utterly broken before you have a pretty solid number of games and in some cases it clearly doesn't work at all (a non-premade non-30 4x and one bronze player vs a 4 man premade of gold/gold/plat/diamond and a random non-30 should NEVER happen EVER, period and I have screenshots of such match making too).\n-Botting is an issue with the AI vs Bots.\n-AI vs Bots doesn't really have advanced enough AI and uses cheap tricks to try to get by so it does not properly prepare players for matches against real players and actually puts them at a substantially worse position when they start playing vs real players. It also acts as a scapegoat for those frustrated with real players and their performance and handicaps their growth as a player.\n\nApologies for poor formatting, really lazy post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kojiro Sasaki","date":"2014-11-30T07:39:40.108+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I think new players when coming to the game on referral from someone else should be allowed to pick 5-10 champions they think look cool to UNLOCK AND OWN PERMANENTLY.

During the loading screen, I identified a few smurfs sporting SKT1 in their names, one was {{champion:61}}  and the other {{champion:121}} . Long story short, his GF went {{champion:22}}  bot lane and the two enemy smurfs exploited her to snowball.

Thats 3750 IP on average. You need to find the time to play two 20-60 minutes games each day for a month with no breaks to earn a single 6300 IP champion, or roughly .8% of the ingame content of this game.\n\nThat is absurd.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ternt","date":"2014-12-01T14:43:32.188+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am new, been playing for a month and a week now. This game isn't hard, at all, because I came from a background of MMO's which require a far larger understanding of how everything works. That aside, it's not that this game is hard to learn, it's that nobody has patience. Hell, I have been playing not long at all and find myself frustrated when my support steals kills from the ADC, or when the jungler refuses to actually gank when you're struggling in a lane cause of a bad match-up. League is rough because it's SO team based that individual performance hardly matters until late game. Sure, you can \"get fed\" early, but that's usually if everything works well. Good ganks, good support, lack of skill on the other side, etc. This doesn't necessarily mean, if you're good, you win. The worst part is, you get somebody who is struggling vs. a Fiora or a Yi. That's GG. Impossible to comeback unless the game drags out.\n\nYou know what I think is dumb? I have all the champs I want to play, which is about 9-10. I am new-ish (been around a little over a month), but I am nearing my 30. If I want to even play ranked, I need what.. 20-25 champs? WHY. I don't want to spend the damn money on the champs, because at that point it's just wasting money for characters I'll never play. What's even worse is that I did mystery skins with my friends recently and of course, the champs I do not want to play are the champs I get skins for. WHY. This is something I will never understand.\n\nAnother thing.. When I first started, I got RP after a week or so (since I was making ass IP because I was constantly playing with 20~30 level people), and I wasted some. WELL, I used my refunds and now... you're just f***ed? Like, why? You've already made the money on the RP, why can't I refund more than 3 times? Make the resell value lower than what you paid, like 3/4 the price or something. Penalize us, sure, but don't limit us. We are the paying customers, with time and money, why aren't you abiding to what WE want. And don't anybody say, \"this will increase hacking\". No, this is about as valid as me saying because you're playing a violence based game, you're going to go shoot up a school or mall. That is a invalid argument, because it's not true. People will do what they're going to do anyways, so if somebody is hacking accounts, they're doing it either way. For things like Mystery Skins, there should be a no refund policy because you're rolling the dice, that's a gamble you take. But give us options for more refunds (lord knows you'll probably make us purchase RP to get more), but still, allow us to refund those skins we bought when we were noob (like buying Xerath for RP, or 2 Quinn skins that I never use). Don't make me sit here and feel like I have wasted money or time playing this game, because this is how games die. Sure, you're thriving, but all good things die. \n\nYes, being new, I am probably still missing stuff. But these are some of the most immediate problems that I have experienced (and frustration). I know there are smurfs out there, but I never really experienced it much because I played with my level 30 friends from the start. Which honestly was probably better. Also, I had all chat turned off so I didn't know people were yelling at me on the other team until I turned level 25 or so. Either way, I believe that they need to fix the RP system as well and allow more refunds. Because like I said, they already made their money, the RP is worthless currency, refunding it has no downside to them.\n\nI am not saying I know it all, or I am super pro at the game, but I am saying from what I have gathered playing this month and a week, these are the things I have noticed wrong with the system.
