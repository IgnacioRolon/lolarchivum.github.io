This was announced back when the Ret-con was released.  Why it hasn't been done yet is a mystery to everyone, and it leaves players questioning just what exactly the lore team is doing.  \n\nI've come to accept the Ret-con.  When it first was announced I hated it.  I loved that I was a Summoner and that even though I wasn't very good I was still important to the game's story.  It wasn't like in RPGs where you were this incredibly powerful hero who was capable of taking on monsters and demons and sometimes even gods alone.  As a Summoner I was important, but I was just a cog in the machine of the Institute of War, and it was a pretty neat hook.  I don't think I'd have kept playing this game if it hadn't been for that.  But Riot has stood firm and will not reverse their decision to keep the IoW and the Summoners, and there is nothing we can do.  I realise this now.  I may not like it, but fighting the Lore team is not worth the effort I'd put in and it will amount to nothing in the end.  \n\nBut the fact that nothing has been done to rectify the lore of champions like Fiddlesticks and Jax and Orianna and Brand and Cho'Gath (along with many others) makes me a bit annoyed.  They all have a direct link to an organisation which no longer exists, leaving them in a weird limbo-state when it comes to lore.  I've played DotA 2 and Heroes of the Storm (really like it too, Anub'arak's so fun) despite the fact that both games have a very loosely defined lore.  In HotS's tutorial your hero asks something like 'But why are we all doing this?  Why are we here fighting random enemies to destroy their Core?'  The answer is 'Don't question it.'  That's it.  That's the lore.  You're playing the game to have fun.  This is mostly possible because all the heroes have backstories tied to other games.  Like Nintendo's done  in SSB, Blizzard's games let you know who Arthas is, who Raynor is, what Tyrael is, etc.  Their stories are concrete and not likely to change.  In League of Legends, we don't know anymore.  We all saw that the IoW was having less and less to do with new champions, but I don't think many people saw it ever being removed from the game entirely, at least not without something major to take its place.  \n\nAnd as of right now, its removal was pretty useless.  Sure, we'd have to question why champions like Jinx, Rek'Sai, Bard, and Lissandra would ever fight under the control of a Summoner regardless of what they were offered, but now we have even less.  Now we just know little snippets of these champions' pasts, with very little beyond a particular incident revealed at their release.  While that snippet is interesting and usually very well-done (for example, the art in the Chronobreak comic was amazing) we need more to fully understand a champion.  \"But it's supposed to be mysterious!\" only goes so far, especially since every champion released in the past year has had some 'mystery' surrounding them.  Rather than questioning why Summoners are controlling champions, we're left wondering why they're even fighting at all.  Why is Bard, essentially a god-like celestial being, helping Rek'Sai fight Azir and Braum?  \n\nThe 'Because reasons.\" excuse works in Heroes of the Storm because HotS has always been about that.  It's a silly concept, but with interesting execution and good gameplay.  League of Legends doesn't have that excuse.  It had a fully-established universe, and even though it was never the best writing, it's a lot better than what we've seen recently.  Don't misunderstand me, I like things like Chronobreak and Mountain and Trials of the Poro, but considering that's where the champions' stories seem to end, they end up just being disappointing.  Since release, we've learned nothing new about Vel'Koz, Gnar, Yasuo, Braum, etc.  Their lore, while interesting at the time, has stagnated and we're left asking where the Lore Team is and what they're doing.  \n\nThis ended up being a lot longer and more of a rant than I intended.  \n**TL;DR**:  Mysterious pasts are good but not everyone needs one, champions do not exist in a vacuum, and their stories shouldn't just stop once the hype for their release is done.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-05-22T03:26:18.983+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kGhinZuR,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2015-05-21T23:42:37.444+0000)\n>\n> Potentially, but Ekko's VO confirms more about his positioning in Zaun and friends and allies more than a scant line of dialogue.

It looks a bit nicer. It has something to keep the rain from warping it. This is the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter approach. There's some kind of explanation for what's going on. It satisfies that part of our minds that instinctively looks for a story to go with what's happening. Humans love stories. We anthropomorphize just about everything. When we see a struggle, we want to know what the story is behind the struggle. The \"crazy dictator starts a tournament to see who is the most badass fighter ever\" story is a white picket fence: gets the job done, avoids the lack of a story from detracting from the game, the way an unpainted fence warps in rainy weather. \n\nhttp://fencepictures.org/large/216/Wood-Picket-Fence-Pictures-5.jpg \nRiot's current approach is like taking out a canvas and painting a landscape, then putting it next to the unpainted fence, and telling the person who hired you, \"Yeah, I know it's not painted, but just look at the painting here, and try to think about the painting when you look at the fence.\" Mortal Kombat at least slaps a coat of white paint on the fence. If someone asks, \"Wait, why is this dude punching this other dude?\", you can say, \"oh, uh, it's like a tournament or something,\" and assuage that awkwardness.\n\nhttp://images.stockfreeimages.com/1565/sfi/free_15651829.jpg http://i.imgur.com/OcIBw4I.jpg\nBetter still would be to find a way to paint the fence and use its awkward shape as an artistic constraint to produce something interesting or clever, maybe having each stake as one panel of a series of images, or painting them to look like pencils, or whatever. But I'll take the workmanlike \"it's now a painted white fence\" option over the \"I didn't paint the fence, I painted this other thing\" option anyday.\n\nIt's all the more tragic because, as derpy as it was, I think the pre-retcon lore actually did a good job of working with the constraints of the game to produce something kind of clever: a fantasy UN of sorts, swapping out international tribunals for a form of trial by combat, with the players immersed into the universe as mages, diplomats, and adventurers who support Champions while trying to navigate a quite treacherous international arena.\n\nTo continue the analogy, rather than getting all upset because the fence isn't a traditional canvas, and spurning the central task at hand to do something else, the original lore accepted the quirks of the task and used it as inspiration to create something that was actually quite novel.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-05-22T00:22:31.106+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kGhinZuR,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2015-05-21T23:42:37.444+0000)\n>\n> **Potentially, but Ekko's VO confirms more about his positioning in Zaun and friends and allies more than a scant line of dialogue.** Each champ is different.

Don't do anything until it threatens world peace. Kalamanda COULD and probably WOULD HAVE sparked a Fifth Rune War, which is exactly why the IoW intervened.\n\nMy reading of the event is also that it nearly destroyed the League. It wasn't like the League had the power to trivially pull Demacia and Noxus apart whenever it wanted, and had just been showing restraint until then. It was an ultimatum: the League used all its power to directly force a brief truce, and compel Demacia and Noxus to confront the reality that, if they continued, the League would be the first casualty. Demacia and Noxus glared at each other, then backed off, each publicly blaming the League for its meddling, while quietly acknowledging that an apocalyptic history had nearly repeated itself.\n\nI find that kind of story so much more exciting than, \"and then Demacia and Noxus fought some more.\" In a literal sense, sure, the League's presence \"ended conflict.\" More accurately, though, I think the League's presence established an entire new dimension of conflict and dramatic tension, and enriched the clash between Demacia and Noxus by showing its larger significance. It made the conflict a lot more interesting.\n\n**EDIT:** I should add, for those less familiar with this discussion, that I don't think this episode indicates, or that the old lore requires, that the League put everything on the line every time two nations start fighting. The League's mandate is not to bring world peace. Sure, there are some idealists who claim that the League can bring true peace one day, but the reality is that the League's mandate is *to prevent another Rune War.* It struggles mightily to achieve even that. It does not have the political capital to be fussy whenever Noxus and Piltover scrap in Shurima, or even whenever Zaun firebombs Ionia. I imagine that the League's general reaction to wars is to move in and lay down some ground rules, limiting the scope of the conflict, and keeping other parties from intervening and escalating it into a world war. So if Noxus invades Ionia, it might say, \"alright, fine, Demacia and Zaun, you both stay out of this, and Noxus and Ionia, the fighting stays within this zone.\" Any Summoner who opined, \"then why bother having an army if the League will stop all wars?\" would be laughed at pretty heartily in-universe, I think. It's a cute sentiment, the sort associated with people who believe that international law isn't at least as much about power politics as it is legal interpretation.\n\nSo why such a dramatic move in Kalamanda? Because you had Runeterra's two superpowers fighting on top of a freaking nexus. That is a recipe for a cataclysmic disaster. This wasn't a border skirmish or a proxy war. Rather, these two very angry, very powerful nations had deployed significant numbers of their own troops (with their own mages backing them up) and readied for a battle in an area intensely charged with magical energy. It would be a mere matter of time before one side started to lose, and those rune spells started looking pretty tempting. I think we can also handwave in something about subtler signs that Demacia and Noxus were tired of skirting the bounds of the laws issued by this League they'd created, and had geared up for another full-scale conflict.\n\nI admit that a good part of this is a \"fan hack\", and wasn't actually spelled out in the old lore. It's vaguely within the bounds of the old lore. It fits with the spirit of the old lore. To be honest, I think the authors of the old lore were sometimes undecided about how all this stuff worked, and kind of went from issue to issue without a great master plan. Still, I think it's significant to note that a few modest community lore patches solidify the old lore verse into a pretty interesting place.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Ivellius","date":"2015-05-29T05:57:17.732+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't see it as a hack at all.

So, late April to early May 2013. Two years ago.\n\nIf you ask any writer worth their salt, they'll tell you that a story is easier to write with fewer main characters. This is because with each main character, you need an arc, and that arc needs real estate somewhere in the story's greater whole. League of Legends currently has 125 main characters. On average, a new one is added every two months. \n\nAnd between today and Lissandra's release, there has been _one event_ that advanced any character lore: the Shurima event. Whose lore did it advance? Sivir's. It also retconned Xerath's origins, and Nasus and Renekton's place in the cosmos. I consider that one step forward and three steps back... four, if you include the addition of yet another main character.\n\nBut even setting aside the \"steps back,\" that's ONE character who has had any story advancement. And it was cool, to see Sivir taking a step from cynical mercenary to cynical mercenary with a royal bloodline. But it's not enough. Not nearly enough.\n\nA lot of people are saying that the Narrative team isn't doing anything, and they're wrong - we see that with every new champion release. Ekko in particular has had some fantastic stuff. The Seconds video is great, the comic is just wonderful (look at all the people asking for more of that!), these are great examples of what Narrative is doing.\n\nAnd yet here's what the Narrative team doesn't seem to want to address:\n-There are a huge number of existing champions with story arcs that have not been addressed, and the backlog is not being cleared out as fast as new champions are being added. \n-There is a substantial portion of the playerbase that wants to be served by some sort of literary medium - that is, it's all well and good to get comics and two-minute movies, but people want to _read_ shit, and that leads me to my next point:\n-We were told that champion lore would be expanded upon, and that the three-sentence versions we see for some champions on the live client is just a \"short version\" that would eventually have links to... something bigger, or more stories, or something like that. We were told this roughly around the Shurima event. The Shurima event was in September 2014. We have been waiting for eight months.\n\nI know that that last point is a technical issue, that you need someone to work on the coding side of things for that, but fuck, guys! Fuck! If you have a product or service, it is YOUR JOB to find a way to get it to people. Remember the Azir short story? Remember the Xerath short story? I do, because I was around and active on the forums 8 months ago. What about my one friend who doesn't visit the forums, but is interested in Azir's background beyond his ingame dialog? What about my one friend who just started playing the game, thinks Xerath is all sorts of cool, and wants to learn more? They WANT this stuff. You HAVE this stuff. And yet the pipeline getting this stuff from point A to point B is broken and _no one seems to be doing anything about it._\n\nOne thing I notice a lot of amateur writers have in common is that they spend a lot of time thinking about writing and a lot less time doing the actual writing. All these \"story hints\"? All this \"room to grow\"? That's _thinking about writing._ That does nothing but piss off the people who actually want to read it. Either do the writing yourself and _put it out there,_ or do what Blizzard does, what Lucasfilm does, what half the creative IPs in the world are doing, and _hire someone to do the writing for you and make mad cash off the results._\n\nYou want to know why people are upset? Because all we hear about is how much stuff you want to do and all the ambition the Narrative team has. Ambition means fucking NOTHING unless you do something about it.\n\nSo please, from the fans to the Rioters.

It's problematic to say they don't interact, because the only way we have isolated lores like Ekko's current story is if you disregard their time on the Rift as anything potentially storybuilding.\n> \n> (The Institute of War, while convenient, also solved these problems in a way I'm not sure you can replace.)\n\nThe Rift is non-canon. They retconned its existence with the IoW.\nJust sayin'. The game you play is now a fictional place in an already fictional world. Completely meaningless on a double-meta level.","replies":[{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-05-22T13:39:24.007+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the game does not exist if they don't have champions fighting somewhere.

I believe they were referring to the game itself that was retconned, the fact that these battles don't actually take place in the lore.  There might be some individual conflicts that take place between the ~~champions~~ main characters, but what takes place in the game doesn't exist in the lore.  The game is supposed to be completely separate/nonexistent. It is just a game you enjoy playing that has characters in it from a story you read.  I know I read this from someone at Riot back around the retcon timing, I would have to find it.\n\nIf I am wrong in this account, that the game is not meant to be separate, could a red please correct me?  Perhaps this stance has changed as time has passed, since in this thread we are being advised that we can get more information about lore by listening to in game VOs.  If the game is not supposed to be separate it would help make sense of why the VOs have been changed in game.  I couldn't figure out why references to Summoners were removed from in game if the game was supposed to be separate from the lore.","replies":[{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-05-22T19:31:25.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm.\n\nWell, I think saying these battles don't actually happen is a terrible idea, as it approximately means that, instead of summoners, we're just some kids playing with their action figures; I guess we don't get to have any influence over or experience any direct connection to these characters (are they holograms? Figment of our imaginations?) or their stories in the world; but I guess that is SOMETHING, if it's true.

I did find this statement which was in the comments of a dev blog:\n\n> No, Summoners, the Fields of Justice and the Institute are not canon within the fictional world of Runeterra. In-game, players are still referred to as summoners - but summoners won't be part of the story.\n\n>  Carnival Knights   - 9 months ago \n\nHopefully I can find the exact post, it was pretty point blank.

That...doesn't make sense.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
