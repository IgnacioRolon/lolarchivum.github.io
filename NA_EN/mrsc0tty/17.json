Anyone, even someone only marginally better than their ranking, who plays at a lower rank will have an easier time at a lower rank by average. Even if the 30% of games he manages to lose are extremely frustrating feed-fests, a diamond player in bronze will not get stuck in Elo hell , he'll win 70-80% of games and shoot out quickly. \r\n\r\nIf you are in bronze, or silver, and you feel you are being held back by teammates, and you're not just talking about having to do promos 2-3 times instead of once, or being frustrated by the 45% of games you lose, you're not a higher caliber player. Maybe you've gotten really good at lane phase (what I see the most) or you rage really hard and stop trying when you start off on the back foot, whatever it is there is something wrong with YOUR play. \r\n\r\nFigure out what it is. \r\n\r\nFix it. \r\n\r\nWatch as your winrate improves. You will still have losses, and feeders, and ragers aplenty, but if you really are better your MMR will rise and so will your LP. \r\n\r\nYou're doing something wrong, deal with it.","replies":[]}
