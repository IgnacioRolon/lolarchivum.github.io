For Yasuo, there is no point in poking him unless you can follow up and hit his health bar after you clear his shield, which is why you basic attack the shield if you can and then hit him after it falls off.  Morgana's shield actively prevents you from CCing the person, so not only does it discourage damage, but CC as well.\n\nNautilus, on the other hand, is a tank.  A tank WANTS people to attack him, especially while his shield is up.  So, while it is up, he is something of an actual damage threat, spreading around a nasty little DoT.

I explain how this is only true of DPS.  You wait out Yasuo's shield after proccing it with an autoattack so you can harass  him between shields.  You don't blow CC on Black Shield because it would be a waste.\n\nNautilus is different because he is a tank.  A tank WANTS people to attack, so he has to give them a reason to do so.  Making Naut's damage buff dependent on the shield acts a soft taunt, and the person I replied to doesn't want this.  I think it is exactly the kind of tank mechanic we need.  The hard CC of a real taunt doesn't much fit the game, honestly, and should be used very sparingly.
