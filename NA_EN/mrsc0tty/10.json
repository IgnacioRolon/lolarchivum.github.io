Just not as...eloquently?\n\nHere's the thing though. It's exactly right, they've decided to remove burst damage from the game. First they made the jungle so hard that junglers can't carry anymore because they can no longer snowball and gank early (except the 3 that they somehow forgot about.) Now they're doing the same thing to mid-lane. They've removed DFG, and are reworking all \"point-and-click\" mages to have skillshots because \"no counterplay\" (which I vehemently disagree with but I digress.)\n\nHere's the thing though, and bear with me cause this is gonna get crazy. \nThey're doing it for a larger reason, and that is that they've discovered a problem with the game at large that these changes are aimed at combating: player mentality.\n\nBy removing burst damage they're removing most role's ability to \"carry\" in the traditional sense where they simply delete you if they hit you without suffering any strategic tradeoffs. They're trying to do away with the *mindset* that most players have that snowballing to the point where they can one-shot and delete the enemy team is literally how you're supposed to play. They're trying to subtly change the mindset of the players by forcing changes to the game that affect what type of gameplay actually works, and it's a different type that what has been working in the past. \n\nThey've also not explicitly stated this because they want players who figure this out and adapt to feel appropriately rewarded for decoding the hidden message. That message is \"teamwork is OP, individual champions are not.\" Obviously they haven't perfected this message yet, but even Nemesis Draft is an attempt to send this message. Who read that thread the other day about \"I suddenly realized all these \"bad\" champions aren't terrible and can actually be fun.\" I knew that thread was coming the moment I saw what Nemesis Draft was.\n\nThe reason \"player toxicity\" is such a recurring problem is because on every team arguably 4 out of the 5 members (everyone except the least played role; support) literally think that they're the hero, and they're the reason the team will win, and that the best way to win is if the other 4 people are all \"supports\" to only them, and assist getting them fed so they can hypercarry. \n\nYes, this is a generalization and doesn't always happen, but it happens a lot, especially in solo queue. In fact, in solo queue, sometimes even the support plays this way, not building support items, and ignoring teamwork and communication cause they don't trust their teammates and think they can 1 v 5 the enemy team once their idiot teammates implode on each other. I've watched enough twitch streams to know that this happens, even in gold and plat ELO, and to know that it's always a disaster. Most games of solo queue League of Legends aren't two teams fighting against each other, it's two teams fighting against themselves until one team defeats itself. \n\nThe theory is, if everyone understood that no one person is capable of winning by themselves, or that no one role was particularly better than any other role at \"carrying,\" (in this case because without burst it's just too hard to do) it may change the amount of toxicity in the game.\n\nIn a team game like this it should never be possible for 1 person to win the game without the help of his or her team. But players are so damn stubborn that they'll fight against teamwork at every opportunity, no matter how much harder it is, and they'll always pick the champions that they feel \"carry\" the best, even though \"carrying\" is no longer the meta. They'll do this because most human beings are simply too selfish to share credit with anyone else.\n\nThis *is* a real problem, and it *is* something Riot should take seriously. I just happen to think that their solution to this: \"nerf damage dealers, make poke and mobility, and longer fights the only things that matter, so that there's more emphasis on teamwork instead of individual play\" is homogenizing the game by making every champion the same (mobility and skillshot poke,) and it's completely removing from viability the ones that can't do this (who are mostly older champs.)\n\nRiot needs to solve this problem, but their solution is terrible because it's having a negative impact on strategic viability, making every game the same because if every champion can do the same thing, the ones that do it best are the only ones that matter and players won't stop playing for individual glory, no matter how difficult that path is to travel. These changes, though well-intended, are hurting the game more than helping it. Riot needs a different solution, but they appear to be all-in on this one.","replies":[{"poster":"MXXIV","date":"2015-02-15T13:03:59.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great comment, but note please that the Veigar in particular isn't really the case.

Would you say that it is good?\n> \n> I find perfectly fine that people complain about plain nerves even when they come with mana reductions. Trust me, once Zed has bursted you down dodging your E, the 10 mana you saved thanks to RIOT Rework™ won't help you.\n\nYet, it's **not** 3 seconds.  And they won't ever make it 3 seconds to make it costless (yes, you can hold me to that).  It's less than 1 second.  \nIt will still have a respectable impact in teamfights, at the *very* least, especially with the range increase.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-15T02:52:50.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People don't like when you take their free kills away.

One of these days they're going to have to nerf Zed and Lee for real because you can only ignore the obvious for so long before we know you're doing it on purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"lokisprodigy","date":"2015-02-15T04:53:45.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Seriously, when have you ever had fun getting instagibbed by Veigar because of his automatic stun and unmissable skills that will guaranteed kill you before you can even flash?\n\ntheres no way i can be the only one who absolutely loved the old school 0 mobility burst mage duels. some of the most fun ive ever had was in s2 as annie vs veigar. every step mattering, having to get into the enemies head and anticipate their flashes or hiding spots was really the first time i started to appreciate the skill involved in league. give me a fight between anivia and karthas, or annie and viegar over the URF-esque 0 planning/strategy clickfest that is fizz v zed or ahri v lb anyday.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-15T05:12:10.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like alot of fun, but those days are definitely never coming back.
