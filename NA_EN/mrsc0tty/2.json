Obviously I was not playing him very well, but one of my favorite parts of his kit was using his W to poke in lane-you know, like nobody past level 10 does because anyone can dodge it-but since I was so early level a lot of people would not notice the shadow and sound and they'd get hit. I always envisioned it almost like a Looney Tunes anvil falling from the sky. \r\n\r\nNow, in Looney Tunes there's always the recurring gag where they try to step out of the falling anvil (having learned their lesson from last time) and the shadow follows then around until they get hit.\r\n\r\nWhat if, while W were cast, Veigar could re-cast it once to cause it to move in the indicated direction, allowing him to follow people trying to juke and turning a somewhat dull skill (I have to cast when people CANT PHYSICALLY DODGE) into a fun little mini-game (was that a short joke? Maybe) for a champ who's kit is simple enough to accommodate one and not have it be overwhelming. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: Allow Veigar to torment his foes by adding an optional re-cast to his W, causing it to move in the direction of the cursor. That would allow the tiny master of evil a response to jukes and mobility while making sure W isn't TOO reliable.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulric Greatsword","date":"2015-02-27T20:09:08.774+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't stop imagining a Cartoon Veigar skin now.\nHe drops anvils.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2015-02-27T20:26:40.024+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"That... would actually be really entertaining.

Similar to Vel'koz, you want to chain your skills in such a way that an enemy trying to dodge one winds up trapped by the other. That really fits into his aesthetic as well, Veigar is the type to \"out-plan\" his opponents and he wants to Get Them Right Where He Wants Them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phrite","date":"2015-02-27T22:21:50.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My issue with your suggestion is that it actually removes some skill from Veigar's kit.

Veigar's W currently cannot be used in a skilled manner- the AOE is such that an enemy can't be harmed if they juke away from it. It can only be landed if an opponent makes a mistake, no matter how good you are. That means that 99% of Ws thrown out by good Veigar's are just against targets stunned by E-a situation where it can't be dodged.","replies":[{"poster":"Phrite","date":"2015-03-02T16:07:20.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play Veigar much so forgive me if I'm missing some insights that you might have as a frequent player.

It still lands in the same AOE, at the same delay, it just gives both players a chance to react to it landing. \n\nAt present it is 100% dodgeable and only lands when the opponent CANNOT move out of the way. That presents no fun for Veigar or his opponent. Making it more reliable is not fun, making it more powerful is not fun, why not make it more versatile instead?\n\nVeigar's kit currently has room for one more interesting mechanic.

Think of it like Anivia being able to activate her Q or Heimerdinger being able to fan his rockets.

She stuns you then rocks you with a jillion damage and you die usually before the stun is off you. Viktor has delays on his cc, his power transfer is a two-parter where he has to auto you, and he will probably need to follow you with his ult since a little less of the damage is upfront. In return, his kit is a powerful toolkit especially when he starts to upgrade it. He can zone with his field, cut his laser at unexpected angles, remote control his ult to clean up fights, juke away with his speed boost from power transfer. \n\nWith Veigar's Q becoming a skillshot, and his stun getting a delay, I'd rather see him move more towards Viktor than Annie. Having a powerful reliable burst ultimate is absolutely fine, but when I play Veigar now compared to the other mages I like I find myself wishing I had a little bit more to do with his ability focused playstyle.
