The problem is farming for tanks.  Making sure you've got the ability to farm up decently stay about on par with the damage carries in terms of level and build.\n\nOutside of that, most of the issues with tanks can be taken care of with small number tweaks.

Introduce an item that grants % bonus health or % bonus Ar/Mr.  Or just introduce an item that can grant you like 5% damage reduction with an active that can bump it up to like 8-10% damage reduction for a couple of seconds.

You failed to reduce the armor/mr from the items listed.  For Randuin's, for example, you calculated it's effective health at the full 70 armor it offers, or at least I am assuming so, since doing that leads to the conclusion of 850 health.  In reality, after Last Whisper slices that armor like a price tag at Wal-mart, it offers closer to 725 effective health.  Compare this, then, to Warmog's, which offers 800 effective health straight up (but only because we used the nice and round starting point after Last Whisper of 100 armor).

The problem is a tank is better in a team fight setting with a good team to follow up on his engage.\nNautilus is a beast in team fights with his CC and AoE, but without a team to jump in and capitalize on his initiation, he's going to fall quickly once his CC wears off.\nCompare this to Renekton who has better 1v1 potential, not quite as much team fight potential, but still enough to be a considerable threat and force the enemy to focus him.\n\nTanks are actually strong, the problem they are strong in ways people don't care about.\nWhy take Nautilus and finish a game 1/4/35 when you could play Pantheon and go 15/5/14?\nNaut has better CC, more innate tankiness, even better team fight potential, but he alone can't carry a game due to him only scaling excellently as a pure tank.\nI wish there was an easy answer.

The same should be applied to the mastery (Devastating Strikes) as well and to Void Staff.\n\nAlso, the way you did the calculation is somewhat incorrect. You should instead look on how much damage it gives you, rather than how much armor it shreds - simply because it can be cost efficient based also on your AD - not only on enemy armor. For example, against Caitlyn with 86 armor it will give you roughly +19,3% physical damage. So, taking it into account let's look at different AD values:\n\n1: 100 AD = LW passive will give 19 AD, worth 684 gold, making LW 92,3% cost efficient.\n2: 150 AD = LW passive will give 29 AD, worth 1044 gold, making LW 108% cost efficient.\n3: 200 AD = LW passive will give 39 AD, worth 1404 gold, making LW 123,6% cost efficient.\n4: 300 AD = LW passive will give 58 AD, worth 2088 gold, making LW 153,4% cost efficient.\n\n\nOkay, and now let's look at something tankier... Maybe 250 armor, just to show you how well it counters tanks (against 250 armor LW increases your physical damage output by 33,3%):\n\n1: 100 AD = LW passive will give 33 AD, worth 1188 gold, making LW 114,3% cost efficient.\n2: 150 AD = LW passive will give 50 AD, worth 1800 gold, making LW 140,9% cost efficient.\n3: 200 AD = LW passive will give 67 AD, worth 2412 gold, making LW 167,5% cost efficient.\n4: 300 AD = LW passive will give 100 AD, worth 3600 gold, making LW 219,1% cost efficient.\n\nMind you that there is a bit of difference between actually giving AD and what LW gives - for autoattack purposes it have absolutely no difference, no matter if you crit or not, or your attack speed - buying LW will act just like buying that much AD. However for abilities and items there are some differences:\n\n- As a general rule (some exceptions include Darius' W and Blitzcrank's E - since they have no base damage) physical damage abilities benefit more from Last Whisper than from AD.\n- LW will also make some items more effective unlike AD (Botrk, Trinity Force, Bilgewater Cutlass, Muramana, Iceborn Gauntlet, Sheen).\n- Abilities that scale with AD but deal physical or true damage don't benefit from Last Whisper's passive, making it less effective than buying AD (Darius' R, Kog'Maw R (I think, not sure)).\n\nSo basically - what I wrote up there is the minimal cost efficiency UNLESS you use a lot of magic damage or True Damage that scales with AD - which you probably aren't, unless you play Miss Fortune (Mind you that things like Varus W, Vayne W or Kog'Maw W aren't included here, since they don't scale with AD either).","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-02-04T18:23:02.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I remember a Rioter (sorry no source) saying that 58% bonus armour penetration would be required to maintain the same efficiency against tanks - an efficiency that is required.

At 65 armor they've only got 65% bonus effective health, dropping it from 4000 to 3300 effective health. You've made it to where the average ADC would only need to hit that person maybe 3 times instead of 4, and that can easily be the deciding factor in a standoff where one person has a LW and another has another item, say a Zephyr or something, that's allowing them to hit a bit harder and a bit faster but each hit isn't doing quite as much.
