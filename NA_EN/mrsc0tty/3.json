They hand their lamp to an ally. The ally doesn't click it and dies, blaming the support for no peel wtf scrub. \r\n\r\nA support main is playing Nami. They E the carry. The carry wastes the three shots on minions then rages because \"playin trash support doesn't so damage\"\r\n\r\nAn ADC main, gods gift to mankind, He Who Must Always Be Right, queues up with a Nami support. \r\n\r\nThey make their servant soul bound. When they need help, they summon their servant like a genie to sacrifice their life to save them. When they want a kill, they scoop up their servant and tell them to catapult themselves under the enemy tower so the carry can make an LCSbigplay and get a kill. \r\n\r\nThis is the way of the world.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2014-11-24T20:43:20.354+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need to allow the player to say NO to the spear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-11-25T04:43:15.502+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They created Kalista to piss off people who want this game to be fun and balanced.\n\nKalista is cancerous to toplaners, midlaners, supports, and adc's. She is anti fun to play against, and has the most overloaded kit I think in league history, She has hard cc, soft cc, twitch expunge (Infinite Stacking as well), free wards, highest mobility in combat in this game, % health damage, and just crazy overall damage.\n \nI'm starting to wonder If League is a social experiment to see how much shit a company can shove into someones face until people quit. Sadly, as EA has proven, its gonna take a hella lot more. \n\nThat and having Lee Sin as an adc is pretty much what this looks like.

Either A) waste Kalista's ult and say you aren't going to tower dive and just ult backwards away from tower or B) Learn to play, if Kalista throws you in, it's because she thinks you can survive and help get kills. Just because you get thrown in, doesn't mean you are going to die, if you play support and get thrown in, maybe you should... I dunno... support your ADC and do something once you get thrown in and don't just stand there like a dink.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-11-24T20:43:28.935+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I have saved my support's butt quite a few times by using my ultimate defensively while they were chain CC'd.","replies":[{"poster":"Smart Fox","date":"2014-11-24T21:42:54.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So true.

Sometimes ADC players are retarded!

(And she can't force you to dive into tower, go the other way, and if the Kali blames you, then whatever, toxic people will be toxic people no matter what role they are, being a Kali doesn't suddenly make you more toxic.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maple Crusader","date":"2014-11-25T04:24:42.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently she was also made to torture melee champions with no gap-closers as well.
