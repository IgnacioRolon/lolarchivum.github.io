If he doesn't have a Lulu and/or doesn't have a team that works with him (pretty common in solo queue) he usually is either very strong or very weak throughout the game (kind of what feast or famine means isn't it?).\n* Cass's rework is toxic because her passive is broken. Since when does being broken require that a champion needs CC or mobility? Her kit was toxic before the rework (that's why they reworked her) but they didn't end up fixing anything and only succeeded in pushing all of her strength into one ability and really p###ing off her player base. Her problem isn't that she is suddenly toxic out of the blue, it is that they didn't fix anything and the bad parts stick out even more (she's still a lane bully, and she is *still* a late game hyper carry).\n* Veigar was actually much healthier to play against before the recent changes. Sure I couldn't dodge the stun as well (but I could just get merc treads or Abyssal Scepter or any other MR+Health item), but I had the ability to bully him out of lane and he actually had to land his full combo to kill me before the game got rolling. Now there is very little I can do to keep him from farming, but he also doesn't scale as well, leaving him with an ok early game and very strong mid game before tapering off in the late game again, which *should not happen*. They still didn't address the way his kit is all about \"If I land stun, odds are you're dead, If I don't land stun, odds are I'm dead.\" *NOTHING* about his kit has changed except that he has a higher chance to fail. That does not make his kit healthy, that just makes it so that there are fewer instances of him actually pulling off the full combo. As the Veigar, it feels terrible since you miss so many more times than before, and as the opponent, getting hit by that one unlucky stun feels just as terrible as before. They rebudgeted his power all right, but that is the worst thing they did, because they didn't actually take the real power (a super long stun) they took the perceived power (how fast it comes out), which leaves him more binary to play against than ever.\n\nNone of my points were about how they do in the pro scene, they were about how healthy they are in terms of the quality of time playing as them and the quality of time playing against them.","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-04-04T19:50:21.229+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"* Feast or famine refers to champions that takeover the game when fed but are a liability when behind (i.e.: Old Kassadin).

Her kit is naturally toxic (using your definition) because she is a lane bully, falls off mid game, and then comes back with a vengeance late game.

Hes pretty good and works fairly well now (really not sure why people think his update was a failure because it was really good and he isn't either brokenly strong or underpowered). Cass has also seen competitive play and is a good champion, some cass main's don't like that more power is on her E and that her passive ramps up but it actually makes her stronger and more consistent because her E is more landable on mobile champions, so you only need to hit Q or W and her passive guarantees she's going to be strong late game, no matter what. I've seen her 1v1 assassins by killing them so fast and using her E to heal through their damage. She also got sustain which she needed desperately. Veigar's update  has only been out a couple patches, I would give it time. I do think they should buff him though, especially his W as its useless about 90% of the time (a lot because of his new E). But god bless olaf, he is playable but only barely and only as a full tank which is pretty sad. Karma? She's just strange, she always has been. Her kit now is pretty good, other supports do what she does but better and other midlaners do to. Lulu is basically the same thing as her but waaay more useful utility wise if you want to play karma support. And stuff like ori and other utility mids do what she does but better.

Now, add another large chunk because they removed DFG.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm not sitting down and doing the math right now, but last I checked the \"extra\" 1 AP you got for every Q didn't come **anywhere** near close to the massive damage loss in Ratios. Even ignoring his ult's ratio loss, you still lost 100% AP Ratio in your kit.\nThey just made you _think_ that it was amazing. It's still a damage loss until super-late-game, at which point the 300G you would have gotten from normally being able to kill the enemy midlaner when your ult was up more than makes up for the extra handful of AP you got from passively farming your Q.\n\nIt isn't a \"slightly worse\" champ if he doesn't get the W change. He's actually trash until they fix it **and** his E. And depending on how they fix it, he **_still might be worse because they nerfed his ult and his Q is still a damn skillshot._**","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LordBrasca","date":"2015-04-04T18:56:34.726+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was a great fan of veigar...

And if there's one trait common to Veigar mains, it's that they weren't really that interested in playing the most OP champs. (There would be times I would try a FotM mid and just be astonished at how much better I did with them despite literally thousands of Veigar games. But I kept playing Veigar.)\n\nIt's funny, too, because by all rights I should be EXACTLY the person to love the Veigar changes:\n\n* I was always really bad at landing my stun with the edge. I got killed a lot as a result. My friends would routinely chide me over it: \"Cupcake, you've played like 2,000 Veigar games, why can you not hit with your stupid E?\"\n* I like trying quirky item builds, and I disliked having to build DFG every match.\n* My micro/twitch reflexes are quite poor, and I would often fail to realize that DFG hadn't fired, e.g. because of a range issue or because the spell-queue was overloaded. (Leading to me on the death screen going \"Wait, why didn't she die—WHY IS DFG NOT ON COOLDOWN?\")\n* I love linear long-range skillshots like Ezreal's Q.\n* I love delayed abilities like Cho's Rupture, because of all the mindgames you can play.\n\nBut I still don't really like New Veigar. Cho's Rupture (\"***UP*** you go!\") is interesting and effective because it's a filled circle, and it's timed just so that if you place it with the enemy in the center, they have to immediately run for the edge to avoid being knocked up. You can also time it to block a path. It's interesting. Veigar's **[new Event Horizon](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/kMxmMEAE-veigar-tries-to-get-riot-to-make-him-a-new-event-horizon)**, in contrast, really only works if the enemy is an idiot and runs into it, or is already stunned.\n\nVeigar's new power budget seems to be about poke damage and, well, general stat buffs. He feels quite boring in fights.\n\nIt's not all bad, no. It's not a disaster. I'll keep trying to learn to like it. As I wrote above, if anyone should like the New Veigar, it should be me. But I'd rather have seen his buff budget poured into giving him a really interesting E that created some strategic choice, rather than just being a stun that only stuns people in Bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-04-05T00:14:25.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if they keep buffing Veigar maybe he will be good in a duo lane with a support with CC to ensure his E lands and that Veigar can land W","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-04-04T16:58:08.444+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":8,"body":"Vieger had two click and point nukes.

Veigar's rework was successful strictly from a goal perspective, as his changes were designed to reduce the reliability in his burst and emphasize the Q-farming mechanic. However, players see his rework from the balance perspective, and by that perspective it's easy to see that Veigar's rework was an overwhelming failure.\n\nCassiopeia, Karma, and Trundle are the only exceptions to this rule. Cassiopeia's rework was a success both in terms of goals (reduce lane bully capacity and accentuate her late-game strengths) and balance (she's seeing quite a bit of competitive play), but a lot of players term it as a failure because they liked to play old Cassiopeia as a poison mage instead of her current style. Karma was a success from goals and balance (at least after a few patches of buffing her), but many players deem it a failure because of how it changed her character. Trundle's \"rework\" was also successful from both a goals and balance perspective (even though he barely got any kit changes at all), but again, some players are mad that his thematics  got changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Fuzzleberry","date":"2015-04-04T18:37:29.520+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get Riots obsession with changing champs, something not quite balanced about the champ? well better change everything about them so they don't even resemble the old champ.

Same for quite a few other champions that either got reworks or are planned to get reworks. Some champions are exceptions to this rule, as champions like Xerath and Sona got changed so that they could be more satisfying to play as.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, we've only had three champions that have gotten reworks that made them not resemble the old champion: Karma, Xerath, and Sion. Karma is the only one of these reworks that was considered a failure. Every other rework had, at the most, one ability completely completely changed to something completely different. Veigar isn't exactly the same as he was before, but Veigar is still Veigar. He still has the same 4 abilities and the same passive he had before, they just work differently now.

Her burst and waveclear was also good, but she kinda sucked at everything else. She was effectively reliant on a 30 second base cooldown early game in order to be good. And her R+E was the only good mantra she had.
