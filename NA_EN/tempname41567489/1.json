I have heard every point of view their is. I keep up with the current scientific theories. I have heard every explanation under the sun for both my experience and the christian experience in general. I have seen all the comparisons. I have witnessed all the misconceptions. I have heard all of the inquiries for \"wheres my proof\"\n\n#YET I STILL HAVE VERY STRONG FAITH IN JESUS.\n\nMy faith in Christ will not change no matter how many threads you spew on GD. No matter how many insults you throw at me my faith in Christ will not change. You will not change me and I will never deny Jesus. Period. It will never happen. Not in a million years. **And any other born again christian feels the same way.**\n\nSo keep up the mockery and the thread after thread insulting my faith and my people all you want. I am just getting real tired of going around in circles with you guys with the misconceptions, bigotry, and your south park education on theology. I would prefer it if you stopped making threads attacking my faith &amp; my people who follow the faith. That is all.","replies":[]}
