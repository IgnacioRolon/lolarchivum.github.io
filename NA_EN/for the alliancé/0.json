Sure, she swings toward good (and to Caitlyn, I'm betting), but she's quite chaotic compared to the order Piltover is often seen as. Demons are often seen as agents of chaos, not always just evil, but they lean toward the extreme.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-21T16:22:15.590+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Correct - skins are alternative fantasies for a champion, and don't necessarily connect to one another. The majority of the skins aren't canon either, which open the realm of possibilities for skins.
