No reason to do it prematurely, you may start playing the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2016-09-03T00:40:02.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a pretty nice skin tbh.\nIdk if it's worth the RP amount anymore with the overall increase in quality in skins, but getting it through crafting is pretty nice.\n\nHere is how I would look at it though;\n1. Do you play Ez?\n2. You are likely to get other skin shards in the future you'll like and that essence would be a very nice cause to getting them.\n3. While it is cheaper for essence than RP, it does still take /a lot/ of orange essence to enchant that.\n\nThere are other tidbits but from someone who has opened a shit ton of Hextech Crafting chests those are the most important three to consider really.\nYou always want to remember Hextech Crafting is an investment for the future, something that adds up bits over time till you finally make it worth it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-03T00:39:02.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got DJ sona the other day from hextech and I stopped playing karma to learn sona, now I adc/support main instead of jg.
