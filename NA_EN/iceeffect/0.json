Get a sense of humor.\n\nI know that Meddler would never do that, I also know that CertainlyT tries his best (even though his champs are overpowered). It was meant to be a humorous juxtaposition of proper request with formality and a \"WTF YASUO OP\" in the same comment.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-12-10T22:33:04.037+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't really a \"get a sense of humor\" in this case.

He always talks about learning and examining \"humans\".\nYet he lacks terror of Veigar stacking his damage or the utility of Fiora finding weak point in defence.\nHe just does not learn anything.\n\nAlso by his quotes he appears to be terrifying, emotionless and cruel.\nBut in game he is just little laser octopusp poking bit by bit.\n\nI truly believe that he should be a big terrifying space monster which will disect you just by its stare.\n\n\nI think he should generate the feeling \"shit, i dont want to get close to it\"... just imagine what this kind of monster would do with its tentacles to you if got too close.\n\nI think his passive could provide the \"learning\" feel, by scaling its true damage into late game, or something like that. \nAnd if he were to increase his size by amout of AP/Kills/Time would be friggin cool.\n\n--------------------------\nsimply put I dont believe that Velkoz represents Sapce sicentist monster at all.\nShouldnt he be able to rip his enemies apart?

What he should get to differentiate him is an xp effect like zilean has but different. maybe his ult can get the added passive that for every 3 stacks popped by the Lifeform Disintegration Ray gives him bonus xp.
