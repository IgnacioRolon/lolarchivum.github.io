Jinx (another rather distinct silhouette) with some comically complicated water guns, Fiora with pool noodles, just for a couple more examples (there are others that other people have already pointed out, such as Orianna).\n\nThe same argument could be made for male characters. Pool Party Zac (who is 'naked' in the first place), for example, is at it's core a blue Zac with a diving mask and shorts. Of course there's other fun stuff with done the skin, but that's the point of the pool party skins isn't it? Having fun with the champ and getting creative.
