When you use Riven&#039;s Q it feels heavy/slow than the default riven and the default one is much lighter and faster \r\n2. Most of her moves feel heavy for skin\r\n3. Animation Cancels also feel kinda heavy \r\n\r\nAnd I think there&#039;s more but I haven&#039;t played Riven ever since because of this problem so please fix!! I want to continue using the skin since I bought it for a reason and ya xD\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:92}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-06T20:20:08.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey EternalBoom165 -\n\nThis is working as intended. We've had several players test this skin, and the difference here is the sound on the (Q). Similarly, Arcade Riven has a different sound, too. It's a matter of getting used to the different sounds.","replies":[{"poster":"Master Woldan","date":"2016-11-24T19:42:49.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey KateyKhaos, i am a riven mainer aswell who plays with dragonblade Riven, i am having the same problem, ive used this skin for 200+, im not playing with sounds tho and im still experiening the same problem too.

It's using the same animation set as the base, and isn't playing any differently. I'm not sure what would be causing you to feel a different at this point. :c","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CreamTea","date":"2016-04-12T23:55:36.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure??

The only difference here are the sounds, which, as I've mentioned above, may throw you off if you haven't played with the skin before.","replies":[{"poster":"CreamTea","date":"2016-04-30T03:36:24.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have the skin but that's ok I guess :P.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
