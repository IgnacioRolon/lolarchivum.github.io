That is not a very good thing for an assassin you know and not to mention it feels SO bad now compared to the old one. It also was an autoattack reset and felt fluid, AA-Q-AA felt quick and smooth. Another thing is that Rengar is an assassin with knives. You stab with knives and they are meant for single targetting, not for slashing several enemies at once. An assassin is also supposed to kill one squishy and be done with it. The new Q simply promotes a bruiser playstyle as it locks you in place. Also, it looked and sounded much better.
