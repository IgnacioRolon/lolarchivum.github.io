This is likely happening from a connection issue that's not loading up your assets properly.  Are you on wifi? \n\nIt could also be game files having trouble rendering.  Try a repair and let me know if that helps, but test it in a custom game!","replies":[{"poster":"stormthegamer","date":"2018-01-06T06:33:24.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I did a full repair, it failed halfway through, so i restarted the client and it had a .2 mb patch and now its fixed. Somehow? Thank you very much for the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-06T16:15:15.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear everything is okay now, but be wary as it could just be a coincidence.  For example, if it failed halfway it may be your connection losing comms with the patching service.  You might still have an unstable connection so you could see it happen again.  Run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide if it does to help squash whatever is causing this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
