(note past-tense) Just tried the changes, and it feels like I'm not even playing veig anymore. He's just too different, too **unreliable** I felt almost completely powerless in the game I just played, despite having 230 q stacks and just my ult alone 100-10 the enemy veig.\n\nI picked veig up solely because of 2 reasons:\n\n1. he was easy to play. Simple and straight forward press q, do dmg, land stun? full combo nuff said\n\n2. he was **reliable!** that means I can trust him to perform well in all situations, and if he did not do so, it was because **I** screwed up, not because the enemy picked a better champ and \"out played\" me.\n\nIt is such a terrible feeling when you do everything you know you should do, the way it should be done, and still fail because of what the enemy did, rather than you simply screwing up.\n\nOne core reason I pick veigar going into matches is because he can catch ppl out of position and punish them for it. I can't do that anymore. The delay on his stun completely destroys any attempt to do so. Even if I center my gate **directly** on the enemy champ, they can still **WALK** out of it. Not only does that put me **dangerously** closer to the enemy than I need to be, but it also means that I am guaranteed to \"miss\" my stun every time I cast it, even if it does stun some ppl.\n\nWhat I mean by a guaranteed \"miss\" is that if old veig missed his stun, he was screwed. That, or the enemy just walks away, depending on their position.  \n\nThe game I just played, the enemy team had a talon top. When talon started roaming, I had enough dmg to kill him, but without any means of cc'ing talon before he jumped on me, I was a free kill. There was no possible way for me to \"counter play\" the enemy talon short of dropping my stun long before he was in range to jump on me and run away as fast as I could. It felt terrible. I had plenty of dmg to kill him, but I just could not get in range to do so due to him being able to kill me before I stunned him.\n\n\ntl;dr - Good job riot, veigar now has \"counter play.\" It's a shame I'll never be using that lovely Final Boss veigar skin again, cuz veig is just utter trash now. Hope yer happy, cuz I really did like that skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-02-26T12:25:59.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":">I felt almost completely powerless in the game I just played, despite having 230 q stacks and just my ult alone 100-10 the enemy veig.\n\nwait wot m8...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-02-25T18:17:20.323+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"This Memorial will be short.","replies":[{"poster":"Byrnes","date":"2015-02-26T04:20:34.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was that...","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-02-26T14:10:31.652+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes...yes it was.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tsugaga","date":"2015-02-25T18:11:34.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":28,"body":"I've had a few Veigars on my team today and they absolutely dominate, all of these whiny threads about Veigar being ruined are just ignorant IMO.

I'm pretty sure diamond players will dominate unranked players with Urgot. I find it funny that you call other people ignorant when you make dumb comments.\n\nRelax. Ranked rank is irrelevant because it was a team builder game, my team builder MMR is diamond, so all players in that game are diamond level, they just don't play ranked as much. Like me for example, who's unranked, but I've played nearly 10,000 games of league with all modes combined, and I perform at a diamond level. My team builder games have diamond, master, and challenger players in them.\n\nIgnorance isn't a bad thing, and it's not an insult, so relax your insults. Veigar isn't ruined at all and is still a very strong champ. The only bad thing about his changes is the stun delay, which ruins the ability to land the edge right on a champ and instead you have to hope enemies run into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravaldy","date":"2015-02-26T02:38:09.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ignorance is the lack of knowledge which in a discussion can be detrimental to your argument. Basically it can render you comment useless such as in this case. \n\nPeople like you keep saying Veigar is too strong yet he's never banned and rarely played in the upper ranks. This is usually a pretty strong indicator that he's lacking something to make him valuable to the team. Nerfing him will just make him disappear from the game completely. \n\nI've had many of my favourites nerfed and I still play them but this would be a first time I drop char due to a nerf.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Volt Cruelerz","date":"2015-02-25T18:15:01.294+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's kind of the problem.  hitting E (and thus W) is no longer within your control at all.
