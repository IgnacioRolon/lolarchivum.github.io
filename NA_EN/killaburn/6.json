And BTW, I&#039;ll just continue meddler&#039;s post in the dev corner, because its crowded now and it mixed with other disscussion.\n\n~~~\n\nSo for me,\n\nI hope to see\n\n- A girl with a long hair hime cut who is always bored, has a bored expression even if she kills a person and very slothy. ( maybe a girl hairmancer, see link below to my thread about it).\n- A Multi Personality Disorder champ that has a unique personality in each persona.\n- A small(not actually small but petite woman) but terrible girl, has a kuudere personality(doesn't show emotions) especially when it comes to fighting, a psychopath maybe.\n- A happy go lucky male( like lux) in the outside but sinister and evil in the inside. A good looking jerk fits this.\n- A shy type character but after its levels it gains confidence\n- A hag/mother figure/grandma champ. we need this riot! Don&#039;t let us down and try to hear suggestions from the community.\n- A support that is some form of military commander who is essentially trying to grab the ADC by the scruff of their neck and shove them into the fray.( not my idea).\n\nbtw, we need a hairmancer( Like bayonetta, Flare Corona, etc. ) in leaugue. An example of a hairmancer is in my thread, i hope you could see this specially a rioter: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/X1PfGqc9-can-we-have-a-new-champ-that-uses-her-hair-as-skills?\n\nAlso, Comment what champ do you want to see in league too :D\n\nEDIT: I'am so happy!! that my comment was noticed and hairmancers can be possible champ in league in the fututre :D\nhttps://imgur.com/a/es42n","replies":[{"poster":"Nickholas12","date":"2017-07-26T09:15:56.111+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":31,"body":"Riot!

Tracer in OW worked well for about a year and everyone loved her and they just put it out there that she has a girlfriend at last years Xmas event.  Did that have a significant impact on her personality or gameplay?  Not even a small one, she's still bubbly, energenetic, fast, reckless Tracer.

There are numerous small aspects of characters that get lost because A.) They're not in the story or B.) they're too small to get a major point in the story.\n\nSay, for example, a character like Ezreal has a tattoo. We're never going to know that unless someone comes out and says \"Oh yeah Ezreal has tats\" or they hamfist a story reason for Ezreal to go shirtless and show off the weird \"E ♥ T\" tattoo on his upper arm.\n\nBut the biggest issue was that this was a Rioter, the designer of the champion no less, saying a major fact when someone asked about Kayn's relationship with Zed.
