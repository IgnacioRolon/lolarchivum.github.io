Long abandoned temples have been converted into homes and places of business, with scaffold walkways leading from one establishment to another.\n\nSo yeah, I&#039;m in a hurry so I&#039;ll just do it fast. \n\n- Bilgewater is the remains of a far older civilization\n- Ruined Kings Civilization is old and has not yet been told, so its a mystery.\n- The ruination of the blessed Isles to Shadow Isles is so old too, much older than the darkin and the rune wars.\n- Plus they&#039;re close to each other in the map\n\nSo what if:\n\n- Lets just say bildgewater is the ruined kings kingdom but not yet like the structure of it like an isles. Islands structure can change too so maybe bildgewater&#039;s architecture is not yet divided in the past. Plus, waters can be low tide and high tide at times. Maybe In this kingdom its like venice,italy. Its a sinking island. Maybe bilgewater is a big island too in the past like a country before some parts sunk?.\n- The ruined king has an empire so maybe he conquered some parts in valoran/the southern continent which lead to his wifes dismay. Maybe other empires send assassins to infiltrate the ruined king and take his kingdom\n-  Then the ruined king&#039;s wife got a damned and instruct kalista to find a cure. Kalista&#039;s story is next which you need to find out for yourselves, to many to type.\n- Kalista instructed the ruined what to do but was stubborn and made a scandal in the blessed isles following kalista.\n- Blessed turned into shadows.\n- Without the kings return, maybe the kingdom got conquered or maybe the people honored a new king like that but as you know, many catastrophes might come in the future like rune wars or darkin wars so maybe with a use of a rune it did change bilgwaters&#039;s state and with the darkin slaying the people maybe the obliterated 98% of Bildges inhabitants.\n- Or maybe just like old factions in the real world, some got extinct just like the ruined kings kingdom. specially him leaving and didn&#039;t came back.\n- Some might survive and started a new life but started from scratch that&#039;s why maybe they&#039;re the first ones who made traditional medicine in bilge. And maybe they&#039;re the first buhru people. Making the religion and making ancient things that people knew today. Maybe there was a time were nagakaburos came making her their goddess/deity and shaping bilge what it is today.\n- After that, many people come to the said faction and build their respective homes and build what is bildge today.\n\nSo long, I hope you could read it. I didn&#039;t include some parts of my theory because i&#039;m in a hurry.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-06-01T16:00:33.697+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Others have already looked at the timeline details, but I'm just going to leave this here...\n\n> _Just beyond the southernmost reach of the Blue Flame Isles lies a graveyard of ships, rumored lost while searching for a blessed land, looking to trade wealth for immortality.

Now, that's not very helpful to you, as you don't know what the track IS, but there have been no major delays or hitches at least.

The Ruination is a more recent event if you compare it to the Watcher, Shurima and the Darkin War. If you ask me, I don't think it is older than a few centuries.\n\nBefore you say, \"no it happend before the Darkin War\", we have canon mentioned that it did happend later.\n\n> Remnants of an order that has existed far longer than Noxus itself, initiates of the Black Rose have schemed from the shadows for centuries, drawing the rich and powerful to their ranks. Though they do not often learn the origins of their matron, many have uncovered legends of a pale sorceress who aided the broken barbarian tribes, in their struggle against the infamous Iron Revenant subjugating lands already ravaged by the darkin. Even today, his name is whispered in fear: Mordekaiser.\n\n[LeBlanc Bio](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/story/champion/leblanc/)\n\nDarkin War happend, after it Mordekaiser come to power and reign for a few centuries. In the end someone could steal his skull, which was brought to the Blessed Isle. The Ruination happend also a good while later.\n\n> Years rolled into decades, decades to centuries, until a cataclysm was unleashed upon the Blessed Isles. A king whose mind had been ruined by grief and madness unleashed a terrible spell that condemned the isles to darkness, turning them into a twisted realm of the undying – the Shadow Isles. During that great sorcerous explosion, the vaults securing Mordekaiser’s skull were torn asunder.\n\n[Mordekaiser Bio](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/story/champion/mordekaiser/)\n\nYeah, the Darkin War happened a good while before the Ruination.","replies":[{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2018-06-01T22:26:41.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a point there too but lets just see what would riot bring into the future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-01T08:11:18.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean.\n\nIt could be possible.\n\nBut I find it highly unlikely.","replies":[{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2018-06-01T22:27:11.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I know why is it unlikely?","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-02T04:23:02.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just have this feeling that Riot wants to keep the kingdom's location a secret on purpose.\n\nI don't think they'll ever reveal it unless it somehow becomes a major plot device in the future.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MooooooooreDakka","date":"2018-06-01T13:07:18.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It took me a second but this actually makes perfect sense.
