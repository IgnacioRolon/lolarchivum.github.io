You guys have painted Noxus as a meritocracy, and through Riven's merits as a soldier, she got honored and given a fancy weapon by the Grand General. That's very Noxus.\n\nHowever, after she realizes the betrayal by Noxus when she's sent to a suicide mission to use chemical weapons on the people of Ionia, her representation of Noxus shifts dramatically. No longer is her mindset that of \"be the best, get the cookie.\" It's now \"HOLY SHIT, NOXUS IS DOING SOME FUCKED UP SHIT.\" The fact that she's now seeing the atrocities that Noxus is committing in order to come out on top means she no longer is representing what it is to be Noxus, as she is no longer in agreement with the idea of doing whatever it takes to win.\n\nNoxus sees power, and any means to get to that power. They don't see fairness, justice, and peaceful understanding, at least not as much as Demacia and Ionia do. Noxus, in short, has a distinct lack of respect for those they must remove from their path to the top. Riven is now woke to the world as it operates outside of Noxus, and she's now representing ideals that are not ideals held by Noxus. She is not striving to seek power and rise above everyone and everything around her. She's seeking to atone, foster peace within herself and with the people she has now chosen to live with. She's seeking a more communal way of living that is very much not like the Noxian way of society or living.\n\nSo no, Riven does not represent Noxus anymore.

Cause the borders are maybe hard to make between these 2 fractions in some point. Noxus old and current stand is that a person can be any role depending on their strenght. There are no noble advantages, the arena and military of noxus is lead by the strenght and not by the many or by the weak (at this point sry for my bad english if it is hard to understand what i wanna to tell). So Urgots philosophy while beeing totaly crazy and probably being dangerous for swain and the now current noxus leadership still resembles around indiviual strenght. Only that he thinks that true strenght comes from chaos and fear. And by that he cleary is closest to Noxus and Zhaun and not like a Demacian who stays for order and a big Union or Ionia and peace with magic.\nRiven even said that Noxus no longer is her familiy or country while Urgot is on his way to overthrow noxus with his Idea of the ideal world.\nI would say that Urgot remains far more as a Noxian as Riven currently cause she remained threw the whole tribunal and even before while geting arrested and later while people threw fruits on her peacefully, resembling a status that Ionia has tried mostly over their history and a big time over the invasion.\nA Noxian would have not wished for his death or to forget their past. Riven is even called the broken blade and i would hardly say that this remains to resemble how noxus wants to be, looking especialy at Darius.\nYes past riven lived a perfect exampel of Noxus Ideal but now she left this war. And her having a magic sword in a magic land is kinda similar to urgot being a crazy guy in a  crazy city: A amtch but not directly the strenght point why any of these 2 should be considered being of this nation. But riven has other points for her saying she fits to ionia and not to noxus while urgot has not realy other points saying he fits to zhaun and not to noxus.\n\nWell one thing i could understand: Rivens lore now is like she quit fighting and is now a farmer girl. While urgot ingame realy fulfills his updated lore Riven ingame is basicly hard to say now: Mostly close before the stories of the last 3 days or while being still ideal to noxus in their army (how you said it) but that would not expalin her ingame broken sword. Otherwise after she broked it down the story says that she soon got picked up and nursed by Shava and asa. So the conclusion would either be that Ingame Riven just doesn't balance quite rightful her current situation or that the story of her is still not finished and she soon will have a reason to at least partly fight again and use the swords power. Cause the only fighting scene we had was the short clash with yasuo and even there she didn't control the windslash of her Sword like she does ingame. But than again it needs to be a realy good point why she should be considered still a noxian and not like a strong ionian warrior similar to irelia.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PookíeChips","date":"2018-04-25T20:34:30.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6JWHilrN,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-04-25T19:49:19.926+0000)\n>\n> Disagree.  \n> \n>  Riven still represents the best of what Noxus is and could be.

I can't see her inheriting Ionian morals and start living a tranquil life. She can learn from Ionia but I have a feeling her story goes further than Ionia.\n\nMore than caring for Ionia, Riven cares about her noxian guilt which is connected to Ionia through the war and corruption she realized her nation brought on Ionia. Her sentence in Ionia is only the beginning of her journey to redeem that guilt.\n\nIf she became officially ionian, it would indicate that she has no further motive towards Noxus and would continue her life as a farmer in order to forget her origin.

Riven HATES Noxus and no longer connects with the place she was born. Even in her little bio, it says she was an orphan who grew up farming, and thought the military was her chance for a better life. She worked hard in the military, got commendations and a cool sword from Boram Darkwill, and then had every perception she held shattered when she was sent on a suicide mission to kill peaceful people with chemical weapons.\n\nRiven no longer wants to have anything to do with Noxus. Her past shames her, the people she killed in her mission with Noxus haunt her. Her homeland has completely betrayed her, and she is trying to cut it out of her life. She IS actively trying to learn Ionian, and we see in the story how she is trying to temper her feelings and instinct to go aggressive with the peace and balance taught by Ionia. She's inheriting Ionian morals and practices, and she's trying to become a better person for that reason.\n\nThe fact that Riven has tried to atone and return to a peaceful existence in Ionia tells us that she does actually care for Ionia and it's people. She sees her shame whenever she sees the people who have lost loved ones to Noxus. She desperately seeks their forgiveness to help her come to terms and move past her horrible past. She has guilt she's trying to get rid of, yes, but judging by her connection to Asa and Shava Konte, who have taken her in and call her daughter, despite her horrible past, she has found a place she wants to call home. She loves Asa and Shava, and wants to protect them and live with them as the family she's always wanted and needed. She doesn't want to partake in war anymore, she wants to help the village and live a peaceful life with a family.\n\nAnd you're right, becoming Ionian would mean she has no further motives toward Noxus. This is true because she _does not_ have any further motives towards Noxus. She aims to forget it and live in peace. Her story _doesn't need_ to tie into the overarching story of the world, because not every person in a story has to be neatly tied and bound up in the massive saga. Some characters can be content to have their moment, and live a peaceful life until threatened. That is what Riven wants. That is her ultimate goal.

Why would she fight alongside Noxus in the first place if she hated it. Noxus was her home.\n\nAll the effort she puts into forgetting Noxus and learning Ionia is just a way for her to escape her origin due to blaming herself for the crimes of the corrupted Noxus. Her being noxian has little to do with how corrupted the nation is. If she had a chance to repair Noxus, I think she would take it. Maybe it is too big of a step to take on Noxus and try to fell it but I doubt she will just forget what Noxus did to her and what it has become. Karma is a b*tch and I'm sure Riven will play a part in the eventual fall of Noxus (if the lore ever allows that). If she gets the trust of Ionians, she could potentially rally a powerful ally against the corrupted Noxus.\n\nYou're just ignorant if you think she's just gonna forget Noxus. For the time being that might be correct while she's serving her sentence and learning Ionia. But after that she's probably gotta deal with her roots.\n\nWell this is basically just theorycrafting.

She only fought for Noxus because, being an orphan, she saw the military as a means to get out of the farm life and become part of a community that would love her and see her as one of their own. She didn't join the military because she loved Noxus. She joined because she wanted a place to be accepted. From her stories, she's never really adhered to the ideals of Noxus and been disillusioned in the same way that Darius and Draven are. She doesn't love the state of Noxus, she only loves that her place as an honored military member gave her a community and a family of fellow soldiers that she could bond with.\n\nWhen she sees the atrocities of war that Noxus was willing to do to extinguish Ionia, she breaks her ties to it, and all of her lore states that she's tried desperately to sever herself from Noxus as a means to try to ease her troubled mind about her past with them. In no way do we see her as someone who's main intention is to go back to the place they were born in order to root out the corruption there. That isn't Riven, and it's nowhere in any of the lore about her.\n\nRiven's motivations are much simpler than people are willing to acknowledge. She's not a renegade. She's not Robin Hood. She doesn't have grand ambitions to purge Noxus of corruption. All she wants is to be accepted, and live a simple life with people who will love her and whom she can love back. That is the motivation we get from Riven. Noxus was a tool that she thought would get her to that kind of life. It didn't happen in Noxus, but it did when it led her to Ionia. \n\nPeople abandon their roots all the time - don't forget that. Not every person has this die-hard urge to go back home. Some people want to make new roots wherever they will be happy. Riven is one of those people, because honestly, she's got nothing back home. She's an orphan, all she had was the farm she was raised on and the military that betrayed her. Noxus literally has nothing for her to want to return to, so I see no reason why she would have this urge to go back and try to cleanse it of corruption.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-04-25T16:53:36.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't criminals such as Jhin, GP (during MFs rule), Veigar, Lulu, Aurelion Sol, Lissandra and Jinx count as of their faction without actually having any allegiance with their home?","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-04-25T16:57:12.226+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That was my point.\nHis argument was that Riven has no allegiance with Ionia and therefore shouldn't be an Ionian champion.\n\nI just wanted to show him another example with Urgot, and he still counts as a Zaunite, so allegiance doesn't seem to be a factor here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2018-04-25T18:10:11.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Faction allegiance doesn't mean there's only one specific moral mindset behind a faction.
