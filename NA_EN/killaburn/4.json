Riven is out too because the person doesn&#039;t have a ponytail. \n\nSo my theories are:\n- Which champ has a black hair and likes glasses ? **cough _vayne_ cough** . maybe a future arcade vayne?\n-  Maybe the foreshadowing of next champion? and having arcade his/her debut skin?\n-  Maybe another champ that i have missed","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2017-08-01T04:19:07.852+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's no way that's Vayne.

Rather we focus on the product and the player experience. The reality is that everything we create is the result of a huge team effort and we want to remember that at all times.
