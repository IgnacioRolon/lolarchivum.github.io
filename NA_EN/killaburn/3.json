Or the opposite, the one who was challenged by {{champion:201}} \n\n- Why not both.\n\nSorry if these wild theories are here all of a sudden.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2017-08-06T00:18:18.118+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not believe Gragas to be in the myth space.
