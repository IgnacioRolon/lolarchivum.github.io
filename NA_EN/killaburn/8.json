I&#039;am excited to read the new lore stories for old champs as some rioters claimed that we will receive a new lore update at this particular day(nov 30). Well usually, we receive new updates between 12-6 in the morning, so i&#039;m gonna wait for it now cause i&#039;m so exited. Specially for Varus.\r\n\r\nIf there are any rioters passing by, can you please tell me the hour of the new lore story&#039;s reveal time.

But i think they don't follow NA time anymore as their time basis. Specially, OCE servers tend to be the first ones to use new features that goes live(ex. the honor system) and Singapore & Malaysia was the first one to reveal the pre-season trailer later last month. Nevertheless to say, that if this new lore stories are just riot's tripping or just gonna announce it for their leisure, well you are indeed correct that they'll use NA's time.
