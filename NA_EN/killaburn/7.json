Another point is that in the canon map  (The Medarda Heirloom Map), it is placed in the western side of the world of runatera.\n- Shurima - we all know that shurima is one hell of a big place so in my map it is huge. and in the canon lore they said that the shuriman map is in the southern part of runaterra.(in the future i will also make an elaborate map of shurima in my fan made map like the shurima capital,etc.)\n- Noxus - self explanatory. look at he cannon map (The Medarda Heirloom Map).\n- Freljord -  This is tricky so i researched a bit. The reason why i put freljord in that place is because: it must be in the northern part of runatera(because ice), it is close to demacia(alot of freljord-demacian interaction in the lore), it is also close to noxus(see the video where darius walks in the lands of freljord) and in The Medarda Heirloom Map, the arrow is pointing towards northwest so we assume that it is not really west.\n- Mt. targon - we all know that the mountain is large and long. In the lore it is also stated that its in the southern part of runatera and besides shurima. And I also assume it is close to demacia because taric duh!(he was exiled in targon so it might be closed).\n- Bandle city - I will elaborate this in the future( i have theories like it is a mystical forest that has a city in the middle alongside a portal that they come trough and that no one can enter in/out in the forest except yordles and the yordles can only be seen as humans  to some ordinary people like tristana is visioned as an old lady unless you are a magcal being( don&#039;t argue with me about the games because summoners are not really cannon anymore)).\n- Kumungu Jungles - I know this is not canon anymore( i think) but this is just my place holder name to the jungles of shurima. This is also close to the place of rengar(the savannah region of shurima)and i wish jungle champs should be retconed here like nida and zyra.\n- Icathia - it is somewhere in shurima and i can say that it is in the sourthern part of it. this is where the void&#039;s portal happend,void corruption, etc.. Another theory is that it is beside  the jungles of shurima(ex. k6 and rengar) and mt. targon where they fight the void monsters.\n\nAnother personal theory of mine that there is a place like this:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/y23co\n\nthis is where the dragons take place. shyvanna&#039;s hometown. as i can say this is also close to demacia because j4 and shyv. another is that demacia is close to freljord so i think this is also the place where braum fights dragons. there are also volcanoes here because we don&#039;t have a volcano yet in runatera. and imagine the dragon X skins takes place here. \n\nNOTE: Time after time, i will update this post :D so keep updated. and thanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-07-16T20:06:47.453+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooh, maps - I _**adore**_ maps. :D\n\nI love the thought process you've put into this - really good to read the reasoning behind the positioning of all the locations.\n\nI'm quite interested in some of the geographical quirks you've got going on there - especially the channel between the two largest land masses of Ionia, and the channel around the are you've labelled the jungles.

I certainly don't have input over what the next champions will be.\n\nI think others have addressed that if Gnar is still in True Ice, in a glacier, then that reduces the number of places that he could have emerged - BUT that doesn't mean that Gnar couldn't have moved around since then.  A lot about Gnar isn't player-facing yet, so I can't say either way.\n\nBasically, I couldn't say anything helpful, so I didn't say anything at all :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Recons","date":"2017-07-17T22:22:30.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To expand, the mountain range of Targon would also deviate wind currents southward, like a funnel, which would mean the southern continent is affected by heavy crosswinds, and high-humidity, which would potentially develop into hurricanes and other natural wind phenomena. \n\nThis unknown southern continent would most likely have a tropical-esque nothern coast, which is abated by storms constantly, these created from the heat of the Shuriman desert, the aforementioned cross-winds, and the colder southern part of the continent. All these factors combine perfectly into low-pressure systems traversing from the middle sea into the northern area of this continent. Think of the Atlantic and how storms come from the Saharan desert into the Caribbean. \n\nBased on the aesthetic of the northern continent, and assuming Runeterra undergoes the same geological processes Earth undergoes, tectonic plates on the southern continent should be collapsing. Since the ones in the northern continent are undergoing divergence.\n\nThis would create a mountain range where the plates are converging,   potentially housing a volcano. However, since I don't have any more information regarding this continent that may or may not exist, I can't theorize very well. I would need to know the rate of convergence of the plates, geothermal processes of the continent, how big are the landmasses, and all of these are left up for writers to come up...\n\nSorry for the long read.\n\nEDIT: Unknown southern hemisphere continent**","replies":[{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2017-07-17T23:19:20.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG!! we should really work on this and let's not put our talents in to waste.

I just felt that there wasn't much for me to add.  There's lots of ways we could 'excuse' the mistake on the map by blaming Jago - but generally I feel doing so is a little disingenuous when the mistake was actually mine.  \n\nThere was an amusing follow up on our end, however - turns out the map IS correct.  The font is terrible and the V and the U are almost identical in shape - what the EU translated maps had done was use a completely different typeface/font that had a different uppercase V, and use that instead.  Faced with either being \"technically correct\" with our crappy V/U similarities, or being helpfully wrong with an alternate font, we're choosing the latter.  At some point, once it's gone through the localization and publishing process, the maps will be updated to have a new (fake) V for Vindor.
