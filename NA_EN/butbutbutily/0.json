It was a lvl 5 account that tried to add me last night and i didnt even accept it. And I go to try it tonight and it says my password has changed and recovery email got hacked also as I see there are requests to change password in my email last night around the time the random account tried to add me. \r\n\r\nI don't even know my setup email or info because even now I was using a spam email and my email had same pw as my league account (it was a spam email ofc on my main email i use a better one) but without my setup email/info or any store info I can give what can I say to say it's mine. I seriously hope I don't lose my account based off lack of info when I can name 90% of my friend list and the 3 clubs I'm in. Would that be enough proof? Also I don't really remember the last time I purchased RP but I do remember how I paid for them a few months ago. Any input of process would be great because this is the first time I've been hacked and am trying to get my account back.","replies":[{"poster":"ButButButILY","date":"2017-05-01T22:48:16.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found my account on op.gg and the name he changed it to (because i played with my friends recently and saw the new account name on their profile) And this guy has played 9x Rank Solo Q (STILL ONLINE USING IT) and lost all 9 in a row. Seriously? Riot is going to ignore that? I gave RIOT the link to the profile also.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-30T04:03:50.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best would be to hit us up through our [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416). We'll need to ask a lot of questions pertaining to early account activity, and they can be hard to answer, but keep in mind you don't need to answer _ALL _ of them. We just need enough information that nobody else could obtain (things like friends lists and clubs can be seen by almost anyone, especially if they currently are on your account). You mentioned having past payment information and that could be very beneficial.","replies":[{"poster":"ButButButILY","date":"2017-04-30T04:09:18.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is I don't remember any of the early account activity because I used spam names n emails and probably can only answer my recent past year of RP payments. That's it though.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-30T04:50:56.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats okay! Sometimes it can be hard to remember all these little details. Just remember as much you can, and that payment info will definitely help! If you can't get verified on the first pass, it doesn't mean you'll be forever locked out, we just need a little more info to verify you is all. Take some time to really think over the questions and do your best to guess if you need to.","replies":[{"poster":"ButButButILY","date":"2017-05-01T22:30:05.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a reply while giving all my paypal transactions with ID and screenshot on my paypal activity and they said my information was not enough. I found someone using my account and we all know RIOT support can see the IP Address of where the player is playing and that the IP address is completely different from where I am. And they continue to ignore that? How is that justifiable??? I sent several transactions pictures of my paypal account from months ago too","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
