I loved the little Ezrael stories the most (was kinda pissed off when I read the one near Icathia where he just stops exploring any further, like come on I really want to know whats there), the art for Icathia was also amazing, massive black looking creatures towering over an army.\r\n\r\nIm primarily a Noxus fan so all I wanted to do was look around that main region but I ended up looking at all of them except Demacia (because Demacia can go to hell, go Noxus), loved Zaun;  Chemtech is apparently cheap and dangerous Hextech. I loved Urgots whole story. \r\n\r\nI found bandle city after 10 minutes of searching, wasnt much of a story there.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows where I can find Aatrox and Tryndamere Id love to hear it cause I didnt find those two. \r\n\r\nAlso Darius had a campagian against the Freljord that ended in a stalemate, would **LOVE** to read a story about that, I was looking for Tryndamere for that specific reason (Thought maybe Darius and Tryndamere clashed).\r\n\r\n On the note of Aatrox, expanding on Darkins would also be amazing as well as on the shadow isle. Would also be cool if more animals where added, I loved reading about Drakehounds and the beasts around Mount Targon (probably because im a biologist :D).\r\n\r\nAnyway, cool stuff Riot lore team {{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mael Jade","date":"2019-01-04T19:40:00.593+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, not every bit of lore is always available on the map. so as of right now we prob got the Neeko/Nidalee points of interest in Kumungu but some of the Ryze marks are missing and so on. Tryndamere can only be found when clicking on Freljord, Aatrox should be listened as Shuriman. Also, it is constantly getting updates whenever new short stories, new champs and reworks come out. Most lore fans are happy by that map and who is not interested in the lore...can play and just ignore the map cause it barely changes anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2019-01-04T21:10:57.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> except Demacia (because Demacia can go to hell\n\nFunny you say that.

Its been apparently bubbling up with each passing year, to no avail. At this point, I wouldn't believe it was coming until a new Yordle champ or rework is actually confirmed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wendy MarveI","date":"2019-01-05T14:13:16.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Where is this map of Runeteera with stories included exactly?","replies":[]}]}
