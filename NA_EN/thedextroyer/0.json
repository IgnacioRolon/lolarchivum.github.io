Something that isnt against the rules! Let alone who decides what is/isnt off meta? What are we currently using as a Meta? Because by that logic every single game in your mind is a 2-1-2. These types of games survive because people like to try out new things. That why we have things like Graves Jungle, Sona/Raka Mid, Zyra/Morg Support, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"THEDEXTROYER","date":"2017-12-19T23:43:58.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not what i mean say your playing and your adcing then someone comes up and literally says im not supporting after you pick your champ and then they come into the lane and just start spell bombing the minions to take them from you or make you miss them stands there dancing under tower while your getting dove standing just far enough away to throw spells into the minion wave and take cs or clear waves.... or better yet my favorite is i dont wanna jungle ima just duo top lane","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-12-20T11:29:08.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats trolling, but thats not what you wanted from your original post. Maybe next time you'd go more into detail as its coming off that you are upset people are just going offmeta. Remember Off Meta and trolling are two completely different things. Going with a certain champions on a role/lane they are not normally played on and still trying to win is Off Meta. What you just wrote in that response post is trolling and can be done with any champion in any role!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
