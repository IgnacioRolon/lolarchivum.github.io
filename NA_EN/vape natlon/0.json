Then complete the following:\nSelect your 'Applications' folder on your Dock\nSelect 'Open in Finder'\nRight Click on 'League of Legends'\nSelect 'Show Package Contents'\nSelect 'Contents'\nSelect 'LoL'\nDelete the folder named 'Config' (Right Click, then select 'Move to trash', then empty your trash)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nreference: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/25074438?page=1\n\nI just played a smooth AI game, will do more tests later to see if it actually solves the problem.

It seems to happen every time I attempt to type in chat as well (in game). On top of this I noticed that my hot corners are working as I play the game, so if I try to move my camera to the top right corner of my screen it sends me out of the game because my hot corners are set to show mission control. This hasn't ever been an issue in the past. Game breaking issue for me.

Game sounds are still going on and the cursor is not frozen and you can give commands to your champion. (you will be able to hear it but not see it since the screen is frozen)\n\nA temporary solution is to cmd+tab to switch to other apps and then switch back to LoL game window to temporarily fix it, but it might occur again sooner or later.\n\nBorderless Mode or Window Mode won't have the issue, but the game is extremely laggy (screen is laggy, not the network, ping is fine, fps is much lower than full screen mode, but the screen is yet much laggier than what the fps should indicate, for e.g. a 70fps will be as laggy as 20~30fps) in those two modes and almost not possible to play.\n\nIt happens on my new retina MacBook Pro 15 inch with touch bar since 7.1, but fine on my friends' old MacBook Pro machines.\n\nI think the cause is that something modified from 6.24 to 7.1 is not compatible with some unique features of the new MacBook Pros.

I've disabled that for the past 5 days and I haven't had a freeze since.  To disable the cursor getting larger, you can do the following:\n\n> \n> System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Display -> \"Shake mouse pointer to locate.\"\n> \n\nIf you turn off \"shake mouse pointer to locate,\" your mouse will no longer get large when you shake it.  Disabling this fixed the graphics freeze for me for the past five days (MBP Late 2016 15'' Inch).  Figured I'd share with y'all.
