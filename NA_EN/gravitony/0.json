Like Riot Girl said, big fan of the ticker. Not sure what your buddy's tech setup is, but a standing ball mic, controlled lighting and an HD webcam would really push him over the edge quality-wise, and moving less in his chair/doing a couple script passes prior to filming would really help him nail that delivery down (not bad per se, just a little distracting).

Excited to see what he does with it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Girl","date":"2015-03-30T19:41:22.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the ticker on the bottom!  \"Wards claimed a cheating device by Bronze players\" <~classic.
