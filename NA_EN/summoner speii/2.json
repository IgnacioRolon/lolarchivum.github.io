EG: aatrox before rework,  gangplank before rework, taric before rework, etc, and they can pick all the different reworks of a champion at will to change their playstyle. Obviously this will be almost impossible to balance, so it should be a new mode, separate from summoner rift ranked system, focusing on off meta builds and having fun. What will fund this massive project? IDK, so this is a crazy idea and probably won't come alive, given how riot removed TT because of its lack of money generation and popularity. I just miss the old days where i could play taric and solo some kids and he wasn't a generic shield bot who was abused for boosting strategies when overstated.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-02T06:22:39.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a staggeringly tremendous amount of work to implement, and players would quickly abandon it due to glaring balance issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-08-02T06:25:38.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"the whole point is it there is no ranked, and it is for players that really miss the days of their champion kit","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FURRY V2","date":"2019-08-02T06:13:19.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mhmm..\nSo, if you want to win and solo carry the whole game, you pick **Xin Zhao** and choose **After release**.\n\nSounds good to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-08-02T06:18:01.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"there is no ranked for that mode, it is a for fun mode, and specific reworks of champions could be nerfed to be in line with other reworks,","replies":[{"poster":"FURRY V2","date":"2019-08-02T06:26:04.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. I want my original **Xin** in the state right after release.\nHe was able to jump after a Kassadin who teleported continuously, knocking people up in every 1,5 seconds and dealing as much damage as a darius ult.\nOh, and had fixed health regeneration after every 3rd hit, cooldown reduction and atk speed bonus.\n\nI do not remember what his ultimate was...
