That in of itself is annoying as crap, but the infuriating thing is that doesn't do that all the time. It's basically a roll of the dice if i'm going to get my usual ping:62ms or the basically unplayable ping that has been plaguing my games as of late. I've tried reconnecting to the game, restarting both the client and my router but nothing works. If it matters my ISP is Shaw. Thanks for any help.","replies":[{"poster":"7oooThresher7","date":"2016-08-17T22:58:50.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue, but I got my ping back when I added League to my Firewall exception. At least it seems to work for now, maybe it might work for you. FYI, my ISP is also Shaw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T21:36:41.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that your network is having trouble maintaining a stable connection, and it could be due to packet loss.
