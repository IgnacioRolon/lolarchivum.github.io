I've had numerous unlucky crashes which cause the game to believe im leaving every one of these games and i sincerely hope i don't eventually get banned for it. This all started with the new client and i've never had these issues before. I want to keep playing, but i don't want to keep crashing and build up higher penalties. I have lowest game quality, but it doesn't seem to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T20:53:30.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks that you got hit with a penalty just because you weren't able to load into the match in time.
