Towerdove me at lv 11 when I was full HP with his JG and both took like 0 damage(I had armor too).\n\n2nd instance of facing Urgot when I played Tristana bot. Just endless poke from him and Sona to the point I was 3 CS/min.\nTry to get 1 CS, lose half HP.\n\nSo who is a good pick into Urgot, especially top lane?","replies":[{"poster":"HeresyHorus","date":"2018-09-15T15:27:24.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:150}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:85}} (AD)\n\nLet no one fools you with other suggestions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlantagenNega","date":"2018-09-15T14:15:36.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar, fiora, darius, vayne","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-09-15T14:07:44.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest thing to do is dodge his Q and make him fight you nearby your minions, so that his W will target them instead. If you have ways to get back to the correct side after he dashes into you, that also helps.\n\nTeemo can be a strong pick top into him, simply because of his Q. Leona is also a strong pick into him, imo, although you *do* have to be good at her, and know how to play her top (My suggestion is W max then catalyst, Bami's, then Sunfire, take Grasp). Quinn is probably fine as well. Avoid Fiora or anyone else who'd jump around him a lot because it's going to just suck ass, because you'll eat shotguns for the entire match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-09-15T14:03:41.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive farming champs, champions who can deny his ultimate, champs with range or champs that outscale.\n\nUrgots biggest asset is forcing engages against melee champs and punishing champions who want to engage.\nThese are champions like {{champion:92}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:59}}. They engage, urgot flips them over into tower or into his wave, slows them and melts them. Urgot is begging for you to fight, because the moment you do, he wins especially lvl3 and after during laning phase.\n\n.\n\n\nSome of these categories will have overlap (eg vlad both farms passively and can counter the ult)\n\n1. Champions who farm passively that urgot struggles to force out of lane: {{champion:41}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:516}} \n\n2. Champions who can deny urgot's ultimate (either by pressing a button while ulted, or making themselves invulnerable so he can't use it): {{champion:8}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:266}} \n\n3. Range: {{champion:13}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:85}} \n4. champs that out scale really hard {{champion:24}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:114}} \n\n5. Bot lane you really want a CC mage support who can obliterate his health bar like {{champion:161}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} instead of a tank (who urgot will melt and punish for using their melee CC like alistar). There isn't much you can do unless you're vayne, kai'sa or varus (hard CC or mixed damage (helps shred beef as he can't itemize properly)\n\nOf course don't assume you can just pick one of them, expecting automatic victory. Tryndamere and olaf by far give me the most trouble. Once they hit level 6 my life is a nightmare as it forces me to hold my ult and I can't use my E on olaf\nAfter that Jax, Teemo and darius are also a pain. As I can't disengage darius and he outscales me from the get go. Jax you will beat in lane if he tries to fight but the moment he buys urgot loses","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-09-15T13:39:49.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
