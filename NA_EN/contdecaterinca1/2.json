His ultimate does have a very low skill floor considering how highly rewarding it is, but usually he has to play well to set up his team in order for him to be able to make good use of it. \n\nI think the rest of your list is accurate, but I'd definitely add Nunu on there. Nunu is likely the best AFK Jungle in the game, all he does is farm stuff and turns into a nearly unkillable tank that gives his team free attack speed, movement speed, crowd control, and near guaranteed objective control when played well. All of that for literally doing nothing but farming in his Jungle until he has a few items. \n\nThe others are pretty busted too in their own right, Nasus gets tons of damage, Karthus is pretty much the same as Nunu (AFK farms into a monster), and Veigar scales no matter how much he feeds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-06-05T10:54:30.499+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean when you write it out like this, any champions seems dumb, watch.

You are totally off topic here buddy, literally attacking my thread with no contribution.\nI said who is rewarded \"the most\", which means there is a degree of reward that other champions don't have, not that you can feed all match and still be rewarded.\n\n> If you die to a 0/10 Garen, you are actually terrible at the game or played so stupidly poorly that he deserves to kill you.\n\nEven if he is super fed or way behind his ULT still does exact same damage. I have managed to get 24 kills streak on Garen once from being down 2-5, my biggest killstreak to date, he is pretty good at coming back from behind.\n \n> Nautilus doesn’t kill people, lol.

But he has such a massive detriment in terms of build possibilities that he just can't make much of it even when he gets kills. \n\nStacking has always been an unreasonable thing to have in a game where the length is determined by the skill of the team as a team, so you've got that on Veigar and Nasus. I think it'd work better if it worked like HoTS, where they had a cap and/or intervals instead of just steady increases in strength. \n\nKarthus just got nerfed really hard, so, not really a problem any more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2019-06-05T11:23:04.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:74}} Plops turrets down and let's the game play the game for him.
