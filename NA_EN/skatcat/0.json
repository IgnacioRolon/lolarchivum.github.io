After reinstalling and force repairing I queued for ranked. After champion select I bug splatted. The client then had to verify the files. That bug splat lead to a remake which caused me to suffer a penalty by reduction of Rank in solo Q. Is there any way to get those points back or am I just out of points due to the bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-20T00:49:25.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we can't adjust LP points without upsetting the balance of the ranking system.

I'm more curious about what action with the file caused the problem. It looked most like it tried to read something and couldn't find it, but without looking closer at the splat log I'll never know.

Is this sort of thing common? Also is there a place for me to look at bug splat logs myself? I know it's probably not my system(memory test passed recently, HDD in good SMART status, SSD Cache is in fine shape) but I'm curious to try and find out if it was some sort of weird interaction with the re-installation of the client and it not confirming hashes only to meet a mismatch when attempting to load or a bad file descriptor.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-20T02:24:00.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could have been a messed up file somewhere that crashed your game when it got pulled. I'd try a quick repair through the client options if you haven't yet, and make sure you do that with admin rights as always.
