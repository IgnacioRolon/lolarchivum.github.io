Which makes sense.  Athenes plus AA basically removed Kog's mana gating, which was what kept AP Kog balanced.  He was used, sometimes he was pretty good, but he was never any more of a dominating force than any other Mage in the game.\n\nThe problem is Riot often seems bent on designing around 'is it fun to lose against' rather than 'is it fun to play'.  This philosophy has lead largely to a lack of hard counters (because getting hard countered is frustrating) and strongly defined niches (because people don't automatically own all champions), which is why we only ever see a dozenish champions spammed all the time.\n\nThe old AP Kog had very clear weaknesses (end the game early, split push, super hard engage) but if your team wasn't set up to deal with him, there was a good chance you were going to lose.  Is that kind of design good?  Or should all champions do more or less the same thing such that only the current 'best' jacks of all trade are picked again and again?  It isn't so much a question of balance as it is a question of game design.\n\nWho's fun is more important?  The person losing because they counter-picked themselves?  Or the person playing the niche champion?  Who should be getting rewarded for good decision making?","replies":[{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2016-09-22T20:11:58.342+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ideally everyone gets to have fun, or at least that's one of Riot's goals. Personally I don't think old AP Kog had enough weaknesses in soloq. His early game was hard to punish because his wave clear out pushed a large amount of mid laners. Then he eventually scaled into a monster that pushed you off of objectives if you couldn't instantly dive him from fog of war and kill him. I hated playing against him, and I'm glad to see him awful. I do like that Riot is trying to make sure that you can always do something in a game, and therefor never get hard countered as I don't want to play a 20-40 minute game in which I do nothing simply because my opponent hard counter picked me after I picked my champ.

AP Kog had ano extremely easy laning phase after level 7 and tear  (wasn't even that bad before that either) since E+R guarenteed casters and you can fairly easily last hit everything else with W (all for like 140 mana tops since W was 0) and he easily got his Rylais and proceeded to permaslow nuke people from off the screen.\n\nThe poke itself wasn't that much of a problem. The problem was Kog was one of the champions in the game that breaks Rylais because it removes any difficulty required to land his ult, if you hit 1 the chances of you hitting more was extremely high since they are slowed by 40% and you have vision.

With her Ult active Vayne out-damages Kog no questions asked.  On paper Kog's W seems crazy powerful, but because it only scales linearly with attack speed it drops off in the late game.  Kog was always at his most powerful once Trinity was finished and started leveling out from there.\n\nHe's not a late game hyper carry.  He's a mid-game carry who doesn't drop off very much in the late game.  So he's stronger in the late game than early bullies, but when compared to the true hyper-carries like Vayne and Twitch he's less successful.
