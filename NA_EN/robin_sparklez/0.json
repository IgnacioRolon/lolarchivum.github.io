In the beginning at fountain I can walk out of that \"wall\" and my champion starts.. i guess.. lag spiking? Moves from one position to another even when im just walking a straight line. It's like a flash.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how I can fix this? This is the first time it's happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T00:16:43.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing some big delays and potentially some *Packet Loss* causing the symptoms you're seeing.
