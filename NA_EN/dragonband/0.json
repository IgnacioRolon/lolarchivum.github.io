Now they won&#039;t refund a penny of all 300 dollars I have spent on my main account. It is Infuriating that I wasted 3 years of my life and 300 dollars out of my own pocket. They won&#039;t even account transfer so now I am stuck with a lvl 7 account with 3 champions 0 skins when my other account was 10 champions away from owning every champion and I had skins like Annie in the Wonderland, Project ekko, Winter Wonder Karma, I got pulsefire ezreal from a box,  I had so much stuff! (Not listing everything I had) And they take it all away just because I wanted to change my skins without buying a skin. And for that reason I now despise riot games. Yet I will continue to play because all my friends play it and I have played it for so long that I can&#039;t stop playing now.","replies":[]}
