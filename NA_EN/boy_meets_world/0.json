Let's think about the impact this has on all players.\n\nFirst, Stonewall is a very capable and skilled player who is more capable than 90% (( and that is being very generous to players))  of Ranked NA. If hes having problems, which are obviously happening, it doesn't matter how much more damage he could of avoided as a pro, 90% of NA players are going to do just as bad or worse.\n\nAnd if you want to look at it as, maybe its just NA who cant handle this, think again. People all over the world are shaking their heads at these mechanics. Even Koreans. And they are Demigods.\n\nNow obviously I'm not going to go into how bad NA is, we all know it. But we have to agree that if the rest of the world is troubled with these changes, chances are  there is a problem and we shouldn't just brush it off as 'oh that footage wasn't the most pro thing I could have seen'\n\nIf it were incredibly pro footage would you have a problem? NO. You would think there is no problem because he breezed through it!\n\nInstead of trying to ignore the problem, Players. Think about it like this. If you're in Gold I or lower, this probably will effect you badly. ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE IN BRONZE AND SILVER OR UNRANKED. \n-\nYou need to actually consider that people are going to find the jungle so undesirable, now that the Jungler is completely alone, very in danger of losing his camps due to enemy invades and unable to even contest them, and if not that, no one will even leash for him in the start because the timers are no longer worth waiting for if you have lane minions to farm.\n\nPre S5 players will lose interest in the position because its difficulty is not what they are used to. New players starting in Season 5 will not be able to utilize it until they hit 30, undoubtedly leading to their whole leveling period being even more toxic than what its like to have a new player. Remember when you took Taric Mid back in your first game of League? Want to see a new player Die to the Razor-Beaks every few minutes and rage quit every time you go to level a smurf?\n\nTeam_Builder is going to be ousted, because no game will ever start because nobody will ever say \"Lets go and play in the jungle, I'm excited to be treated like dirt for not being able to clear my jungle without going back and losing my blue buff because the enemy ADC and support had 3 whole minutes to take it freely before I could even attempt it.'\n-\n\nI'm a fatalist and I see the worst possible outcome in scenarios. I know this when I write all this out. But if you try to blow it off as I'm overreacting you should look really hard at the people around you in your next match and don't try to tell me you don't see how a person could come to this conclusion.\n\nI want Riot to see this and ask themselves, If our Userbase was toxic when the game was fun for every player, how bad are they going to get when a position becomes undesirable?\n\nAnd no, Support was not this kind of Undesirable. NOT BUILDING DAMAGE AND ACTUALLY HELPING YOUR TEAM, 'I DON'T LIKE THIS' says most players, is not the same as I CANT KEEP UP WITH THE OTHER PLAYERS AND MY ABILITY TO EVEN HELP THE TEAM IS GONE 'I DON'T LIKE THIS'\n\nIf you want to reward the act of team invading the jungle, Fine. Go ahead. But aside from the Invade-capable champions who excel at level 1 jungle invades, you have about 60 champions who are getting the crap end of the stick. Just like 4 out of 5 enjoy the game their playing and the 5th guy is like, why is my job so hard, i should become a professional (Opt.) Laner so I can enjoy the game again.\n\nI {{champion:86}} Tee these changes if left unchecked and only slightly modified to still increase the overall difficulty without offering better incentive, Lower ELO (for lack of a better term) players will start to demand Duo top and bot lanes, say screw the jungle, and the overall feel of ranked games will deteriorate into why even bother.  Solo Queue is even more pointless.","replies":[{"poster":"Lardee","date":"2014-12-07T14:47:20.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"koreans are jungling just fine right now. I've been in korea for the past three weeks watching preseason games. anyone complaining about jungling in League of Legends should try jungling in Heroes of Newerth. I mean seriously there is so much spoonfeeding in LoL for junglers its not even funny. There is smite, now smite items as well. runes and masteries to give u that edge and recall. In HoN firstly there is no summoner spells or runes or masteries to help you at all. Jungle camps are ranked with levels and spawn different creeps which means you can never master a perfect jungle route. Pots stop healing you if you get damaged in anyway including self damaging effects. Also camps leave corpses that take 30 seconds to disappear and it prevents the next camp spawn if the corpses remain in the camp. Lastly there is no recall to help you get back to camp. You either dish out money to by a teleport stone which is a one time use or u run your ass back to base. Now be thankful with LoL having such a much easier jungle potential. Also jungling is meant to be challenging.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordPickleton","date":"2014-11-17T05:35:03.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I {{champion:86}} Tee these changes if left unchecked and only slightly modified to still increase the overall difficulty without offering better incentive, Lower ELO (for lack of a better term) players will start to demand Duo top and bot lanes, say screw the jungle, and the overall feel of ranked games will deteriorate into why even bother.

If you're a tank, start with smite-buff on Gromp for the reflective damage. If you're AS/AD, start with Krug's. If you're a mage maybe get a leash and save smite for red buff for the hp restore? I dunno, someone will probably find a good strategy. And then the items on top of that and even the elixirs? Jungle has never been more appealing to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Magnolius","date":"2014-11-23T10:36:22.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I initially agree with this and jumped at the chance to find new strategies, I find the buffs themselves to be lackluster, and don't provide enough effects to enable most junglers to farm more than 2-3 camps without backing, at least until 20+ minutes in.  As I expected, some balance needs to be made but obviously Rito wasn't going to get it right the very first time, not with so many changes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BoxHeadz","date":"2014-10-13T23:49:17.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"your jungling sucks in my opinion... you anticipate on killing them with burn too much and waste your time walking around while they hit you.

Feral Flare and Spectral Wraith which gave stacks were some of the reasons i ever farmed jungle. This might make you think 'hey let's go gank more then\" but then you realize all you have is a jungle item that is only for the jungle so you pretty much gonna only use it for the jungle. which makes sense, but that makes you stay in the jungle longer, barely able to farm like you use to.\n-Stats again.\n-Tanky junglers will take even longer to level up or survive. They'll walk into lane and throw a cc, but then have to leave since they arent going to be tanky enough early game.\n\nSo I guess Riot really wants this to be a late game, where everyone sells the jungle item.","replies":[{"poster":"kiniath","date":"2014-11-22T17:17:52.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the items do give fairly large stat increases the objectives are important enough that a buffed smite will be huge and also they do have a jungle item that stacks just like feral flare did","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boy Meets World","date":"2014-10-11T16:28:05.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just think that only allowing 2 pots is over the top for such strong camps.

On Darius, when he had the execution buff and was fighting chickens he sat there and got pounded on by all of the enemies for 10 or 12 seconds when a 3 AAs on the smaller chickens would have reduced his incoming damage a LOT! There are plenty of other, similar examples for other champion's clears.\n\nStonewall does great work, but he's not a very good multitasker when he's dealing with new stuff. There were a ton of times when he could have used Smite a ton earlier, both to give him his Smite back more quickly at the next buff AND to make sure he takes the mob in question down ASAP. 1 less AA is a BIG deal when you're taking that much damage from jungle creeps. Of course it's easy for me to say that watching a video, I guess, but some of that was painful to watch.\n\nThat said, Nunu and Fiddles are freaking ridiculous compared to all other junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"WhompieWomperson","date":"2014-10-15T15:43:35.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"from what i tested most junglers can hardly survive 3 camps with basic machete now due to the 2 pot start, i tested a clear route that takes the new crab camp but all in all i think the jungle mobs are too strong early and should be tuned back a bit","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoxHeadz","date":"2014-10-13T23:50:48.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"right?

I think there should be a more noticeable difference between how sustain based junglers handle it and non sustain jungles handle it. The first clear should stay hard, unless your entire kit is based around sustain (Trundle, Aatrox, Fiddle) and getting a tier two jungle item shouldn't magically fix you if you don't have sustain. Right now, picking a sustain jungler seems to have no advantage over the others, because you are a brutally punished early, and after first back, EVERYONE can suddenly clear with ease, meaning your strong sustain is redundant.","replies":[{"poster":"SirLapse","date":"2014-10-26T14:42:56.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trundle is punished, however, champions like Fiddle were unaffected and can invade the enemy jungle easily.

Starting at the Krugs or Gromp is extremely good since their Smite skills are very helpful in the jungle. Any camp that gives extra damage or Krugs is the best to start at.\n\nIf you are a tank, Gromp is the best to start at since in majority of cases Tanks won't have fast attack speed and will be benefited a lot from the poison (HUGE Rammus buff btw)\n\nIf you are a spell oriented champion, starting at Red Buff is great for the burn and extra health regen.\n\nIf you are an attack oriented champion, starting at Krugs is the best since an extra stun every 5 basic attacks will help a lot with the early jungle levels.\n\nThe only changes I think should be made is reduce the Smite cool down to 50 seconds and reduce the basic attack damage on select camps (Birds, Wolves). Also, Machete should give reduced damage against monsters again and cost 35 less gold for am extra pot so that champions like Evelynn, Wukong, and Vi can survive in the jungle early.","replies":[]}]}
