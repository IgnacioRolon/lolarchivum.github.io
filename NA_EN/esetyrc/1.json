Also, any idea why no event for these skins? The teaser video with the dragon really hinted and pointed to one, but nothing. Also the lone refers to a wolf, so is Sett part Wolf in the skin? or was that just an expression. You guys have been tight lipped on what animals he is part of.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Weiponpon","date":"2019-12-21T14:15:07.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance we can get a toggle-able wingless option for this skin post 6?
