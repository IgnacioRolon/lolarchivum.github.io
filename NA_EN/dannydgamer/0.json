You only get banned if you leave games a LOT.\n\nWhat does it say when you log in?\n\nBTW, support tickets are the only way to contact riot directly 100% of the time about account bans, but I can probably at least tell you why you are banned if you log in to the client and tell me what it says on the screen that pops up.","replies":[{"poster":"Dannydgamer","date":"2016-09-24T15:42:28.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did not get banned i meant LPQ but still i did not mean to leave the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2016-09-27T04:26:20.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but if you leave enough games (intentionally or not) you need to be punished in some way, otherwise people would leave games all the time.

This is automated by the [Leaver Buster system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) to not only punish intentional leavers, but also to encourage you to fix recurring issues that result in you leaving games; without any kind of penalty you have no motivation to fix the issue.\n\nWhether the leaving is intentional or not it is equally unfair to your team, so do what you can to solve the problem. If you need assistance with a client/connection issue please post on the **Help & Support** board and we'll do what we can to help you solve the problem. If you only rarely leave, then you will only get minor LPQ's or no penalty at all, but if you continue to leave too often the penalties will increase, and Riot will not remove this.\n---\nIf you were actually *account banned* this is different, and you'll want to submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you did not get enough information in your client and email.","replies":[{"poster":"Dannydgamer","date":"2016-09-24T15:41:34.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got LPQ not banned but it did not mean to leave but i understand what u saying","replies":[]}]}]}
