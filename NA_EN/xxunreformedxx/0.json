I recommend running a traceroute log with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to determine where exactly your latency starts becoming problematic. After loading up the application, simply plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After you've let the trace run for 5 or more minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nPlease let me know if you run into any issues with this.","replies":[]}]}
