Whenever I try to log in, a window appears saying that an Unknown error has occurred and a report has been sent to the server. I can't log in and when I do I can't play at all because this error keeps happening, my profile won't load nor the store. Ranked disabled because I dont have enough champs( I have them all), when I get to play, the game is fine with 33 ms and 80-90 fps. So I tried going to the NA server to check out if it was my PC or the EUW server, and it didn't lag at all. It was just fine so I think there's a connection problem between the EUW server and me. What can I do?\n\nEdit: I tried with different accounts and the error keeps happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T22:18:52.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kind of confused about your issue because on one hand you say you get an error logging in, but on another you can't see features of the client.  Can you provide me with some more exact details of any error messages you are seeing, and where/when you're having issues?  Any screenshots can help a lot too.  Let me know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mithrándir","date":"2016-09-12T12:27:56.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the delay, I've got some images of what's going on:\nhttp://imgur.com/qDGGeQc\nhttp://imgur.com/yiRLBz8\nhttp://imgur.com/xCcKwxO\nhttp://imgur.com/ocxySGD\nhttp://imgur.com/SkUa5Wu\nThat window on the logging screen always appears when something doesn't load, after I wait 10-15 minutes I can start a match but the client lags on champion select every 20-30 secs, this doesn't happen on NA server just on EUW.\n\nEdit: Yesterday I didn't have any problems, just a bit of lagg at the first log but then it was fine.

I've always had flawless connection and today tried troubleshooting my internet, restarting my PC, even restarting my router with no results.\nI wonder if it has something to do with Worlds going on and certain updates because my browser and everything else is running smoothly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mithrándir","date":"2016-09-14T09:42:12.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is still here, but now I know that after 00:00 the client doesn't lag.
