I understand that they drop randomly but its been a while since ive gotten a key fragment. I know the drop rates are probably low but how are u goin to have chest but not have keys to open them. It makes me feel bad because i was hyped about the whole hextech feature but i can&#039;t even enjoy it because i cant even open up a chest.

Honestly I'd guess the hextech crafting was introduced to incentivize spending more money, so either chests or keys have to be kinda rare.
