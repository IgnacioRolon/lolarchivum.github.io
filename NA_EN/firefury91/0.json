Like suuuure there is a lot of people requesting account un bans, but cant riot stop being a cheep skate and actually get a proper support team who can handle this????? Riot doesn't care about this person, the're just like... thanks for the money, now go and create yourself another account and buy the skins again... it seems like they try to squeeze every last dollar from the community, AND THEY GET AWAY WITH IT. people don't realized how much money people lose because of this, and i hope they realized there are hackers out there. they are just so cheap that they cant hire a support team to deal with ban appeals, and EVERYONE knows riot is a multi-million dollar company. this needs to be stopped!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T02:44:55.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we can find proof that the punishment was applied while your account was compromised, that's absolutely something we can look into.
