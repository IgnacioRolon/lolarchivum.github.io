I personally don't care if it gets nerfed or not but remember this is riot. We all know how they resolve issues of same item spam in 100% of cases.\n\nAlso no nerfing lethality isn't going to make tabi disappear as there is always going to be at least 2 champions whose primary damage function is auto attacking in a match and in general everyone auto attacks.

If you run a triple ad comp, people start building tabi.  They are a counter to the current meta, and those who don't percieve this scream 'OP'.  Sadly, their prevalence contributes to the perception of adc weakness, but no tank or bruiser wants merc treads when up against zed mid, graves jungle and fiora top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-03-16T22:01:05.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"the only thing I think should be nerfed is 5 armor [back to what it was] it's counterpart being mercs are strong at what they do, so should tabis. put both at 25 res, and let the uniques be strong.","replies":[{"poster":"doodlebob666","date":"2017-03-16T22:03:58.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i disagree with that since there is less mr in general because their are less  penetration options and 5 armor being removed would be a massive buff to lethality users since that means that ad champs have a weaker response to them stacking lethality before grabbing a tank item or ga late in their build\n\nedit: some math if ignoring lethality runes\nmasteries will give you 6 lethality+15 from edge of night+15 from yuommus gives 36 lethality and 22.4 armor pen at level 1 which would negate the armor from tabi's almost completely, but this would be it doing its job since now you have your base armor left. but at this point in the game you would probably be around level 9-11 and at level 11 you would be ignoring 30.4 armor, overshooting the new tabi's and cutting slightly into the base armor of the target, considering how powerful the movement speed and the spell shield from these two items are and the 120 ad you get from it being able to cut even slightly into an adc's base armor instead of only ignoring bonus armor is a large buff to the likes of jayce and jhin since there poke now hits harder and over time it will add up alot","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-03-16T22:08:43.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You typically don't need as much MR to make it effective even with void staff being around the way it is.
