On paper she has a lot of damage for an all in but in practice it means she has to take far more risks to deal her damage that other ADC's can deal without having to suicidally dive the enemy team.

Until level 16, which again, barely ever happens for a marksman, you could have picked Caitlyn and gotten more range than Tristana while also having a better lanning phase.

Tristana's W and Caitlyn's E both apply a slow, they both deal damage, and they are both a dash. Tristana's W requires her to jump ONTO an enemy to deal the damage and apply the slow which puts her within their range of power just as much as her own so you have to either choose to use it to escape someone or use it to deal damage. Caitlyn's E on the other hand moves her away from her enemy and fires a skillshot that slows, putting her into a safe position, and deals its own damage and procs her passive so she can hit them with an auto for a large amount of damage.\n\nCaitlyn's E has all the benefits of Tristana's W without the drawbacks, it makes her safe but it doesn't sacrifice her damage while doing so and the damage doesn't require her to do one of the worst things a marksman can do which is go out of position.","replies":[{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2017-05-31T00:02:12.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpecterVonBaren,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RHATwHNy,comment-id=000c000200000000,timestamp=2017-05-30T22:39:30.308+0000)\n>\n> Her &quot;long range&quot; only ever gets higher than Caitlyn&#x27;s at level 16, most games end before an ADC gets to level 16 and long range doesn&#x27;t mean anything if you don&#x27;t have the damage to go with it, her AS steroid hurts her more than it helps her because her base AS has been made so low in compensation for it so she has brief moments of having high attack speed only for her to lose it all when her Q goes on cd.\n\nShe has a decently long range and plenty of damage; yes, her CD on her Q does gate her damage but she still does a decent amount without it as with a Runaan's, BoRK, and Greaves at level 14 her AS hovers(without Q) at 1.56. This is running a rune page with 16% AS, which is at least my standard Tristana page. :/ If you run triple crit instead and go Runaan's and PD, the AS is 1.69 which is still not awful. Her Q nearly sets her at the Cap at level 14 and completely maxed out. Cait running the same Triple Crit set up and the same Runes(which I usually wouldn't run on Cait TBH), only has 1.70 AS. There's literally only .01 difference at level 14 between the two. And then Trist activates Q and actually gets a massive buff.\n\n> Her E does damage, not good damage but it does damage, and nothing about it is all that high nor is it a good teamfight skill, it&#x27;s actually a god awful teamfight skill because someone with her E on them can just rotate out of her range and she can&#x27;t chase them because she&#x27;ll end up running into their team, if she is forced to switch targets then she loses her main source of damage.

If Tristana jumps from someone she&#x27;s now safe but she also has no retaliation, if she ults them then she&#x27;s not only pushing them out of her face but away from herself and her allies attacking them.\n\nHer E isn't intended as a teamfight tool in the first place. Its there for trades in lane and later as a tool to assassinate some squishy too stupid to have warded or be with their team. Its a burst tool for 1v1's and while it can be useful if the enemy team engages and/or is CC'd in teamfights, Tristana's main source of teamfighting power comes from her Q, Hop, and Ult. And while her self peel gets her away and out her own AA range, 9 times out of 10 if she's been hard engaged on, she can't be that close anymore anyway; she's squishy like any other ADC and if someone is already on top of her, its probably too late. So sure, while Jinx's E *could* allow her to AA them for a few more seconds, if she's getting dove it doesn't matter. She's probably already dead because that E isn't very good for peel in general. :/ Its acts like a bigger Caitlyn trap really. Instead, what Tristana's W and Ult provide instead is a way to stall things out. She can hop away or ult them away and then actually live long enough maybe for her to support or the tank to come in and CC the threat for her. At that point, she can just walk back in and continue to deal damage which is what I often times will use my Jump and Ult for instead.\n\n\n> Vayne&#x27;s Q and Lucian&#x27;s E are infinitely superior to Tristana&#x27;s W, having low cd short ranged dashes means you can reposition yourself over and over again while still being able to deal damage back and allows you to dodge multiple abilities throughout a fight.

Her ult pushes someone off her but it also pushes them away from her team so they can&#x27;t follow up and CC or damage them.\n> \n\nBoth Vayne and Lucian have short range so their dashes *should* be short CDs. And Lucian's is actually *not* all that short. Lucian's dash actively rewards him for kiting back with it by getting a lower CD the more times he procs his passive. Its not actually a short CD. Vayne's tumble is honestly, too free a spell in my opinion and needs a longer CD when you consider it can also give her stealth. Vayne is also extremely easy to dive and CC and also has a knock back, like Tristana's, that could be considered counter intuitive. Also, 9 times out of ten, if a Tristana is ulting someone away, they were probably already coming at her from an angle in which her team couldn't react and that would have probably honestly gib'd any ADC less mobile than her. :/\n\n> Potential is all it is.

I feel like that's what's wrong with ADCs right now is that they are \"bursting\" when they should be \"DPSing.\" That is what Tristana does and she never has to suicidally *dive* the enemy team to do it. Only stupid, bad Tristana's EVER use their jump offensively in teamfights; why in the hell would you *ever* jump forward into a team?! This applies to not only Tristana but to Lucian and Vayne as well. Why the *hell* would you ever aggressively dash or jump or tumble into the enemy team? A Tristana who is good saves her jump to get her out of trouble in teamfights; not to leap in and *find* it. Anyone doing that on Tristana is an idiot.\n\n> How does that make my statement factually incorrect?

Tristana takes so long to get high range that by the time she does it isn&#x27;t a factor in how the game will go because that has already been decided long beforehand.\n> \n\nI get level 16 fairly regularly on Marksmen. After laning ends, when there isn't a teamfight, the ADC should honestly be in the side lanes solo catching waves which will make them catch up and level fairly quickly. Just for proof, here are a handful of games I got level 16 and up in just in the last few days: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2510926561/228066420?tab=overview\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2512394937/228066420?tab=overview\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2512191203/228066420?tab=overview\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2511967136/228066420?tab=overview\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2510926561/228066420?tab=overview\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2509895871/228066420?tab=overview\n\nI'll agree that her passive should give her more range per level but saying that it barely ever happens that an AD gets level 16 in a game is bullshit. \n\n> Give me an argument for that, not just your opinion, explain to me how Tristana&#x27;s kit is better than Caitlyn&#x27;s in an actual situation.\n> \n> Tristana&#x27;s W is far far worse than Caitlyn&#x27;s E.

Cait's net is short ranged and very poorly designed as an *actual* means of escape which is why most Caits don't actually use the net as a means to escape but instead as an option to do more damage. :/ So many Caits in lane or in teamfights, use Net specifically to pull off the Net into Q into Headshot. Furthermore, the net wouldn't even viably provide her with extra damage because it gives Caitlyn increased range. Meaning they took an ability that originally was intended as an escape mechanism and turned it into an extra damage source. Caitlyn's net is actually a terrible safety and self peel tool that, sure, keeps her in range to continue doing damage(for one AA), but it also keeps her in range of still being blown up and it also has a fairly long CD. Tristana can out put shittons of damage with her high range right up until the last second and the hop away. If she's being chased, the enemy will naturally come back into her AA range, allowing her to continue DPSing. I often times will hold my jump so that I can stand close enough to continue to do damage and the jump away right as they're about to get on top of me. :/ \n\nIn all honesty, however, comparing Cait and Tristana are like comparing Apples to Oranges. Cait's not *meant* to be carrying late game; she's meant to be falling off and originally was intended as an ADC who did well in lane, had a meh sort of mid game and wasn't supposed to continue scaling massively well into the late game. Cait is currently not even in *her* right role, which is why she's being nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2017-05-31T19:36:27.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love you <3","replies":[{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2017-05-31T20:35:39.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tobias Brackner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RHATwHNy,comment-id=000c00020000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-31T19:36:27.540+0000)\n>\n> I love you &lt;3\n\n<3 Glad I could step in and get solid points across about how Caitlyn is *flatly* not better than Tristana and performs a completely separate niche.

Another problem of Tristana's is she relies fairly heavily on her support for laning phase; she can't easily make plays in lane because she doesn't have any effective means of poking. Her AA range is still shorter than Caits, Lucian's Q can hit her through minions and, honestly, outside of her AA range, and Draven's AA's hit far harder than hers ever could early game. With Cait, she requires a support who will be aggressive with her so that she doesn't get focused down; probably a Karma or, hell, even a Sona or Zyra if there isn't a Thresh or Blitz with the Cait. With Lucian, she has to dodge the Q and stay out of his dash range; basically, to take trades with Lucian, you have to watch his CDs. With Draven... there's honestly very little she *can* do. He does more damage than her so taking trades is a TERRIBLE idea. If she has an aggressive, poke heavy support that can wittle the Draven down so she has a health/pot advantage, then maybe, but 9 times out of 10, on equal skill and at level 1, Draven wins all trades just due to how much damage he has. That being said, if she can survive against any of these three and not fall *too* far behind, she does out scale them later.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2017-06-01T17:28:12.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah Lucian and Draven are going to be rough but I feel she has the tools to turn a small mistake on their part into a huge trade for her favor although this will want a really good support at her side.\n\nW/ Caitlyn I feel that W E Q will win the lane for Tristana, especially if you dodge the net.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TEA Nietzsche ","date":"2017-05-30T09:03:31.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, she has great self-peel capabilities.

At level 18, Tristana has the highest range of any AD, Jinx, Kog, and Cait all included. She also has a very clear defined niche to me; she is the safest and best self peeling hyper carry. She has fine DPS in teamfights and her reset is way more useful than Jinx's for chasing people into a losing teamfight and she has way more mobility than Jinx could ever dream of. There was a time, before they continued to flood the meta with hyper carries to take her spot, that she was *the* best hyper carry that could exist.\n\nAnd as a Tristana Main, I *want* her to stay as a hyper carry. :/ To me, her identity has *always* been super safe, long ranged late game ADC; the tower taking bullshit is honestly secondary and I have no interest in her being turned into a tower taking bot. Honestly, I would like to see her E changed all together as its extremely clunky and less reliable than her original E was for damage. It helps her take towers which is cool and all but there are others that do it better and already have that niche(Jinx and Ziggs).\n\nI would like them to change her E and put more emphasis on her jump and ult. Shift more of her power budget into her Jump and ult to emphasize the fact that she *is* the safest hyper carry late game and maybe change her Q so its less CD reliant. Maybe make it something like Kled's Violent Tendencies on steroids or something because a lot of her issues are that her power, as an AA late game ADC, is tied up in long, lengthy CDs; if her Q is down, she loses TONS of trade potential and unless she gets an assist or kill, she has to be careful about engaging with her W as its also long. Her E also has a very long CD and honestly, I feel, holds too much of her power. \n\nI *do not* want to see her turned into a siege bot.
