However, nobody plays him because he requires a lot of items... and has a non-existant early and mid game. Such a game mode would allow AP Varus to actually shine. Apart from AP Varus, there are also other champions which take a while to scale... such as AD bruiser Fizz, tank Akali, AP Ezreal, Aurelion Sol, Tristana... A game mode like this would allow those champions and builds to finally shine","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2016-05-27T02:18:38.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not use logic, people will be upset.\n\nEveryone thinks that they are a trend setter","replies":[{"poster":"Nvseib","date":"2016-05-27T02:20:55.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"its not logically for elo hell players trying new builds in rank but they still do, this can reduce that threat for serious gamers","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2016-05-27T04:22:59.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not really, cause they are going ot see an end result that has partial success but not be able to replicate it in a real game.

Your build will never function anyways but the player will have proof of end game concept.\n\nHell max builds are very rarely reached in the silver through plat range. The games are usually way one sided to worry about that far.
