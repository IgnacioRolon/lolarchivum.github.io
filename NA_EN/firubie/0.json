When I then try to change my password in the settings they send me these 6 numbers per mail. I type them in correctly but they always tell me \"Service Unavailable\". It's not my computer because I can still log into the game with other accounts. I have no idea what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-08T18:39:19.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you make sure that you were logging into the right Region?
