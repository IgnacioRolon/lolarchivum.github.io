For the past 4-5 months, I've been really sick...so a buddy of mine asked me if he could use my account to duo with his friend. Being the idiot I was, I let him log on and play not thinking of the consequences. Turns out, while he was playing with his friend, he had activated 3rd party scripts.\r\n\r\nThus, we are here today, with a permanent banned account for something I did not do. Was it my fault for letting him on my account? Yes. Should I receive a ban for account sharing? Definitely, seeing as how this must of created a negative experience for other players. But do I really deserve a permanent ban for something I did not do?\r\n\r\nI contacted Riot support about this telling them the summoner name of the person who was on the account, and to even check IP addresses, yet he still runs free on his main account elo boosting and scripting while I am perma banned.\r\n\r\nI've been a supporter of Riot for 5 years. With a clean ban history, and the amount of time I put into this account, I don't think a permanent ban is justified. Please if any Riot staff member could help me out... I really enjoyed playing this game..","replies":[{"poster":"Kat  Head","date":"2015-10-20T02:03:36.281+0000","up_votes":83,"down_votes":3,"body":"Very sad, you know you broke the rules though.

You sharing your account, as in giving consent for your friend to use your account, gave your friend access to your account where they clearly used the chance to do what they wanted. \n\nRiot does not allow a lot of 3rd-party things, your friend used some of these \"not-okay\" 3rd-party techno-ma-programa-wuts. \n\nI imagine having a punishment for just one of the two might have been a lot less severe. Because your friend,  while **_having consent_** to use **_your account,_** used what he used, you managed to break two or more of the games rules at once because you are not only responsible for your account but trusted your friend to be responsible with your account.\n\nIf you do decide to start the game over add me; I'll be more than happy to play with you because I'll need somebody to celebrate the Harrowing with.
