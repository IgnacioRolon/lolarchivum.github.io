While he is permaban for me, I wouldn't like to discuss him in this thread, instead I would like to discuss your opinions regarding the current support meta as a whole. So as the title said: this said problem started earlier than his release. How so? It is simple.\n\n**The invasion of midlane mages on the support role**\nThat's right, even prior his release, there were \"supports\", who were extremely problematic: {{champion:99}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:25}} etc.. We liked to pretend that they weren't that bad, but they were. The issue is: they are even more so problematic to balance, because if you balance them around at support role, they become weaker on midlane, if you balance them around midlane, then they become too strong as support. Just remember {{champion:25}} . She is still an unhealthy support and will always be, because her Q is way too forgiving and she can poke with her W. When Riot decided to hit her W, so she could become less oppressive on botlane, then midlane {{champion:25}} mains started crying, that she as midlane shouldn't be killed off. I don't remember exactly what happened to her W nerf since then, but it showed that you can't balance champions around both mid and support. We also should remember, that mages in support role were supposed to be in the \"tolerated\" category, not the \"encouraged\" category, because they were supposed to be the inferior choice. {{champion:555}} is just this phenomenon taken to another level: a lot of people desired an assassin support and we have got one, so Riot only fulfilled something everyone desired. It's just another example of the \"Be careful what you wish for, because you might get it\". And we got it. :D\n\n**Nerfing ADCs and Enchanters/Supports, letting the mages run amuck**\nI still remember that a few years ago botlane was 1:1 = ADC:Support, when it came to efficiancy. Then last year (or was it 2 years now? I don't remember exactly) Riot decided to nerf every ADC. While their decrease of damage could have been a good thing, but in reality what really happened is a damage shift from the ADC to the \"support mages\". ADCs just become a farming supports for the mages, so they can spend their mana on poking and don't need to farm. {{item:3303}} ftw.\n\n**{{champion:223}} problem**\n... is basically when you want to enforce an unhealthy pick for toplane, but in the process you nerf his intended role to be really situational, but after a while you just nerf that unhealthy pick, and you end up with both roles gutted.\n\nIn conclusion: {{champion:555}} is just a new level of a problem, which has been a problem for a few years now and everyone ought to reconsider what a support really is, because this can get worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2019-08-27T17:25:00.184+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":3,"body":"The problem is that champs like Zyra and Brand became supports because their lack of mobility forced them out of midlane and their CC let them function as supports.

Her healing is stronger the lower the health the target has, and not by some small value. The increase is over 100%. I usually keep one charge strictly for saving on low health, and use the other for sustain. However her passive gives her the mana required to keep the ADC sustained.

How a Morgana, Lux, or Brand protects the ADC, that is being jumped by a Zed, or Rengar? The answer is: can't. Best they can do is to try kill the assassin once all-in out.

And their damage output is high enough that junglers would rather abandon that lane if their ally team can't follow up.\n\ntldr they are like yasuo's stupid strong in lane garbage when not, but they have no reason to leave.\np.s forgot they changed brands ult to prioritize champions when bouncing same with zyra's plants.

You said it clearly: there is no such a thing as \"mages being pushed out of midlaner by evil X\" (whatever X is). That may be a delusion in one's head, but nothing more than that.\n\nIn fact, Lux has been regularly played Mid at basically all ranks (except Pro-Play). And Lux Support was already a thing well-before the changes to Enchanters. Mages became good supports because being a support became equal to being hyper-oppressive and poke/kill enemy laners, aka, \"assassin-like\".\n\nP.S.

I will avoid stating \"in my humble opinion\" (IMHO) at every sentence for brevity. Relatively little of what I have written applies outside of SoloQ.\nPyke is the symptom of a bigger underlying problem, which was lurking behind the scenes since around Season 5/6.\n\nThe main actors of this problem are:\n1. Gold-income and aggresion-rewarding;\n2. Junglers;\n3. Vision-related items (Sightstone vs. wards inside the main support items)\n4. Auto-fill (back when getting autofilled was the same as going support unwillingly)\n5. Direct and indirect nerfs to enchanters\n6. Player Agency and perception of power\n\nThis is nothing less than Pandora's Box. Let's open it.\n\n1. **Gold-income and aggresion-rewarding**. No surprises here: you can't have Brand/Lux/whatever support without items. An aggressive play-style was also more fun to watch than a \"passive\" lane (e.g., Soraka), so the slow degrade of these lanes started. Poke-oriented lanes started to emerge as a safer alternative to Kill Lanes, which were often a bit too binary (binary = win hard or lose hard).\n\n2. **Junglers** became part of the equation for several reasons: dragons become really crucial to take early so ganking bot was a good option, most mid-laners (especially assassins) could roam really well, poke-oriented lanes were blurring into Kill-territory (one good Lux Q or Zyra E and it's basically the same as a Blitz Q), botlaners were rarely at 100% hp, abusing botlane, if successful, was a macro-play with no real answer (in most cases), and, later on, tower plating gold. Thus, the infamous \"clown-fiesta\" was actually a smart move to make.\n\n3. **Vision**. When the map was lit like a Christmas tree, botlane could at least anticipate and prevent such stupidly powerful dives with stupidly-high rewards. So, nerf vision multiple times, until they can't anymore. There was a time in Pro-Play where even the slightest sign of continued aggression was almost immediately responded by TP from both toplaners (this was before the CD nerf to Teleport).\n\n4. **Auto-fill** also comes without surprises. Why bother playing {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:16}} when {{champion:63}} {{champion:99}} , hell even {{champion:90}} (for a certain time), worked ? And also were a lot more effective than the off-meta picks they looked like at first glance.\n\n5. {{item:3504}} this item sealed the deal. It was (rightfully) nerfed and most enchanters were nerfed alongside it. Remember, no one likes 10-15 minutes of farming in botlane. We need action, blood, kills. That's what everybody wanted. Indirectly, this created yet another reason for playing Brand/Lux/... supports.\n\n6. Finally, we arrive to where we stand now, when **Player Agency** is at its minimum (or barely above that). Sure, you can still play Janna perfectly, but one mistake in your ADC positioning, a Jungler gank at the wrong time and... boom! He is dead. You may also die trying desperately to save him, or be rational and at least not give them another free kill (though that may get you flamed by bad players). Now, let's try it with {{champion:555}} . Suppose you play Pyke perfectly. They are all dead. You take gold, also your ADC earns gold. The chances for a successful snowball (if you have a competent jungler and the other lanes aren't getting destroyed) rise dramatically. At the very least, you can say that \"I did my job\". You may still lose the game, but you still feel that you had more \"power\" in your hands, more agency. Playing Pyke was rewarded by enemy deaths, an immediate reward. And you get better at killing them as a result. Which feels even better. And the Perception distortion is now online.\n\nThe enemy support, let's say it was Nami, starts thinking: \"wait, I played Nami so good for 90% of the time, poked them good, healed my ADC, etc.... yet one mistake (less than 0.1% of the laning time) led to disaster and now Pyke is killing everyone! Why I never was able to kill anything even if I got fed. You know what? F**k that, Brand/Lux/Pyke/... next game. At least I can kill the enemy carry and make a difference\". And the circle is closed.\n\nYes, there are several exceptions to this last point, I am not claiming it is the thought-process of most support mains, by no means I am suggesting that. But it is certainly not unrealistic, especially when we have seen a shift (although for different reasons), including in pro-play, from Janna/Lulu to Pyke/whatever. The shift is real because the underlying motivations are real: burst/assassin-like champions are simply becoming more and more effective at the support's job, which, in the damage meta (or whatever it is called), is simply \"kill before you get killed\".\n\nThis was the underlying problem all-along: the support's job got reduced to \"kill enemy botlane faster than they can kill you\". This is disgusting. A Soraka-Vayne lane goal was just surviving and letting Vayne farm. \"Winning lane\", in that case, was having good CS and not dying. That's it. Now it doesn't matter, it's just \"kill them\". So, Soraka got replaced by Brand/Lux/Pyke/etc. (and Vayne got replaced by Kai'Sa, but that's another story).\n\nOn a final note.\n\nI am (was) a support main. Back in the days of S4/early S5, my mains were Sona, Janna and Morgana. I also liked Braum a lot. Now, if I want to play support (which doesn't happen often), I rarely pick something outside of Brand/Lux/Pyke/etc (I started doing so well before they were considered \"meta\"), or the occasional \"old-school\" Kill Lanes (Blitz, Leona). {{champion:350}} is the only exception, and will stay so as long as she stays significantly over-tuned. I am deeply unsatisfied with what the \"support role\" has become over the years (there is no more support role anymore, strictly speaking).\n\nI don't know if Pyke was the result of \"true\" Supports (like Sona, Janna, Nami, ...) not getting recognized for their _awesome_ plays. After all, they are not that flashy as the best montages of Zed/Yasuo/almost-any-champion-really. But I think that, in the old days, Janna (I'm sorry to always use her as an example, but bear with me) was over-tuned precisely because you were putting all your agency inside another player hands. And that's why some players wanted that agency back. And all the rest followed.\n\nYou may hate {{champion:555}} , but what the true supports (I don't count myself anymore as a \"true\" support main) endured in these years was far worse than anything Pyke could do. That's why I don't hate him (and also why you shouldn't hate him): I hate what led to him as the \"solution\" to the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2019-08-29T20:47:31.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Yes, there are several exceptions to this last point, I am not claiming it is the thought-process of most support mains, by no means I am suggesting that.
