People have the tendency to pick new champions in Ranked, champions which most of the playerbase haven't even figured out yet; nobody really knows how to build or play with them, their strengths and weaknesses, and the problem is that your teammates don't know either how to prepare. Those other issues you mentioned are indeed problematic, but nothing can be done about that.
