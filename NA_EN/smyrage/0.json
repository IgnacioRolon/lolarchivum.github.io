It's not \"bad\" and they won't \"punish\" people for it, but they will lock the account and tell the player to stop it, only unlocking the account when the player agrees to change their behavior. And if they keep being disruptive, they get an actual punishment.\n\nSo, like I said, if someone knows that the team isn't okay with it and just does whatever they want because they couldn't care less about the people they got matched with and Riot doesn't punish off-meta picks, they actually will get punished. If they're somehow unaware of the trouble they're causing (only a few cases a year), they get this \"not a punishment\" lock and lecture.\n\nI'd say that what I said is still accurate, but lacking mention of this extra procedure for the tiny category of clueless meta-breakers.

I think it's important to caution that while the former is achievable through communication and teamwork, the latter is still very much punishable. It's all too common for people to troll with unviable picks but otherwise normal play and then attempt to wriggle out of a punishment with \"I'm just playing to win differently.\" I'm not sure how this analogy will pan out, but I love analogies, so think of it like drinking during Prohibition.

I disagree heavily with the scaremonger tactics you are employing to achieve this. Whether something is acceptable play or griefing is not defined by your team's consent.\n\nUsing your analogy:\nI acknowledge that you may be trying to make people aware of the laws of prohibition, even including the exceptions **and** including that you can't just pretend to be among the exceptions and expect to be spared.\nThe problem is that rather than sticking to the actual laws (as ambiguous as they may be) you are trying to pass off your **own** definition of \"religious use\" as the actual rule, which makes the prohibition seem much stricter than it actually is.\n\nAs a result you are no longer actually raising awareness of the law, as much as you are scaremongering people into the behaviour that **you** think should be considered acceptable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2020-01-23T10:08:25.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Do you think the non-communicative player will be like \"nah I'm gonna keep doing what I want\" and the Rioter will be like \"okay, we'll unlock your account and not bother you again\"?

Why would they use that word?\n\n>If it wasn't, Riot would comb through thousands of reports to find a few players who need a special procedure of locking their account and getting a lecture from Riot on how to behave.\n\nThey're combing through reports as is. You're acting as if they are specifically trying to find these players, when they're really just doing manual reviews, especially if people have an unusual amount of reports. They're not actively trying to find these players, they're trying to find trolls and other players that slip through the cracks of the system.\n\n>It's special-cased because they don't want such players to be pushed onto the road to a permaban. \n\nThat doesn't explain the specific policy, since those players are only caught by manual reviews and, as a result, manual punishments. I know from certain cases from the forums that manual punishment also allows manually setting the next escalation step. They could easily stick to issuing 14 day bans, but they deliberately chose not to do that.\n\n>But if the behavior doesn't improve, I don't see why the lock and lecture wouldn't repeat. \n\nBecause, again, the policy is about making player aware of the problem.

I don't care what a professional team did, because Solo Q Ranked =/= pro-scene\n\nYou also amuse me that you defend such players, yet you same people come here to tell Riot that their matchmaking is bad, because you got such players in some matches. You get such players, because you don't want stricter rules. Also Ranked is played, because players would prefer more serious matches, not to play with players, who want to try out idiotic, fundamentally broken picks. That's what Normal is for or play Ranked Flex with 4 others in a premade, who is going to tolerate such. If you don't aim to win, then play Blind Pick, but personally I enjoy the more serious toned matches where the aim is to win. I don't like playing matches with people, who don't even try from the beginning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2020-01-22T00:24:59.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if off meta becomes punishable then so too will meta. one cannot exist without the other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-01-21T23:45:47.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they enforce a meta just out of boredom and curiosity.
