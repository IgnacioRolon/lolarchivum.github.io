Why? Well, we all have our bad games, I&#039;m a grown up and can take responsibility, but let&#039;s discuss how this game requires 5 people (sometimes 4) to win a game. As a player with nearly 2000 games played I can offer advice to other players on what tactics to use to win a game or battle. But, how do most players receive that advice? Every once in a while you get the, &quot;thanks for that, sounds good let&#039;s try it,&quot; but mostly you get, &quot;KYS&quot;, &quot;STFU UR TRASH&quot;, etc.\r\n\r\nReporting these players is fine, but that doesnt save your league points or advancement possibility.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s not even get into those who just troll, whether a jinx jungle or shaco adc or veigar top. Yesterday I had a jungle veigar.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I could understand being matched up with these players in solo/duo queue if I were less than 50 games into the ranked league. But I have over 150 wins, have been to silver 5 and bronze 1 multiple times and back down. Shouldn&#039;t I be playing with some more experienced players?\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my solution. If RIOT were to add more divisions below bronze, like iron, steel, wood, etc., then the inexperienced, bad players, and trolls would occupy a lower division and allow other players to move up into higher ELO.\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t mind queuing for longer times to play with players of similar experience. I look through my ranked divisions and see that there are players with over 300 wins in bronze 5. They shouldn&#039;t be there. Maybe once you reach a certain number of wins you get locked at a level which you cant fall below for that season.\r\n\r\nIt just seems that it&#039;s nearly impossible to rise out of bronze and silver with the volume of trolls and players who refuse to work as a team or accept advice from more experienced players this season.\r\n\r\nThanks for hearing me out.\r\n\r\nBruno\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-06-09T13:38:13.348+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can assure you that \"trolls\" aren't the reason you're stuck in Bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"CorporalBruno","date":"2017-06-09T13:52:08.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You yourself even have commented before on the no difference feel between ranked divisions.

If I was concidered to be one of the worst players of the entire game not able to climb out of the lowest division and then someone who thinks he is better than me even though he probably isn't starts telling me what to do I wouldn't be happy either. No wonder you get negative responses\n\n>  but mostly you get, \"KYS\", \"STFU UR TRASH\", etc.\n\nWhich will never change. People don't lose their toxicity once they reach a certain division.\n\n> Reporting these players is fine, but that doesnt save your league points or advancement possibility.\n\nImagine this for a second. The next game you play will have a troll, afk or feeder. There is a 4/9 chance he will be on your team and a 5/9 chance he will be on the enemy team.\nTherefore, if you manage to play consistently and have a good attitude, you'd climb BECAUSE of trolls, feeders and leavers. \nIf we could look at all the games which were decided by things like that, you would probably have won more LP than you lost.\n\n> Shouldn't I be playing with some more experienced players?\n\nIf atm you play like someone in Bronze 5, no. There are a lot of very experienced and also very bad players in Bronze 5 ... you included. You are not good at the game if you lose more games than you win, especially not against the worst players of the game\n\n> It just seems that it's nearly impossible to rise out of bronze and silver with the volume of trolls and players who refuse to work as a team or accept advice from more experienced players this season.\n\nI already mentioned that. If every single game had 1 troll, you would statistically win more than you lost, concidering you're not the troll.\n\nThe reason you're stuck in Bronze 5 is not because of trolls, flamers or people leaving games. There is only one single reason: You're bad at the game. If you want to improve yourself, complaining about teams and the ranked system won't help you at all. \n\nIt's time to L2P  ... and I don't mean this ironically","replies":[{"poster":"CorporalBruno","date":"2017-06-09T14:05:38.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"While I appreciate that you took the time to tell me the problem is me, I have admitted in my post that sometimes I have a bad game.\n\nLet me give you an example.\n\nMonday of last week I made it to bronze 2. In that same day (im a disabled combat veteran so I play video games all day while my kids are at school), I played 8 games and lost 8 due to afk, trolls or feeders who wouldnt work as a team. Each game I played really well and was happy with my performance. At the end of the day I was back in bronze 4. \n\nI will continue to learn to play, and I watch videos and read guides. I watch the pros play consistently. The troll/bad player ratio is much higher than one per game. Its more like 2 - 3 per game. \n\nI wouldn't care if there were no trolls/bad players on the other team. I would enjoy a well balanced fight of equal ELO. Its no fun to win when the other team receives one of these players either.\n\nHoping the new honor system also adjusts who they get matched up to play with. Higher honor players playing together in matchmaking and lower honor players playing with each other.\n\nAlso, you seem to say similar things in posts to others. Even though you've never played with them or me, you still lay the blame on us.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/20fb29fe5140e401a0bac188d08472be\n\nPlayers like myself are willing to reach out and explain our experiences in the forums to the developers as to hope to spark some sort of revolution of gameplay. I guess we could just get bored of being matched up with these players, grinding for days on end to reach a higher ELO, just to be slammed back to bronze 5 and just quit playing the game. This would just leave the bad players and the trolls to play with each other while the more responsible players go play something else.\n\nFrustrated with my teammates is the story I'm telling. Whether they be bad or bad on purpose, I'm ready to play with some like minded people.\n\nGood day.","replies":[{"poster":"Coopa123","date":"2017-06-09T14:47:06.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Also, you seem to say similar things in posts to others.

That's simply a fact. Of course you can blame everyone but yourself to make yourself feel better, but the fact that you're the only one responsible for your ELO is still true","replies":[{"poster":"CorporalBruno","date":"2017-06-09T15:13:24.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did say I have bad games.
