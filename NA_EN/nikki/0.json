I do my best every game, ive played all day nonstop for the last week or 3 and ive been trying my best to climb my rank, now im freaking banned for 14 days because of people that TROLLED ME, and not the other way around? Your automation system is obviously not picking up on anything right, Lucian was literally AFK for over 12 minutes, and you flag me as being a troll???

While banning a teammate hover is completely legal and not punishable whatsoever, what do you expect when you banned what could be someone's comfort champ he wanted to bring into a role he is not comfortable with (autofill)?
