If you really want a casual experiece just play normal games with friends :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-27T03:18:06.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are lv34 (a couple weeks at the very most, for most players, and utterly new) and have not stabilized your MMR, you are still playing with new players and bad players. The former either shape up or get banned, and the latter can be escaped with a little work.\n\nPlaying ranked is not something you should do until you are more confident in your abilities.\n\nLooking at your match history, you seem to often do well, but when you get off to a bad start you feed like a firehose. Working on how to deal with a bad lane and play from behind instead of gleefully running it down to 0/15 is a good plan.","replies":[{"poster":"lnaccurate","date":"2019-11-27T03:19:27.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats mmr? well i guess me asking this its obvious i dont play much, but does this mean i should stay in normal draft mode untill i figure out how to properly do things?","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2019-11-27T03:44:53.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR is Match Maker Rating, it's a number that is used to match you with players who contribute approximately the same towards victory.\n\nhttps://na.whatismymmr.com/derpyfush\n\nIt goes up or down depending on wins and losses.

I noticed it helps if you let people know right from the champ select that you're new to ranked. Both games people have been... not awful. Not great, for sure, but not flaming me or flipping out. I play support, and my ADC the first game was pretty annoyed at my misplays, but it never got much worse than spam pinging and telling me what to do. Second game we lost, but it was everyone doing poorly and so nobody got upset with me.","replies":[{"poster":"lnaccurate","date":"2019-11-27T03:25:07.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont know if i wanna try that i dont wanna ruin someones game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TEEMO GOD XDDDD","date":"2019-11-27T03:33:05.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bro u must understand that people who tilt on league arent \"no lifes\" and horrible people. league is just an inherently toxic game because u are literally paired up with randoms in a team of 5, and if some guy decides to feed, you feel so helpless because even tho u stomp lane ur bot lane is 0/14 and enemy team already has dragon soul. the best of us have been corrupted by this game and is completely natural to be angry since matchmaking is broken, promos are the most stupid idea ever, meta is broken, placements are unbalanced, everything is horrible","replies":[]}]}
