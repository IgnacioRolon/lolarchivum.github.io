I can't tab out of it and if I command - alt - escape it closes but when I click reconnect the same thing happens. I've tried restarting league and my computer. I played multiple games today before this started happening and now this happens whenever I try to play a game.\n\nUpdate: I used the \"initiate full repair\" button in the client settings under general and stopped having\n the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulong Tea","date":"2017-11-16T07:46:24.913+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah! I tried the _spamming spacebar_ on the \"white screen of death\" solution and it worked! \n\nFrom my understanding, I started getting this error problem with the white screen on normal client and the \"unknown directx error\" on my beta account recently after I downloaded the beta client. I also have a macbook pro and from my understanding people who have this similar situation also seem to have recently downloaded the pbe client. \n\nPerhaps there is an issue for mac users in which involves the downloading of the pbe. I wish I found this forum earlier because I tried repairing the clients, deleting and reinstalling, updating everything again, reinstalling my mac's system update, doing another full and complete update on my macbook again, and pretty much EVERYTHING you can think of. But right now, as a temporary fix, it seems spamming spacebar on the white screen for the normal server works. I hope Riot can fix this soon! \n\nP.S. Again, I feel this problem mostly involves players that use mac and also recently installed the pbe, I may be wrong though but that's for me at least.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nUpdate: 11/16/16 : The Pbe is working again, still might need to spacebar spam for normal account tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Chapter VI","date":"2017-11-16T07:58:53.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

If you force closed it at that point, some of the background processes were still running probably which interfered with you trying to reconnect. \n\nEssentially everything went really wrong in this case, unfortunately. Open your task manager and make sure you close out all instances/processes of League, and then run a quick repair to check for possibly corrupted game files that caused that initial crash. Let me know if that doesn't help, and we may need to get you over to our techs for deeper troubleshooting.","replies":[{"poster":"Wángy","date":"2017-11-15T02:52:32.368+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I have the excat same problem, and im a mac user, and i have already checked up my connections plus running the repair. \nit was working this morning, however i tried to log in to pbe today, mac client for pbe is broken, saying the dl driver error, I dont think they should be related, however when i try to log on back to NA,  white screen. \ni almost tried everything i could try.","replies":[{"poster":"Leighphora","date":"2017-11-15T06:49:31.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same exact thing happened to me.
