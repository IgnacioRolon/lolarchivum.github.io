I personally am frustrated at the hair not being iconic red either but am able to cope with it since most of her skins change her hair in some way or another as well as the project skins all have white hair. \r\n\r\nThat and it could be just me but Hot Pink doesn&#039;t seem very &quot;sinister&quot; to me. Probably the least threatening color. A deep ruby or scarlet red that&#039;s reminiscent of her iconic hair color or I don&#039;t know, the color of BLOOD would actually make the skin for me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time. \r\n- Just another random Katarina main who adores the champion","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-15T17:00:57.990+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey S Katarina 2 - \n\nFirst off, thanks for taking the time to leave feedback! It seems like you're pretty passionate about this lovely lady. ^-^ \n\nKeeping in line with PROJECT, we've decided to keep the tones more pink, similar to what you've seen with PROJECT: Fiora. This is similarly why we've chosen white hair for her; it's one of the iconic pieces for PROJECT, as you've mentioned. \n\nSide note, as we make more and more skins for Katarina, it's become tricky to give her more than just her signature red hair to switch things up! :P For Warring Kingdoms Katarina, we had a player suggest more of an ombré, which ended up working out pretty well.

One of the larger differentiation there is the particle work. Challenger uses smoother, more wispy lines, and PROJECT focuses around more geometric shapes.

Why did you guys choose a weird ground bottom trail?\n\nYou guys could have done something like adding the ghost effect to her speed boost. ((leaving after images of herself behind her.))\n\nThis thematically makes sense.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCojmKpGLqA\n\nDuring her recall she leaves after images of herself when she starts twirling around. ((but this is the only time she does it.))\n\nThis would create a really cool image during her retreat combo after E+Wing. She'll become distorted looking and leave an after trail of multiple images of herself.  This matches her recall + overall theme of Katarina. But instead, she gets this derpy trail of pink behind her . . . . I don't really like it, and feel it's tacked on for the sake of being there just to say that you guys \"did\" something. \n\nBefore people mention that it'd be confusing with ghost.\n\n1. Nobody runs ghost on Kat.\n\n2. Ghost is white.\n\nBefore anyone mentions that it'd confuse players:\n\n1.Ekko's ult has been bugged since release, and it still doesn't effect people.\n\n2. That's kind of the whole point of Katarina . . . she comes in like a whirl wind and then jets. It wouldn't confuse people anymore than she already does.\n\n3. Animation clutter.\n\n1. It really wouldn't be much animation clutter. Zed has more animations than Kat does as is, via the ability of having 2 shadows (( around 10 shadows in URF))\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4pEN_dSaXA\n\n^ just in case anyone says it'd confuse people.\n\n\nAll together, I believe giving her brief after images of herself for a speed boost indication is better than her leaving a trail behind her of pink. I hope you actually take this into consideration and try it out to see what you guys think. It shouldn't take much effort to try, and I think if you actually pull off a few combos with all the skills during a team fight, you'll realize just how awesome it'd look compared to . . . a pink trail. Also, as said, thematically, it's clearly the superior choice.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-15T23:07:19.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Puttyblo - \n\nThanks for all of the detailed feedback!

They don't have to be extremely over bearing.  It's just  one of those . . . extremely slight things you can add that can take a good skin and turn it into an amazing skin. If she had this attached to her W, I'd instantly buy it to be honest.  \n\nBecause if you pull off a pentakill with Katarina with the slight after images from W + blurring in and out with E it'll look really really really really really pretty.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-18T18:14:02.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so we did discuss your feedback, but the changes aren't something we're going to be adding to PROJECT: Katarina.

How can that be possible and still keep the 1350 price? Ekko by being himself gets all of the extra animations which is fair.

Should Kat not be the one to get extra things to make up for her simplistic abilities?\n\nIn a similar note, what is wrong with the recalls and the 3 seconds they are all still? Ashe got other animations for those three seconds and then got removed.

In PROJECT: Ekko's case, the animations aren't new - we simply changed the prop he was holding because it didn't make sense with the PROJECT thematic. It's considered a quality of life change - similar to what we do on some 750 RP skins as well. If part of the kit or emotes don't make sense with the current thematic, we'll change them so that they do. \n\nIn PROJECT: Ashe's case, that animation was never meant to actually hit PBE - it was a trial for different recalls, and that iteration was something we felt was awkward and we felt didn't work out. \n\nRecalls aren't meant to be secret until release - 99% of our content isn't a secret before release, it's all on PBE first.

Currently this joke can only be heard by reaching Katarina's abilities tab and pressing Ctrl + 1. This joke might even be better than her current one.\n\nI would like to point out that I do like the skin, it is actually the one I will be using the most from now on (I have every Katarina skin).

I was hoping I could ask you for clarification on something regarding Project Kat. I commented on the PBE Project Kat thread with my PBE account but I feel it was hardly noticed and not at all answered.\n\nFor Kat's hair in this Project skin, I understand you want it to be white to match the theme, but why is her hair pulled to one side? I feel like the falling hair on the right side of her head was the biggest and most iconic look of Kat. So when I play this new Kat skin on the PBE, it may feel like playing her but it looks so off, as if I'm playing Project Fiora with Kat abilities.
