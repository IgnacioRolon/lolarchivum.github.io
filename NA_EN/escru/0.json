Then depending on how long until it gets to me, I eventually get booted.\n\nThen I have 5 min or 10 min delayed queue. If I play ranked I would probably lose LP. This is ridiculous my internet is fine and 120 mb down.\n\nEdit: Why isn't this fixed yet?

I STILL see my teammates talking and they actually see my comments and respond to it. This is already at the point where a ban or pick is stuck at zero on my screen.\n\nThe client or process needs to be re-designed if it relies on \"syncing with your group\" if it's so buggy and causes lost promo series. There should be a different process altogether that doesn't fuck even if the internet is fine and I have 35 ping in-game and I'm downloading nothing AND I have 120 down/20 up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T16:24:39.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha, actually the client requires a constant connection as soon as you login.  For example, when you enter queue and join champion select you are transitioning from pvp.net to champion select.  Everything intertwines together, so if you have unstable connection then you could get left behind.  Let me know if that clears things up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
