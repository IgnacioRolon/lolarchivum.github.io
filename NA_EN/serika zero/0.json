You would be in the middle of the pack :)\r\nBut over the year, more and more people are joining the race.\r\nAnd now, if we have 1000 people in a race and you end up number 5. Well, now you are in the top 1% :)\r\n\r\nThis is the benefits of starting late in ranking.\r\nThere will be more people in it, and as such, your placement compared to everyone else is going to be much more accurate :)\r\nYou won&#039;t have &quot;I was gold/plat last season, and now i got placed in bronze 3 and i won 9 of my games, wtf rito!!!!&quot;\r\n\r\nJust a little tidbit to the lazy people over here.\r\nAnd ofc, if you had a rank of gold or above the previous season, its even more easy to get gold in the last month.\r\nJust ofc, this means still knowing the game and having played it in normals to know what the fuck you are doing ;)","replies":[]}
