Okay fine shit jungle i'll shake it off. She comes back, dives turret and dies giving him double buffs. Alright I'll keep trying. Top comes down with jungle ganks me 1v3... and I die.. okay I'll keep trying. In the next 2 minutes, Eve goes mid twice and dies to yasuo both times again. I'm done.\r\n\r\nSorry, but I'm not gonna keep playing a miserable fucking experience against a broken ass champion like Yasuo when my teammate decides he just wants to run it down but act like \"he's trying.\" So I spend the rest of the game farming jungle, protecting turrets except for mid which I opened, and then eve asks everyone to report me. I end up getting the ban but she is still playing right now. \r\n\r\nTherefore in closing, from here on out, I am going to int other people's lanes every single game and just not say a word. You did this Riot, you promoted this behavior, and this game is no longer fun because of it. Therefore I will make it fun by ruining people's enjoyment of it until you go bankrupt. :) Thanks Riot!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-02-19T05:29:04.297+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like the ban was correctly placed if this is your response.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-19T04:56:15.920+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have fun getting banned.","replies":[{"poster":"illuSionboy","date":"2019-02-19T05:01:39.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-19T05:31:45.681+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't make any comment on that at all?\n\nI just said that if you're going to start intentionally feeding, or trolling, that I hope you enjoy getting banned.

Say nothing and nothing will happen to you. I've been playing on LAN since preseason where everyone speaks Spanish, so I got used to not saying shit. You'd be surprised at the shit you'd get away with when you don't use chat. 90% of all punishments are a result of chat. Never state your intentions in chat if those intentions are bannable. Without chat, no one can ever prove that your 21 deaths are intentional. They HAVE to accept it as a bad game/player etc. Half the players in Silver would be banned if this wasn't the case.","replies":[]}]}
