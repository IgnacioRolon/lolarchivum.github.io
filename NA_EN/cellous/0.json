The location is a small map like the Twisted Treeline or even the Howling Abyss. The game mode should be fast-paced with a lot of action and brawling. The fun part is that either everyone on both teams play the same champs which makes it a skill match, or both teams have 5 different champions but the 5 different champions are the same on both teams. Share your thoughts!","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-22T02:30:03.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just described OfA Mirror from last year. Except in the case where it's 5 different champs. That would be ARAM mirror, which hasn't happened yet, but still doesn't sound like a big enough leap from what we already have to warrent consideration though.\n\nI would like a game mode though where each team picks the OTHER team's champs. That would be sadistic, but funny.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaotic Sage","date":"2015-10-19T20:15:43.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems kinda pointless tbh...also could easily just be made in a custom game for different champs, otherwise we already see those mirror matches sometimes in the current featured game mode.","replies":[]}]}
