I understand I wasn&#039;t being sportsmanlike but I was far from toxic. saying &quot;stop being a dick&quot; isn&#039;t toxic. dick = jerk. if i called him something like &quot;bitch&quot; then that would be toxic because that&#039;s degrading him. i literally just asked him to not be toxic. not only was he the only one who wanted to report me (the urgot i was vs), his whole team agreed with me that i wasn&#039;t being toxic, noone on my team was flaming me, and their whole team wanted to report urgot.\r\ngame 2 i wasn&#039;t even flaming vlad. he was yelling at me all game because when i asked for assistance at objectives when everyone else was doing it, he didn&#039;t do baron and we got nothing from it cuz we didnt get it. then i asked why and he gives me this giant speech and i say &quot;stfu&quot; that isnt toxic. that&#039;s just saying to shut up because you&#039;re flooding the chat. i also said &quot;stfu&quot; when he was flaming me. yes i wasn&#039;t helping in fights that much. but that was cuz i was useless. view the chat and i literally say &quot;im useless in fights rn&quot; which is why i splitpushed all game and why we won. i literally solo&#039;d 7 turrets including the two nexus turrets, and top and bot inhibitor. so yes, i was not being sportsmanlike. but i wasn&#039;t being toxic, never called him a name besides a dick, which literally means being a jerk and being toxic. so this does not deserve a permanent ban.\r\n\r\nGAME ONE CHAT: http://imgur.com/a/e2B17\r\nGAME TWO CHAT: http://imgur.com/a/SoPUa","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-02T22:31:50.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's this term that alot of you don't seem to know the meaning of. \"Harassment\"\n\nIt's what you did... its prob what you do consistently since you got perma banned, your chat logs show tons of harassment, it was deserved. enjoy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kid Insomnia","date":"2017-09-02T22:32:07.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"still should not be a permaban, i get a chat restriction or something but it wasn't that bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-02T22:33:05.254+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've already had a 14 day ban, which is past chat restriction. so yea you got what you deserved fam, sorry","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-09-02T22:39:32.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kid Insomnia,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=9tivWpJt,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-09-02T22:32:07.083+0000)\n>\n> still should not be a permaban, i get a chat restriction or something but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.\n\nYou got chat restrictions.
