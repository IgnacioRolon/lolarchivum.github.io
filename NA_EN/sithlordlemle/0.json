Internet Issues","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen posts from the past with people having issues with the ISP WOW! (Way Out West). I have had them for almost a year, and in the last month or so, I have started having major issues with them. Every night, between 8 - 11 my ping goes from 23 to 200. It happens quickly, and then goes away just a quick. These are a large majority of the hours I even have free to play, so it is a major issue for me. I would rather switch ISPs than stop playing. I have 3 other friends who have WOW! and they all spike at the same exact time. I have a friend who lives in the same city with AT&amp;T who doesn't have this issue. It's not an equipment issue, or processes, because I have 23 ping at all times except in this time period. I have went through support and was just told that Riot is working with WOW!. Has anyone heard anything else? I have posted on reddit about this and had 4 other people comment that they are having an identical issue in different states than me with WOW!. TLDR; Nightly giant lag spikes. Want to see if anything is getting done before going through the hassle of swapping ISPs. Any update on the situation would be amazing since I am limited to around 1 game a night.","replies":[{"poster":"Smooch Da Pirate","date":"2016-03-10T03:17:34.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm experiencing the same problem with WOW!.  The ping is great during the day, but sometime around 6-7pm until 10pm the ping is a constant 200+.  I have been trying to find a work around but can't seem to find one.  It is only a problem with LoL; I am still able to play other games with no problem.  I have even been able to connect to Europe servers playing Rainbow Six with better ping (120-150ish) than connecting to the Chicago servers.","replies":[{"poster":"SithLordLemle","date":"2016-03-10T14:05:22.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't read the other posts in here before making this, but on another thread Riot has said they are working with WOW! to resolve this, so fingers crossed.","replies":[]}]}]}
