Kind of.  I guess they arent really new but compared to me they are.  I 've been playing for almost 3 years.  They have been playing for about a year and a half plus or minus a few months.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways, 1 of them (the guys house that I go to on the weekend to play) is extremely passive aggressive.  Somtimes hes just aggressive.  Hes a lot worse than I am  but sometimes he'll try to make comments about how im playing when hes clearily in the wrong.  I go over there just to have fun, and dont rage at them for doing poorly.  yes i'm often the guy that has to the carrying almost every single game and i usually get camped when we are playing normals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe point is tho that he has a horrible attitude problem, and doesnt understand much of the game.  He knows hes not that great at the game, but he defineltey  forgets how bad he is when he is actually playing the game and rages at all 3 of us in different ways.  (4 of us total usually).  \r\n\r\nI'm the kind of person that lets stuff go for a long time (this has been going on for the past 3-4 months), but I think its about time to let him know whats up.\r\n\r\nHes extremely volatile and doesnt listen that much at all.  Makes excuses every game when he loses and calls said champion OP and that they take no skill etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWat should i do?\r\n\r\nBest way 2 go about this?","replies":[]}
