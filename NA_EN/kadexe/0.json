I always assumed they were crafted in the cult by some demonic craftman (Blood Moon {{champion:516}}?), but Aatrox&#039;s recall shook those assumptions. With Aatrox being the definitive Blood Moon demon, when he recalls, is he creating all those masks out of the blue?","url":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/redtracker","image":"https://avatar.leagueoflegends.com/na/Mortdog.png"},"up_votes":9,"down_votes":7,"body":"Right now I'm looking at the Red Tracker, and most of the responses are in the Dev Corner and Story, Art, and Sound. It's pretty easy to see why. In the Dev Corner, the submitter is always a Rioter and they set the tone of the conversation. Story, Art, and Sound is inviting because the lore team is treated respectfully and there's a generally positive attitude.\r\n\r\nIt's no secret that Gameplay is awful. Angry rants dominate the front page, the balance team is endlessly slandered, and Rioters' words are twisted. There needs to be tighter moderation, even if that means some very vocal users need to be banned. This atmosphere is just so hostile and negative that I'm not sure if Riot even reads them anymore. And that sucks because this is supposed to be our main channel for giving feedback. That can't happen if the boards are so repugnant that Rioters have to be paid to read it.","replies":[{"poster":"michaelchan","date":"2018-12-10T19:11:14.092+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"We understand your concerns, and over the coming weeks, we'll be discussing, both internally and externally, re-organization and new guidelines for the Boards.
