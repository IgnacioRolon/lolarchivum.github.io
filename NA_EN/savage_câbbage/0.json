I know there are items and champion passives that take away unit collision, but I don&#039;t care about that. The only thing minion collision does is make you stuck between two minions because the game doesn&#039;t know how to comprehend a few little minions standing in your way, when you&#039;re trying to run away or chase someone but there&#039;s a minion wave in the way, you&#039;ll just keep trying to get past it left-right-left-right-left-right just pretty much stopping you in your path for a second or two. When you&#039;re pushing a turret and you want to fall back because you are getting ganked, it&#039;s not going to happen because YOUR mage minions have formed a solid wall making you have to walk around them giving the jungler a few more seconds to kill you while you&#039;re under their turret. \nThere&#039;s not really a lot to add to this but I just wanted to get this off my mind.\n\nP.S I&#039;m not English, so I hope everything is understandable.\n\n**EDIT**: I didn't know they were going to patch the path finding (It's about time...), so that will probably change a lot.\n**This might actually fix the whole issue I have.**\nBut we will see...\n\n**EDIT 2**: I'm only talking about walking into minions, not skillshots hitting minions...","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-07-06T22:36:30.950+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't mind keeping unit collision when running through enemy minions, but can we remove being blocked by our own minions for starters xD?","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-07-07T05:58:30.592+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's exactly how it works in Smite, and it's actually less necessary in Smite considering they have a full WSAD full movement system, and not the gawdfukingawful pathing League has.","replies":[{"poster":"Ajacks1337","date":"2015-07-07T14:46:00.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Smite is terribad, get out","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Beowulfss","date":"2015-07-06T14:37:54.424+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":26,"body":"\"I know there are items and champion passives that take away unit collision, but I don't care about that.\" \n\ntl:dr I want to whine and complain about something that is already solved by a few items or champions in the game.

Having no unit collision actually helps a lot when trading in lane. The fact that I can walk through creeps and make sure that my opponent cannot trade with me is a very nice, albeit small advantage to have. It also helps when you're running away and such and such. In my opinion this isn't something that needs to be addressed.
