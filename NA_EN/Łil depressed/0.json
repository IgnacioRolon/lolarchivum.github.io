Well it seems there have been 2 other bugs introduced that I've noticed as well. While in the lane the long range Q auto bug might be fixed but there's a new one where if I have 2 soldiers up and try to Q them to a champion, the game will just freeze up and not do anything then randomly 2-3 later the soldiers will move after having to spam the Q over and over. The other one is the W. This feels insanely inconsistent to use on towers. Every time I W a tower there's like this weird 0.5 second delay where azir can't do anything and it messes up my autos causing me to auto attack cancel and sometimes freeze up all together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-03-10T15:25:37.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=nEc6E2Tn,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2016-03-10T05:20:37.293+0000)\n>\n> I am probably aware of what you want to tell me.\n\nbe honest do you just hate azir at this point","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YKIm Just Saiyan","date":"2016-03-23T00:14:29.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i disagree with this alot, while yes his attacks are spells. the fervor playstlye of azir fits Riots vision for azir much closer than any other mastery to date. first the bird has had his Q damage reduced and attack speed added to his w and the knockup on his sheild removed to remove a large portion of his burst (lets be real it was broke though). turning him into a dps mage instead of who relies on constant damage with nashors and rylais in fights and a well timed ult to self peel and more time to dps. sooo why oh why is thunderlords the only acceptable mastery on azir... ya know the mastery for doing burst damage. what kind of balance is it when you can only run 1-2 masterys keystones max on any champion and be effective. thunderlords being the 90% go to on azir, even though he is a dps mage and not really burst anymore (and dont say theres deathfire torch that mastery is useless on all but 2-3 champs). i enjoy azir immensely and i really would prefer a dps mastery that could fit his current playstyle I prefer the dps style of azir but please consider a different dps mage mastery buff deathfire (and nerf champions like brand/rumble a bit to compensate). or leave the fervor interaction with azir, its the most fun change on his so far. thanks for reading, hope you can consider some of the following. \n\nsigned a hopeful azir main","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-03-09T21:49:22.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought frevor also stacks with spells. 2 stacks right?","replies":[{"poster":"baayveer","date":"2016-03-09T22:39:11.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MunchCrunchLunch,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=nEc6E2Tn,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-03-09T21:49:22.213+0000)\n>\n> I thought frevor also stacks with spells. 2 stacks right?\n\nyeah but i think what they meant it wont proc it unless you use normal aa think of it like {{item:3115}}  we use it for its stat its passive is useless to us sadly buts its good cuz you have to use aa cause we always use our mana so quick XD","replies":[{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-03-10T00:09:15.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean at full build you get an extra 100 magic on autos. not bad for waveclear. most people don't appreciate this but I buy nashors more than most people. for example I buy it on my ap ezreal build. to get that extra ap on the Q.","replies":[{"poster":"baayveer","date":"2016-03-10T01:15:13.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but ur aa is not optimal in teamfights   but as u said ez q is on hit effect azir otherwise ..........","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Zan","date":"2016-03-10T00:03:57.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=nEc6E2Tn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-09T21:22:26.650+0000)\n>\n> Intended, but the note didn't mention it for some reason :\\ Sorry!\n> His basic attacks with soldiers are spells!\n\nI thought it was a cool interaction.
