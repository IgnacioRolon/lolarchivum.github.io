However, after seeing the skin its looks really amazing and all and it costs 975 on PBE, i feel like it more new particle effects could be added and the skin could be so much better and we will propably not get another yasuo skin in the next days, i suggest that the skin could be alot better with some more particle effects on his first 2 q&#039;s and on his e q combo, it will be perfect.\r\nThen it could easly be worth 1350.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-12T19:13:08.843+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Korean Wannabe 7! \n\nFirst off, thanks for the feedback!
