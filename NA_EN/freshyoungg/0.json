Keep in mind though, that if you hit enter and type players can still see what you say.  You can also use /mute all to not see player chat, as UnbenchedKench suggested.  We don't penalize players for selecting not to use chat, so feel free to stick to smart pings.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Letter H","date":"2016-09-05T23:02:10.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use the /mute feature.
