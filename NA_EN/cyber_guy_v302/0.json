The skin usually filters his voice to have a deep, mechanical sound to it, but all my resent games with him using this skin had him talking in his default skin&#039;s voice. Has anyone else been having audio bugs like this?\r\nAgain, it&#039;s for a skin that filters the default skin&#039;s lines, not replacing it with other lines like Legendary skins.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-16T21:31:53.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Cyber Guy v302,\n\nThanks for the report!
