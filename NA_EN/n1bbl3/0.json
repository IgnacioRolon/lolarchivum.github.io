The damage dealt by the vest was counted as damage dealt by my champion (in this case Dr Mundo).  I did not attack the Cait bot once during the game, and let her auto me a bunch.  As I said, the reflected damage was considered to be dealt by me, meaning that it should logically cause tower agro (just as Sunfire Cape has been known to).","replies":[]}]}]}
