I believe that it is a league issue because all of my other games start up just fine. If you need any information feel free to ask. I recently had to replace my motherboard, it started with windows 10 and i played league just fine and so i changed to windows 7 because i don't care for 10 and now i cannot play league, after champion select even in a custom game i get application error (0xc00007b). I know that 7 often has issues with games and i've looked up problems with specifically windows 7.\r\nWindows 7 sp1\r\nAMD A10-6800K APU (w/Radeon HD graphics)\r\n8 GB RAM\r\nNVIDIA GTX 970 4gb acx2","replies":[{"poster":"Sarlyk","date":"2015-10-29T02:16:04.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you GoldPikaKnight, i submitted a ticket and now i'm waiting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Andrionar","date":"2015-10-29T01:32:50.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/FOkvTQ8J-low-fps-and-high-ping-fix","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-29T01:06:59.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sarlyk, \n\nIf you have tried everything to try and fix your issue with League, the next best step would be to submit a ticket.
