It usually comes from chasing, diving, over-extending... basically they want kills. But a lot of times they end up getting killed for a kill, or at best they end up just trading kills. I kill you, you kill me. Getting you&#039;re enemy fed is never worth. If you try to not die and focus on not dying, you&#039;ll probably do better. Maybe your cs might improve too? Maybe you&#039;ll focus on learning trades better, so you always come on top? Maybe you&#039;ll learn to ward more often? I mean why die and get your enemy fed?\n\nGoing 8-15-0 is not worth in my opinion. I&#039;d rather go 2-0-5, if you know what I mean. Heck 15-15-0 isn&#039;t worth either. I mean how many times have you had an ally with a load of kills but deaths too and you lose? Many times.\n\n\n\n\n**Edit:** After reading many comments down below, I think I haven't explained myself well.

Sometimes I enter a 1v1 I am not sure who will win, simply to find out who wins it and why. I don't see how playing overly passive improves your game-play. It might temporarily increase your performance and win-rate, but it sounds to me like it would slow your learning process down. Also there's lots of situations in which you would negatively influence your performance by playing just not to die, for instance when playing naturally aggressive champions such as any midlaner, any AD botlane, or any AD bruiser toplane.\n\nMaybe you should refine your statement to \"Focus on not dying when playing really strong late-game champions.\" That would be simply the most wise style of game-play with those champions, since you'll actually benefit from nothing happening to you or your lane opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"Rootworth","date":"2015-04-03T01:31:12.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you said it in the first few lines. You try to figure out what you did wrong. A lot of people just continue to make the same mistakes over and over.\n\nThe thing is, when someone hears, \"try not to die,\" they assume it means play really passive. But that's not the case at all. All it means is to not run into the enemy jungle without wards, chase and get baited, jump into a group of 4 enemies when all you're building is damage and you're a squishy champion, and so forth.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-04-03T07:51:34.696+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">  All it means is to not run into the enemy jungle without wards, chase and get baited, jump into a group of 4 enemies when all you're building is damage and you're a squishy champion, and so forth.\n\nNo that's not what the phrase means at all. Try not to die means simply that, actively putting in thoughts to avoid death. It means a hell of a lot more than not running through the enemy jungle. It means leaving lane when you're too low, it means trying to position yourself in open spots with more than one escape route, it means in lane trying to sidestep skillshots and when trying to run it means use your escapes effectively. It has nothing to do with not running through the enemy jungle. It has nothing to do with not jumping into 4v1s. Those are literally the **worst** ways to describe it.\n\nBasically *trying* something is an **active** process. You are taking actions **to** achieve your goal. **Not** doing something is also **not** taking actions towards achieving your goal, in fact it hinders you as a person and as a player. You aren't supposed to think of things in what \"not\" to do you're supposed to think of what you \"should\" do. You should take action to see if the enemy jungler could be nearby before you go in on an engage, that's how you avoid dying. You should take note of your enemies power spikes, what is on/off CD, what items they have built before trying to trade with a champion who will be in range to trade back, that's how you avoid dying. The people who don't go anywhere in life are the people who focus on what they \"shouldn't\" do and they think things like \"don't run the red light\", \"don't tell her that dress makes her look fat\", \"don't fall asleep during tomorrow's meeting\". The people who actually get somewhere focus on the things they \"should\" be doing to get somewhere. They focus on complementing the woman's hair or her laugh if they think her dress makes her look fat, they actively attempt to take notes and process what their boss says during the meeting instead of trying not to fall asleep. \n\nThe game is played the exact same way. \n\nJust because you shouldn't do something doesn't mean you'll win more games by not doing it. If I decide not to chase through their jungle and instead recall, that doesn't help me win the game. If I choose to not chase the enemies through the bottom side jungle and instead farm bottom lane, it doesn't stop the group of people who would have caught me in the jungle from coming to kill me. Not doing something never helps win you the game, it helps keep you from losing it faster. There really are certain things you have to do to win the game. You have to take towers and at least 1 inhib and the nexus turrets to take the nexus and win the game.  That is really how you win, it's not by \"not dying\". Not dying means that the enemies have more people to worry about when they try to take turrets. It doesn't magically mean the enemy's turrets fall or that they will surrender.\n\nSeriously just focus on the things you should be doing in your games and not the things you shouldn't be doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Rootworth","date":"2015-04-03T17:35:08.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good points.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2015-04-02T22:03:52.633+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but you can push it a step farther. play as aggro as you can, while still trying not to die. if you can punish people in laning and survive a gank, you made the jungle come to your lane and not get anything and you were making it harder for your laner. there are times when I was ganked top and got double kill even and when you do that in a game, other team almost gives up right there sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Rootworth","date":"2015-04-02T22:26:15.553+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"B3ER","date":"2015-04-03T09:35:15.327+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried this.

Its about not making mistakes. Thats people's problems. League games are not won on LCS big plays. Maybe in the pros, where they might end a game with a 3-0 score, but in your typical solo Q game, its about who throws and messes up the hardest, not who insec'd who.\n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with risks if they are calculated. But some people just do dumb things that have a very small chance of succeeding. And, its usually these people that are complaining the most about being stuck in low elo, about struggling teams, about the system, about everything. Its not your typical fun loving people who are dying 12 times a game. Its the try-hard guy thinking he belongs in silver/gold/plat while he breaks even at best in games.\n\nAnd again, this fun thing you are talking about people rarely do. People spam 1 champion out of 100+ all day, every day, JUST to gain some LP. Just to maybe win a game or 2 more. They spam 1 role nonstop, JUST to win more games. I mean, hell the people who are having \"fun\" are the ones at lvl 10 who are just randomly going places with random champs. Not try-hard number 5000000 spamming 1 champion mid for months at a time.\n\nAt some point you do have to test your limits; but those have to be TESTING your limits. Not just suiciding and doing dumb things that have little chance ot offer anything worthwhile except not to do that again, which you should hvae known better the in the first place. Its like working a speed bag. You dont start hammering on that thing as fast as you can. You have to slowly work your way up to being able to style and show-off on that thing. You arent going to get anywhere on it by hammering on it like a monkey the first time you hit it.\n\nBut if fun is all you care about then go ahead. Just dont start complaining when you cant gain elo when you are sabotaging yourself by making too many mistakes.\n\nLow elo is a game of mistakes. Its who can make the less mistakes. Most of the people, esp. on this forum, are in that elo. Low elo games just arent won by LCS big plays.

I totally agree with OP.\nI'm still a noob, but I've started learning a lot faster when I began playing with OP's tactics. \nWhen I started out, I played as Lucian and I rushed into fights all the time. Ended up with a lot of 2-15-2 type rounds. Later I changed to Tristana (currently my main) and started to focus more on actively trying to avoid fights I'm sure I'll lose. I almost always pull back when there's more than 1 enemy champ if I'm soloing my lane. Never use my rocket jump for offense since it's my main means of getting out of trouble, except for \"sure\" kills and sometimes fleeing champs when ganking.\n\nToday this playstyle really payed off and I played my best round yet.\nExcept for some jungler help and end game support, I was soloing bottom lane. Ended up with 10-5-1. Two of those deaths where completely my fault because I was over-confident and got owned when rushing in (lesson learned: keep my distance with Tristana). Two deaths was enemy ganking and/or ambushing me (lesson learned: ward is key!!!). Last death was getting killed for a kill.\nI ended up with second most champ kills on team, most minion kills by a long shot, most gold, highest lvl and I cleared my lane of turrets and inhibitor.\nAfter I started playing with OP's playstyle, there are two very important things I've noticed.\n1: This is the obvious one.

Neither does it apply to games like Age Of Empires, Divinity, StarCraft, etc. \n\nIf you rush into every game without thinking about tactics, you will not have a fun time, but if you can adapt your playstyle and tactics to each game you play, you will definitely have a fun time.\n\nBut of course, to each his own. If your playstyle works for you, keep at it, but remember that it might not work for everyone.\nAs you say yourself: \" Video games are for doing things outside of the norm and having fun\".

Very passive, try to do the minimum for my plays. I found the issue with this is that I do too little sometimes and that makes my team lose out in trades.\n\n3rd game: Ham and cheese.
