That's one of the reasons why Nasus is such a good pusher.\nThis includes Spellblade procs like Lich Bane.

Nasus is the prime example, where Jax is the example of someone who doesn't but uses it for the AA reset. SO if your champ does extra damage to towers make sure to use the ability to reset your AA cooldown. Example blitz AA>E you will get both off in a much shorter time frame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vicvictorw","date":"2015-05-24T04:56:41.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any autoattack reset can be used to deal more damage to towers even if the skill itself doesn't hurt the tower.\n\nFor example, activating Jax's Empower will reset his autoattack timer, but won't proc on the tower. It's still a free hit.","replies":[]}]}
