Was it a specific champion played a certain way? strange buys?\n\nI don't know if they're following the same pattern nowadays but back when I first started doing PVP bots were rampant in ARAM. Eventually my MMR rose to where they didn't get matched with me anymore, but in the early going sometimes it would be 4 bots on my team and 5 on the enemy team. There were some very easy ways to spot bots:\n\n1. They always had ghost and heal. Without exception.\n2. Their name was usually two random names thrown together (\"Brian Molly\" for example).\n3. They tended to buy the same items over and over again (ruby crystals and zeals seemed to be especially popular).\n4. They fired skillshots in random directions.\n5. They played like minions - just running down the lane and auto-attacking anything that came into range.\n6. They never communicated (I've heard of bots that send generic messages, but these never said anything).\n7. They were always using a free-to-play champion.\n8. They never used their poro-snax.\n\nWhatever program controls them may have changed since then, but there was a definite pattern with all this.","replies":[{"poster":"FarRockBF","date":"2015-05-21T19:52:32.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Der Lindwurm,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Av8JAh13,comment-id=0000000000000006,timestamp=2015-05-21T16:55:49.394+0000)\n\n> 1.

A few things have changed.\n\n1. They do take other combinations now, not just Ghost + Heal\n2. SAME\n3. I've seen this and others\n4. Not so much anymore\n5. YES\n7. CHANGED: They now \"randomly\" communicate. So in middle of a teamfight or just at some random point they will say \"lol\" or \"brb\". Very generic quotes and they will NEVER respond when you type something.\n8.
