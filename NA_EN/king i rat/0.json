Why are you forcing me to watch pro-games that I have zero interest in to continue my quest-line? Are you really this desperate for people to watch pro-play now? \r\n\r\nIt's boring, there is nothing new going on in the pro-scene cause the game has been in the same state for the last 3 seasons. There are no real new comps, no new items, nothing to knock me off my feet and go \"oh wow, that was cool, I had no idea you could do that\". At most you will get someone out-flashing someone else or maybe get a penta-kill from a carry. Woohoo. Every build is the same, every comp is the same, every game is the same. I would rather watch grass grow, at least I will get some fresh air out of that experience.","replies":[]}
