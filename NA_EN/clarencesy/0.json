However, I've been able to reconnect back in time to pick my champ but none of the champion icons are shown and available for me to pick thus resulting in a dodge and losing lp. I can see the countdown, everyone's champs, change runes/masteries freely, etc. So I've been wondering whether its an issue on my end or not, and if there's a way to solve it","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T21:51:26.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm sometimes if your connection is a little unstable the client won't be able to grab certain information. It kind of sounds like this might be the case here since champ select needs to grab the pool of champions you have available from our servers in order to show which ones you can pick from. Do a quick checkup on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and run through the steps on that guide updating anything you see.
