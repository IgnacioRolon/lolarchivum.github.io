At this time I realize that the &quot;horrible community&quot; you hear about this game having, I was among those players. I have been mean to some people, but I have never intentionally fed or purposely lost a game, never have never will. Back then I played to win, and today I play to win. I just had troubles understanding this game. When I made a new account, I did  get a few punishments at the start, but I slowly got less and less, and from here I have not gotten punished since around last year. Now, of course I do have my bad days still, but instead of being horrible, I usually just shrug it off. As I got better at this game, I realized that it doesn&#039;t matter what my teammates did personally.  Every player is a part of league, and usually if i see somebody doing something annoying I always shrug it off as &#039;this is what league is, and there is nothing you can do to get around it&#039;. I could either quit league, or I could adjust to league, and I made my decision. \r\n\r\nI do realize that my account was punished for a reason, and many people will say i deserve to get permanently banned because i must have done something horrible to deserve it. This is true to a degree, the degree being that I have waited almost two years to make this post. I personally think two years was enough to think myself over and make a choice. \r\n\r\nThe reason I am making this thread is because I know it is rare, but I do know of professional players that have been suspended getting a second chance. Again, this is rare, and I&#039;m not a profession player, but it would be the final percent in reforming. \r\n\r\nTL:DR I believe i have reformed and am applicable for a second chance with this account.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-04-30T01:08:59.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"pro players just got the competitive rights lifted.

Yes, it's annoying to level up but it's a way to really test how you've reformed. I don't believe an account has ever had a permanent ban lifted. It's a lifetime ban that could be listed. This is when the player makes a new account and it's immediately banned knowing it's that players. \n\nSorry but I hope the best for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Shayapig","date":"2017-04-30T01:57:25.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have made an account a while ago and am playing on it, but I just wanted to see if I could see my old account live again.

I would like to congratulate you on your reform! Keep it up with the non-negative behavior and you'll never need to worry about a punishment again.\n\nAs said by others, you can never get your account back since it was permanently punished for verbal abuse. However, you can start again and as long as you don't go back to your toxic ways, Riot will not ban you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spareatick","date":"2017-04-30T01:09:28.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats on the reform man, that's not an easy thing to do.  I could be wrong about this but I don't think those professional players got their accounts back.
