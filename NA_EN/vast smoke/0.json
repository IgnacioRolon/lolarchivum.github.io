I used to be a dominion player and played that mode quite a bit and I believe with the removal, it removed all the time I had played with it on my account and I was cheated out of my tier 3 veteran emote. (I could also be wrong) But I would like it if someone at Riot would look into this because dominion was a game mode for a really long time and the time played in that mode should be applied to our total time played. I have lost a majority of my friends with the removal of dominion and I don't want to lose the time I invested in this game also. I know you won't bring dominion back but can you make ascension a permanent game mode for those fast action games we all love and miss.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-04T02:07:21.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dominion was definitely counted as well! If you still think you didn't get the right emote feel free to hit us up in a ticket where our game agents should be able to double check that.","replies":[]}]}
