During my first back, I noticed that the poro who Malzahar turns into a void-ling was missing his texture. I thought it was odd and asked my friends if he he looked different. They described him as totally blue, which is exactly what I saw. I took a gif of the backing animation, which is the gyazo link. Wasn&#039;t sure if I should have posted this here, since it IS a bug, but it isn&#039;t crashing my game or anything. {{champion:90}} peace out chicken scouts","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-08T17:30:22.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya QueenofNuggets! \n\nThanks for the report!
