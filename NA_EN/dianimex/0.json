So, failures at this particular point in patching are caused by your patcher disconnecting from the patching servers. The most common cause for this is problematic network settings that conflict with League. I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address the frequent fixes.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Dianimex","date":"2016-12-26T17:31:13.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, so, I gave it a try and it gave me logs, but I don't know wha to do with them?
