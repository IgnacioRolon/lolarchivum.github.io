Upon starting my first game since the change, the game instantly crashed my entire computer, and after restarting and disconnecting my second monitor the problem repeated itself. I tried to find a way to change the resolution outside of actually playing the game (because that's impossible) and it doesn't seem like there is a way anymore, or if it is it's buried under hundreds of complaints from 2010 and whatnot. Is there a way to adjust these settings outside of the game? my game.CFG file is nearly empty.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T03:17:10.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, you may be able to modify your resolution settings outside the game, but it's far easier to clear out what's stored server-side and have League autodetect your new resolution.
