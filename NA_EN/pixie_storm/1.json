Nobody in all chat cares if you&#039;re pissed in fact, they want to see you pissed the hell off because they&#039;re getting free LP. \n\nFor all you monkeys crying about how you lost your season rewards (I mean the people who have been playing all season)I'm sorry that really sucks. The matchmaking system sucks, they put that guy who hasnt played a single game of ranked all season in your game and screwed your promos, I get it, but let these losers who decide to wait till the end of the season to ~~feed~~ play report themselves, cuss, and fight each other out and stop typing to them. cut your goal off earlier than the end of the season and say: &quot;ok this was my peak. don&#039;t let the frustrated trolls ruin it for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Ellomdian","date":"2018-11-05T06:14:38.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't remember the last time Ranked in Sub-Plat was as toxic as it has been for the last 2 weeks.\n\nRito, the missions that require ranked wins were a *HUGE* mistake.

They play with the plat or diamond in flex obviously *they* are not the reason they are losing the solo duo game ğŸ™„. \nSpecifically the problem is with the end of the season and those ranked missions are messing with people who casually rank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-05T05:21:05.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is basically telling everyone to STFU, but you are talking about the tryhard mode, so justified.\n\n+1","replies":[{"poster":"Pixie Storm","date":"2018-11-05T06:06:21.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=B8ojsj3H,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-05T05:21:05.960+0000)\n>\n> this is basically telling everyone to STFU, but you are talking about the tryhard mode, so justified.\n> \n> +1\n\nyeah it's a little ridiculous how these games have been going.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-11-05T07:08:54.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So basically you're saying don't be toxic.\nShould be simple, but I don't expect it to be that simple for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Pixie Storm","date":"2018-11-05T09:13:08.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zombie Gerbil,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=B8ojsj3H,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-11-05T07:08:54.623+0000)\n>\n> So basically you&#x27;re saying don&#x27;t be toxic.\n> Should be simple, but I don&#x27;t expect it to be that simple for them.\n\nNo Iâ€™m saying stop paying attention to the mongrels who come last minute at the end of the season; unranked; to ruin everyone elseâ€™s experience. Report them, make sure they donâ€™t get their season rewards cause quite frankly if youâ€™re gonna come ruin my game because youâ€™re being toxic and pissed off that youâ€™re not where you wanted to be because you CHOSE not to work over the season for it; and now you *think*  your team is holding you back because youâ€™re not playing your role correctly then start flaming and typing, they shouldnâ€™t receive jack for end of the season. Not everyone is kind but even the toxic players who worked hard over the season and know the game in and out deserve it, not the entitled last minute rankers. Honestly as my second year on league, itâ€™s always around this time I see people getting banned left and right and now I see and understand why.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-11-05T18:39:39.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eh fair enough.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-11-05T05:20:04.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe leave the insults out?","replies":[{"poster":"Pixie Storm","date":"2018-11-05T06:04:08.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mlm olo mlm,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=B8ojsj3H,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-05T05:20:04.984+0000)\n>\n> Maybe leave the insults out?\n\nSure lol sorry","replies":[]}]}]}
