After I would download it and try to run the game, it would say: \"could not connect to the HTTP server. Please check that your internet connection is enabled and that your firewall is not blocking access.\" I checked in the firewall and it wasn't there and my internet connection is really good but it wont open. I also tried to run as an admin, and it would open the game. The problem here is that when i would try to play a 5v5, after the character screen shut to open in full screen, it would crash and ask me to send a crash report. When i would close the report and reconnect, it would crash again and ask me to send an other report.\nWhat can i do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-27T16:26:17.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The update may have changed some of your settings, specifically with security.  The error may be suggested that something is blocking the game from opening properly.  While running as admin can be a workaround ,it's not a total or permanent fix.  Instead, I recommend going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure access is restored fully.  \n\nYou may also need to make sure your drivers are all up to date and compatible with Windows 10 since your upgrade.  Our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide can help get that fixed up so your game can render properly.  \n\nMake sure to go over those steps, and you'll be all set!","replies":[{"poster":"Tadai","date":"2016-10-27T18:52:29.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much!","replies":[]}]}]}
