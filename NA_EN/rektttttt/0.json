I just returned from finals week finally no more stress and I come to play some solo/duo queue with my buddy because we are trying to climb the ranked ladder, I try playing but this cho&#039;gath keeps flaming me for no apparent reason until i finally crack, I held back for a good portion and was trying to be reformed aftter the 1 warning I recieved ( by the way 1 chat restriction doesnt really seem fair, please look over my other games and check how far I have come with my being reformed, I really sincerely tried not to do this but this cho&#039;gath continued to get on my nerves until I had had enough). I have put alot of effort in to improving League if Legends as a whole and have continued to play it through out the last 2 years and spent a good portion of my own money on the developement of the game. Examples include me being an alpha tester and playing only on that client and reporting every bug or glitch I came across, 2 of which got fixed in time for the Beta release. What I am asking of you is for you to make an exception for me, or at least leave me with a day - week ban or a chat ban in general, i realize that it is my fault for flaming the cho gath but it is the communities fault for alot of the bans, peoples days or even weeks to months are ruined because of one game that was bad and their teammates just wouldnt let it go so they get angry and retaliate and what do you know, the company that &quot;believes in second chances&quot; perm bans them. I have heard cases of bans sometime happening after actual chat bans etcetera but not after a single restriction! Please take your time and consider my request.

You keep saying you changed and that you deserved another chance, but you also still shift blame onto others. Being flamed is no excuse to flame back. Even bringing up the fact that you flamed because you were flamed in turn shows you still don't understand that the only acceptable reaction to flame is muting, which shows that if put in the same situation in the future, you'll act the same way. You'll flame back instead of muting. \n\n>Rektttttt: bronze %%%gots should die irl\n\nTwo things right there that can lead to an instant permaban, even without prior punishment.
