If you remember purchasing a specific skin upon its release, you can find the date it was released. You could use either of these to estimate a possible date. Honestly, if I were asked when my account was made, I couldn't give an exact month, or even an exact year. However, I could provide a lot of information of where I lived during possible years that I may have created the account if I ever needed to prove myself the owner of my own account.","replies":[]}]}
