I do see that you recently replied to your ticket, but keep in mind doing that  can return you to the bottom of the queue until a specialist replied back.  If I can lend a suggestion here, you may want to go over the steps in our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide.
