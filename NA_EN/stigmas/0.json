I use a mac book air, and it seems every patch one needs to be ready for a certain bug. I was able to solve mine immediately by just playing on the legacy client. I do not experience the champ select blackout or having to wait 1 min to return to game menu just after you finish a game on the legacy client. Tbh, you might as well run on the legacy client till the 7.5 patch update if you are looking for a beta client solution to your problem. Counting on the tech guys at riot to help you is like pouring water into a basket. it took them almost 3 months to fix the sound issues and fps drop mac users were experiencing from patch 6.5 - 6.7. Thousands of ranked games were lost due to their negligence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T00:07:54.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this happening in the Beta Client or the Legacy Client?
