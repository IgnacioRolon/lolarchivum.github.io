Borderless, Fullscreen, and Windowed don't let me use my second monitor without alt tabbing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T20:41:07.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can set the game to borderless, so tapping the Windows Key should allow you to task to the desktop.  The borders are still limited because it's required to scroll around the map, so the cursor is locked into the game.  I believe this is to prevent accidents of scrolling too far and out of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-08-17T00:54:39.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worth noting, oftentimes with borderless games you can scroll out of the game when a menu is open.","replies":[]}]}]}
