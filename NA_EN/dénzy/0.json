This usually happens with outdated drivers or other issues like an oudated OS.  Since you have a new computer, you definitely want to make sure these are all up to date.  I also recommend going over our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to help out with this and troubleshoot.
