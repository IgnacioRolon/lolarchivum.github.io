So basically some friends and I queued up for a blind pick match, there was 4 of us (This is including myself) in a party and there was a single random player. During the match there was some banter going around (Mainly it was me, but it was only kept between the four of us). So the random saw this and decided to report me and I got perma-ban.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to remove the perma-ban? Because I've spent quite a good bit of money on that account.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-11-19T22:27:58.843+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in media, it is not the case for old forum threads.
