You literally won't even be able to tell whether they're doing any \"punching.\"\n\nPractical advice: every time you feel like ignoring the rules and doing whatever you want, imagine how silly you'd feel when you not only get a punishment for it but also display to a bunch of strangers how you broke rules that you were fully aware of and reaped the reward. That's how I avoid traffic tickets, by the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-06-25T00:47:45.371+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Flaming/blaming, and harassing others and calling for reports.","replies":[{"poster":"March 15 2019","date":"2019-06-25T00:51:33.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response.

So just  report  the person you feel is being toxic after the match... it's not complicated.","replies":[{"poster":"dAsKiLzZ","date":"2019-06-28T21:20:18.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChaosLordMadis,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Icj8Epfx,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2019-06-28T20:48:36.696+0000)\n>\n> Sure you can call people out just do so in a   non  toxic way.

I said their are  ways to call out  people with out having to be toxic.  And then  I said  if you think they need t o b e reported  do it yourself after the match. Their only needs to be one report for the system to look at the game.
