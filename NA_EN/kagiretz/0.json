As I understand it, true cosmic horror is completely non-understandable and basically the threat cannot be overcome because it's so incredibly powerful and ancient. Lots of Lovecraft-inspired things take a lot from the visuals, but at the end of the day there is some way to stop the threat at the end which is unlike Lovecraft's original work. One of the only big \"victories\" in Lovecraft's work is that they run over one of the monsters with a yacht and it temporarily knocks them out for a while or something, but they can't permanently be killed.\n\nIt sounds like Volibear's morphing and overall demeanor are supposed to be horrifying, but true cosmic horror in League would likely require a god born with the universe like Aurelion Sol but malicious, evil, and bent on breaking mortal minds. Volibear is locked to Runeterra, is extremely powerful, but is not so powerful that he could never be truly defeated. It sounds like Ornn already beat his ass a few times, and if all of Runeterra were to be destroyed which is feasible the demi-gods who live there would be just as screwed as everyone else as far as I know.\n\nHowever, Swain's quote for Aurelion does hint at Aurelion having \"siblings\" of some variety and if the Watchers ever get out and attempt an assault on the universe so they can have nappy time that would probably be close to cosmic horror, so maybe we'll see it in the game one day.","replies":[{"poster":"Crow Nebula","date":"2019-03-03T12:43:37.503+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"True cosmic horror should not contain anything \"evil\" or \"malicious\".

Good luck making him afraid of anything.\n\n{{champion:112}} has already made augmentations that removes fear from humans.\n\n> We also don't know for a fact that the non-human champions on that list are incapable of fear. \n\n{{champion:432}} doesn't have any emotions as far as I'm concerned.\n\n{{champion:9}} is fear itself.\n\n{{champion:429}} only feels revenge.\n\n{{champion:10}} distances herself from all mortal emotions.\n\n{{champion:203}} doesn't have any thing to fear to begin with, as they are immortal.\n\n{{champion:54}} we don't know enough, sure, but he's a mountain. I doubt he's the big feeler.\n\n{{champion:82}} same as Kindred.\n\n{{champion:111}} same as Kalista.\n\n{{champion:80}} can't feel fear as far as I'm concerned.\n\n{{champion:555}} you might be right about this one.\n\n{{champion:33}} as emotional as a boulder.\n\n> \n> Sejuani's response to Volibear was more of a visceral reaction to his imposing figure than the result of fear born from thoughtful analysis of potentially losing her clan. In fact, Sej was happy she avoided pledging them to Voli in the first place.\n\nNo one mentioned anything about a \"thoughtful analysis\" here.\n\nRegardless of Sejuani's flinching being her worrying for her clan or a reaction to Volibear's mosntrous appearance, it was still a sign of fear, and you  argued that Sejuani wouldn't flinch *under any circumstance,* which has already been proven false.\n\nI will agree, Sejuani is indeed a very cool character, but I'd argue that you're overplaying her a tad too much here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"L Rayquaza","date":"2019-03-02T22:49:55.541+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about something the Watchers attempted to corrupt, but that just made him even more pissed and out for their heads(?)","replies":[{"poster":"Kagiretz","date":"2019-03-02T23:15:01.537+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L Rayquaza,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=rQHy61qx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-02T22:49:55.541+0000)\n>\n> What about something the Watchers attempted to corrupt, but that just made him even more pissed and out for their heads(?)\n\nThat would be epic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jocomotion","date":"2019-03-03T06:27:37.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it was obvious that the thing wasn’t actually Volibear.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-03-03T22:03:32.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhm how do you get that idea?\nEveryone calls him Volibear in the story and he is also the leader of the ursine.\n\nIt could be a channeled version of Volibear, but it is definitely Volibear in the new lore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mael Jade","date":"2019-03-03T22:25:13.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont worry, he is just your average Lovecraftian Outer God going Rampage when summoned and making you loose your mind, personality and body","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2019-03-02T23:09:18.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please don't hit him with the Void hammer.
