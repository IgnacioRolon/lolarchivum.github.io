Sometimes when I ping a summoner spell only a blank space will appear after the colon.(when you ping it has your name a colon then your ping e.g  Bladesmasher999: Caitlyn's flash 100s cd but now it only says Bladesmasher999:  \r\nAnother and i think more important problem is that the chat isn't chronological and sometimes pings and messages appear like 3min after it appeared for other players which can be detrimental for communicating with your teammates. When you scroll up sometimes theres a massive blank space before more non chronological messages. Pressing z just makes it worse and creates more blank spaces and incoherent messages. Not sure if this is happening for others as well or just for me. Going to submit a ticket about it. Please help.\r\n\r\nNote this does not occur all the time but it gets really frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"valcano","date":"2017-11-04T23:38:01.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have this problem too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrFreshPotato","date":"2017-11-03T22:10:02.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OVO23","date":"2017-11-01T01:45:05.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here how do I fix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-29T22:28:40.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh....that's pretty weird tbh. I wonder if this is some kind of really odd connection thing where only the chat and ping times are affected? Let's go ahead and adjust a few settings here and there following the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).

If it's at a reasonable under 100, you might still be lagging.   If you're on a wifi connection, you might be experiencing packet loss which doesn't necessarily result in higher ping.  If it's your internet that's causing the delay, try a wired connection.  \n\nIf it's NOT your internet that's causing the pings and chat messages to delay, however, then it could be Riot performing live network maintenance or the Riot servers themselves lagging.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashtwee","date":"2017-10-29T02:34:02.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this bug too. It's actually more than annoying now because I can't see the pings for things like summoners or any chat messages at all for periods of time.","replies":[]}]}
