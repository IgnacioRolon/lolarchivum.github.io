NOT EKKO!\n**\nNidalee was last pick, didn&#039;t talk until they were locking in (this happens regardless of the new champ pick, or the old) &amp; proceeded to say &quot;I don&#039;t like Darius as top, so I&#039;m going to feed guys, sorry&quot;. \n\nHe went into the game, bought only the items you can see, fed 2 lanes silently, said &quot;lol&quot;, quit. So it was 4v5 with a Quinn &amp; Zed given first/second/third/fourth blood&#039;s which is all that&#039;s needed to A: tilt the lanes in their favour due to people feeling negative and B: allow the other team the confidence to know there&#039;s infighting and trolling on our team.\n\nGame over.\n\nYou can say &quot;OMG YOU CAN TOTALLY TURN IT AROUND, I KNOW I WOULD!!&quot; or &quot;not all of your games can be like this, this is a bad example, I have xxx in my games!&quot; etc. I don&#039;t care. This is ALL I see. It&#039;s either an afk, feeding, toxicity, etc etc. \n\nI can deal with bad players, I can deal with people that get countered due to bad picks, whatever. I can&#039;t deal with these scenarios. It&#039;s pathetic, and it&#039;s so common it pains me to even bother playing any more.\n\nI couldn&#039;t care less what my rank is, I just like playing the game &amp; actually earning/losing something at the end based upon my skill level. Normals don&#039;t offer that because people generally take it even less seriously than bronze level ranked, &amp; I don&#039;t gain or lose anything based upon playing so I&#039;m just kind of like &quot;meh, who cares?&quot;. \n\nObviously the care factor in rank also becomes meaningless over time due to the fact that I have zero influence on what happens in the game. I can&#039;t alter the outcome of a game where someone decides they&#039;re going to deliberately lose it from the start. \n\nI&#039;ve played multiple MMO/team games that require people to work together, &amp; I&#039;ve never in my life seen a game so FILLED with people that just want to destroy the fun that others have so that they can laugh, or whatever.\n\nThere should be a WoW-esque scenario where you have to do proving grounds (google it if you&#039;ve no idea what I&#039;m talking about) to prove you have a basic understanding of game mechanics, and have to do a certain amount of cs/damage/healing whatever before you&#039;re capable of entering the ranked scene. \n\nIf it isn&#039;t taken seriously, then what&#039;s the point? Where&#039;s the learning?\n\nI literally can&#039;t remember the last game I&#039;ve played where someone doesn&#039;t go 0/20/0 or never connect, or connect &amp; flame the team, or multiple other scenarios.\n\nI know I&#039;m terrible, I don&#039;t need people going through my game history pointing out that I&#039;m terrible. All I want is for people to know that it&#039;s impossible to improve at this level of the game when you&#039;re instantly behind before the match even starts because one team is guaranteed a feeder/toxic/afk/man-child whatever to sway it in one direction.\n\nSo any win you have is meaningless, because it&#039;s one of the above, and any loss you have is out of your control due to the fact that you&#039;ve generally got one of the above.\n\nIt makes me blind. I hate this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-01-21T22:49:38.746+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly man if you don't care about your rank, then don't play ranked.

So I assume you got out of the first 10 minutes already. Not a too good value then.\n\n\nYou can carry yourself out there but you need to know how to keep your mentality up regardless of your teams performance and the focus onto the things that you can do better.\n\nI would say that this game, at this point, can't be carried by a guy in bronze or silver. But a silver player that started this game as Darius top would have probably gone 4/1/2 with 100+ CS even in a 2v1. Would that win the game? Probably not. But it would give the team hope and motivation to go on and even when you can't win that one, the next one can be easier.\n\n\n**If you want some help, I am willing to help.** I am from EUW (time zone problem maybe but I can stay up long and can spectate with one of my NA smurfs) and even when I am not that good mechanically I still get to plat5 each season in less than 100 games.

That wouldn't actually solve anything in a 2v1 with a fed Quinn and Zed especially (and Quinn is fast as heck so her rotating to another lane would take no time at all). \n\nIt feels more like people are just trying to blame the OP to sound like some \"well you gotta blame you too\", but we've all been there, friend. When you have someone feeding, then goes afk, and you are countered, your laner gets fed from a troll, AND you have someone perma roaming to your lane, (on top of bot and jungle doing really bad looking at those scores)...there isn't that much you are going to be doing. It is good to say \"you just have to do x\" but I think we both know that isn't possible 100% of the time. \n\nEven farming under the turret in the game he was in could have easily got him tower dove by a fed Zed and Quinn with no real danger to them, then add in their jungler and his Ekko who was obviously doing poorly as well. Just gotta look at it realistically and not \"Best case scenario in a bad situation\" instead of trying to jump to \"well you could just do better\".","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-01-22T03:44:54.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have my babies!

That's what my skill level and game knowledge was.  Bronze 5.  \nLook in the mirror.  Look for opportunity and capitalize on mistakes of others.  you got a shit team for this one game, I get it.  Take what you can from it and move on.  \n\nThe \"It isn't my fault\" attitude will get you absolutely nowhere.  \n\nOther lanes feed.... play jungle....\nMy ADC is shit ... play support... \n\nThere is always something you can do..  Take it or leave it. \n\n\nLata.............","replies":[{"poster":"GahRii","date":"2016-01-21T23:27:17.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've done everything I'm capable of doing & I can't achieve improvement if there's people that are actively working against me improving, because they think it's funny.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"weeaboomer","date":"2016-01-22T07:13:49.280+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet the point still stands.

At this level, you are winning about 55-67% of your games. This takes into account your trolls and feeders (remember that both teams have it, but the chances of one being your team, 4/10 is less than the enemy's chances, 5/10).\n\nIf you play at a gold+ level, bronze games should be way too easy for you. You should be getting fed and one-man carrying most of your games regardless if there is a feeder/troll on your team (with the exception for cases where the enemy is constantly running into the enemy team no purpose, but these scenarios are uncommon and should not deter you from climbing). I am plat this in season 5 and gold in seasons before it. From my perspective (when I was gold), bronze players were painfully bad. Like - it's not even... oh they're a little bit worse than me. It was more like... holy crap these people either have $100 computers or they're just downright mentally challenged. Bronze players are bad beyond imagination; and therefore if truly deserve to be gold+, you should be able to carry with blindfolds on (exaggeration).\n\nIf you are winning ~50% or less of your games, you are bronze - PERIOD.\n\nHow to determine your level: Play AI games at the hardest difficulty \n\nRequired: Pick a champion you have never played or is not very proficient with - do not pick your \"main\".\nIf you're losing your lane, you are bronze.\nIn a situation where your teammates are losing lane, if you cannot carry them against AI - you are bronze.\nIf your games against AI's are closely contested, you are bronze.\nIf your farm at 20 minutes is below 100, you are bronze.\nIf your farm at 20 minutes is below 130, you are low to mid silver - basically bronze.\nIf you are clearly winning, but require to put in effort, you are low to mid silver - which is basically bronze.\nIf you are clearly winning, but only because you need to cheese to get ahead, you are low to mid silver - which is basically bronze.\nIf you are clearly winning with little effort, you are silver.\nIf you are getting fed like crazy (consistently), you MIGHT be high silver/low gold.\n\nIn insure getting out of bronze, your score in an AI game should consistently, with your worse champion, be something like... 15+/0-2/5+ with 150+ farm @ 20 minutes. The farm number is considered low, but I'm taking into account you running around and KSing your teammates.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2016-01-22T14:40:40.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are in fact getting afk/feeders every game and you are never one of them then statistically they should be on the enemy team more frequently than yours eventually allowing you to won more and climb out of that shitty elo. \n\nDespite that if you want to avoid those kind of games I'd suggest experimenting with the time of the day you play ranked. I've noticed that when you play ranked changes the experience to a large degree.
