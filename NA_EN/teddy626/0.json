On wifi, the games i play, SOMETIMES it randomly dc's me and takes like...10-15 seconds to reconnect me, and this has been consistent since i got the new router. This also happens to me on Heros of the storm, accept i have to literally log out of the game, then log back in to get my connection back. Is there anything I can do to make this stop happening? I refuse to do ranked with this situation happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-20T00:34:29.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue could be coming from your router or some settings since swapping for the new one.  To start, see if a [power cycle](https://kb.netgear.com/19755/How-to-Power-Cycle-Your-Home-Network?cid=wmt_netgear_organic) can help but test it in a custom game.
