I played poorly lvl 1 and gave up first blood. My adc then tilted and starting making up lies and my mid and jg fed into that because they were playing poorly. They kept typing I was afk to enemy  which i wasn't, can even watch the game. They died a combined 10 deaths in the first few mins of the game. Basically they were using racist comments and kept typing every chance they had to influence the other players. I think I kept pretty cool and tried to finish out the game. I dont have a history of toxicity and believe i only had a chat suspension once about 3 months ago. I got 9 false reports probably for being pretty calm and only 2 chat logs of poor sportsmanship yet Im being banned?

The only behavior a person can control is their own, so that's the only behavior Riot looks at when determining punishments. If they had to account for \"but he took my lane\" and \"did you see what he said though\" and \"he was afk anyway\" and \"they started it\" and every other excuse under the sun, there would be no punishments and the game would be crushed under the weight of this poor behavior.\n\nBy the way, what you consider \"calm\" is not what others consider \"calm.\" Also, calling your teammates \"losers,\" \"useless,\" and \"horrible\" is totally unacceptable. There's never any justification for doing that.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-02-16T12:40:17.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=NAAEOB3E,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-16T07:39:01.639+0000)\n>\n> Why do you keep bringing up other people's behavior?  \n\nBecause they think the behavioral system judges people on a single instance and compared one's behavior against another. \n\nSadly, we don't have the transparency to let people know it's based on consistency x severity.\n\nWould be nice if the reform card actually wrote something like the following:\n\n###*57 games out of your last 242 games were deemed to be below community standards and was used in consideration of your punishment.

Think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nIt is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some shit as well. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game.\n\nKeep in mind that the reform card only shows you 1-5 recent games as examples of unacceptable behavior,  doesn't mean you were punished for those 2 games alone.

Restricted Chat was placed on your account. Accounts that show signs of persistent negative behavior are often first punished with chat restrictions. When this feature is active, you will have a limited number of chat messages you can send while in game.\n\nHere are some chat logs from games where you were heavily reported:\n\nGame 2978869781:\nwontontonton: hmm\nwontontonton: gg\nwontontonton: lol\nwontontonton: you shouldve pushed the wave or started e\nwontontonton: lol\nwontontonton: but you were at tower lol\nwontontonton: sure\nwontontonton: dont push now omg\nwontontonton: lol\nwontontonton: what a game\nwontontonton: can we just ff plz\nwontontonton: lol\nwontontonton: i said one thing\nwontontonton: then you shut up too\nwontontonton: it was you buddy lol\nwontontonton: how is it me\nwontontonton: mf was at tower\nwontontonton: when they leaswshed\nwontontonton: how am i afk lol\n[All]wontontonton: how am i afk lol\n[All]wontontonton: annie getting mad and blaming every for her losing lane?\n[All]wontontonton: lol i never said anthing lol\nwontontonton: LOL\nwontontonton: sb players lol\n[All]wontontonton: how am i afk lol?\nwontontonton: like you at lvl 1\nwontontonton: keep making up shiit buddy\nwontontonton: its you lol\nwontontonton: omg\nwontontonton: omg\nwontontonton: lol\nwontontonton: its so you\nwontontonton: never kid\nwontontonton: lol\nwontontonton: its you 2\nwontontonton: you guys weird\nwontontonton: how does me affect you losing mid so hard lol\nwontontonton: you died 3 times in 2 mins\nwontontonton: and youre blaming\n[All]wontontonton: this annie blaming me lol\nwontontonton: its this annie and mf\n[All]wontontonton: this annie omg\nwontontonton: youre lower rank and played more games and have lower kda for adc\nwontontonton: whys that then\nwontontonton: you ahve more deaths than me lol\nwontontonton: you guys ar ejust a horrible duo\nwontontonton: stop complaining\nwontontonton: how am i trolling\nwontontonton: wow\nwontontonton: like im playing\nwontontonton: this mf was at tower lvl 1when they leashed\nwontontonton: how is that my fault\nwontontonton: no i wasnt\nwontontonton: wow\nwontontonton: so now youre going to lie\nwontontonton: you honestly got problems\nwontontonton: you shouldve pushed for lvl 2 first duh\nwontontonton: they just walked up to me\nwontontonton: and you stood there\nwontontonton: im playing you guys are typing\nwontontonton: 3 players with the worse score playing the blame game lol\n\nGame 2977557620:\nwontontonton: jsut back\nwontontonton: ffs\nwontontonton: every lane losing\nwontontonton: you couldve gotten first kill if you ignited\nwontontonton: muting you jax\nwontontonton: this jax is so useless\nwontontonton: you have 90 cs lol\nwontontonton: jax youre horrible\nwontontonton: youve been free farming all day and losing\nwontontonton: its you buddy\nwontontonton: omg\nwontontonton: useless honestly\nwontontonton: you died llv\nwontontonton: to vlad\nwontontonton: LOL\nwontontonton: why do i get these bronze players\nwontontonton: its free\n[All]wontontonton: our jax is papaer\nwontontonton: better than you for sure\n\nI know these can be subjective concepts. I myself was once banned for calling my teammates “weak, fleshy underlings.” Even though I meant well, enough of them reported me for it that I re-programmed my communication style. By acting diplomatic and calm, I’m now able to bend them to my will without succumbing to the forbidden dance of verbal abuse.\n\nSometimes it’s best to ignore the mewlings of your teammates and only focus on what you can control. If teammates anger you, try saying so out loud to yourself, not in chat where they can report you. After an annoying game, find a satisfying way to blow off steam. I’m told humans find catharsis in music, so try listening to Mozart or the dulcet sounds of “LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR.”\n\nI hope I have been useful to you. Although my heart is cold and mechanical, I feel we now have a deep connection and bond.
