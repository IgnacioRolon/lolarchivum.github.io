I figured it wasn't that big of a deal, I hurried to restart my computer and get back in. When I was finally able to get back online, the game was over. I tried to rejoin queue, but ended up getting this:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/9skyw\r\nSo I restarted my computer again, same thing. I then went into the settings menu and did the league of legends repair, issue persisted. So I said fuck it and completely uninstalled. Same issue again. I then reinstalled windows, league, and some steam games where the only things on it so I figured what the hell. The issue persisted. So I finally contacted riot support. They haven't been able to help me.\r\nI gave my username and password to a friend in another state, they logged on and they also got the same message I was getting.\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/JsNhA\r\nWhat can I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T23:22:45.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see that you still have a ticket open, and a Specialist is working with you to figure out what's going on.  Our tech team will continue helping you individually and get a solution. I know there's a lot of steps but it's important to go over them to both rule out possibilities and fix this up.  Make sure to reply back with the requests!","replies":[{"poster":"ZerroShadows","date":"2017-01-13T23:26:10.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have ran through all their steps. And have completely ruled out the idea that it is my computer or network like they are implying. I have logged in with a new account on my computer and I'm able to play. I have had my account logged in by someone in another state, and they saw the same error message I'm seeing. This is an account specific issue. I just want to be able to play again before work picks back up. This issue has persisted since Wednesday, and haven't heard from my support ticket at all today. =[","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T23:37:06.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha!  So it looks like you recently left a game.  The leave prompted a message panel that introduces you to the Leaverbuster system.  Since you're on the updated client per your screenshots, the message prompt is not showing up.  Return to the legacy client, agree to the message box, and you should be all set:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that does the trick!\n\n(btw, change your password and secure your account since you shared it with a friend and isn't something we support).","replies":[{"poster":"ZerroShadows","date":"2017-01-14T00:00:40.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude... I love you! \n\nFor future reference, the message didn't pop up when I tried to join a ranked queue, only when I tried to join a normal blind pick. You just solved an issue that the riot support ticket didn't even get close to solving. I wish I had posted here at the start instead of posting a ticket. Thank you so much. If there is a way I could tip you I would. You deserve it!\n\n(I changed my password before I gave them the account to try it, and changed it back after, so my account is secure. I was just pulling my hair out trying to figure out what was wrong.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nauseating Plays","date":"2018-02-03T00:12:20.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, i'm having the same issue but you cant open the legacy client anymore","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"pro rusher 2","date":"2017-08-31T22:11:20.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i am not sure where to ask this. but i have same problem and i just cant fix it :(","replies":[]}]}]}
