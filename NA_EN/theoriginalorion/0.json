I have many hours in the game now and play with my friends a lot, my friends have all found a main champion that they play, and I still don&#039;t have a champion over level 4. I can&#039;t find a champion that I am good at and is fun, I like top/mid/jungle  I have played as Yi jungle and enjoyed it but I can&#039;t see myself maining him, I played Top with nidalee and wukong, I really enjoy playing both of them but I can&#039;t see myself maining ether of them ether ATM. I could probably main one of them but I can&#039;t decide, If anyone had any tips on how to find a champion to main please let me know. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"6T4OwdQQAJ","date":"2015-07-20T23:20:12.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"freind me in game\ni can literally give u every benefit and defect of playing support champions and i can coach u on just about any support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colonel k1","date":"2015-07-20T23:20:00.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see why you can't main {{champion:11}}  ,when you already like him. If played correctly, he is an absolute monster, especially with the recent buffs to devourer. As far as finding what you like, narrow it down to certain things. Do you like auto attacking things? Do you like casting spells from range? Do you like giving your teammates heals and shields? Then go from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angelofchaos16x","date":"2015-07-20T23:17:55.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. You do not have to have a main, many people are good at many champs and enjoy swapping the champs that they play a lot\n2. First Narrow down what do you like. Top lane ? Ok , but then what ? Bruiser ? Tank ? Mage ? Assassin ? Supportive ?. Its the same question for each role\n3. It takes time and experimenting to find a main.It will not always be fast, and sometimes it will come to you out of the blue.\nStep 2 is the most important to find your main tho, tell me and I can suggest to you and tell you my opinion, but only you can decide.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kiwi killerz","date":"2015-07-20T23:13:28.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try someone like {{champion:5}}  or {{champion:254}} , {{champion:254}} is an amazing toplane/jungle and if you wanna just mess around try her support. it takes some skill but makes for a fun match. Mid is a good place for someone like {{champion:79}}  who is also a good jungle if you want to try him there, also he can be played top if you like.","replies":[]}]}
