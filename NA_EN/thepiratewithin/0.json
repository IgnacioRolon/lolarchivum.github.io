The thing is, after resetting the client because of server issues, a video popped up talking about how the calling card would give me Sett for free, and i got the calling card, i was wondering, if perhaps i could use the calling card for anything else, or if Riot could refund me the Champion so i can get him through the calling card.\nSince everyone i knew was talking about how the Calling Card giving Sett was too good to be true, i didn't even think about opening it first, not to mention i couldnt open it at the time already.\nSo can anyone help me out here?\nThanks\n\n(P.S: I don't really know what board this belongs to, since it's not a bug and stuff.)","replies":[]}
