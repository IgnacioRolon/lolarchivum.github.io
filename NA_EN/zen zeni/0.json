I'm tired of getting promoted then immediately demoted because of a 3+ games in a row of AFKs or intentional feeders. Other than that I win most of my games. B4 but lost many many games in a row to get here.

There is nothing wrong with this. I would recommend looking at your own play and seeing what you do then comparing it to professional player VODs (watch without sound you are there to improve not be entertained). As far as trolls and ragers i recommend Sky Williams DST (Dick Sucking Theory) basically try to take them off tilt, do NOT point out \"Hey you are on tilt\" because that really does nothing but annoy them more.

Theres nothing to learn from my peers the games are pure luck. And as an ADC main i cant control engages on team fights and i seriously dont know what im doing wrong. Im nice. I mute rude players. I really do not know why i can not advance.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-28T20:37:13.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly look at replays, don't just go from memory, see when you could have pushed an advantage, taken an objective, denied CS. The biggest thing is realizing in low elo (lower than gold I would say) it is a single player game. You can't depend on your team. Sorry this is such a late response I just checked the boards again","replies":[]}]}]}]}
