I'd be pretty cautious of making too proxy focused a champion however, since it's a playstyle that's got quite low engagement with other players. \n\nMight be some room to make a champion that's got abilities targeted at situational proxying though. Having said that I can also see an argument that Singed's already a really good take on that concept.","replies":[{"poster":"Philantrophe","date":"2015-03-29T14:29:33.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow...

The clone have a maximum range ( So you can use it from the base / can't proxy while being undertower) and have the HP that you used to create him. Exemple : You have 1000HP. So he create a clone with 250hp. \nEDIT : The clone could get different abilities, like proxying-ability and bonus damage to minions, and the original champion fighting abilities.\n\nThe original champion is still possible to kill, and can't get healed (including the hp regen) while controlling the clone.\nYou have to be careful, and use your clone wisely, because you are vulnerable, and if your clone die for nothing , you just lost 25% of your HP for nothing.\n\nThe problem is , if he goes full AD / lifesteal, he can just spam clones, deal damage with them , then lifesteal back. So i think the clone stats (except HP) should scale with something non-ad. (exemple:  the clone get 20% of your AP / AD / Armor / MR  +1% for every XXX bonus hp that the champion have )\n\nSorry for my bad english , i hope you all understand what i mean.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2015-03-28T22:50:48.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of a very fast, but very low damage champion whose focus is more pure roaming than actual ganking. The closest i come to that in playstyle is when i go as hecarim, use E, get into lane, scare the crap out of the laner and maybe get a Q/AA in, then get out, back to jungling. A tank built on hyper speed and vision with little CC or damage capacity.\n\nThematically it could easily be a living remnant of hecarim's centaurish civilisation, there's a whole ton of lore to look at there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2sips","date":"2015-09-23T15:25:42.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A champ that lowers Ping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-03-30T18:25:37.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A champion that revolves around \"haunting\" an enemy champion, meaning following and messing with them but not really killing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weegee","date":"2015-03-29T16:30:40.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know who would make a good proxy character of some sort?\n{{champion:133}} \n\nThe whole idea of Quinn is that she and Valor sneak into enemy territory.

I mean lets be serious if something goes wrong they will just depend on these items whenever they end up in some bad situation just because they weren't paying attention and they just pray they will survive.\n\nSo you know you will only be able to seal 1 item from only 1 champion.Having a passive that can seal away more then 1 item would be too much.\n\nSo that's why im suggesting that a champion with such a passive would be great.For example:\n\n\n1.Players focus so much in earning gold and use it to buy items and a champion with a passive that can seal away an item will give them the advantage they need to turn around a fight when they are low on gold. \n    You know what i mean right? \n    Gold=Items\n\n2.No more miracles for enemy players.NO MORE SECOND CHANCES YOU WILL ONLY HAVE 2 CHOICE FIGHT OR DIE(NO MORE {{item:3157}} FOR YOU GUYS OR {{item:3026}} )\n\n3.Since you have a passive that can seal any item you should figure out what item would be the best to be sealed.I mean yeah it would be great to seal away the items i mentioned early but it would be really great to seal away items like {{item:3089}} from {{champion:7}} ,{{champion:30}} ,{{champion:55}} and so on.It would reduce the damage their ability's would do.\n\nP.S. Yes it also applies to the items passive. \n\nBy the way if you are going to seriously use these ideas for creating a new champion may i suggest that this champion should be originally from Noxus but because she/he doesn't agree with the idea of gaining strength no matter the cost and so she/he will start a rebellion and she/he will be the Leader Of The Rebellion and will have allies like Riven and some Demacian champions(Well i'm sure not everyone will agree her/his presence but Jarvan IV should agree with her/his ideals),and Poppy who will just love to see the current Noxus leaders pay for their crimes.\n\nI hope you like my ideas.My name is WishStar and please tell me what do you think about it and dont worry i wont judge :) .","replies":[]},{"poster":"phirestarter","date":"2015-03-28T22:27:35.432+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"This was the best idea IMHO:\n\n> refuses to follow commands 70% of the time and returns to base every 5m regardless of summoner commands\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/pG4W3R3l-we-need-an-autistic-champion","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-03-29T01:10:10.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"a champion that emulates playing on EUW servers?","replies":[]}]}]}
