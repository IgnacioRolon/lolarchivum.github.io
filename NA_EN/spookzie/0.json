My question is if your \"Q\" crits, it doesn't do 200% crit damage, it goes by what rank your \"Q\" is at?  Also, since i usually lvl up shiv first, my \"Q\" may be the last skill i rank up.  If i have an IE and my Q is rank 1, does it still only do 150% according to his \"Q\"s rank1?","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-10T01:30:07.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way Shaco's Q works is that it changes your base crit multiplier. The base multipler is the standard 200%. IE adds 50% to your base, it doesn't actually change the base despite what it says. This means if your Q is at rank 1, your crit damage is set to 140% instead of 200%. With an IE, it's only 190%, which isn't very much at all, but when maxed, it'll be 220% plus the 50% from IE, which is 270%. Shaco's Q with IE has been confusing for many players considering Infinity Edge's poor wording.","replies":[{"poster":"Spookzie","date":"2015-02-10T01:56:50.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So If i have \"Q\" at rank 1 with IE and i Q in and crit an enemy instead of just straight auto attacking, am i doing less damage?\n\nWhat does more damage Rank 1 \"Q\" with IE crit\nor\nRegular AA crit with IE","replies":[{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-02-10T03:46:43.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just treat IE's passive as something that adds 50% critical hit damage.\n\nRank 1 Q deals 140% crit damage.
