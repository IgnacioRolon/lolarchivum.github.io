Yes / No\".\n\nDo I click YES or do I click NO? I never changed the actual runes themselves, just the order of the pages in the menu.\n\nThis also pops up if I click on any other menu item like lobby, home, etc.\n\nIf I instead click on one of the rune pages I moved (in this scenario, 1 and/or 2), no popup shows and instead I have the option to either click on the golden highlighted \"SAVE\" button on the top right within the rune page editing screen, or simply just continue back to the lobby without saving anything.\n\nThere is an issue when you move rune pages around then do some combination of clicking either SAVE, and/or \"YES\", or \"NO\" on the \"Do you wish to save changes\" popup. That's how they get linked together and messed up. I just don't remember the _bad combination/way_ that causes the problem OR the _right combination/way_ to move the pages around without causing the problem.","replies":[]}]}]}
