I'm scared to touch anything else with those two now.~~\n\n***\n\n~~#Just kidding all the pages are screwed up again please help I can't play any league right now without pages!~~\n\n##Ok, I don't know WTF happened, but I closed the client and re-opened, and all the pages seem to have reverted to NORMAL (back to original positions and names)...\n\nI'm changing the names of every page that has either numbers in it or special symbols like @.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T02:34:16.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyooooooooo! \n\nSo as I said in your other thread, I really suspect that the main issue with these rune pages is when you use special characters like @ or have very similar names with only a number difference. Try changing those rune pages names to something a little more simpler without those symbols and see if that helps. \n\n~~I'm going to go ahead and reset that page with the @ symbol since you mentioned it hasn't been working~~, but let me know if you need more help on my end!\n\nEDIT: I wasn't able to find a rune page with an @ symbol, so let me know any that need fixing here and I'll get it done!","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-05-22T02:43:15.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea sorry for the confusion! Somehow I got it all working... I re-logged the client and all the pages \"reset\" back to how they were before I moved them around.\n\nThat didn't happen last time a few months ago, but thankfully it fixed itself.\n\nSo I removed all the pages with symbols in the names, and the trick now is to make sure you ALWAYS click \"save\" or \"YES\" to the pop-up that asks you to save your changes.\n\nSo the way to do it properly is:\n\n1. Re-organize your rune pages (I find it safer for my mental/emotional well-being, to move just one or two around at a time)\n2. Make sure to click SAVE or if you get a pop-up, click \"YES\" to save changes.\n3. Don't have any strange symbols or characters in the rune page names.\n\n***\n\nSo, Riot needs to really fix the issue of the rune pages getting \"out of sync\" from the user's client to the riot servers....","replies":[]}]}]}
