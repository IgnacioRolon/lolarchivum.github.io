It's not entirely uncommon, and happens sometimes when your network has some kind of blip or hiccup during patching. \n\nTry running a quick repair through the client options, and if that doesn't work you might need to use the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to run a **force repatch**. I would also be safe and try using an ethernet connection during the repair/repatch to make sure nothing goes wrong during the patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ISOzHell","date":"2017-12-21T23:49:05.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ƒåÞ GøÐ,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=IL13Xayu,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-12-20T04:13:47.172+0000)\n>\n> Nothing has changed on my PC or installations for months, other than the new patches from League.\n> \n> Getting random bug splats in champ select, causing me to get penalized.
