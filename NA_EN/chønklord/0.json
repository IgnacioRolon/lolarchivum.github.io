There should be an alternative fix to this (and other problems in the new client) that should not require going back to the legacy client. Be it reinstall or delete some config files. As a person in tech support myself the option of reverting to a soon to be discontinued product/version should be a last resort on the troubleshooting list not the first thing I see every time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T20:23:24.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing, and asking the OP to try the legacy is to help determine if the specific issue is with the client or something else- not fix it.
