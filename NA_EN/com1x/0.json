So what I propose is an idea to aid said issue. Let&#039;s say you have mastery 7 on Teemo. {{champion:17}} (Horrid, right?) Well, once you cap out at mastery 7, playing a champion seems to have no more... purpose. You don&#039;t get anything. What if there was a system that gave more tokens for getting an S or S+ on those champions, that when you disenchant them in your loot, you gain a small amount of blue essence. \r\n\r\nNow, this happens to be my first boards post, so I really have no real idea on what kind of information I should include in this as well as what I already have.","replies":[]}
