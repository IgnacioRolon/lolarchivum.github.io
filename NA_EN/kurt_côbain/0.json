I can't remember the exact details and why. But I would like to know if it falls under chargeback and if I can get my account unsuspended. I've submitted support tickets and I'll keep waiting on them. I just want to know if my account can be unsuspended and how. I would love to pay back the money I refunded but I'm currently broke and a college student. Anyways Thanks for Reading have a wonderful day.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T18:36:46.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since we'll need to take a look at your account to address this and you've already submitted a ticket, I recommend waiting for an account specialist to get back to you in your ticket.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Kurt Côbain","date":"2016-09-27T19:05:17.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually figured out it is considered chargeback through a Riot employee on Reddit ty anyways","replies":[]}]}]}
