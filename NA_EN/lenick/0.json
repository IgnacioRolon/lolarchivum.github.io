I've searched almost every site but nothing works at all. Is this again some Riot Game bullshit that they need to fix or is there some special fix to this ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-30T16:36:29.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error may not be specific to League but an underlying problem with your OS or DirectX.  As a first step, your best bet would be to update your drivers and update Windows.
