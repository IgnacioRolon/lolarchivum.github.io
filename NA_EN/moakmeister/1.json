I am currently Silver IV and have only been playing this game since Vel'Koz's release. \nThat said, I have mained Skarner for several months and I would like to state what I think of his upcoming rework in Patch 5.16. I have posted RiotRepertoir's PBE thread above. The reception from Summoners has been... horrible, to say the least. People accused Riot of ruining the champion and making him too gimmicky. While I certainly agree with the latter, I'd like to keep an open mind. Here are my thoughts:\n\nThe good:\nThe amount of attack speed that Skarner receives from his Spires is massive. At level 18, he will boost his attack speed by 150% near the Spires. At level 1, he gets 48% attack speed - the same amount that his old level five Q gave him. His Q no longer grants attack speed, and attacks against minions and monsters only reduce the cooldown by .25 seconds, but the ability's cooldown is reduced to 2.5 seconds at max rank, and because of the huge attack speed from the Spires, he might be able to use the Q faster than he did before. He also has no need for a blue buff, because he gets 3% of his mana back while under Spire. These traits actually make it a possibility that Skarner could solo the dragon as soon as it spawns. His W is significantly improved, actually scaling with his health - a lot of his health. It's Sion's shield on steroids. Now I'm not stuck with an 80-300 shield as a tank (although Skarner's tankiness was always ridiculous). His E has his old passive moved to it, and all we have to do to stun someone is land the E and then autoattack. Applying the stun also reduces the cooldown of his E by one second, and ulting someone reduces it by 1.75 seconds. His ult now does more physical damage than magic damage. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but apparently Skarner will also be granted movement speed during his ult. The PBE forum says \"Makes his R a bit more dangerous once landed, as he will always have his passive's Movement Speed bonus while dragging his victim\". Due to the way it's worded, I'm not sure about this, but it would be a huge buff if this ends up being the case.\nI'm also a bit happy that despite his Q nerfs, the ability at least does more damage. Skarner does, after all, have the highest base AD in the game, and now it actually ramps up even more as he levels.\n\nThe bad:\nI'm beating a dead horse here, but it is a huge weakness that Skarner has be near the Spires AND have them captured already to get the bonus and be at his full potential. I get that in order for the enemy team to capture the Spires, Skarner's team has to already have captured them beforehand, meaning that the enemy team can never capture the ones in their jungle unless Skarner ventures over to do a bit of counterjungling. However, being solely dependent on the Spires for power spikes and not his Q is a downfall. The Spires won't help him at all during ganks because they're nowhere near the lanes. His Crystal Venom passive will be missed. I know that his E instantly applies the Venom to a target, but we have to land it first, and if we don't, the gank is over. He can't apply it with his Q any longer, which will probably feel clumsy. His ult also won't deal more damage to a target if they have the Venom on them, but at least it won't consume the Venom, so I can E someone, ult, then autoattack for 2.75 seconds of continuous immobility. Also, and by far the biggest, is that Skarner is useless when trying to defend his base. He can't do much while keeping super minions off his Nexus turrets, wchich could lose him the game.\n\nI guess that's it for my thoughts. Comment what you guys think about the rework. While I definitely don't think it's perfect, Keep an open mind. Maybe this will actually be a good thing for Skarner. Gl and hf all.\n\nEdit: I guess I should input my thoughts on Runes and Masteries then. Right now (before the rework), I run Marks of Attack Speed and Quints of Movement Speed. After this rework I'll change them to Marks of Attack Damage and Quints of Scaling Health. My Masteries won't change. 0/27/3 jungle tank.\n\nEdit: Hey guys. PBE gameplay videos have come out recently, and after watching them, I've concluded that Skarner's rework will make him incredibly strong. It turns out that stunning with his E actually not only reduces the cooldown, but also will grant him the Spire bonus for the duration of the stun, and stunning multiple people will keep it going longer. So he CAN get buffs away from his Spires. Also in conjunction with the new items (Dead Man's Plate, Sterak's Gage and Titanic Hydra), Skarner will gain so much health and attack damage that he will be one of the strongest tanks in the game. Under the Spires, a fed Tryndamere won't be able to 1v1 him, and even without the Spires he will still be a powerhouse. I am very satisfied with this rework, and hope that everyone else can grow to like it as well. Gl and hf all.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-13T01:00:17.353+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi Moakmauler,\n\nThanks for the write-up on your Skarner thoughts. Sorry I haven't been over to the PBE forums the last few days to read it.\n\nOne of the main pain points for players with Skarner's changes, as you have well identified, is the feeling of what to do when they are not near a crystal they own, and for a lot of these players, they just hate the idea of it. I pushed Skarner's strengths and weaknesses pretty hard, and because they're so stark, I think it lets his strengths be _really_ strong. I know this won't be for everyone, and I'm not pushing for Skarner to be a character of broad appeal like Yasuo or something, but we do think we can hit the balance where there are players that are accepting of, and even excited about, his strength/weakness profile, even if it's not the majority.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2015-08-13T01:29:28.507+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel like recent updates have made League of Legends feel like a game that is too bloated with minigames.

This is in comparison to right now, where if Skarner is ahead it's very difficult to deal with him.  That's the sense I get from this, at least.  His Q is weaker early but stronger later, and to ensure he clears camps fast and safely in the early game his spires give some massive attack speed and mana regeneration.\n\nI've also seen Skarner have some massive impact at dragon fights if his team captures the crystal.\n\nI really think Skarner just needs to see the return of one key feature: His sticking power.  The only reason Skarner has ever worked correctly in the past is because he can stay on a target.  We've seen that attaching it to his Q tends to make Skarner snowball hard (because his sticking power becomes essentially permanent).  \n\nWhat I'd like to see is a semi-rework of his E in order to fit the bill.  I don't know if you remember a this far back, but way back with the initial Skarner rework (Patch 4.2) many people were suggesting that if he lands his E on somebody, he could auto-attack them or Crystal Slash them to prolong the duration of his E's slow (Ask RiotScruffy about it, he might remember).  **Scruffy himself even said that this would be reasonable**, and that the only trade-off would be a slightly weaker slow than what they buffed it to the following patch (they increased his E slow by 15% at all ranks).\n\nWhat this means for PBE Skarner?  It would probably mean his stun is removed off of his E in favor of a potential long duration slow (like, as long as Nasus's Wither) **IF** Skarner can attack his enemy enough to extend the slow as far as it'll go.  As a sidenote, his E passive wouldn't really work anymore because he cannot stun to lower the cooldown (and maybe his E cooldown would be reverted to live values).  That effect should just move to a part of his R's active: \"While Skarner suppresses an enemy champion with Impale he gains Crystal Energy.\".\n\nHere's exactly what RiotScruffy said on this idea way back in 2014 though.\n\n> **RiotScruffy:**\nI see a bunch of posts about a mechanic where a Q or auto could extend the E slow. This is actually pretty reasonable and is something that we could do. Realistically if we added this mechanic, we would not be able to buff the slow amount as much. In this case, as a Skarner player, which would you rather have?\n> \n> -A stronger E slow like proposed with same 2.5s duration\n> \n> or \n> \n> -A (less than first option) stronger E slow that can be extended for additional time with Q or auto attack damage\n> \n> I'm glad that we are having some good suggestions on ways to improve the kit and both of these mechanics could work out well.\n\n[I found this here, on the old forums.](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4272804&page=162)  May need to scroll down a bit though.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2015-08-13T17:56:29.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Messaiga,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aETVwEIl,comment-id=0002000100010001,timestamp=2015-08-13T17:07:30.776+0000)\n>\n> Could the \"why\" reason be that these crystals help make Skarner less able to snowball into a monster?

If his team is winning, he controls spires in the enemy jungle. That means that his team will *keep* control of the enemy jungle. And if he doesn't have control of his jungle, he won't get access to his jungle's spires.","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-08-13T18:04:05.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the only thing I've been worried about.

Even when there is disagreement, you are willing to talk.\n\nI'm one of those players who hates your vision for Skarner and his crystals. Skarner is one of the two jungle champs I like to play. I have his Battlecast skin. I've played him for a while, though certainly not as long as many of the others who have posted about this. It isn't just that this rework isn't for everyone: it seems like it isn't for even for Skarner's *current playerbase*. The vision of Skarner as a premier neutral objective controller is something that has never been his identity. I play Skarner because I enjoy the feeling of being this lawnmower, racing around in team fights, being able to shift from target to target, (in his most recent kit) stunning those people and spamming spells. I think that is fairly common to the vast majority of the Skarner player base. I don't value the extreme restrictions you put on his kit. I will never be excited about Skarner's crystal iteration. I don't want to play this neutral objective controller. I want to play my amazing, peeling John Deere riding mower chugging out smoke as he flies out of nowhere into a fight. The steps you took to restore the ability of applying his stun multiple times in a team fight are nice. But I honestly can't get excited about the idea of fixed points of power.\n\nI still don't understand why Skarner's identity needs to be changed the way you have envisioned. I don't expected Skarner to need broad appeal.

Since the enemy can simply _not fight on the spires,_ this means Skarner is ALWAYS going to be weaker where it _actually counts-_ in ganks, when assaulting or defending towers, and when assaulting or defending the base. Yes, he _will_ be hypothetically stronger for securing Dragons and Barons (only hypothetically of course, because they enemy can easily get position to take control of the spires based on the fact that _their jungler can actually gank effectively_) but is that worth having a _painfully_ sub-par champion on your team at all other points in the game?

He is definitely still a powerhouse outside his Spire range. Why are we wasting our breath on this anyway? We all need to focus more on getting Shaco deleted from the game. #deleteshaco2015","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CoffeeCreamy","date":"2020-02-15T03:18:15.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcane Azmadi,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aETVwEIl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-12T22:54:24.439+0000)\n>\n> The fact that Riot still thinks the stupid spires are a smart idea on a champion who was always supposed to be very gank-focused makes me give up on them in despair. Skarner HAS to be powerful outside the area of his spires, or else he's just worthless. What are you going to do when you're besieging the enemy base, or being besieged in yours? What are you going to do during a gank when the enemy jungler shows up to countergank? I'll tell you what you're going to do: you're going to fucking die.\n> \n> Riot seem oblivious to the fact that, even for a jungler, the entire game _does not take place in the jungle._ No I'm NOT going to keep an open mind. As far as I'm concerned, the entire fucking stupid spire rework idea makes as much sense as saying \"Hey I know, let's rework Ashe into a tank!\"\n\nWhat if his ultimate ability allowed him to place a spire at the target location- like a quick place team buff for teamfights and dragon/baron takes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-08-13T13:39:14.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried the new Hydra item on Skarner?
