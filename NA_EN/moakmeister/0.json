(Urgent)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\nI've just been placed in a lower priority queue for the second time ever. This is due to me having bugsplats frequently when I try to begin a game. It happens at random, but it will ALWAYS happen on my first game after turning on my computer, unless the computer has been on and was being used for several hours. The screen will just stay black forever and ever, and the computer will only do anything if I hit Control, Alt, Delete and select \"Task Manager\", which causes the League error message to pop up. Stop me if you've heard this one before: \"Please make sure your graphics card is up to date.\" Ugh. Anyway, this crash can also occur if I am in the loading screen or am already in the game, and I Alt-Tab for ANY reason. When I click back on the game icon to get back to the game, it crashes. \nLast week, I actually figured out how to get the game to load after a bugsplat. If one occurs, I just Control, Alt, Delete, select task manager, and then when the error message comes up, I just close the game completely and re-open it and relog. This worked reliably for about a week, but for the last two days it has stopped working. Now I just keep crashing over and over and over, which cost me a ranked game yesterday because I only managed to finally get into the game thirteen minutes in. Today it happened with a normal game, thankfully, but I NEVER managed to get into the game, and I just kept crashing for almost a half hour. That was when I got the notification for being placed in a lower priority queue. \nIt's infuriating. How on earth am I supposed to stop this from happening?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-08T23:42:29.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely get the urgency, getting bugsplats is not fun.

There's no way of knowing if it'll crash the next time though.\nBut I did try the options on that crash page. I ran the cleanup program on league and put my NVIDIA defaults back on.","replies":[]}]}]}
