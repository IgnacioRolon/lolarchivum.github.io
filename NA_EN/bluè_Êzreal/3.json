During the middle of a game even sometimes the champion loading screen my League will just minimize itself for no apparent reason.  Nothing in the background is opened.  League just minimizes itself to my desktop.  Not sure if its a problem on my end or what.  \r\n\r\nThe game doesnt close or anything and i can easily just re open it but its just an annoyance because it seems to always happen at the worst time lol","replies":[{"poster":"RoakOriginal","date":"2017-11-27T13:27:38.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"kabkabx","date":"2017-06-23T05:32:40.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently same thing started happening to me.

This was a problem for me for a while, when you get a skype message, it pops up on top of the map, but invisible, so anytime you click in that corner, it gets focus and tabs you. Some antivirus use a similar popup, so check those too, enable any game mode or similar that they may have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SarahElle","date":"2017-02-13T22:12:29.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens to me once and a while.
