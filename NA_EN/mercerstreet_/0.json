Even when you reach lvl 30, you will be terrible.\n\nThey prevent you from playing with other lvl 30 players, because you would make the experience bad for them.\n\nUse this time wisely. Learn to rolfstomp bots. You should go 20/4 in bot games. Once you are doing that on 3-5 champs, if you are still not lvl 30, buy a boost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Code Capitalist","date":"2016-10-24T14:30:49.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems like a very long time.
