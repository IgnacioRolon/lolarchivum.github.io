Really scummy though.\n\nIt's not about \"including morality.\" It's against the rules to disappear into the jungle or attack-move down a lane while alt-tabbed just because you've given up on the game and don't want to respect the results of the surrender vote. Making it \"convincing\" is just an attempt to avoid getting caught while doing something that you know is against the rules. Encouraging people to break the game's rules is against Boards rules, by the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-16T02:28:51.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"What I actually suggested was that they *don't* AFK.

The method they have chosen is AFK farm by attack move and alt tab.\n\nThat, could be consider trolling. On top of the fact that it is also planned, therefore a threat to his team. You know what though, let's take a step back and assume by threat they mean something life threatening. OP still is admitting that they will essentially be Non-participant. This is based off the \"attack move, AFK farm, and alt tab out\"\n\nWhen it is all said and done, punishing or not would be up to Riot as in the terms it says:\n\n>The User Rules posted to our websites, apps and games or set out in this section are not meant to be exhaustive, and we reserve the right to modify them, as well as take appropriate disciplinary measures including temporary bans, account suspension or termination and deletion to protect the integrity and spirit of the Riot Services, regardless of whether a specific behavior is listed in the User Rules as inappropriate.\n\nAs for the whiny bitch part, yes I figured that would be a common response people may have towards the attitude of someone who has a tantrum due to a failed surrender vote. I do try to look at others perspectives and put myself in others shoes. Which is why I specified that I wasn't. Do I think what op is doing/talking about scummy? Absolutely. Doesn't mean I need to call them names though, I do assume others will though.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-16T02:13:23.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's pretty shady- but fair. Still, they have a responsibility to be non-discriminatory, so if they do it once, they are expected to hold that as a standard or reverse it. That part merely is saying that things can change, (edit) not saying they'll do whatever they want whenever they want.\n\nAlt-tabbing isn't punishable, AFK is (edit again: though he said AFK farm, whether or not he's really AFK is uncertain). If he goes back often enough to keep himself from getting killed over and over, that's really the least that is expected of him under the current defined rules. All about standards and expectations.\n\n(final edit) Sorry about the accusation tone. I've been very salty when seeing specialists or moderators saying more than what I've been punished for, but still... perhaps it's best to not insert what insults you imagine will be given for their behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2020-02-16T07:04:49.903+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no.

To me it sounds like he doesn't care if he gets killed while alt tabbed doing his AFK push every x seconds. \n\nEh, I get where you're coming from. It could easily be taken as me trying to skirt around the rules. I have had things removed before for such misunderstandings. When I intentionally toe the line, I'm usually straight forward about it, even stating I know I may have action taken against me.\n\nFair, I can't make promises it won't happen again, but I'll try to be more aware and catch it. üêº","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2020-02-15T17:48:59.310+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually you dont have the right to do whatever you want.
