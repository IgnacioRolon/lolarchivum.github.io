And I don't lose my temper when the score is for example 0-5, as 5 kills is a small dfference and kills aren't everything.\r\n\r\nBut something that is important to realise is that not all games can be won, nor should it be expected. When your bot lane has gone 0-15 by minute 10, your mid laner keeps disconnecting and reconnecting and spends more time in the fountain the and your bot lane decides to give up, its over. \r\n\r\nYes, it is _technically_ winnable, but in the vast majority of people's opinion, it is not worth the effort. It's better to just end it and try again in the next game. And yet, these people that lost their lane hard and blame the jungler, flame hard and refuse to follow pings/advice also refuse to ff, effectively holding the other 4 players hostage in a game that is finished. It has to drag on for another 10-15 minutes. I think this is the main cause of people losing their temper; being forced to stick around in a shit game with people with a shit attitude. At best, we will farm on autopilot, alt tabbing. At worst, they will afk or start trolling as well. \r\n\r\nThis fallacy that we sign up to some sort of pseudo agreement to stay until the end of the game is a lie. I don't know who the hell came up with this idea but it promotes bad behaviour and loss of people's temper. I am older and wiser now and understand it is just a game at the end of the day, so I don't get angry. I just ignore my team and play on auto pilot. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the ff15 threshold needs to be 4/1 to surrender as well as ff20.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2020-01-29T22:08:10.374+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah bro we scale\n\n- 0/7 Renekton speaking to his 2/4 Draven adc while they fight under nexus turrets at 17 minutes","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-29T20:43:58.009+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Fun fact - this isn't a problem because a game isn't \"clearly lost\" until the nexus falls.

It takes guts to not give up a game that is obviously lost. Whether its because of a lack of gaming knowledge or because they are pinning their hopes on that 0.01%. I admire as well as dislike them for it, obviously not to the point where I retaliate. When my teammates refuse to give up, I still play and let them see the end result. Then, move on. \n\nI've had a ton of games like these where people refuse to give up. Lost Inhibs, lost Baron, Elder is on the table and there are no wards. Either the support is not giving a dime or the team won't help the support ward. Either way, its a team game. Some amount of patience towards teammates should be acceptable! As frustratingly obvious a loss may be to you, give them the peace of mind to play it out. 10-15 minutes waste of time but its on you and all those players not to lose your tempers. Remember, _a little bit of kindness goes a long way_! Not everyone understands everything and perhaps, they're still learning - the lost match may not be as obvious to them as its to you. {{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2020-01-29T20:46:05.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Yes, it is technically winnable, but in the vast majority of people's opinion, it is not worth the effort.\n\nIf that were really true, the logical consequences would be that such games are only not surrendered in a tiny minority of the cases, no?
