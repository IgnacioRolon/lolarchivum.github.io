I talk about the potential problem I am seeing with it and how I fear it can affect competitive play. Also I know in the video I only describe a situation for poke/siege, but it goes all ways.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1TAuOAJBQc","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R1TAuOAJBQc/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"The video shows the perspective of a person called LS of the elemental dragons. \r\n\r\nBut does it have to be too difficult? Because what one could do is to &quot;list&quot; the dragons which are going to appear in order in champion select for everyone to see. It could be on the minimap displaying colours symbols/letters for display.\r\nThe main reason behind this is for players to draft team compositions around certain picks. Like: &quot;3 Clouds in a row? maybe {{champion:120}}  could be awesome&quot;. or &quot; there is earth and ocean drake, a siege comp could look good?&quot; {{champion:110}} {{champion:18}} \r\n&quot; its going to be 2 Infernals, lets get grab those early with our good early control&quot; {{champion:64}} {{champion:58}} \r\n\r\n This will encourage people to try and &quot;win the game&quot; from champion selection and try to be diverse with their picks and be good for the upcoming situations, and it will bring a whole new level in the competitive macro game.\r\nWithout proper foresight, things might just be a bit pointless, and people won&#039;t be enthusiastic about getting drakes. \r\nBut if there is foresight, you might automatically enable  picks like {{champion:20}}  who is all about the objective control, wheras now, {{champion:20}}  can be seen as a total troll pick because he is going to do a cointoss everytime he goes into a game, and that is a bit sad.\r\nIt might make drafts more weird as people will look for rad counters and such.\r\n\r\nIf not, there is a &quot;second option&quot; to make it less RNG\r\nYou can either just put a random drake or again tell which of the drakes start first\r\nand then, based on how long the drake has lived, it will start &quot;rotating elementals&quot; on who will be next.\r\nFor example, lets say the current order is:\r\nOcean Earth Fire and Cloud\r\nIf Earth then starts first, and dies within X seconds/minutes it will spawn Fire, \r\nbut if it does not die within X time, and dies over Y time then the cloud drake will spawn instead of fire\r\nand so on, within Z time\r\nyou could also just make an interval, like 1 minutes it rotates or so.\r\nThis will encourage even more control to make it live longer/or die at a certain time for denying the enemy a potential drake they could use more than the other options.\r\nSince you already have symbols that displays what drake is up and next, you could use a secondary symbol which displays the next drake that will come up, and it will change by glowing furiosly proud in its own color and then become darker as the chance dissapears.\r\nOpening a poll which one is seems better.\r\nI seriously hope you take that into consideration, I like both options equally if you ask for my opinion (if it matters)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, the SivHD &quot;crap-cept&quot; idea\r\nAnd lets just start with yes, the name sounds silly, but I have to credit the idea&#039;s [original source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9US8ZbVbdyo)\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s start from the beginning\r\nI am EUW player who regulary plays in master\r\nAnd I am absolutely sick and tired autofill more than just long queue times.\r\nI&#039;ve listened when someone from riot talked about &quot;match quality&quot; in the video with Scarra and Gbay\r\nAnd tbh, it&#039;s at its damn lowest when there are 1-2 autofillers in a champion select.\r\nI could rant for an essay about how stupid that idea is, but lets just say that it contradicts the original idea where players had a choice to get their selected 2 roles, and then you just take it from them because they happened to be in the top 0,1%.\r\ni can understand that queue times are hell, but honestly, we should just deal with it with the given system, logically, it&#039;s either role selection with longer queue times, (talking about 20-30 minutes) or regular soloq where you just get a role because the other people who are above in order took your role, which is totally fine to some players. Role selection + autofill also comes with massive confusion, and it seems to reward luckier players than skillfull players who have gotten used to the system.\r\n\r\nSo, what does the crapcept idea have to do with anything?\r\nlet me ask you, do you want to watch a screen for 20 minutes straight to wait for a game?\r\nNo? I thought so, but do they still want to have a game of League of Legends? absolutely.\r\nThis might be a lot too read, but please bear with me.\r\n\r\nAlright, so the general idea, is to have an option in League of legends which cooperates with your mobile device if you choose to download the League of Legends app, since you already created the app for people to gain access to their social life in League of legends through their phone, then why not take it to the next lvl? wether it is upgrading the current app or making a new one isn&#039;t my decision\r\nThe idea is that when you are QUEUING for a game you can some options preselected on when you will accept the queue time.\r\nLet&#039;s put this into an example:\r\n\r\nYou are Master 200 lp euw \r\nYour queue time is approximate 23 minutes to have a game where everyone gets a secondary or a primary role.\r\nYou are also slightly hungry, so you want to grab some leftovers pizza for the champion select phase (because you can afk relatively easy there)\r\nYou also are going to show your grandma how to use the television controller to watch her favourite show (or do it for her if she is slow today)\r\nAll this will take between 23 or 24 minutes.\r\n\r\nbecause you do NOT want to dodge the champion select you want to time it exactly with a premade function where it accepts for you. within 23 minutes or 24 minutes. But otherwise, it will not accept for you causing to just stop searching for more games. unntil you re-queue into matchmaking.\r\nYou can ALSO make it cooperate with the phone, it might be extremely stressful to develop, but for good convinience sake, you could accept it from a mobile device. \r\n\r\nWether or not you can do both, allowing the player to feel &quot;safe&quot; from just walking away from their pc for just a couple of minutes, or even seconds will be posetive. A lot of the times I feel &quot;chained&quot; because I want to play a game, but because I have to be at my computer to accept the queue pop then I &quot;foce myself&quot; to do other activities on my PC, which is something that can get dull over the long run.\r\n\r\nIt does not have to be for high elo players either, you can make it short like 1-3 minutes which will allow you to take a toilet break without braking a sweat.\r\nWhen all that is said, it will also fix my infuriating bug where I get a queue pop, but it doesn&#039;t pop, and instead the client tells me that I failed to accept the queue pop which didn&#039;t even occur regardless wether I was going other activities on my pc or on the client itself. \r\nAlso keep in mind, the sound triggers WHEN it already shows that I have &quot; failed to accept&quot;\r\n\r\nIf there is anything unclear, leave a comment and i&#039;ll try to reply and answer to the best of my ability, sorry if there is something unclear or misses grammar.\r\nif there are some serious spelling mistakes, please let me know and i&#039;ll edit it ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Kempachi Taichou","date":"2016-07-31T21:27:50.036+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leave completely random.","replies":[{"poster":"Zetzuan","date":"2016-07-31T21:38:43.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why?\nCare to elaborate?","replies":[{"poster":"Itankyou","date":"2016-07-31T21:41:50.228+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this would be a cool concept because as of right now the bans in the game are stagnant (same bans every game).

But I dont think Elder should boost your stats if you have 3 fire dragons, OP man like how you beat that? 3 fire dragon + elder? Thats done man, even if your team has baron.  I think it should be a stand alone buff, and remove the stacking of dragon but have it fixed order or show whats the first 3 dragon in champion select but make them stronger to suit any team at the cost of having a timer on them like normal red and blue buffs.
