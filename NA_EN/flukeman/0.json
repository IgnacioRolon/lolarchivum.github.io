It asks if I want to reconnect but when I try I get the same crash, each time. I've tried many of the options from the \"Help and Support\" center, but nothing's working so far. League is getting mad at me for leaving games now because of this. Also I can't even play a tutorial game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-02T21:32:51.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something seems to be failing to render the game when trying to reconnect, and resulting in these bugsplats.  Specifically, your best bet would be to go through the steps in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide for a resolution.
