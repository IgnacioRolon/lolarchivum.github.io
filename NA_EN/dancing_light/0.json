New voice-over, crisp new animations, detailed character model and awesome particle effects and obviously, the hype in-game music. Whenever I play support, DJ Sona is whom I instalock.\n\nFast forward a few months and the **PROJECT** Patch comes out. I bought all **PROJECT** skins and icons, and I took the time to play all **PROJECT** champions and genuinely enjoyed the release.\n\n**So, regarding the bug:** I just finished a game with **DJ Sona** and during the entirety of the match, I couldn&#039;t hear her ultimate voice! Instead, when testing the joke and the taunt emotes, I heard either her Classic Etwahl or her Rock Guitar. Other times, her Arcade Machine takes the spotlight and when running or attacking, her classic voice comes into play. I rarely heard her ultimate voice and I was quite disappointed throughout the game.\n\nI hope someone at **Riot Games** notices this as the next patch is already on the horizon and it would be a shame to those who bought it.\n\n**FIRST EDIT:** As documented by another user, some players have experienced this bug even before the **PROJECT** Patch.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-15T17:15:01.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lumynum,\n\nWe've had a report of two of this in the past, but do not have a solid repro for the issue.

Other than the information I've provided, I cannot elaborate further on the matter, as I've explained everything just how it happened to me during the game.\n\nI'm sorry to disappoint you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jolyne Cujoh","date":"2015-09-14T07:09:38.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same but only once, and this was before the Project skins were released","replies":[{"poster":"Dancing Light","date":"2015-09-14T18:45:27.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jinx Hentai,realm=OCE,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=gHB0MwMi,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-14T07:09:38.298+0000)\n>\n> I've had the same but only once, and this was before the Project skins were released\n\nI'll add that to my original post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ARequestOfDeath","date":"2015-09-14T02:15:16.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"who even likes the dj sona voice over. it is just justin bieber clips distorted.","replies":[{"poster":"Dancing Light","date":"2015-09-14T18:44:38.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=pokemaster275,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=gHB0MwMi,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-14T02:15:16.501+0000)\n>\n> who even likes the dj sona voice over. it is just justin bieber clips distorted.\n\nI like the ultimate voice.
