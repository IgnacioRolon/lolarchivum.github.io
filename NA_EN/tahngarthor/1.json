I totally understand.

And from here I guess my advice to others would be not to assume that an oddity will fix itself, restart the client and/or give it some time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-08T23:48:26.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally, I know it's just as frustrating for you.

I have had some similarly strange things happen during champ select (like player name hilights from a previous game being stuck on the screen), but they didn't prevent me from picking/getting into the game.\n\nI h ave a suspicion that this sort of thing can occur if you click on certain things at just the right (wrong?) time. For example, once I had clicked the mastery edit button right as a champ select ended because someone else dodged, and the next game I went into there were graphics out of place. So there's definitely some wonkiness if certain things occur when the client transitions between scenes.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0if6clckpstlc2q/league%20issue.JPG?dl=0\nIn this image from the incident that led to me posting, the bottom right player has the red \"currently picking\" VFX stuck on and not animating when it isn't their turn, because the player in that slot happened to be picking at the time I got booted out the previous time.This is something I've seen multiple times but not 100% of the time. (in 3v3, if two players are still picking, both of them will have the stuck graphics)\n\nI will make a point to take more screenshots when I see this weirdness.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-08T23:26:12.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you confront any bugs, it's super important that it's posted on the bug report boards so QA can investigate it.

There may be some pushback, though, because dodging and leaving games still cause negative impacts on other players even if unintentional.  Still, hopefully we can work something out!","replies":[]}]}
