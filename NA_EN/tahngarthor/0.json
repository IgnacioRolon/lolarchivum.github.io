I checked my web browser to see if anything was making noise, then the volume mixer, and turns out it was the client. The client is usually silent while a game is in progress, so is this intended? While I don&#039;t mind the sound while I&#039;m in the client, I&#039;d rather not be hearing it on top of the game music and sound.","replies":[{"poster":"Vonderhamz","date":"2017-11-08T23:04:36.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a known bug we are working on now. Seems to be happening when you leave the runes page and then save outside of Runes. To get it to stop playing, go back into Runes, click a page and then exit. It should stop playing! I'm working on getting a fix for this ASAP!\n\nEdit - looks like we can piggyback the fix for this when we do a patch for when we find something else that is inevitably broken with all the new Runes stuff that went out. In the meantime, what I wrote above should be a way to stop the ambience! Really sorry about it :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hanandano","date":"2018-09-22T10:16:03.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is some kind of changes now.
