My IP balance in the top right showed 2156 but the store said \"Not enough IP\". Later when I relog, my IP balance drops to 2026- but I certainly didn't ever spend 120 IP. What gives here?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T17:54:47.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this, I see that your IP is actually at 2195, Aurelion Sol being your most recent purchase.  This may be a balance sync issue on the updated client.  Switching back to the legacy then hopping back to the updated version should update things.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Tahngarthor","date":"2017-02-21T19:28:53.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I actually had played another game since then though. I'm still confused at how the client could think my IP was higher than it was unless I just bought something and it didn't update correctly. \n\nthis got things back in sync I guess, though it was still annoying to end up waiting one more game to get that speed quent Asol needs :P\n\nThis seems a lot like those signs at the gas pumps \"in case of a disagreement between this register and the one inside, this register shall be considered the correct one.\"","replies":[]}]}]}
