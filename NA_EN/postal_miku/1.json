While poke seems to have been a popular reason to pick her, Fearless' reasoning was basically that you can't have a poke champion and a sustain champion on the same frame because the lane flow becomes toxic.\n\nWhen a normal poke support gets ahead, you can counter it with poke of your own or a good initiate/cc. This is an inherent weakness of poke support.\n\nWhen a poke support also has sustain, they are able to widen the gap to the point where counter-initiation is simply not viable. In fact, the opponents will likely start doing *less* damage as they lose the ability to take risks. There will come a point where the opponents can do nothing but cower under the tower or back. \"Once she gets ahead, she stays ahead\" is not good design.\n\nIf we compare old Sona to Alistar, Nami and (current) Soraka, we see that none of them are nearly as strong in this particular combination. \n\nNami's pressure comes more from Aqua Prison than anything else and that's fairly binary. It either lands and you're in serious trouble - which is satisfying for Nami - or it misses and does nothing at significant CD/mana cost, which feels good for the opponent. Nami's sustain is also harder to use for full effect because you have to clip an enemy.\n\nSoraka's sustain is stronger, but it's on a much longer CD, which makes for more meaningful decisions. Her poke also puts her at vastly increased risk. \n\nAlistar has potentially the strongest sustain of the healing champions, but he doesn't really have poke. He's a disruption tank like Leona, which means that he has to be in the scrum to do his job.\n_________________\nOn a personal note, I think that this perspective on Sona should have been made more clear. I also think that being more direct about the poke nerfs would have allowed him to reduce Q damage but keep the range, which I believe is a more dynamic choice. I would find it more satisfying to be doing things more often, even if the net effect is the same. I think the range decrease made Sona a more passive champion, which is almost always a bad idea in my book.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-09-12T19:06:24.065+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":12,"body":"This is just not correct.

E is the dump stat.  you take a rank in it then cycle through it to stack her passive.  I would much rather have range and effectiveness with her Q.\n\nI'm completely with you on the Q range. What percentage of players started Q at level 1 pre vs post-rework? That's a stat Riot should have access to and ponder.\n\nE being the 'dump stat' is a misconception many players have about Sona. E was the real \"**Hidden Power**\" that the devs talked about wanting to remove from her kit. The cooldown on her Q and W increased but not as much as E. The range on Q decreased a tiny bit and we sure do feel it but think about how much range her E lost! Her E also lost its passive which was there to compensate for her being slow and squishy. Now we have \"short bursts of compensation\" with cooldowns that cost mana. Thats why my deaths are going up now vs then, she's slower but just as squishy and has less itemization options. So now I have 1 viable boot choice > mobis (also recently nerfed). More deaths per game directly as a result of the E changes. Her Q isn't causing my to die 30% more every game because her over-powered heal compensates enough to get me through laning phase. Yet that heal isn't going to compensate for the loss of E's nerf when I get engaged upon because my 'short burst' wasn't long enough or I was out of mana. If E was such a 'dump stat' then why did it get nerfed so much harder then her Q or W? SINCE the rework, E has now become THE dump stat. \n\nThe Sonas who thrived on her old Q in lane and then proceeded to build a lot of low AP utility items (crucible/locket/etc) are less likely to have realized the true worth of her E. Any Sona main who regularly went the high -AP route knows what hidden power was unlockable in her E and what it was capable of doing for her team mates mid to late game with enough AP.\n\nWhen the average person on your team becomes x% faster than the average person on the other team then 2 things happen:\n\n1 - mistakes made by your team mates become more forgiving\n2 - mistakes made by people on the other team become easier to capitalize on.\n\nThere is a certain point where enough X (AP) will start to give your team a **chance ** to turn the tide of a game believed to be lost by everyone else on your team except you. But to get enough AP on squishy Sona to do this you have to be extremely good at positioning, vision, and supporting. You needed her old E. Yes the reward was great but the risk justified it.\n\nHow many varied builds did you see on Sona pre vs post-rework? Everyone builds cookie-cutter now.\n\n\nHigh AP Sona worked for me in SoloQ mostly because of her E. She was balanced and their were quite a few supports I had a very hard time laning against (Annie and Voli come to mind.) Her Q early game is what got me to the point late game to leverage that E but Q didn't win games, just lanes and some trades. E (not Q) was way more of a factor in winning these [games](https://www.flickr.com/photos/90984084@N05/14506719365/in/photostream/)\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A2ZOMG","date":"2014-09-14T09:15:32.654+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"W heal by itself alright, but frankly the shield could scale harder and have a .5 second longer duration so that Sona doesn't feel nearly as awful for building AP when you factor that she effectively needs to be in melee range to have access to a large amount of her power.  And honestly, I'm annoyed that the heal needs to scale with missing health.  It's like we want to promote more baiting, which is really scrubby and insulting.  Insulting that you would expect us to appreciate it as playmaking.  I'd rather have something closer to the old heal base values and scaling, which aren't going to be broken with the nerfed mana cost and lack of free resists but rather will reward Sona and her AD better for making good exchanges.  I hear a lot from Riot that players should be rewarded for playing well.  The new heal is like...what? You get more out of it after poor exchanges?\n\nE aura should cost slightly more mana, and have better overall values.  I'd prefer a base cooldown of 10 seconds, and Sona should have at least 20% self bonus movement speed at rank 1.  Also I don't understand why the aura movement speed can't scale better when the aura itself only has 350 range, which is REALLY TERRIBLE for a movement speed buff support ability.  I mean...I don't know where else to begin, but just look at Karma, Lulu, Zilean, and even Nami.\n\nAs I've stated, the rework partly disappoints me because it currently forces Sona to basically default to tank builds, because her abilities with auras have abusive base numbers in grouped situations, but her scalings don't justify being in melee range to take advantage of her auras.  Old Sona actually I appreciated as a glass cannon, because it had FAIR tradeoffs in conjunction with skilled positioning.  Your abilities could feel good if you were a good enough player to position carefully, ESPECIALLY with Sona's old E aura, which at 1000 range could easily reach your frontline, which was the real underappreciated power of lategame Sona for initiating fights.  But you can't really do that anymore with current E because the aura range is bad and the values don't really compensate for it out side of minor reaction skillshot dodging.\n\nAlso, I dunno many things to suggest for Q aura, but it disappoints me because of its functionality.  It's silly for invades or generally focus firing a single disabled target and oneshotting them.  At the same time though, the way its designed makes Sona less unique, and also limits her laning options, making her optimal laning partners strictly champions that somehow have a way of reliably right click harassing (and waveclearing), which is effectively Caitlyn and Lucian. I wonder at times what's so bad about a shorter duration AD/AP aura buff which would maintain Sona's versatility.\n\nAnother thing that's semi-annoying is Sona is overall one of the worst supports at contributing waveclear (which is something ranged supports in general really shouldn't have), but she's also one of the most vulnerable supports to ganks, which is another small reason the loss of the AP/AD aura on Q makes me sad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlexKondratz","date":"2014-09-22T05:58:09.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Still exploring ways to improve satisfaction with W and E especially.

Unless your jungler is an idiot and feeds her double buffs, in which case, okay.  Double buff Sona is probably the most unfair thing to lane against, and probably STILL is.\n\nThe rework doesn't make new Sona much healthier, if at all, to be frank.  Level 1, you go invade with Sona because Q aura is retarded for level 1 skirmishes and basically lets you instakill people who get caught. And really, Sona's play pattern is pretty much THE SAME THING.  It's all about damage and sustain. Just it was nerfed in ways that feel really awful, mostly the range nerf on Q is highly invasive.  Sure, I agree with mana cost nerfs on heal, because it made old Sona really retarded at running other supports OOM, but missing Qs that I feel should have hit is just not nice. \n\nThen if you reach lategame, Sona Q aura still is there to oneshot people, and then Sona basically gets access to old Zekes aura by spamming W with Ardent Censer which allows insane objective clearing.

Post-rework Nidalee is better, but she's still problematic.\n\n>I could go on, but Jesus, are you new to snowballing?\n\nIt's not the snowballing that's the problem. It's *how* they snowball. The matchups between champions without heals come down to who plays better. The problem with healing champions is that they erase progress between engagements and they do so in a way that can't be countered. All those champions you mentioned have counterplay, with the possible exception of Alistar [1] - *and his heal is on the chopping block according to the devs*.\n\nThe Soraka rework is a *perfect* example of how Riot is trying to fix this problem. Yes, she can heal, but she has to interact with her enemies - in the form of landing Starcall - in order to keep it up.\n\nFearless went with a mix of clumsy and subtle fixes to Sona's heal:\n\n* By nerfing Sona's poke, he made it so that her heal could be stronger.\n* He increased the cost and the cooldown.\n* He encouraged making choices about when to heal by increasing the effect on more damaged targets.\n* He married a proactive effect (the shield) with a reactive effect (the heal) so that you usually have to choose which is better.\n\n>On a side note, Sona's rework has succeeded in making her more broken in ARAM where insane aura numbers are much easier to take advantage of and Sona's higher mana costs matter a lot less.\n\nAs much as I agree with you, Riot has made it perfectly clear that they have zero interest in balancing specific champions in ARAMs.\n\n[1] - I would argue that the heal on Alistar is probably okay because it's expensive and his role as a disruption tank means that there is counterplay. In my experience, he's really only a problem in ARAMs and I've already talked about that.","replies":[{"poster":"A2ZOMG","date":"2014-09-10T14:36:09.962+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Sona doesn't have pre-rework Nidalee's mobility, and firstoff, when she goes to hit you, she is consistently in range to be engaged on.  Old Sona already promoted dynamic skill plays THAT HAVE COUNTERPLAY based on positioning.  The only thing that was really stupid about old Sona was mostly the superior mana efficiency on her heal when specifically healing 2, which basically made Sona vs other poke supports a game where she simply ran them out of mana. Though even that actually has SOME counterplay by strictly investing all effort zoning Sona to attempt forcing more suboptimal use of her heal.\n\nHeals don't simply erase progress.  Mana bars exist.  Arguably, Chalice and Athenes shouldn't exist because resource trivialization is one of the more toxic fundamental parts of League of Legends.\n\nYou want to argue the Soraka rework is good because Soraka has to interact with enemies.  Guess what.  Pre-rework Sona did exactly that, because she ALWAYS stepped in engage range when poking and survived on skilled positioning, and furthermore her mechanics ENCOURAGED it because of optimal case usage for Sona's heal by ensuring you are healing two people after trades.  Sure, I'm fine with removing her free stat auras because Caitlyn is the most toxic range AD in the game especially paired with old Sona, but now current Sona almost basically needs Caitlyn or Lucian because of how much more conditional Sona's current Q is to optimize for trades. Also sadly enough, Caitlyn lost one of her few reliable lane counters by Sona getting nerfed, and Caitlyn DOES need more hard counters due to the sheer toxicity of her kit.\n\nAnd yeah, Alistar's heal shouldn't exist.  For one, it's not actually a very expensive spell. Alistar's heal for clarification costs less mana than old Sona's heal at early ranks (rank 5 heal costs the same), and numerically heals for a greater base total amount in an optimal use case scenario for the duo lane. And secondly, I don't get how you believe Alistar has a better play pattern than Sona.  Outside of the mana cost for WQ, which got reduced not too many patches ago, Alistar is basically THE SAME CHAMPION AS IRELIA.  And I'm pretty sure you know why \"better nerf Irelia\" is a meme.  It's because Irelia (and Alistar likewise) has one of the most toxic and overloaded kits that exists.  Alistar doesn't have counterplay outside of picking Ashe, Cho'Gath, or Vel'Koz (mass slows, knockups, and true damage are the only real counters to Alistar).  He clicks on you and kills you if he's stronger, and you can do NOTHING about it especially since it's a point click knockup. In THIS situation, having a point click hard engage that can confirm into kills easily COMBINED with a heal that further prevents retaliation from enemies is extremely toxic.\n\nI dunno man.  Sona has to position carefully multiple times to make her Q poke effective, and she can't actually just simply kill you by running at you unless she burns her long CD ultimate which CAN be feasibly Flashed on reaction.  Alistar?  You can do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about his engage and heal, except be stronger than him or have mass slows/knockups/true damage.  So when Alistar is ahead, he literally does run up to you and just kill you.  Having a heal + a point click knockup engage is basically THE most toxic play pattern that exists.\n\nLet me clarify, I agree with some of the changes to the Sona rework, but do they make Sona a more interesting, unique, and healthier champion?  They more do the opposite.  Reworked Sona thrives on a few fringe abuse cases dependent on grouping, and provides considerably more generic buffs to teammates that several other champions are already capable of doing (we need MORE onhit magic damage procs?).  This isn't the same as old Sona who had a versatile kit that could be utilized well but not generally abused heavily by any comp and teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2014-09-10T15:23:12.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Look, I don't disagree with you that the Sona rework made her a more passive champion in the laning phase.

Riot buffing Alistar recently was easily one of the worst decisions they made this season, because the champion DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BE COMPETITIVE.  Current Alistar being competitive ruins the game, because he's effectively identical to Irelia, where both ignore disables, both point click engage/disable you, and both heal obscene amounts at trivial cost.\n\nWhen Sona in contrast is strong, she at least is still strategically and skillfully beatable.  She's bad at peeling, and her options for contesting hard engages are limited and depend on SKILLED PLAYS, and then there's the fact she's always been one of the most vulnerable supports to ganks, which means in the first place you can't just automatically win lane without playing smart. That's why the previous iteration of Sona was a fine and balanced champion, especially because in that design, her optimal build was glass cannon AP for maximizing her auras lategame, meaning you effectively needed to be fragile, but could be really powerful by building that way.  Now current Sona's best itemization options are mostly tank + Censer, which again, is a more abusive design choice where you have a healer that becomes hard to kill later in the game and can afford to build tanky because base numbers on abilities + auras are stupid.\n\nIf there's one thing that especially baffles me and ticks me off about the Sona rework, it's the fact that it's basically taking her back to Season 2 where she built nothing but tank items and mana regen.  Which combined with Sona's original free Aegis Aura was objectively ludicrous, and of course needed to be nerfed.  The new auras are basically melee ranged but have stupid bases, which...yeah.  Right when I learned to appreciate previous Sona's tradeoffs and strengths building glass cannon.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2014-09-10T16:07:56.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">And see, the point is, the Sona rework is poorly thought out and hinges on abuses. So basically Sona is really abusive in teamfights, but feels awful to lane with. \n\nMy impression is that the top-level devs issued a mandate for getting rid of Sona's auras just like they got rid of dodge. There was also a need to make her post-laning phase have a noticeable impact outside of her ult. I think the \"snuggle zones\" were viewed as a creative way to keep the feel of the auras without them actually being auras. From there, they struggled to balance them and fell short of the mark.","replies":[{"poster":"A2ZOMG","date":"2014-09-10T16:36:03.403+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt Sona's new auras are actually balanceable.  Because of the whole melee range requirement, either you have cases where Sona gets to use them and then they're potentially too good, or you have cases where Sona can't really reach her teammates with them and suddenly she's lost a lot of power.  Or alternatively the way to look at this is Sona is STILL STUPID IN GROUPED STANDOFFS.  Hell, hasn't Riot learned already that teammate buffs in general are STUPID TO BALANCE? Look at Lulu, Zilean, and Morgana. And now they decide they have a problem with Sona's auras?\n\nSona's new auras powerwise are insane when you do the math, and because there's this idea that Sona needs to make more plays, you create the Blitzcrank problem all over again.  Blitzcrank's problem is being Feast/Famine.  If he and his team are strong enough and he gets hooks, he's extremely OP.  But if he can't get hooks, then he's effectively one of the worst champions in the game.  Although Sona's sadly enough probably a bigger mess than Blitzcrank because she's WAY BETTER lategame than Blitzcrank due to being ranged, not being trolled by items lategame (hello Banshees), and offering teammate buffs IF she can use her auras.\n\nThe way I see it, DISREGARDING ACTUAL BALANCE (the rework is a nerf, but let's ignore that), the Sona rework creates more problems than it solves about Sona's gameplay and health.  And of course, the range nerf on Q is unnecessary and just more feels terrible above anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Emmy Cha0s","date":"2014-09-13T00:42:23.247+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll agree, the new way Sona's abilities work is more difficult to balance than her old ones.  They basically walked in the opposite direction they had intended, instead of sustained abilities over time it's all been put into a burst.  Unfortunately, that's been balanced below the equivalent amount old Sona would've put out in an identical time span leaving her with both weaker burst and a complete lack of persistence.  On top of that, there's nothing innovative about her kit.  They just copy/pasted abilities from other champs, lowered their numbers and put them on a pathetic 1/3 range (non)aura.\n\nI still fail to see the hype around Ardent Censor.  Are teams intentionally picking 4 auto-attackers?  Short of that, it's a lackluster item that just looks like it's doing something when in fact it is not.  Like Sona herself.  It's rare to ever see more than 2 auto-attackers, the ADC is always one and then sometimes the jungler.  \n\n> Sona's new auras powerwise are insane when you do the math\n\nI've done the math, I'm a math major and every calculation has come back favoring old Sona by varying margins of width, but I digress.","replies":[{"poster":"A2ZOMG","date":"2014-09-14T08:43:43.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sona's winrates in ARAM which as I recall are actually are BETTER today than they were pre-rework I believe is fair enough evidence that her auras are insane theoretically.  I don't have complete history, but I'm pretty sure in the past her winrates were more in the mid 60% range.  Now it's closer to like 70%.  Which goes back to my point that her reworked auras are actually more stupid to balance.  Also it's harder to cheese Sona with Ignite in ARAM due to how her new heal works, and furthermore in ARAM where creating picks with burst damage is a big deal, Sona's Q aura fits the meta better there. So as I stated, I'm pretty sure there's math that proves her new auras are insane theoretically, which basically only matters when you're grouped during standoffs and have excess mana regen (which ARAM helps tremendously).\n\nArdent Censer is broken on Sona because it means you clear objectives faster.  Objectives win the game.  Though I'm too lazy to math it out right now, to give you an idea, clearing towers 3 seconds faster, or Baron 6 seconds faster is a HUGE deal.  It's why old Zekes had to be nerfed, because free AS aura = stupid fast objectives.  Furthermore all the stats synergize strongly with how Sona works.  You want CDR, mana regen, movement speed, and some AP.
