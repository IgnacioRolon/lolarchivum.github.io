I saw that she had a kind of reverse Lulu shrink on it during PBE, but that was removed sadly (sounded like fun to mess with)...I thought that was a good idea since it shows your allies that the enemy target is much weaker and would ensure more aggression on that target, I don't know if this was true or not since I'm not in PBE.\n\n\n**So my questions to Fearless are**\n\n**-Was the max range nerf on her Q intentional or something you forgot to mention and left in by accident? (it was 700, is now 650)**\n\n**-Why did you remove the shrink effect on her W powerchord during PBE?**\n\n**-E has 1% per rank up in movement speed, isn't there a way to make this ability scale better with rank? (say something like the extra movement speed for her diminishes more slowly)\n**\n\nSo even though most of this thread is my concerns for the current Sona, I want to remind you that I love the changes and these concerns are just little scratches on the face of it, she feels/plays/looks better and I am thankful that I was wrong about her numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-08-05T23:56:02.859+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"The range on Q was not changed. I was in the scripting today, and verified that the number has not changed. In fact, nothing in how Q gets it's targets was touched for her release. I'm not sure if the model change is throwing off people's feel for this, or if something not related to Sona changed and is causing the confusion here. I'll keep you posted if I find anything. \n\nI removed the Shrink effect because as neat as it was, it was going to cause issues the animations of the shrunk characters. We did add the much more visible hit effects for powerchord, but I know those can be lost in a team fight. \n\n1% MS actually adds a pretty significant amount of MS in our game, but I know that this is a pretty underwhelming level up for a lot of players. We are still pretty low on data to make any changes right now, but if we need to buff Sona in the future, I will experiment with some other level incentives on E.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2014-08-06T02:38:14.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her Q just feels like it's too short-range because of the extremely low payoff when landing it, even with an immediate powerchord followup. It's especially problematic since her auras, being short range as well, often require either her ADC to be too close, her ADC to not benefit, or her to not benefit, meaning her overall power is smaller. Maybe she just needs a better auto-attack range?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Postal Miku","date":"2014-08-06T00:40:21.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for answering the questions even though the thread is barren\n\nI had thoughts that maybe the feeling of Sona having a little larger model was probably throwing me off on her Q range, but what unsettled me was the part where her Q says 650 range, for as long as I can remember in season 1 when she was released, I have been telling people she has 700 max range on Q and 500/550(when it was changed) on her champion priority range, that may have been a offset from misinformation on the wiki, it's not as crushing as it seems, just a little annoyance when you try to stretch a free hit in\n\nI would have never thought that effect would mess with animations, if that is the case, how does Lulu ult/dominion buff/Rageblade also not mess with animations if it's essentially the same effect but in reverse (probably not something you are capable of answering, but I really don't know if you code the changes or not)\n\nAs for E, I found it tough to think of a idea for scaling, if she did get 5% per rank up (like most movement abilities) then I am fairly confident that it would tip her waaaaay over the edge, and then making it 2% or 3% wouldn't make much of a difference in hindsight anyway, honestly I think after playing her for about 10 games, her E should just stay the 1 point wonder and virtually do nothing when ranked up, it's terrible for players unfamiliar with the skill but I think it makes up for how good her QW actives are now when those are fully ranked \n\nThanks again for the comment, and would like to apologize for doubting the changes while they were in progress (though what really can anyone do other then look at the number changes since I can't get into PBE)","replies":[]}]}]}
