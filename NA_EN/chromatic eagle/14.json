I think the Kalamanda incident was a HUGE loss from the old lore, possibly the biggest other than the potential of the League of Legends itself. We actually got political intrigue between the two supposedly most powerful nations on Runeterra at the moment. These two are supposed to be rivals, opposites in a lot of ways but also reflections of one another. Ancient enemies. You'd expect more stories of conflict between Demacia and Noxus, but I suppose they chose to move away from that angle in the newer lore. \n\nIts also technically the setting of the Crystal Scar. One thing I liked about the old map was that you could point to not only the nations the Champions are from, but also the maps we actually play on. There's something kind of neat seeing where Summoner's Rift was situated right on the border between Demacia and Noxus, right in the center of the conflict. Or how the Crystal Scar had a history, it isn't just a magic wilderness like Summoner's Rift, it's an old mining town. Even Twisted Treeline got relocated to the Shadow Isles, a really smart change, and Howling Abyss has some small plot importance to Freljord's on-going conflict. (Also, bring back Butcher's Bridge!!)\n\nI hope Riot can capitalize on Kalamanda and use it as some kind of modern Runeterran event, as a reminder of the danger of the Rune Wars or something, incorporating Ryze in the midst of the conflict between two really powerful nations. But if Skarner's people are still associated with the area, then I'm guessing Piltover's new involvement with the Brackern are going to be a bigger role. This is all assuming Kalamanda even slightly resembles it's old self or even still exists at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-02-12T17:17:31.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Brackern are from Shurima now, they're buried all over the sands there.

Bottom left: https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/piltover/medarda-heirloom\n\nWhich makes it the northwestern coast of Shurima.
