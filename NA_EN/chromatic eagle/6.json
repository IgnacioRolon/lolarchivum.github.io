Having said that, a part of me misses the old Gangplank. While I&#039;ll never call him a good man, I never would have taken him as the type to murder an entire family, burn their workshop, and destroy the guns he wanted made purely out of spite. I think it&#039;s a bit out of character even for the new Gangplank. He seems like a brutally fair man.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Fortune, I&#039;m happy that she had her past concluded, which was also developed. However, I feel conflicted on her now darker, more brutal and manipulative personality. I feel bad for her, but can&#039;t help but judge her either. I can accept having a burning hatred for Gangplank, but I liked their &quot;friendly&quot; rivalry, especially when it was thought that he was the boy that saved her when they were younger. \r\n\r\nMy biggest question however is the Harrowing Event. Is the part involving these two canon? I can&#039;t see her working together with the man that caused her so much pain.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-01T01:26:00.125+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"I actually find the idea of them [having to work together](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Harrowing#Fist_Light_after_the_Harrowing) to (barely) fend off a Harrowing, quite interesting actually.

Right now, after Gangplank's fall, there's a lot going wrong, and if the Harrowing hit it could be catastrophic.\n\nActually I find this possibly an interesting route to take with the lore, Bilgewater realizes around the time of the harrowing the state that it is in. Many know their fate, but no one wants to talk about it, suddenly almost over night Bilgewater is abandoned for the time being. Now without the front line of defense against the shadow isles and its harrowing, other places now must make their stand (sorry im not up to snuff about runeterra geography). But how will they make their stand against a threat only bilgewater ever defended against? The governments vastly unprepared for the wave of chaos. MF Nautilus and possibly GP are up for grabs as well as anyone else from bilgewater but knowing that their town is now over run by the harrowing will they choose to help the others defend? or will they leave without question, letting the others who they defended for so long without even the slightest thanks, finally pay their price?\n\nThe possibilities opening up the shadow isles interaction with the rest of runeterra and finally revealing more about the champions from there is exciting. Im ready to know more about the metal giant mordekaiser, or even the tragic past of hecarim (well to me the dialogue in TT to him makes it sound tragic). The married souls trapped in the platforms will have a play in this? Theres a lot to go on.

People may just assume Soraka is just that for them. to Miss Fortune and Gangplank they have no beef with Soraka, they know what it means and morale is raised and in that moment .... a MF-GP pact naturally pans out as you wrote. :)\nMaybe Soraka should probably remain clandestine through-out, though. Bilgewater may have attracted non-human things who dislike Soraka. A way of expressing a kind of diverse lawless culture. She's here against The Harrowing and not for Bilgewater.
