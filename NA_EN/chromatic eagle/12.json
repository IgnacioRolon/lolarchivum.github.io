But I think she said she wont cause it takes her a lot of time and she doesnt get any money for it. Just one more reason to hire her at Riot, so she can do that for money while finishing the comics.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2015-05-05T21:09:57.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea.
