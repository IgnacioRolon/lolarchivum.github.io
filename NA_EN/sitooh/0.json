It looks like several attempts were made, but they failed each time. We're aware of some slight issues here and there, but for now, please wait until the next patch before trying to transfer again.","replies":[{"poster":"Sitooh","date":"2018-01-31T11:59:54.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have not yet received an error message, on the contrary it says that the account transfer has been completed.

It probably shouldn't be saying the transfer was completed, since each time it's failing on the backend of things. Y'know if it's still not working throughout today, and you really need this transfer soon, go ahead and write in a ticket and we might be able to push it through on our side!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Taliyah Supp","date":"2018-01-29T13:31:52.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After you purchased the transfer it should log you out automatically, then after server selection it should update and you should be able to log in.
