So when I reconnected my internet was still down and rebooting so I couldn't reconnect but when it got back on the game was over and I got leaver busters please help I did nothing wrong because the whole block had the power out please remove.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T02:33:08.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't be getting a low priority queue due to that one match where you got kicked out from a power outage. Rather you'll only end up with an LPQ after multiple afks. I know it's pretty shitty to get stuck with this wait time due to a loss of power, but overall those teammates were still left without a 5th team member. It looks like you've only got one game left in the LPQ, so you won't be waiting much longer!","replies":[]}]}
