Tis I again, this time with a question in regards to behavior.\r\n\r\nI've been seeing on the Behavior Boards that people are saying they are getting punished with 15-day bans instead of a 14-day ban. Is that really a thing? I've even seen a screen shot of it, was that screen shot real? I can't see why people would need to photoshop that.\r\n\r\nIf it is real, what are the different conditions to trigger a 15-day ban as opposed to a 14-day ban?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-03T01:49:20.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly sure players aren't photoshopping those 15 day ban messages, but it's definitely something we're looking into and trying to figure out why it's been saying something different.

This would result in a more than 14 day difference if my time is behind your servers time?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T03:23:15.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FIGURED IT OUT!!!! \n\nSo it turns out this is just a simple change on the backend to the messaging. Ban lengths haven't been increased I don't believe, this is just a visual messaging change to provide a better estimation of when the account would be unlocked.","replies":[{"poster":"vikatchu","date":"2017-11-06T18:30:22.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"are you entierly sure?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T05:03:37.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty dang sure lul.
