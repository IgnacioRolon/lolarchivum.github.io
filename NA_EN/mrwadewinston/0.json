It seems like with the increased punishments, more players are making new accounts since their main account is banned or has a large chat or game restriction. Hopefully it weeds itself out, but I can't see the new player experience being better anytime soon. \n\nI do agree with the OP that it would be nice for experienced players to help out new players instead of telling them they suck.
