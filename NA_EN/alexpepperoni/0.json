In the middle of the game, it says reconnecting, and no matter how long I wait it won't reconnect. So I'm forced to leave the game and try to reconnect, but it won't let me reconnect. I get put on a black screen for a few second then a message pops up saying \"Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.\" with the option to retry or cancel. Retrying doesn't do anything, and force quitting then retrying doesn't help either. I've tried restarting the whole client, but that doesn't help either. And there's nothing wrong with my internet, because I'm using discord on the same computer to talk to friends while playing and there are no interruptions there. My friend tells me Riot doesn't care for its Mac users, so maybe thats the problem. Does anyone have the same problem or know a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Sumerian Cheese","date":"2017-08-30T06:44:15.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"about to start a game in draft mode, countdown finishes and i get a new screen that's onlt option is to reconnect. i click reconnect and page glitches and im still on same page. im assuming game has started by now...... why can i not connect?????","replies":[{"poster":"Sumerian Cheese","date":"2017-08-30T06:45:45.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i have restarted client several times, i am using the internet right now to see this forum... restarted router anyway. turned wifi on n off.... still no change.
