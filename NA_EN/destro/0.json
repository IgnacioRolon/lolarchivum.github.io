I play League of Legends in my free time and have run into trouble recently when trying to play it.  In game I have low ping, high fps and I am still getting delay lag.  I have ruled out all other computer side problems.  I did a full virus scan, re-installed league, and Reset my PC (resetting it to factory default).  I see no reason for the lag to have suddenly started and have no idea if I am the only one that is currently facing this problem.  I do not even know if there is anything you guys can do to help but I am just running out of ideas.  I would really like to be able to fix this because I would like to spend what little free time I do have on something that I want to do.  Speedtest.net by Ookla - The Global Broadband Speed Test results gauge me at 2 ping, 16 mbsp down, and 15 up when pinging the IP 134.139.190.14\r\nI also see no packet loss when I open the command prompt and ping the league server with the command ping 104.160.131.1 -t\r\n\r\nI have no idea what is wrong and I am hoping someone at the tech desk would be able to help me out.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T03:28:07.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you describe the \"lag\" in a bit more detail?

Say, maybe 1 or more out of 5 ability commands register late or awkwardly by about a second.  \n\nIf I move any champion around via click movement commands, a period of 5 seconds with about 20 clicks, occasionally the movement commands appears to be delayed or not register at all.\n\nI know its probably hard to understand what I am explaining but basically any commands that I put forth for my champion are subject to a weird delay occasionally.  It makes trading and dodging abilities extremely hard.  It is reflected in my last few games that CSing is also affected by this \"delay\" lag","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T18:40:55.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely seems like you're experiencing either *extreme packet buffering* or *packet loss*.
