As a support main, I saw so many times adcs wanting to continue in lane, because coming back to lane with a pickaxe or a BF makes a huge difference , and end being punished for it. Some of you might think &quot;Well that was his decision&quot;, and while that is true, I kinda understand that it sucks to almost have the right amount of cash, but not quite enough, and they get so punished if they don&#039;t get the correct items ( Pickaxe 25 ad to BF 50 ad) , then they cant trade well, and then my job as a support goes to hell also. Could we rework the ad items ? Lower the price on some core items and balance out the power, to make thing fare. Make {{item:3134}} build into something else ( {{item:3142}} build is wonky because one item wants you to stay in lane and farm and get a large gold advantage, and the other is for early game power), make {{item:3508}} a actual item in the game and make it viable for casters, since a problem many lower level carries face is the fact that there is no mana regen item for carries, and the one item that gives them mana back is bad, so they have a mucj harder time with mana costs ( Better adcs know how to control their mana pool better, but would like some help). Anyway that is just my 2 cents and I really like debates, so please tell me what you think .","replies":[{"poster":"OctoberIV","date":"2015-07-20T22:27:26.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"inb4\n\n\"NO YOU HAVE LIFESTEAL AND CRIT WITH NO COUNTERPLAY HURR DURR\"","replies":[{"poster":"Angelofchaos16x","date":"2015-07-20T22:56:00.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a fan of crit ( Could be because I spend half of the game in the crit zone, with the 2 champs that build crit in the game ) however I do understand that it is important in the game.

You could say the same for NLR, but the \"carry\" AD items are intended to be hard to get. IE, BT, and other ones have expensive items building into them because the main role they're balanced for, the ADC, is intended to farm early and scale late, part of the reason they get a support laning with them early game.","replies":[]}]}
