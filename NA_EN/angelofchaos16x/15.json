It is gritty, yet maintains this core of hopeful advocates for technology that work in the shadow of irresponsible manufacturers. It is a place of ideals where innovation and discovery for their own sake have supplanted consideration for the consequences. Characters run the gamut of good and evil, such as {{champion:245}} who is jaded, but at least tries to do the right thing, {{champion:112}} who holds no ties to greater forces and works for what he believes is the benefit of all peoples, and {{champion:27}} who works only for himself, even at the expense of others.\n\nBandle City is this quaint little community of sapient hamsters that has carved for itself a utopia in the harsh world of Runeterra. We have not seen much, but I like to think they have a society that is both rural and progressive, somewhat akin to modern day practices in cultivation and civilization; they appreciate the conveniences of new technology, yet strive to incorporate it in a way that does not spoil the world's natural beauty. Despite all their cheer and enviable society, yordles are nonetheless alien and perhaps a bit frightening. They _require_ a community, or at the very least sufficient contact with another, or their minds slowly break down. It is this duality which makes yordles so fascinating, that they can be so warm and funny, yet cruel and indifferent if pushed too far. The more negative aspect of their psychology is suppressed, but still present, as seen in {{champion:18}} pyromania, {{champion:17}} pragmatism, {{champion:74}} indifference to the world outside his lab, and {{champion:117}} amoral interactions with others.\n\nThat hardly dips into the consequences of a yordle that has gone entirely off the deep end. {{champion:45}}\n\nOther factions are quite awesome in their own right, but Zaun and Bandle City remain my personal favorites.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-07-16T19:56:21.669+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me I like the majority of the factions, but Noxus really stands out to me, in particular the more \"traditional side\", with fellows such as:\n\n{{champion:122}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:92}}  {{champion:14}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:6}} \n\nI hope Draven and Urgot actually count here.\n\nNoxus is a nation of strong men and women who became strong through persistence, dedication and unwavering will. While some are born to nothing and other are born with everything the truly strong are those who command the most respect. Even if you are a forgotten orphan you can rise up to claim what is rightfully yours, as long as you have the strength to carry a weapon and bury it in to the fools who would try to stop you.\n\nThe thing that really got me about Noxus was the dichotomy between it and Demacia, in many areas but particularly in war. Demacians are organized and conscripted; they are numerous but they're aren't bred for battle as Noxians are. Sion and Darius are prime examples; soldiers who turned the tide with action and will power, who did what hundreds of Demacians couldn't do. Noxus values the worth of individuals as long as you can prove yourself.\n\nLike wise justice is in the hands of the strong in Noxus. If you have the will you can bring it down on any you see fit, and those people are just as free to do the same to you. Of course a civilized nation has laws in place there's no shame in killing someone. The act of actually killing is in itself a sign of strength; only the strong can truly commit such an act.\n\nOne other thing I really like is the conflict internally in Noxus between the Black Rose and the true Noxian way. The Black Rose is deceitful, traitorous and rely on magic to do what they do. They lack true Noxian strength, and the struggle between the dark shady side and the strong warring side of Noxus is really compelling to me. Which is why Swain's cool, because he exemplifies true Noxian strength but isn't afraid to rely on those old alliances with LeBlanc if the situation calls for it. He's in control of everything despite what some might believe.\n\nAlso another thing; I really love when humans are depicted as being insanely powerful in a physical sense despite being ordinary humans. As such Noxus is really cool to me because it has many examples of humans showing physical prowess that would be impossible for normal humans. Their soldiers aren't as numerous as Demacia's, but they're ten times stronger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Downfall","date":"2015-07-16T16:09:09.017+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of legends has factions?","replies":[{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2015-07-16T18:42:38.867+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://leaguefactions.net\nthe institute lives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-07-16T19:03:18.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes it has\nNoxus lead by {{champion:50}} \nfrost guard  lead by {{champion:127}}\nshurima lead by {{champion:268}} \nthe winter claw lead by {{champion:113}} \nDemacia lead by {{champion:59}} 's father \nZaun lead by Unknown \nPiltover lead by  Unknown \nBilgewater has no leader \nThe shadow isles lead by i think the Ruin king \nIonia is lead by i think {{champion:43}} i think \nThe avarosa lead by {{champion:22}} \nthe show order lead by {{champion:238}} \nkinko lead by {{champion:98}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Sterling Bee","date":"2015-07-16T18:02:06.079+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"THE VOID {{champion:96}} {{champion:121}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-07-17T04:34:59.062+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bow to the Void, or be consumed by it!\n\n{{champion:90}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:421}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-07-18T07:23:32.514+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zaun is my home.\n\nI've spent my life dealing with some nasty genetic diseases and allergies for which the only balm is a strong constitution and plenty of distractions (games, drawing, reading). I've been in an out of facilities and had hundreds of treatments - many of which were experimental. As a child I had to stay out of the sun, off the grass, couldn't play sports and it's only thanks to modern advancements in medicine that I finally have a decent life. Scientific advancements have given me a chance.\n\nWhen I was a child I had recurring nightmares which I learned to overcome using lucid dreaming - the technique of becoming aware you are dreaming and thus empowered to shape dreams. To this day I love to dream, and build towers in my mind. Perhaps from here I got the idea of experimenting within my realm of influence? When I was 6 I tried to convince myself I had an imaginary friend I believed was real (failure). When I was 8 I tried not speaking for 12 months which I actually managed with a hefty book of flash cards. At the age of 12 I deliberately developed a speech impediment by reversing techniques used to fix one. When I was 15 I tried to overcome appendicitis with positive thinking and meditation (failure and almost death, would not recommend). At age 18 I tried to create a Kindlejack 2.0 by writing down exactly what kind of person I wanted to be, staying away for 56 hours reading it over and over then going to sleep and waking up as that person (it didn't work but the effects were pretty interesting). My favourite was when I was 21: In order to tackle crippling shyness I introduced myself to everyone at a new college as a character that was an extroverted version of my normal self and maintained it indefinitely while on campus. Eventually I became more social all the time while the character at college toned down until I arrived at a happy middle ground. Experimentation is everyone's right.\n\n To me, Zaun is freedom. Zaun is progress unfettered by law or public opinion. Zaun is opportunity for creativity without judgement. Zaun is a place where I can just do my thing.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2015-07-18T07:27:37.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, did this actually happen to you during your life?

So check it out and consider playing.\n\nJust saying Leona isn't from Shurima but Mount Targon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2015-07-16T18:31:04.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of my favorite champs are from Ionia\n\n{{champion:43}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:85}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2015-07-16T17:19:32.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Piltover is my favorite.

I like Ionia's spirituality, but also its diverse range of champions. (Syndra, Karma, Yasuo, etc). It just feels like there's a lot of character there and different motivations.\n\nAs for Bilgewater, I'm just a sucker for pirate motifs, and many of the champions from Bilgewater are just plain interesting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2015-07-16T19:26:15.043+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zaun, because most of my favorite Champions lore-wise come from there, especially {{champion:112}}.

The cold has always comforted me and I thrive when winter comes (I get horrible rashes from the sun due to my pale skin). As Lissandra says in her quotes -_ The world began in ice, and it will end in ice_. I like her character a lot. She knows how to win a war. She is a brilliants strategist and pasient and know how to deceive and bid her time well and I admire her qualities.\n\nAshe is young and naive, true, but I share her...utopic views of the world. I like peace, I wish it was possible for it to exist everywhere, but the very notion of this is foolish as it is in humans nature to strive for power and greatness. Nevertheless, a remarkable ideal and, had I not felt so drawn to Lissandra and the...Ice Age she promises to bring, I would have joined the Avarosan, without doubt.\n\nAs for Sejuani....I admire her stregth and endurance, her will to live and determination (plus she's really pretty but that is completely besides the point)\n\nAs I said, ice is comforting, the tribes are nice and I love how the result of the incoming war between the tribes can change the future of Runeterra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShÃ©nzhÃ¬","date":"2015-07-19T21:34:00.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When all lore is cleared up in 2025 ... imagine faction tributes through League of Legends! faction wars! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-07-19T20:10:31.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAIL ZAUN","replies":[]}]}
