Some of Valoran&#039;s greatest scholars have spent their lives trying to understand the mysteries it embodies. This enigmatic spirit has been given many names throughout the history of Valoran, but titles such as Cosmic Vagabond and Great Caretaker only capture a fleeting aspect of his true purpose. When the unknowable structure of the universe is threatened, Bard steers all existence away from utter annihilation.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Bard Mountain\r\nNoxian troops tried to capture the Bard Mountains and obtain a Celestial artifact bestowed to the Ionians of the Floating villages. During the battle, the village sage was tasked to take the artifact to one of the Celestial shrine on the top of one of the villages peaks. The Noxians mortally wounded him with arrows before he could reach the shrine. However, as his last act of defiance, he used the artifact to strike his would-be-killer, obliterating him and slicing a nearby mountain in half (seemingly failing in his duties). This misuse of the eggs power had drawn the attention of a Bard Celestial, who promptly intervened in the event. He retrieved the artifact and took it away from the mortal plane before the Noxians and Ionians could use its power for war.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Bard teaser.\r\nThat is all we have on Bard in his league page. Is that all that he is going to get ? The Battle of Bard Mountain is more of a Runeterra lore then a Bard lore. And his intro is just his intro, and not his actual lore. I know that you guys are busy with the Shurima Bios, but please, Bard needs a lore too.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-11-22T17:15:35.259+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yup, we know.
