Her skins include : Slightly dark Eve , Masquerade Eve, Tango Eve and Safecraker Eve, none of which cost over 750, and are kinda lackluster compared to the other skins that are coming out. I would really like to see Eve getting another skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-06T00:29:21.441+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sukishoo is correct. \n\nEvelynn is in need of a serious update before we go crazy on her next skin, unfortunately. Her rig and animation set are quite old, which limits what we can do.

I like Evelynn a lot and generally go Evelynn jungle when I can in Ranked (and then MSI/LCS pick Eve and my pick is contested). My friends joke about how I have more skins for champions I don't play as much, but most of Evelynn's skins look... uninspiring and inspire a feel of \"much of the same\". So of course, I'm super interested in a visual update for her, but is it something for the near future or more \"don't hold your breath\"?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-07T18:08:10.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have any info on the status of the update - I'm on the skins team.
