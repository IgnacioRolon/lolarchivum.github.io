I honestly don't think he's too strong but the power is just in incredibly frustrating places/places that as you say, are far more useful in competitive play. As long as kit is what it is now, he'll dominate LCS every time he's even remotely usable in solo q.\n\nThey need to streamline what he does but make him better at those things.

Apparently riot doesn't think so. Q should have a slightly lower cd, less scaling (35-40%), and his Soldier auto attacks should ramp up in damage as they attack a target so his dps rises exponentially rather than linearly.
