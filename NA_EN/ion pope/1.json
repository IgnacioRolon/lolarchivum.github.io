But there is some time when i want to try a new champion and instead I try to play on blind mode. Then i remember why i don't play there anymore: people spamming with their position on the map. Like you don't even loaded the game and there are already 3-4 who already claimed something (with duplicates or not). \nSome games ago i wanted to try {{champion:27}} top, hopefully i managed to claim my position before the other guy, I said i was first and locked my champion. But no, some people think that spamming \"top\" more times, does the trick... And so this way we got 2 tops and 1 bot... I don't complain though, it wasn't my worst match...\nI know there will be someone saying that i can try new champions in draft as well, but actually its not so easy. Draft is more organised and its based mostly on counterpick. So either you change your champion to win the match (but this isn't the reason i started playing), or get destroyed by the respective counter (which i dont want to happen).\nWhat i want to say is Blind mode shouldn't be like that. Blind mode is about your team against an unknown team so there is no counter pick, but the champion select is kinda broken. It should be like in draft mode: selecting your desired position and then searching for match, so there will be no more struggle. Or at least to add it as a different gamemode.\n\nPS: sry for bad english...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-03T23:48:32.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the general idea is to give people a more relaxed play area, but I do see the point you're making with people arguing over which role they want. We can't make these kinds of changed here in H&S, but I'd definitely suggest you post this over in Gameplay to make sure others see this kind of idea and so they can join in on the conversation!","replies":[]}]}
