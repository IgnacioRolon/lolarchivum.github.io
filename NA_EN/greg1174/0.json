I read that if I go into windowed mode or border less mode that it would help but when I change to one of those my client zooms in really far and spreads through my first monitor and half of my second. It won't let me change the size of the window either. Help please I have no idea how to fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T05:02:40.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After changing over to a Borderless or Windowed Mode, can you ensure your display resolution is set correctly?

So, we'll need to take a look at your system logs to determine what's causing all this ruckus.
