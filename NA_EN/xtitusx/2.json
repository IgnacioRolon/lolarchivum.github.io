Although pretty sure that leaving in that case would get you a queue block.. I got a leave queue and I really don't want to wait them out without knowing what I did to earn myself a leave-buster.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T02:35:07.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you disconnected in champ select, the system picked up on that and placed in an LPQ instead of outright giving you a leaverbuster. You've already played through most of them, so you won't be waiting through LPQ for much longer. Keep in mind that once you're in champ select, any afk or leaves with most likely flag you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrClockwork7000","date":"2017-06-17T23:55:31.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me, though my last game I did have a bugsplat halfway through... I still reconnected and apologized to my team and helped us win....","replies":[]}]}
