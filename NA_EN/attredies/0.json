Whenever champ select ends and the client closes and the game launches, it locks up on me and I have to use task manager to close and re-launch. Sometimes it will load up the next time, sometimes I have to close and relaunch 6-8 times before the game will load, and sometimes it never will (I just got leaverbusted because my team remade since I never loaded in).\r\n\r\nAs you can see in this screenshot, the client goes unresponsive, and for some reason there are multiple process for League occuring. I've updated my drivers, restarted my comp, googled the issue, and I'm not seeing anything anywhere to help with this problem.\r\n\r\nI'm running on windows 8, GTX 980, AMD FX-8350 processor, with 16gb ram.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/q4GqA\r\n\r\nI need some help with this, because I'm having to stop playing ranked due to this bug and as I mostly duo with friends, it's making it so we can't climb the ladder together anymore.\r\n\r\nI do NOT have discord installed on this PC, so it is not part of the same bug that others are experiencing","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T22:00:34.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This definitely doesn't seem to be the Discord issue that's affecting a variety of players lately, rather it seems like something to do with your PC not being able to properly launch the actual in-game portion of League. First, close out of League completely and check task manager to make sure everything is closed. After that, launch the game as admin and try starting a custom/practice match. \n\nIf that works normally, sweetness! If not, let's go ahead and run a quick client repair through the client options. Let me know how that goes, and if you're still getting these errors we can dig a little further!","replies":[]}]}
