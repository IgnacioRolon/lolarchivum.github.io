You're meant to progress through Honor ranks throughout the season, and it wouldn't leave much room to rank up if people were already moving up. We should start seeing checkpoints and rankups before too long though.","replies":[{"poster":"YoRHa No5 Type N","date":"2018-01-31T12:59:22.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you're probably right. I was just surprised to not move up 1 check point. I would think they wouldn't have it take to the end of the season to reach honor 5 since you still get rewards once you reach it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-31T21:42:30.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you here! I'm sure it won't take *all* season to get up to rank 5, because just like you said you can keep getting rewards regularly even once you hit the max rank! I'm betting we'll start seeing rank 3's within a couple weeks at most.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
