Also like the titles says, I just cant stand the color theme and how it generally looks. Light colors are more appealing imo, this feels gloomy and uninteresting. Also this wasn't something that was necessary or that the community needed so the common question flying around the boards is just, why? I honestly feel like the boards weren't even QA'd because someone must have realized that this isn't a change for the better.\n\"New isn't always better\"","replies":[{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2014-10-23T17:03:02.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I love reddit, I just dont like the idea of them bringing the style here and completely replacing the old forums with it.

Not the best solution I'll grant it to you but it is still something.\n\nAs for the reddit functionality, simply set the sorting on top of the page to \"new\" and it will act as any regular forum does for the threads.\nFor posts, set it to chronological sorting.\nhttp://gyazo.com/a8a7e207913f98550c4c22587911ef78.png\n\nI'll also give you that work still needs to be done on this place but the old boards just had some programming limits that had been reached long ago so Riot came up with a custom solution.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-10-22T20:48:43.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of it is a rant, I'll admit, but look for the salient points:\n\n>The forums was so nice to look at and this just killed it\n\n>and destroyed the forum community\n\n>I don't really understand why\n\nThis is actually kind of useful feedback, especially if we ask the OP to elaborate and he/she does.
