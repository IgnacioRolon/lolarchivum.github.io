Some minutes into the game I got the message \"Attempting to reconnect\". My Wifi disconnected, and reconnected within a matter of seconds. I tested the connection by logging into TeamSpeak, streaming videos, loading other games, and my internet was perfect. However, inside my League game, I still was receiving the message \"Attempting to reconnect\".\r\n\r\nI did not want to be LeaverBusted, so I let the client sit there hoping it would reconnect. An hour passes. I'm now frustrated and exit the game seeing as how I'd made no progress and am stuck in an infinite loop of \"Attempting to recconect\" . The second I exited the game, I was brought to the post-game lobby, not a screen telling me to reconnect to my game. That's because the game had been over for the last 20 minutes of me waiting. I read all the post game chat, saw all the stats for the game, but was told I had been LeaverBusted. But I \"left\" 20 mins after the game ended. Broken. This is unacceptable and broken. I don't know how something like this makes it into a stable build of a software release. I bet I'm not the only person this has happened to.\r\n\r\nTLDR; I was LeaverBusted for leaving a game that was over. So I literally didn't leave any game at all. LeaverBuster is flawed. The issue may stem further down into the client itself's connection protocol.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKepler","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-16T22:05:10.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being punished for leaving a single game is definitely unacceptable.
