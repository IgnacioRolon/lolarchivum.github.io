I understand it&#039;s programmed to loop into the same animation once she&#039;s on the ground, but because of this, **she won&#039;t ever start laughing until you wait like 3 seconds** while standing still and not within auto attack range of anything. \r\n**The first part of the loop should at least go on even if you don&#039;t wait through the animation.**\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you&#039;ll pretty much NEVER hear the laugh. For a champ whose identity is being bats*** crazy, it&#039;s strange seeing her always play silent, cold and calculating. Even on ARAM, there&#039;s no goofing around with her. I just played her a lot since she was free week, but never being able to laugh in funny situations feels weird. I&#039;d buy her instantly if she worked normally.\r\n\r\nPLEASE, fix her!!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-12T23:43:10.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nAs it is now, the laugh hooked up to allow it to loop, which means it's not spammable (and doesn't start immediately). In a perfect world (and tech permitting), you'd be able to have both a spammable emote, and an infinite laugh loop. So, currently, this is working as intended. she is a bit older, and when she was made, that was the extent the tech could function. Not sure if said limitations are still in place, but it couldn't hurt to look.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poat is High","date":"2016-09-08T01:13:26.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes - I play {{champion:222}} a ton and can never laugh anymore - I feel like BEFORE.. it wasn't an issue (like a few patches ago maybe) - but then suddenly I remember not being able to laugh as easily or having to really stand behind my creeps and wait first","replies":[]}]}
