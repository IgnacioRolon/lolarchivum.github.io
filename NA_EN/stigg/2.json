During the game I will loose connection to the servers (my internet connection is fine every-time I checked.). It won't tell me I've been disconnected, but when I go to lane, the lane minions are either invisible or keep fighting without loosing health. If I use any abilities nothing happens, but about every 20 seconds the game randomly \"rewinds\" to me using my ability with either me dead or loosing half my health. I can freely move during the disconnect, but everything else is frozen. \n\nLucky, I have only experienced this during normal games, but I've still lost games because of it (Games I could of easily won because I was against an easy match-up). \n\nWill I get a game restriction because of this? I don't want to be banned or restricted because of my connection to the servers.

The issue you're describing is typically related to *Packet Loss* and is an indication that your connection to our servers is pretty unstable. I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure your network settings are harmonious with League.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
