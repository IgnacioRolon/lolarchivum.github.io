I stopped playing for about a month and a half , since I've come back my ping went from a stable 100-125 ping on NA to 150-250 ping with noticeable lag jumps. Even worse is I'm lagging on EUW too, I used to have 20 ping now I get 50-70ping, I can barely catch Draven's axes now.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T02:16:15.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're gonna have a bad time if you can't catch Draven's axes!\n\nWith your ping hovering that high, it sounds like your network is having a hard time keeping a stable connection throughout the whole game.
