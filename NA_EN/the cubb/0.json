But still unplayable.\r\n\r\nI used to be game lag-free and played regularly without issues until about 2 months ago. I think it was shortly after my McAfee expired. I have just recently paid and re-installed Fsecure which I had before Mcafee. I dont know much about anti-virus' ect.\r\nMy friend who works in tech support came by to help yesterday and used an ethernet cable and changed settings on my router but the game was still unplayable whilst going through the etherner and I usually get pretty good broadband speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To summarise:** I dont know what my fps was when i used to play fine around 2months ago but right now it is hovering around 4, the game is unplayable at this rate it just jumps. I dont know how to fix this. I have just installed new anti virus and ran a clean it is fine and also ran cc cleaner and deleted history. My laptop is good and lol used to run just fine on it and had done for a while up until only fairly recently.

Generally, FPS problems occur from bad drivers, game files, or even hardware issues.  Instead, I suggest going over each step of the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to troubleshoot this towards a fix.  That should do the trick but let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
