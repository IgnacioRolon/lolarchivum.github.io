Last year as in 2018 around this time at end of season I had been 10 day chat restricted twice, since then I have went up the honor system from 0 checkpoint 0 to honor lvl 3 at the last checkpoint. I had some very frustrating games and got instantly got a 14 day ban with threat for perm ban on next infraction. Based on these logs and over a year of honorable behavior I think that is pretty unjust.\r\n\r\n I have no motivation to edit the logs I will just copy paste them so you can read them and discuss what you think. I will not be offended if you think that the conduct was inappropriate or out of line, which I would tentatively agree. I will also not be offended if you think the punishment was reasonable, though I will strongly but respectfully disagree.\r\n\r\nHere are the logs \r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nChristmasTime: red start\r\nChristmasTime: teemo leashing panth\r\nChristmasTime: teemo no f\r\nChristmasTime: stop die\r\nChristmasTime: y u not come for the last 5 min when f was down lol\r\nChristmasTime: how\r\nChristmasTime: did they roll 4 platersw in every roll\r\nChristmasTime: that are significantly beter\r\nChristmasTime: than u\r\nChristmasTime: how\r\nChristmasTime: fuk ni\r\nChristmasTime: how am i toxic lmao\r\nChristmasTime: jg\r\nChristmasTime: doesnt come top\r\nChristmasTime: for 109 min with no top f\r\nChristmasTime: and you 3 flame eachother\r\nChristmasTime: while all of u feed\r\nChristmasTime: make the game unwinable for me\r\nChristmasTime: completely\r\nChristmasTime: ?\r\nChristmasTime: dude this is over\r\nChristmasTime: u think i give a shit aovut u fucking dying to my laner for free\r\nChristmasTime: after u fuked around all game with bot and mid\r\nChristmasTime: when they are clearly animals\r\nChristmasTime: and my laner had no sums\r\nChristmasTime: like\r\nChristmasTime: fuk\r\nChristmasTime: LOL\r\nChristmasTime: UR LVL 6\r\nChristmasTime: mute report move on -

However, in reality that word is by no means hate speech towards those who are mentally ill. The word's actual definition in a noun form is either a term to refer to someone who is affected with mental r%%%%%ation, such a person would exhibit signs of intellectual impairment which can usually be indicated by significantly lower than average IQ scores. The other definition and the way the word is used in common culture is to refer to someone who is foolish or stupid. \n\nRegardless of Riot's policy, the \"R-word\" being referenced in my logs is in no way hate speech. Hate speech refers to any speech expressing hatred of a group of people. Nowhere in my chat did I ever do that, calling a person a member of a group is not the same as expressing hate towards that group. I hate being labeled as someone who would hate any group of people or someone actively engaging in hate speech as it simply isn't true. Because I believe the 14-day ban was specifically because of \"hate speech\" but since by definition I have not engaged in such behavior, I think the ban is really unwarranted, though I feel a chat restriction would be completely justified.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-16T08:40:39.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem isn't that you got a 14-day without a 25-game; it's that you got a second 10-game rather than a 25-game.

Surprised people don't realize that the punishment system reverts. If you get a 10-game and get back to Honor 2 (roughly) without getting punished again you're basically reset to a 10-game restriction.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MeesterMo","date":"2019-11-16T17:38:31.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ChristmasTime","date":"2019-11-16T18:52:03.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MeesterMo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vPnejAp3,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-11-16T17:38:31.063+0000)\n>\n> Lol imagine being proud of being honor 0 checkpoint 3.
