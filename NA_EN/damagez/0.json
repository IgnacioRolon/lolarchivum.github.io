Almost every movement Nautilus makes causes parts of his body/armor to pass through other parts, It just looks clustered and like it was rushed.  Nautilus is one of my favorite champions and I'm all for a new skin but I am hoping Riot takes more time with this skin and cleans it up before releasing it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-04T18:08:58.246+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there! \n\nKeep in mind that the SkinSpotlights video was made when this skin first hit PBE. \n\nSkins on PBE are constantly changing, and issues are being fixed.

For example, you can search \"Kitty Katarina old model skin\", and it should have a video of what it looked like when it was first released. While also having a video of skins when they get a model update. =P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jaghatai","date":"2015-02-04T18:28:29.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The blue mohawk really ruins this skin for me.
