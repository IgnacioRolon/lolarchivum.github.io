Like if you purchase a skin, but your account got banned, should riot give at least a partial refund? Or does the player deserve it, even if it was 1000 dollars? Please share your opinion below, as i would love to hear them.\n\nEdit: k i realize the partial refund thing was unrealistic. That was just an suggestion. My question is, do players deserve to get their money they earned in real life taken away for being toxic?\n\n","replies":[]}
