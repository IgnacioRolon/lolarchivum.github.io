After that, highlight the name and then go to the bottom of the post and find the \"Insert a link\" button, next to the quotes and strikethrough options.  Click that, then paste the URL into the text field that shows up.  From there, just repeat the process for each concept you have.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"SushiKnight","date":"2015-03-31T21:00:29.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh here I remade it a bit\nAnd I will \"TRY\" to do the hyperlink >.< \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/5EqQi9Zo-sushi-champion-archive\nOh and btw I never knew someone actually took a look at this","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SushiKnight","date":"2015-03-31T20:44:24.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added more link's!","replies":[]}]}
