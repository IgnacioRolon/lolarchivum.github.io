So I left and tried to reload again and it didn't work giving me bugsplats tons of times.

I recommend going over our [Game Crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) guide to help troubleshoot this.  As a first step, I suggest updating your graphics driver and running a repair which can recover any files that may have become corrupt.
