World of Warcraft and League of Legends are online games through and through. Offline LoL would make about as much sense as offline WoW, which is why neither one exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiwah","date":"2019-01-13T12:06:21.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-13T12:24:20.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shiwah,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8PrYUcV6,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-13T12:06:21.809+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s the point - I have a feeling OP mixed up the games, unaware of the difference between titles and available features. Not that important, probably, but using the wrong game as an example to set to ask for offline LoL, well... As you said, it makes no sense even if OP used the correct example - Warcraft being a RTS, and LoL being a multiplayer-oriented game as its core.\n> \n> But then again, the concept of MOBA was born from a Warcraft III mod, so who&#x27;s to say what will happen?\n> \n> On an unrelated note, I&#x27;m seriously considering preordering WC3 Reforged!\n\nWhile LoL did originate from a WC3 mod (or a SC mod; I don't know), the key is that they're different games. Just as LoL isn't just online DLC for WC3, an offline version of LoL could only come from an entirely new game - and what's the incentive to make such a thing? Operating games as a service offers complete control over every part of the game, while allowing mods and offline play frees players from depending on the company for everything.\n\nWhy do you want the not-new WC3? It's the same game with slightly better graphics, falling somewhere between [buying retro Nintendo games repeatedly on a succession of Virtual Consoles](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/09/15/wiiactions) and watching a reboot of a recent movie (like Spider-Man, The Hulk, etc.).","replies":[{"poster":"Shiwah","date":"2019-01-13T12:44:07.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2019-01-13T13:46:30.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"_-Insert your ackchyually response here-_","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2019-01-13T13:40:55.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dota 2 allows you to play offline with bots, so it's not like it's impossible to do.","replies":[]}]}]}
