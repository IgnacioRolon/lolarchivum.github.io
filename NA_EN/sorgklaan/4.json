There are ways you can make yourself useful late game though, such as focusing your attention solely on the carries, and ulting to cut off the escape routes of your enemies.\n\nThe issue here is that guys like Renekton, Volibear, and Xin Zhao can splitpush late game, and Pantheon is only slightly better at taking towers than Mages are (hell, Ziggs does a better job at it).\n\nPantheon is far more team reliant on his successes late game than those three.  If your team derps, those three can just split push.  If your team derps when you're playing Pantheon, you're SOL.\n\nPantheon got indirectly screwed preseason with the lazer towers, but everyone was paying too much attention to his ability to block dragon shots to care, and after the dust cleared he was unplayable until Warrior got buffed and Black Cleaver got reworked.\n\nRight now, some good ideas would be to normalize his ultimate's mana cost to 100 mana, and give him some more late game utility, like a slightly longer stun on his W from 1 sec at all ranks to 1.1-1.5.  I don't know any other ideas right now that wouldn't push his early game over the edge.\n\nEdit: Pantheon doesn't need a rework.  He's an extremely well made champion that has a low skill floor but a high skill ceiling.  He just needs some balance tweaks and some fresh ideas to reinvigorate him, and he'll be back to his good ol ass kicking top lane self.\n\nEdit 2:  Did I mention he counters Fiora?

Sometimes you want to engage with your ult, pinching the enemy team with the indicator and your team's engage tools, or you'll want the fight to start and ult in about 2 seconds into the fight to disrupt the flow of things. Hydra and Black Cleaver are enough to pressure mages and marksmen, given that you actually land your Heartseeker on them and use Randuin's active to keep them in range. You probably won't get kills but you create a shitton of pressure. \n\nApart from fights, split pushing is your main thing, which is why you build Ravenous Hydra. The ideal situation is that you force 1 or 2 enemies to come and stop you, and you ult to where the rest of the enemy team and your team are at and win the fight based on number advantage.
