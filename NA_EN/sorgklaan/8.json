As could Zilean and Ziggs, you don't want to TRIGGER anybody with those bombs and explosions, do you riot?\n\nDon't forget about Brand and Annie, those two are insensitive to burn victims and could be very triggering.\n\nElise is triggering to anybody with arachnophobia, so she should be removed as well.\n\nSome people are triggered by blood, so vladimir has to go.\n\nJungling has to go as well, because killing frogs and wolves is animal abuse, and that could be very triggering.\n\nWhat about Singed? He could be triggering to those who have experienced chemical warfare, swain and fiddlesticks are triggering to people with crow phobias, shaco could trigger people with a fear of clowns.\n\nWhat if a suicidal person hears one of Karthus's quotes and it pushes them over the edge? Better censor that too.","replies":[{"poster":"Yatsufuså","date":"2015-11-14T04:49:04.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually thought the Corki sirens were fire.

I wouldn't care if they were just changing it because they thought they could improve it, but they're clearly changing it just to capitulate to the SJW crowd.\n\nGaming is already infested enough with Anita Sarkeesian's and Zoe Quinn's.","replies":[{"poster":"Yatsufuså","date":"2015-11-14T04:55:00.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Censoring sirens though.. might as well sensor the Call of Duty series while the gaming industry is at it.\n\n (I know Riot doesn't own Activision or TreyArch, but seriously... to censor a \"trigger\" siren is so dumb while games like CoD 1,2,3,4 and world at war exist)","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-14T04:57:53.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Censoring, not Sensoring. lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Yatsufuså","date":"2015-11-14T04:59:03.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that.

There's very few people saying it's even PTSD stuff. I've seen more people comparing it to the sirens for tornado warnings in tornado-heavy states, which is less of SJW and more of 'Crap, prolly shouldn't use the same sound as a life-threatening siren', but most of the complaints are how damn annoying it is. I love Corki, but playing him sometimes is like... SHUT UP, SIREN.
