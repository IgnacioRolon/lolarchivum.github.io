Can&#039;t believe you&#039;re actually capitulating to these moronic SJW&#039;s.\n\n Why not just delete corki in general, those bombs can be pretty triggering. Better delete Ziggs and Zilean too, they could be triggering to people as well.\n\nAnd hey, killing gromp is animal abuse, that could be triggering, better censor that as well, am I right?  \n\nBrand and annie are pretty damn triggering to burn victims, you should feel ashamed for your insensitivity.\n\n\nFor context: \n\n> I wanted to reach out and let you know that we've gotten some great feedback regarding the siren sound that plays with Corki's Special Delivery ability.\n\n>Admittedly, the reaction that is elicited by this type of sound effect for some players was overlooked by the team, and we're going back to the drawing board on this one.","replies":[]}
