We singed mains don&#039;t build Tear or ROA anymore, because Ryalai&#039;s+liandry&#039;s has been such an amazing combo for so long, giving him the tankiness, damage, and slipperyness he needs.\n\nFitting with the theme of the passive, could we instead change it to give resists based on AP or something? I&#039;m not really asking for a buff, but his passive currently has nothing to do with how most actual singed players play singed.\n\nEvery other Singed ability is iconic, but if singed has room for change, it is definitely in the passive.\n\n\n\nEDIT ( originally posted on page 5 ): One more thing I would like to contribute. You could argue that the passive is redundant because as long as you manage your poison correctly, singed has absolutely no mana problems that a dorans or two or a pot can't solve in the earlygame. The only reason he builds mana is to abuse his passive, but beyond that he has absolutely no reason to build mana.\n\nAnd I think that's an issue, his passive should be an expansion of his other abilities, not a separate thing to be abused. Why does he have a passive built around mana stacking when he has absolutely no mana problems to begin with?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-15T21:40:00.228+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree that Singed's passive could use some work.

I like the second one and third as well, and they would work well with the first one. As for whether I would rather rather have a stronger heal or more movement speed, it's hard to say, because I don't know the power budget on it. If it could be a fairly strong heal that was useful outside of laning phase, then I think I would prefer the heal. Otherwise I think the movement speed would be better, but it would still have to be worth buying the potion.\n\nElixirs lasting indefinitely is a bit ehhhh for me. Elixirs already last for a long time, so you would have to survive for a very long time for the passive to even be worth it, and singed is about throwing himself into certain death and escaping by a thread. It's just not a high enough reward for how dangerous his job is.\n\nthe last one is interesting, could you flesh out how that would function?  I can't see that being particularly gold efficient or easy to balance. I'd imagine it would have to be in conjuction with 1 through 3 to be any good, and it would have to be on a timer most likely. Again, you'd have to flesh out the ideas a bit more before I can decide on this one.\n\n\nI have an idea, it's a bit thematically weird, but you can change it how you see fit. Basically singed has his own special potions in the shop that only he can buy, however, he can get them mostly for free. The catch is that the more you poison enemies, the more stacks of X you gain, and you use X to buy said potions. Kind of a spin on gangplank's special currency.\n\n\nJust an odd idea, not thematically related to anything, but I'd just like to see how others spin and change that base idea.","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-08-15T23:16:08.374+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, thematically that makes sense because Singed is trying out his creations on the battlefield, then using the data that he collected to improve upon them.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorgklaan","date":"2015-08-15T23:29:44.645+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sp441,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6KATE5fZ,comment-id=00050000000000010000,timestamp=2015-08-15T23:16:08.374+0000)\n>\n> Well, thematically that makes sense because Singed is trying out his creations on the battlefield, then using the data that he collected to improve upon them.\n\nRight, something like that could be interesting.

Based on what's in the bottle, it can add various effects to him or his abilities.  For example, an Elixir of Iron can allow his Fling to move people a little further, or a Mana Potion can cause his poison trail to change color to blue and reduce enemy damage by 2% while they're in it.\n\nYou can have items stack, or even trigger special effects when he mixes certain, more potent combinations.

In an approx 30 min game I dealt 26,936 damage where you have done 17,597. Granted, you are diamond and people are a bit more cautious than silver. Still, after checking multiple games, I usually have over 20k damage if it lasts more than 30 minutes.\n\nI mean, i checked out your ranking on lolskill score and you are like, 115th best in the world. Not gonna say you are bad because that would be a blatant lie.  I'm just saying I think you could have way more survivability and damage with a roa.\n\nIf you don't believe me:\nyou with roa 39 min 40 sec game 46,083 to champions...\nyou without roa 44 min 47 sec 35,947 to champs\n\nwith: 23m 45s 15,279 damage\nwithout: 24m 34s 8,210 damage","replies":[{"poster":"g07h4xf00","date":"2015-08-16T04:23:33.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ah Keel U,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6KATE5fZ,comment-id=0009000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-16T01:56:48.684+0000)\n>\n> Hmmm...

A {{item:1056}} {{item:3116}} build is much more aggressive than a {{item:3027}} build you get more AP and HP sooner and the permaslow passive.\n\n>In an approx 30 min game I dealt 26,936 damage where you have done 17,597. Granted, you are diamond and people are a bit more cautious than silver.

You have to analyze it in a vacuum and you can't do that if you take two random games with different circumstances and compare them. There's this thing called \"doing math\" that you should try once in a while. Also, Diamond players are smarter about taking free harass/damage, kiting, and running through poison than silver players are. Worthless comparison.\n\n> I'm just saying I think you could have way more survivability and damage with a roa.\n\nYou say that without any math to back it up. I've done math (which you can check on my guide) that shows that Rylais+Liandrys is more damage than RoA+Anything on {{champion:27}} \n\n> \n> If you don't believe me:\n> you with roa 39 min 40 sec game 46,083 to champions...\n> you without roa 44 min 47 sec 35,947 to champs\n> \n> with: 23m 45s 15,279 damage\n> without: 24m 34s 8,210 damage\n\nWorthless numbers, once again. Not statistically representative, not scientifically accurate. \n\nPlayers in general have this strange notion conditioned into their head that \"oh I have to build {{item:3027}} because Singed's passive mentions the word 'mana'\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FatalHalo","date":"2015-08-16T01:39:08.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A nice potion passive would be singed gaining 1 permanent health every 5/3/1 second a potion is in effect, including his ult.
