What he means is when you set Fullscreen mode in graphics settings, the game switches monitor refresh rate to 60 Hz and there is no way to change it. Most games let you manually select monitor refresh rate in graphics settings, but for some reason League isn't one of them. I checked the entire game.cfg file and there is no such setting to modify either.\nIf you choose Windowed or Borderless, League adapts to desktop refresh rate (which in my case is 180 Hz) and the game is buttery-smooth. But when you switch to Fullscreen mode (which is the only playable setting on macOS), your screen refresh rate is set to 60 Hz even though both hardware and software support higher refresh rates (confirmed that using a hardware FPS meter built into my monitor). There is no such issue on Windows because League recognizes the refresh rate correctly and switches to the highest possible one.\n\"How did you manage to check it?\" - you may ask. I own a 2016 MacBook Pro and I really like this laptop, but it lacks computing power AF so just few days ago I decided to try out Hackintosh on my gaming machine. Right now I am running macOS Sierra (10.12.4) on a custom rig with Core i7-6700K, Asus Maximus VIII Hero motherboard and 16 gigs of DDR4 RAM. My monitor is Asus ROG PG248Q which natively supports 180Hz refresh rate at 1080p and it is hooked up to GTX 1080 via DisplayPort. I am using the latest Nvidia Web Driver for Pascal GPUs (ver. 378.05.05.05f02) and macOS fully supports that monitor's refresh rate (even G-Sync is working properly!). But when League is running in Fullscreen mode on macOS, the monitor shows 60Hz refresh rate even though the GPU is pushing well over 300 fps (quite poor compared to 700+ fps in Windows on the same hardware, but I know it's OpenGL).\nIt's clearly RIOT's fault there :/\n\nI do realise that 99,999(...)% of Mac users have 60Hz panels and this issue does not apply to them, but I came across this thread while looking for solution so I decided to reply. I hope they will fix it because I'd love to play League on my PC without having to reboot to Windows in order to do that.","replies":[]}]}]}
