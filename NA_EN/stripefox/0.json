Think of it like that punch card you get at a smoothie shop - you don't get the free smoothie until you get 10 punches, so you don't get punished until you get however many games logged against you. You've shown a pattern in your behavior, which is why you got punished. I think it'd be wise to stop \"defending yourself\" and instead mute the people complaining and move on with your game.","replies":[{"poster":"StripeFox","date":"2018-07-06T20:17:27.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So the only thing I can do is just mute all in game chat?\nThis doesnt seem like the right decision for competitive play.\n\nNormal in game banter shouldnt get you banned.
