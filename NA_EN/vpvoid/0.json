I also find it tiny, but am unable to drag to resize, and don't see any size options in the in-client settings. Note: I find it tiny, as I play on 1440p, which makes the client pretty much too small to read most things.

Can we get a response on this? If there are indeed options to change the size, I'd like to know where, as this is currently making me unable to test the Alpha client. I literally just can't see any of the details at the size it's defaulting to.\n\nNote: This comparison is just to provide a frame of reference between the two sizes. If you're viewing the screenshot on a 1080p monitor, the 1440p image is going to appear huge and very easy to read. The point here is the size of the client in reference to the size of the screen around it.
