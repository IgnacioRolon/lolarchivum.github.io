But today when I tried to get on the old client by clicking on it on my desktop I get the error \"The item lol.launcher.exe that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved so this will shortcut will no longer work properly\" I thought thats weird so I checked my league of legends folder and the old client isn't there! only the alpha client. When I open the alpha client everything works fine I have no idea what happened or how to get the old client back.\r\n\r\nPicture of the league folder\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/353ZgiI.png?2","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-28T23:43:19.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The alpha client is completely independent of the live client, so installing it should not cause you to lose the other.  Download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to see if it can find your game files and perform a fresh repair.  Otherwise, it may need to be reinstalled.
