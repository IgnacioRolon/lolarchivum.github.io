But for months now, I have been getting FPS lag in league and my gpu only being around 30%. I used to get 200+fps constantly on my 960. Now with the 1070. starts 450 and that is at 50% then flats out to 20-30%ish load then bounce up and down from 90-200, causing fps lag. no, it didn't start right after I got the 1070.
