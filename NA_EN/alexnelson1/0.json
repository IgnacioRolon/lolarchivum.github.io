By banning them? \n\n  You didn't have just one bad game, you had multiple. \n\n If this game warranted a permanent suspension that means you had multiple previous punishments in the form of a 10-game chat restriction, a 25-game chat restriction, and a 14-day gameplay suspension. It was stated on your last reform card that \"Any continued negativity _will_ result in a permanent suspension.\" \n\nRiot has already made it abundantly clear that this type of behavior is unacceptable and they warned you that continued negativity would yield harsher and harsher punishments. You ignored those warnings and got punished accordingly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-06-29T02:16:30.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Downvote EVERYONE, that'll get you your account  back...","replies":[]},{"poster":"JetRam","date":"2019-06-29T02:01:51.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not being self-aware enough to see it's ban-worthy was your downfall, especially after a previous 14 day.......\n\nTLDR: you deserved it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-06-29T02:33:45.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bans.

People don't get perma-banned from one toxic game. They get perma-banned after a history of toxic behavior and only after other punishment has already been given. You aren't going to get anybody's sympathy, and the devs aren't going to lift your ban because of a forum post. At best, they're going to correct you, show the actual data from your behavior, and roast you for everybody to see. \n\nIf you think it's an error, send a support ticket, and if it's wrong, they'll fix it.
