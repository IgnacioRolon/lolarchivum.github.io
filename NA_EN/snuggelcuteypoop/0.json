Once scrolling the speed is normal, but if I stop and start scrolling again there will be a moment of lag time before it starts to scroll again. I haven't been able to find this problem before. It just started happening to me when I got a new computer. Windows 10. I can provide more details if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-29T17:48:10.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to tell the cause based on the info here, it could be a lag spike or even corrupted configuration settings.  What happens if you try using another mouse?  See if resetting your config helps here:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.
