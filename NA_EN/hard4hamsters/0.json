I know there is no guarantee that these changes will upset the balance of champions drastically, but are you prepared for a large undertaking if things don&#039;t go well in 5.13?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-06-30T19:44:43.994+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yup, we figure there are reasonable odds we'll have to do an above average amount of follow up work in 5.14. \n\nIn terms of amount of change per patch something we're always interested in is trying to find that line between too little change (which results in problems persisting too long and the game feeling stale) and too much change (which results in things feeling too chaotic and messy). How much change is appropriate also varies based off the time of year. The start of a new season's a good time for more disruption for example, while the patch just before Worlds is one we prefer to be more conservative on (introducing Devourer in the Worlds patch, without having time to make followup balance changes would be a poor idea for example).","replies":[{"poster":"badooga","date":"2015-07-01T12:59:25.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So shouldn't you take it more slowly and not majorly change both jungle and AP itemization instead of doing it all at once? That way you have more time to watch the effects of one change on the PBE and the other on live, which makes it so that there is hopefully less balancing needed in the long run.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paress","date":"2015-07-01T10:17:45.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hviK4k8M,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-06-30T19:44:43.994+0000)\n>\n> Yup, we figure there are reasonable odds we'll have to do an above average amount of follow up work in 5.14. \n> \n> In terms of amount of change per patch something we're always interested in is trying to find that line between too little change (which results in problems persisting too long and the game feeling stale) and too much change (which results in things feeling too chaotic and messy).

And as far as balance goes champions that receive a nerf just because they get some play by pros is a bit absurd. A lot of these champs that get nerfed have been strong and have only gotten recognition because they are played well in the lcs. take season 3 for example i never saw any morgana players and hardly any in the lcs. she was instantly banned in ranked and never really played in normals, yet someone used some logic and said hey her kit is pretty good let's take her support. all of season 4 support morganas in bot.

And if there's no blatantly glaring balance issues at the time, it will be about whichever assassin is most popular at the time. That is how it has always been.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Curling Veigar","date":"2015-06-30T19:05:22.857+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:8}} {{champion:68}}","replies":[{"poster":"rebound2","date":"2015-06-30T21:58:08.193+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3751}} {{item:3751}} {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}} \n{{item:3751}} {{champion:17}} {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}} {{champion:17}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}} {{champion:17}}  {{item:3751}} \n{{item:3751}} {{item:3751}} {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}}  {{item:3751}} \n\n{{summoner:14}} {{summoner:14}} **DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME** {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:14}}","replies":[{"poster":"windwolf777","date":"2015-07-01T08:16:51.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The devil's greatest trick is making people think he doesn't exist","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlytherinUmbreon","date":"2015-07-01T04:23:19.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I for one welcome our new DoT overlords","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-06-30T19:07:18.707+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Emergency Dart Reserve is probably on standby.","replies":[]}]}
