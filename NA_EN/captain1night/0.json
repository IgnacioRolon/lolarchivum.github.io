Then I grinded out of my honor 0 and got a popup saying congrats I'm now honorable again, but when I check my profile it still displays honor level 0 and I don't receive key frags and it seems I'm stuck at honor 0 even though the game gave me the popup that I had been on good behavior long enough to become honorable again.  I havn't reported it until now because I kept hoping that eventually it would fix it self if i played enough to level up honor again and I typically buy alot of keys anyway, but its not happening and now that PBE signup is out I have a reason to want it fixed ASAP","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-15T21:57:05.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The popup you saw was most likely one letting you know that you were eligible to receive honor-related hextech loot again after your suspension. Your Hextech loot was unlocked already, and you're progressing and earning Honor at the normal rate currently, even if you're still at rank 0.","replies":[]}]}
