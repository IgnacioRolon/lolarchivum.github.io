Instead, I received a notice that stated \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.\" Has anyone encountered this problem before? I tried restarting my computer and entering the game through other areas not on my desktop.
