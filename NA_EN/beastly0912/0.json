One a lot of banned players are literally just so competitive there assholes to people who play like complete retards. Its the truth. People play like retards 99% of the time in normals, so people who are trying not to lose there rank because there close to demotion go to normals, or they play with their friends, in normals. This creates the fact that people are still competitive in normals, just because its normals, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT COMPETITIVE. Winrates are a thing you know. If people are competitive and have a hard time not yelling at complete utter idiots, rather give them a disable chat button, OR MAKE A PUNISHMENT THAT MUTES THERE ACCOUNT IN TEAM CHAT AND ALL CHAT. First mute would be all chat, second mute team chat. say you go through 25 games of all chat. You then go through 5-10-15-25 games of the whole chat being muted. After you&#039;ve got through all those punishments, you get a perm mute all chat. Than if you are toxic to your team, you get a whole chat perm mute. Or make it easy and just make a friggin disable chat button in game options. Truthfully I feel like a lot of people think riots scummy because they could easily implement 1 of the 2 things, or both of them for that matter, into the game. But nope, they need to ban players. Waste there money, get them to get new accounts and spend more money. Thats all riots doing in my opinion, and they get site views for people making tickets about there punishment. Seriously riot, you can easily do this. Implement it in the next update, not that hard. Or be scummy and try and take 12- 100 year olds money away from them.\r\n{{champion:122}} {{item:3348}} {{summoner:30}}","replies":[{"poster":"Leylania","date":"2018-02-16T02:53:06.724+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could just learn to control yourself and realise that it's just a video game with actual people at the other end of the connection that are not into getting flamed.

And what would that be? Afking and inting mostly. And unlike flaming you can't just get rid of that with a click on the mute button. So no, the banning system is good as it is. You knew the rules beforehand and broke them, don't beg for other forms of punishment just because you fucked up.","replies":[{"poster":"Beastly0912","date":"2018-02-16T02:56:57.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"First off I explained why people were getting mad and flaming, no one rages like a child.

Mature players with any skill know that raging and flaming hurts themselves worse than anyone else and just forces a loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leylania","date":"2018-02-16T03:21:16.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot makes the rules, so no, they don't have to adapt at all.
