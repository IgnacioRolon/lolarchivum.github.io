Less than one minute into the game, my client suddenly started on-and-off disconnecting and I couldn't move for small durations. As it got worse, I turned on Fraps and started recording my gameplay. I uploaded to YouTube some of the worse moments of my game. I had a constant 40-50 ping throughout the entire game, so it was obviously not my internet's fault. Please fix this Rito, b/c I currently can't play your game, and I'm not inclined to throw my money at you for half-decent skins when your game refuses to work. (BTW, I'd really appreciate my LP back for losing a ranked game b/c your servers don't work.)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T04:52:35.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be sure to drop some traceroutes here as well so we can pinpoint exactly where these connection issues are stemming from. It's been hard to pinpoint thus far, but if it were a server issue *all* of NA would be impacted and not just your area. \n\nIf you're in this area and on the NA server, please run a traceroute using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to the NA server at 104.160.131.1 and post the results here so we can narrow in on where this problem is coming from.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mouthianell","date":"2018-02-09T18:25:12.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Arlington here..
