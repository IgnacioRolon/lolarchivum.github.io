The user transferred my account to EUW and changed the summoner name. While we are still working out the charges on my card I was able to log into my account and change the passwords on everything and get it transferred back to NA. If I LOLking the name that the hacker changed it to on EUW the profile appears with the match history (same exact matches that appear on my match history when I log in on NA). My question is will this user be deleted &amp; is there any way that this user will be punished?\n\nEdit* also if you look at my match history it still has the hackers name - will I get my original summoner name back?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T02:46:52.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't help out with this sort of thing here on H&S, since we'll need to take a deep look at your account.

I'm awaiting a response on both of the tickets atm but I am being helped for sure!\n\nI was just curious in this thread if I am going to have my original summoner name back and if there is really anything we can do about the person who hacked it. If you can't answer that here that's totally cool, I'm just pretty anxious waiting for responses - but I know you guys are busy so it's understandable.","replies":[]}]}]}
