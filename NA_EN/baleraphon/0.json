I've played this game off and on for years. I have a lot of fun with the mechanics and the skill. However, I continue to be surprised by how acidic this gaming community is. When I try to communicate with my team, if they even respond at all, all they do is tell me to shut up. And then if I get stuck in a bad matchup, the flaming is instant and relentless. Almost every day that I play I consider uninstalling because the other players suck all of the fun out of this game.\r\n\r\nI know there are exceptions to this, and some rare games are what I think the ideal is supposed to be, where players can have fun even if they are losing. To those players, I say thank you, and I know that you experience this too. But mostly, it's just frustrating silence, or incessant harrassment. It gets worse the higher level you achieve. I won't even consider playing ranked games, because ranked players tend to be the worst of the worst. Mostly I blame whoever the hell is following up on reported violations (which I actually doubt happens at all, or at least never crosses in front of a real person.) Riot, you encourage the worst in players by not responding to the actual violations that take away from an otherwise great game. By the same token, you discourage people from trying to improve because any time you make a mistake you get shit on.\r\n\r\nI know, too, that this will largely be viewed as a snowflake whining about stuff that everyone has heard before. The ones criticizing are the assholes ruining the game. People have been complaining about the attitude of this gaming community since I began playing over 5 years ago, and nothing changes.\r\n\r\nI have no confidence that this will affect any change whatsoever.","replies":[{"poster":"Baleraphon","date":"2019-10-30T03:05:47.314+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"UPDATE:\n\nI've been reading a lot of comments on other posts about how we should just mute all, never talk to other players, and suffer in silence. Including a quote that says [about Riot]: \"all they care about is chat bans\".\n\nI feel like this mentality is exactly what is cultivating an ever-cascading degradation of the community. Why are people being punished for standing up for themselves, while the people who are intentionally throwing games and blaming people around them seem to go unaffected?\n\nIf we accept your solution to be quiet and just lump it, we become complicit bystanders in the behavior itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Doofy The Yam","date":"2019-11-07T19:00:11.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is one of the truest statements alive. The whole game is just kids arguing and then running to big daddy riot for punishments. Punishments are rarely ever dealt fairly. It creates a sense of injustice and makes them more likely to soft int: which is completely unbannable since they have no idea if youre actually doing it or not","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-10-31T05:39:03.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[See my thread somewhat saying this too (link).](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/LL70BEQF-another-taunt-another-day) I think we're allowed to link other topics in threads... if not I'll remove it on request.\n\nDo you agree?","replies":[{"poster":"Baleraphon","date":"2019-11-01T02:59:25.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like what you said about playing with the same players multiple times to build a sense of community. I think part of the problem is that when I report another player for bad behavior, once I leave the lobby the chances of ever interacting with that player again are so small, that it's impossible to see whether or not they received any consequences. I think if we saw the same players multiple times, it would in fact build more consciousness about playing and interacting with real people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VindicatorOFThey","date":"2019-10-30T05:11:22.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">I've been reading a lot of comments on other posts about how we should just mute all, never talk to other players, and suffer in silence. \n\nAt least in  the silence  nobody is gonna  abuse you / flame you... \n\nSo how is this suffering ? \n\nI mean if you  are  in to getting abused ,,, then sure...{{champion:36}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoollyWitch","date":"2019-11-07T12:11:46.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is my favorite game, but my least favorite community. \n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mcmxcix","date":"2019-10-30T09:38:56.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Resistance is, in fact, Futile\n\nReminds me a good song from The Project Hate *MCMXCIX*\n\n>Song: Nailed\n\nMass Destruction\nImpaled angel face\nExtinction of the angelic race\nResistance is futile...\n666\nResistance is futile...\n\nJoin Us into darkness\nOn clouded skies We ride\nFlog the angels senseless\nIn torment They will die\n\nNailed...Their souls no longer breathe\nNailed...
