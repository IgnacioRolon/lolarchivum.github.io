I don't mean oops there it goes I mean it makes an intense noise that scares the crap out of me and I have to hold down the power button for a sold 3 seconds before it turns off. I've deleted both Skype and League and reinstalled them both. I even installed the Skype that is for the new Windows 10 update and it still happens. I load into the game and 3 seconds in, boom, gone. My boyfriend went in and updated my drivers for everything including my graphics card yet nothing is working. It only happens with League. I can Skype on Overwatch and everything else but with League it's like nah. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T23:32:41.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A recent update with Windows caused some problems with the xbox game bar, and it's causing League to freeze and make odd sounds for some players.
