In reality you have a small window to make it work, in a lot of cases your passive just expires and somebody else gets ascended. You can do the same trick with Kog-maw. \nBut honestly, as Sion, you get a bigger chance to get ascended, but so does volibear, who just flips you right out of your spot.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: Yeah, I felt like you meant that Sion's passive doesn't deserve to be Ascended but what you meant is  he doesn't take any damage, huh. I've ascended my passive tons of times and it never happened in previous patches.\n","replies":[]}]}
