(I want to know so that if I do get it I know I can play and communicate to my team or friends without a problem)\n\nyeah I almost always have skype running.\n\nit's a dell inspiron  15,  3000 series, model 3521.\nblack matte with textured finish.\nof course with the $500 you could get something a bit better than mine, it never hurts to have a little extra performance under the hood.\n\nthough my biggest recommendation at the moment would be to possibly look for something that does NOT have windows 10 installed because of all the weird issues it has running league sometimes. That or if you have another version of windows (7 or 8) to install on it, then that would be good as well since it wont matter if u get windows 10 pre-installed then. I'm running Win 8.1,  i3-3227U cpu 2 core 1.9GHz,  6gig ram, intel HD graphics, 64bit. about 2.5 hour battery life.\n\nnormally would have gotten something a bit better but there was an accident and my old laptop didn't work any more and I needed my laptop for work so I went to the nearest stores to look for a new one the same day and found this one to be good for the price. Normally I wanted to buy a gaming laptop aside from my old one but didn't have much cash at that time so I wanted to avoid a BIG purchase of closer to the $800 - $1000 I had been originally planning to spend on a performance laptop. This one has been working perfectly fine and no real complaints about it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T18:44:49.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, congrats on starting college! ^.^\n\nWhile I can't suggest specific laptop models, I think a good place to start is by ensuring any prospects meet our [Optimal Hardware Suggestions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements/#wq3). Be sure to read the reviews and ensure your model has rated well in decent cooling and reliability. Also, consider battery life ratings.
