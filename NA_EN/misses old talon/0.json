FOR SOME GOD FORSAKEN FUCKING REASON, WHENEVER IT POPS UP AND COMPLETELY ECLIPSES MY YOUTUBE VIDEO OR ARTICLE I WAS READING, IT STAYS FOR THE LAST FUCKING 10 SECONDS UNTIL GAME START.

YOURE ABOUT TO HIT LOAD SCREEN AND SIT AROUND FOR 5-15 MINUTES DOING NOTHING!!! CLICK ME!!! PAY ATTENTION!!! LOVE ME!!!\"** FOR THE WHOLE 10 SECONDS. LIKE, GREAT. NOW THAT VIDEO I WAS WATCHING IS GONNA PLAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE LOAD SCREEN OR THAT GAME I WAS PLAYING IS GONNA GO ON WHILE IM AFK.

Queues can take several minutes, so people often do something else during that time with the expectation that they will be alerted. When a queue pops, you only have a few seconds to act. It makes sense to take focus in this case.\n\nHowever, the other half dozen times the client is programmed to take focus are absolutely unnecessary. If someone has accepted a match, they are well aware that they will soon be put into champ select. If they alt-tab at that time, it stands to reason that they are doing so with the knowledge that they are currently in champ select. There's no need to set focus back to the client on basically every event a few seconds apart. If Riot released a public API to enable third-party clients, someone might actually make a good one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaxusalem","date":"2018-11-07T09:00:32.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Bro to check your runes and summoners or someone is talking to you or you forgot to swap, is actually good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tr4shB4NSYST3M","date":"2018-11-08T02:41:32.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"God i wish i could upvote this 10000x","replies":[]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2018-11-08T02:41:24.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the League client is pretty much a cat?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoÎ˜xer","date":"2018-11-07T07:40:15.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah this also annoys me","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-11-08T02:38:52.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you tried Alt Tab ?  it switches between open windows.
