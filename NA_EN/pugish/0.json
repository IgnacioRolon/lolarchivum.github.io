Don't remember leaving anytime before? There doesn't seem to be a punishment issued either. Is it a bug or did I actually leave a game? Do I get LeaverBuster for leaving one game (I think I might have closed the league tab instead of waiting for the \"defeat\" screen)?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-26T22:02:18.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You did have a Leaverbuster from August but are showing to be in the clear now.  This may have been a dodge, though, which would give you a lower priority queue that lasts for one game.  In this case, you should be in the clear after the one match is complete.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Pugish","date":"2017-10-30T21:25:43.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
