{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-10-27T00:37:44.221+0000","title":"Dammit, Rito","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C6VsDeSo8ZA/UVxYmf9caRI/AAAAAAAADE8/XifgPV_n3t4/s1600/challenge+failed.png\nThe new unveiled Shadow Isles lore is good, damn good. But it just crushed a hope of mine. I was close to posting my own theory and interpretation of the scant little Shadow Isles lore we had (before today), spent weeks tweaking its wording and contemplating it for whole days. When I saw last week or so that you had turned your attention to Mordekaiser and the other Shadow Isles champs though, I was spooked (pun intended) into action. I was worried that soon you&#039;d beat me to the punchline and my carefully-composed work would be for naught, which it now is, D:\n\nNow, what you came out with, it&#039;s absolutely and irrefutably better than what I was cooking up. But I hope you can understand that conceiving a whole culture (because I interpreted Yorick&#039;s lore to mean that the Isles always had deathly spirits, but never harmful), an entire system of how the spirits of the dead became what they are in the afterlife, a whole plot of the Ruined King wanting to unite the warring Isles under one banner but lacking the power to do so, him turning to the aid of an ancient but obscure shade who turned out to be Mordekaiser, and so much more, even coming up with a way of tying in Evelynn and explaining her ambiguous nature . . . only for all those weeks of musing and reiteration to be blown out of the water so completely, it would give me cause to lament. I was so close . . .\n\nWoe is me, you beat me to it. I love the new lore, but it burdens my heart. Dammit, Rito, you crushed my fanfic dreams! Woe woe! **WOE!** Okay, I&#039;ll stop now. Again, your stuff results in a wholly better product and you rock for finally shedding light on the mysterious Isles. But seriously, what am I going to do with all this crap, I don&#039;t want to delete it forever.

This fanfiction should have been about an interpretation of his past and how he became what he is.\nAs you can understand this made it really really susceptible to changes, not only of Veigar but of the game whole, but i did not care: my interest was not creating a rule-bound story but to tell a story about a creature, Veigar, which life was twisted by a series of events that etched his souls and made him a creature of darkness.\n\nObviously, since this is a fanfiction, i would not invent things out of the blue and the core source was respected - only thing is that i would put on a disclaimer that it was my own take, and not an official one. What i meant is that what i wanted to propose could be or could not be totally equal to the official Runeterra, that was still a thing to which players could relate, but the story itself had a value of his own, no matter what kind of changes Riot could introduce to the game!\n\nTL;DR: don' t look at it as of a story of the actual Runeterra, look at it as an alternate story, a what if, that could respect something or not of the current lore but still has interest and value of his own!\n\nAlso, I have an headcanon that probably is comfortable to you... do you see the ocean that stretches beyond Valoran, the Shadow Isles and so on? I hardly think that Riot will ever create a full map of every existing continent in that game, so my headcanon is that beyond this unending ocean there is... another Runeterra, with a slightly different turn of events, and after that another one and so on; the more closer those are, the more they share the same events but still they are so far, far from each other that it' s nearly impossible for a denizen of one of them to land on the other. Maybe your story is localized in one of those..?","replies":[]}]}
