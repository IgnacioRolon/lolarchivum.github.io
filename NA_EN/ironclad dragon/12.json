{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-05-31T22:49:48.652+0000","title":"A Petition For Blight Crystal Sion","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":105,"down_votes":4,"body":"Sion hasn’t had a skin since before he got his visual rework (which I’m frankly in love with). His other skins were brought up to date along with his default appearance, but none of them appeal to me. For some, they do; not for me. But Sion's VU has broadened the potential for future skins. It was wasteful to consider giving him another skin pre-VU, and a shame to force the art team to work within such tight confines. That's no longer the case; he's a modern contender now in the art and tech department. So why not give him a skin to test his newfound limits?\n\nI present **Blight Crystal Sion** for the case. The pictures below are of Absalom, the central antagonist of a game called Darksiders II. Brace yourself: tangent incoming. Darksiders was a charming albeit short-lived series I’ve grown rather fond of; primarily of its art. Some criticize its \"cartoony\" art style, but I find it more captivating than most \"high fidelity\" dirt-and-grit games. The art style shares some similarities with League's; heck, I think Darksiders may have even swayed me into liking the VU'd Summoner’s Rift. Tangent over.\n\nhttps://ngplusblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/475_max.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=&amp;crop=1\n\nComing back to what’s relevant to Sion here, let’s talk about Absalom. As you can see, the guy is nothing short of huge. Massive, even. He towers over the game's protagonist and definitely outweighs him several times over. Sort of like Sion now, towards most of the champ roster. You may notice some other similarities between him and our Undead Juggernaut. Both have a prominent lower jaw; broad shoulders; so thick a neck it calls into question whether it exists; an asymmetrical upper body, the off arm being larger and spikier than the dominant arm, with which they can ram obstacles (Sion uses said shoulder when attacking towers); have exposed torsos with numerous scars and a prominent pectoral injury that’s been closed shut but poorly; wear high-riding belts that double as abdomen armor; have pretty thick boots and greaves; and in case you haven’t noticed… **A BIG HONKING AXE.**\n\nhttp://www.gamearthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Darksiders_2_characters_tohankim-darksiders-ii-6.jpg\n\nhttp://i.neoseeker.com/n/2/sion_skins.png\n\nLook at these two: They're practically identical brothers! I hope you can see that, I really do! Otherwise I'd question whether or not you’re a monk. Join me, brothers and sisters and fellow creatures, help make this a reality. Sion deserves something, even if it isn’t this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky Moniker","date":"2015-06-01T01:29:39.592+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"he needs a more menacing skin, this would be amazing","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-06-01T01:38:12.470+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://media.giphy.com/media/QBjH0bEtlZheg/giphy.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JöJö","date":"2015-06-01T00:35:11.686+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Sion, hate all his skins though so this would be amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbsoluteSadman","date":"2015-06-01T05:04:33.004+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH MY GOD YES ABSALOM SION NOW","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-06-01T05:10:45.284+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcylt4pUts1rk4qm0o1_r1_400.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-06-01T07:30:37.473+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p4VrGYHzFSQ/VSKRKEiTzWI/AAAAAAAAEfE/jGW0IjRzRv8/s1600/tumblr_m9sqah3XWN1r8dy8go1_500.gif","replies":[{"poster":"4NoxiousHours","date":"2016-01-08T14:09:16.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stars Shaper,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Nr712wyq,comment-id=000900000000,timestamp=2015-06-01T07:30:37.473+0000)\n>\n> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p4VrGYHzFSQ/VSKRKEiTzWI/AAAAAAAAEfE/jGW0IjRzRv8/s1600/tumblr_m9sqah3XWN1r8dy8go1_500.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Centuros","date":"2015-06-01T20:46:23.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No gif for this, but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3AhwnmY9uM","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fritterz","date":"2015-06-01T16:13:50.455+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simply put","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-06-03T04:48:02.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:74}} INDEED, A WISE CHOICE.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-06-01T03:27:42.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure I'm a fan of the Blight Crystal line, but I agree that Sion definitely needs a new post-rework skin.\n\nOn the topic of Darksiders...
