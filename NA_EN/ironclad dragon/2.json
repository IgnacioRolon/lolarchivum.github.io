He accepted he wanted to be “King”. Not just the mob boss, captain, or leader— King.    That requires the creation of an actual nation, government, and legacy beyond his own life.   It was simultaneously selfish and yet also the first step towards a redemption.  Accepting that he wants to be king, deciding to devote his life and choices to that goal, now gangplank can finally begin to question what that means, what that will take, how he will have to change, and what sort of King he will be...\nAnd he will not make the mistakes his cruel father made.\n\nA good king?  Maybe not.  But better than bilgewater has seen — and maybe the right king for where that society is headed.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2018-02-20T06:17:12.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=IjMkNLuE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-02-19T18:22:56.388+0000)\n>\n> Buddism upside down yes,  but Stoicism not Epicurean.

Especially passion as a driving, motivating force.  Being motivated via desire for pleasure or fear of pain was seen as a pretty major failing in Stoicism.  'Good' was acting justly and logically in accordance with natural order, as the natural order was seen as the highest order. \n\nEpicureans, by contrast, considered pleasure the highest good.  Though not strictly pleasure in the sense that we might think of it today.  The pursuit of happiness, if you will.  Happiness is good.  Suffering is evil.  So the thing that provides a happy life to the greatest number of people while causing the least possible suffering is good.\n\nThe feel I got from {{champion:420}} is that her faith focuses on attaining that happiness and then continually striving for ever greater happiness.  However, that happiness appears to be primarily self-focused.  The road-building example you cited paints a very different picture, however.  If the focus is on personal happiness that *also* happens to lead to greater happiness among the community, I would rescind the earlier comment about it being purely selfish.  I really hadn't gotten that impression from her in-game quotes, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-02-19T18:33:03.240+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will we start to see these nuances in his story?

This is shown in [Illaoi's color story](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/illaoi-color-story/) when she puts Gangplank through his trial.  He had been left stagnating as the king of Bilgewater for too long, so he almost didn't make it.  His will to rise and become king once more was what put him back in motion to let him pass the trial.\n\nNagakabouros is all about the flow of life, and life itself *is* motion, so Nagakabouros can be called a god of life.  We see this in [Shadow and Fortune](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/shadow-and-fortune/chapter-1.html) when Illaoi straight up annihilates a ton of undead.  I would assume that undead are the ultimate form of stagnation.  \n\nTo help visualize what being in motion is like:\n\nGangplank was almost stagnating, but he is now in motion.\n\nMiss Fortune is likely in motion, but she might not have had her trial yet.  This may become a plot point.\n\nAs confirmed by Rioters, Braum would definitely pass a trial, but apparently he would so obviously pass that Illaoi wouldn't bother putting him through a trial.\n\nJhin would not pass a trial.  Someone asked why, as he's pursuing his art and that could be \"in motion,\" to this a Rioter replied:\n> Is Jhin actually happy?\nIs he actually chasing what his heart wants him to do?\nThere is a bit of subtext in many, many of his lines, here's one on the nose --\n\"There is nothing for me... but this.\" --Jhin\n\nIf Illaoi could put him on trial, Galio would pass.  Apparently divine magic and arcane magic work with different methods, so Galio might be able to get a trial.\n\nRakan would pass.\n\nAll undead would fail automatically, and that might apply to Ascended beings, as they're \"trying to cheat death.\" Not sure if this applies as much to Renekton tho…\n\nVi would pass.\n\nNow, quotes\n\n> Illaoi's religion is about life serving the universe. But Nagakabouros is see as bigger than that goal.\nIllaoi knows, she can not comprehend her god or it's plan. So she and her religion are attempting to serve and understand a small portion of that god idea.\n\n-\n> Nagakabouros doesn't give out bibles, or hard rules. It demands you to be self aware, emotionally present, and iron willed. Her faith requires you to approach you're own subconcious with simultaneous questioning doubt and total certainty.\n\n-\n> Having doubts isn't a \"sin\" in her religion-- failing to take action is.\nArguably having to test Gangplank, a former lover, was an extremely difficult test to give... but she examined her own motives, listened to her gut, and didn't allow herself to hesitate as soon as she realized he needed to be tested.\n\nAlmost all of this information came from [this](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/icewate2-what-exactly-are-illaois-powers-and-which-champions-would-survive-the-test-of-nagakabouros), so if you want the full discussion go there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2018-02-17T09:35:21.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a Rioter, but if you haven't yet read Illaoi's Color Text, I'd highly advise checking it out.
