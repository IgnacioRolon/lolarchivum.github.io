She doesn't feel or play anything like a DoT/poison mage.\n\nI keep hearing this \"poison Mage\" crap. Listen up\nOriginally, Cassiopeia was intended to be a champion who has a playstyle like a adc. Her q and w would poison so that she can use E constantly like an AA. Her Q and w would also help her kite and position. Her r was there to help her stand in mid lane vs champs who can dive her. After all she plays like an adc but has no support. \n\nThis is why, if you look at her guides back in s2, everyone said to max E. Mathematically, it did more damage, more consistent, and more effective. Then champs like zed, Yas, vi.etc started getting played and released. She went from being a bully in lane to being bullied. So people changed the guides l, they recomended maxing q because it was safer even if her dmg was a lot lower. So that's when this whole, poison Mage started to arise\n\nHer original design was not to poison and watch them die. She was meant to hit you with e spams and repositioning with q and w, while stopping enemies from diving with her R. This rework did hat again.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-10-04T04:51:57.648+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well Blitzcrank wasn't originally designed to be a support (he was supposed to be a top laner) but look at how he's being played now.","replies":[{"poster":"BenParadox","date":"2015-10-05T00:53:40.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's not the same.

There was no viable option for the lategame aside from a DPS route, any other playstyle you chose was deliberately suboptimal.\n\nShe had the ability to max Q first in lane and bully the lane super hard, and that had to be removed because it prevented her from being a balancable champion.
