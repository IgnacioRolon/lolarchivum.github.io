People die a lot, but given that a lot of people wander about without getting killed shows that it's not a permanent PUBG game. It's a lawless city, but it seems like there are tules to the place, like the bilgewater tithe existed before Nautilus was a giant, so it's not impossible there are unspoken rules that keep normal people from just being mass murderers. Basically, it's certainly something of a hell hole, but it's got more to it. If you list only the bad of any place, any place will sound inhospitable.\n\nLooking more into some of your specific points, you only get killed by Nautilus if he doesn't collect your payment, and while Fizz certainly steals Tithes from time to time, the large number of ships that don't get killed by Nautilus shows that Fizz isn't constantly screwing people over. Tahm Kench only targets people who are desperate, and even then isn't a force specific to Bilgewater. His bio talks about him showing up in Piltover, so he's not the best example for why Bilgewater shouldn't be lived in. Pyke certainly kills a lot of people, but that doesn't seem to be everything he does. I mean, it's his occupation but he's been doing this for years and hasn't made much of a dent in the Bilgewater population.\n\nA good chunk of your other points could fit with almost any city with gang violence, or any violence at all really. Bilgewater just lacks a legal system, and even then as previously stated it's not just a free for all. And there's good too. You can make your fortune, sail the seas, discover ancient treasure, and more. People will always have their reasons for living in certain places. Why does anyone live in Zaun?

You have to use it. Demacia has plenty of opportunities to do so since their lands are rich and bountiful. Which means there is a lot of people looking for a chance to take a bite. Which most likely is one of the factors why they adopted defensive stance. \n\n\"Demacia's army is often outnumbered, but is arguable the most elite, well-trained army in Runeterra. \"\n\nAncient romans also could enjoy getting outnumbered more often than not.

Though Jarvan IV had studied the theories and tactics of warfare, and could win a duel against his swordmaster, he had never stood on the front lines of a battle, much less taken a life.\n\nDetermined to prove his worth through victories in battle, Jarvan IV led his troops against bands of Winter's Claw reavers, warring tribes, and even a coven of rogue mages.\"\n\nWhich indicates serving in an army is an honor for demacian and leading troops is even greater one. Also Winterclaw kind of part of  Freljord so it also means demacians more than happy to invade something themselves. Especially if they can massacre some filthy mages. \n\nSeem pretty war loving.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-06-05T00:34:27.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Sion lore\n\nHaving the greater numbers for ONE battle doesn't prove you have a big army overall...\n\n> \"Demacia's army is often outnumbered, but is arguable the most elite, well-trained army in Runeterra. \"\n\n... however, being *regularly* outnumbered tends to indicate that you have less overall troops than the other side, or sides.\n\n> Demacia lore\n\nHaving a good army and being forced to use it to defend yourself has nothing to do with actually loving to wage war.\n\n> \"Demacia is a strong, lawful society with a prestigious military history.\"\n\n> Thats clearly marks them as complete militarists.\n\nHow so? Prestigious history of war is something that any European nation could boast about, that doesn't make them war-mongers in present times. On the other hand, the US basically never had a domestic war, and only fought foreign wars when called in by an ally/vassal state but still strike me as one of the most \"war-loving\" country today.\n\n> J4 lore\n\nSo, he basically never fought in an international war, and had to resort to internal law enforcement to prove his valor. How exactly does that prove that Demacia love war?\nAnd no, the Winter Claw's **reavers** were invading Demacia, not the other way around. It's in your quote.\nAnd yes, of course, when most battles are defensive ones against invaders or bandits, of course the people honor the troops who protect them, and their leaders even more so.\n____\n\nNot a single one of your arguments hold under close scrutiny. I certainly wouldn't want to live in Demacia myself, they are far too conservative for my taste, but you're far less likely to have to fight in war as a Demacian citizen compared to someone from Noxus. The latest story with the emissaries from the Iron-what's-its-name mountain clearly marks them as a unique exception because they never had to provide soldiers to the empire. Meaning EVERY other region is regularly having conscription.\n\nBlame Demacia for what they actually deserve to be blamed: they are a bunch of hypocrites, who cling to tradition for its own sake and forgot what's the true goal of a good society, and why those traditions were established in the first place.

It doesn't feel like we understand how the whole city runs, or even if there is anything keeping it running or if they're all just lucky as hell that it hasn't fallen apart under their feet.\n\nWhat I think would be most likely is that it was built by somebody else, and pirates simply invaded and took over. Pirates (at least in the way we know of them) were not individuals keen on doing the sort of work it would take to build a city. So either the city is ramshackle and hobbled together, or it was previously built and is becoming run-down over time as the pirates make no effort to perform upkeep on the city.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Red Wreckage","date":"2018-06-04T07:28:30.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Detroid","replies":[]}]}
