The targeting indicator is shaped like any normal skill shot indicator, yet its displayed effective radius doesn&#039;t match up with it. The displayed effective radius is a rectangle extending from Mega Gnar, not a normal skill shot. I&#039;ve tried to describe this before to people, but without pictures it was difficult. So I actually learned how to take screenshots in-game to show the difference; and it&#039;s a major one, I think.\n\nGranted my aim is a bit off so they might be misaligned, but look at these pictures and just try to tell me that Wallop&#039;s targeting indicator matches up with its effective radius. The indicator can fit in the actual radius.\n\nCould Wallop get a new targeting indicator? I know there are rectangular indicators in the game (Lucian&#039;s Q is what I have in mind), so can Mega Gnar get the same thing? It doesn&#039;t feel right when you narrowly miss an enemy or stun them when you outright shouldn&#039;t.\n\nEdit: Overlapping Image supplied by Alopex\nhttp://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1439304757/GnarComparison.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2015-08-11T17:52:44.489+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler pointed me over here.

This is good because when you take cast and travel time into account you were never going to hit that guy anyway.\n\nI think the difference here is that Wallop is an instant AoE effect (so there isn't travel time, just a cast time) and Jinx's W is a projectile with both a cast time and travel time, while being at a significantly longer range that makes projectile speed a lot more relevant to how it feels to use. Mega Gnar's W and Lux's ult are both the same kind of ability in terms of cast delay-instant AoE damage, and while the reduced range indicator size makes it feel better with the cast time included, it is just a bit too small relative to the size of the AoE. Sion's Q is also similar, and has a similarly undersized cast indicator, but it is much closer in size to the actual ability effect, so having it be a touch small is ok, just not this much smaller.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-08-11T18:01:47.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=gypsylord,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ooMx28z6,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-08-11T17:52:44.489+0000)\n\n> As a side note, many of our arrow/rectangle cast indicators (the ones only the caster can see) are slightly shorter and skinnier than the actual effects they represent.

It's just that Mega Gnar's W feels _very off_ in comparison to Jinx's ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-09-03T14:41:51.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, Gypsy.

If you don't (the wall is too thick), you get a fail-flash.\n\nBut yeah, most skillshot indicators suck.
