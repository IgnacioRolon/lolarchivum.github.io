In order to have reasonable interaction against Thunderlord's you need to be able to land 1-2 hits and then get away from a fight before the Thunderlord's user can even proc -- which you can't, because of how hard you have to chunk someone to activate Stormraider's at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2015-12-22T17:29:25.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right now it's a failure.\n\nHOWEVER, I do like the CONCEPT of key stone masteries.
