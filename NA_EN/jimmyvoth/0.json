Last night, I was playing like normal, and all of a sudden the game crashed and kicked me out. Now, every time I go to the log in screen, it says:\n\nConnection Error\n\nConnection Failure: Unable to connect to the PVP.net server\nInformation Regarding what may have caused this error can be found **here** (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944)\nService availability can be viewed on the League of Legends Server Status web page.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure what to do. I've tried restarting my computer, shutting it down completely and then restarting it, I've tried logging in LoL as administrator, still nothing. I went to the link provided in the error box, and it did not help at all. My location is in North America, and the page shows NA still working, so..? \nAlso, my internet browser is Chrome, I've never used Internet Explorer. A lot of the forums I've found have all been things to do on IE, but I don't use that, and haven't had any problems before last night. \nAny thoughts?\n\n\n\n***UPDATE***: The game is now working again in my region. Time was all it took. Thanks for being consistent, Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"SS1GravyBoat","date":"2016-08-08T01:02:05.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tried getting on and it worked!

Depending on your location, it could be a standalone internet provider or maybe even your cable tv company.  There might also be a slight chance that your ISP's logo is on your router!

Unplug it for 30 seconds then plug it back in (this will knock out internet for whomever is connected to this modem while it restarts - allow up to 5 minutes once plugged back in).","replies":[{"poster":"JimmyVoth","date":"2016-08-03T19:42:55.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not quite the computer/tech expert..
