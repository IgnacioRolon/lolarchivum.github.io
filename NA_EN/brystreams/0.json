This looks fine to me, I'm not sure what you're talking about. ;) \n\nHave you tried performing a client repair?  If not, I'd suggest trying that first. Here's how'd you go about it: \n\n* Open the League of Legends Launcher.\n* Click the Gear button to open the Settings menu.\n* Click the \"Repair\" button. The repair process will take about 30-60 minutes.\n\nRegarding video cards, the minimum requirements for League would be a shader version 2.0 capable video card, but we recommend a Nvidia GeForce 8800/AMD Radeon HD 5670 or equivalent video card (Dedicated GPU with 512MB or higher Video Memory(VRAM)). You can grab a full list of specs [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements#wq1).\n\n*Sorry, this is a tad of a copy pasta of a comment I'd made the other day, but they also had a similar glitch!*","replies":[{"poster":"Brystreams","date":"2017-06-29T06:05:26.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh thank you for replying!\nI have a Nvidia 1050Ti for a graphics card, and the small glitch I was talking about was the yellow flash (As seen in the picture, and briefly in the video.) Starting from the \"S\" in the center of the screen, proceeding in a cone shaped pattern to the upper right hand corner of the screen. Very brief, and nothing too troublesome, just making sure if it popped up more and more frequently, you will have seen it before and have an idea of what is going on. Thanks for your time! Stay awesome :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-29T18:27:25.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to help! \n\nI've also passed this along to our compat peeps, so they can keep an eye out for any additional reports. They'll also be able to check out various configs!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
