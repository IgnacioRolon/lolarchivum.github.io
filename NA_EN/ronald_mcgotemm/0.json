I realize that she is technically harder to play now, but that isnt the problem, she is not fun to play anymore. She just isnt as strong as she was before, even if you are good at new kat it is not as good. Katarina was a strong, classic champion that had been around since the beginning, and she was made to wait for the right time then go in and rip the enemy team apart, as long as you were smart about it. People complained about her being overpowered, but she never got played in high elo games because in reality, she is easy to counter. She has a completely different playstyle than she used to in my opinion, and it is boring. This isnt the first time Riot ruined a good champion, they did the same thing to shen. Riot needs to stop trying to make old, classic characters into the types of champions they have now, they arent the same. All they had to do was give katarina a visual, if that, but instead they turned her into something else and it makes me feel like i wasted all that time having fun playing old katarina because I cant anymore. I think that Riot should revert the katarina rework, it is boring, weaker, and much less satisfying.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-21T21:01:53.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"not as strong as before\"\n\nLol...","replies":[{"poster":"DotaSbetterDUH","date":"2016-12-22T00:37:51.244+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"U think new kat is actualyl viable past silver?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"7 N","date":"2016-12-22T01:09:54.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i honestly think my ass is open when kat is on the other side but I see more bad kats than good ones due to her being not good {{item:3146}} {{champion:55}}","replies":[]}]}
