Nid hits spear and full combos to deal half health.\r\nMore fair for the person playing against, but is still a bitch to deal with.\r\n\r\nWhat if all of the 1 skill shot wonders were simply reworked into a different style of champion.\r\nReworks fail all the time and honestly a lot of people would probs be mad as hell.\r\n\r\neasy solution would be to nerf all 1 skill shot wonders, specifically targeting early game.\r\nthat way die hards can work to figure out how to make it work while most of the community can just never deal with those champions.\r\n\r\nand here is what I consider the best solution.\r\nmake it so that the skillshot is the beginning of the combo, but the combo can be broken after it hits with a forgiving cc timing.\r\n\r\nImagine if lee had a 1.5 second channel cancelable ult, then he would need to be careful about using his ult, and it would have healthy counterplay options. therefore not making him a 1 skillshot wonder","replies":[]}
