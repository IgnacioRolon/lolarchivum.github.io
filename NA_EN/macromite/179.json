Namely, what is GOOD on a tank is GREAT on a bruiser, because a BRUISER has higher base stats than a tank and has HIGH BASE and HIGH scaling ratios. \nRiot needs to make tank items actually FOR tanks, and get rid of the bruiser class entirely. The myriad of champion types in this game just bloat everything and makes balancing items a nightmare.\n\nThe only reason you ever choose a tank over a bruiser is because they often have a higher leaning towards resistances and have much better team fights than bruisers. \ntanks are also often MUCH less mobile, requiring them to risk MUCH more just to be able to do their job. Generally, bruisers have a get-in-get-out like assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-05-10T04:24:58.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you don't understand the class you are arguing against. great.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
