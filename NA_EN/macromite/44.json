I mean Aatrox Fought for demacia long ago, and was likely called a hero, and there were  other things depicting him from demacia to show him as such.*\r\nSo It would not be too far a stretch for Demacia to memorialize him like they did. perhaps he turned into a legend long after he left and demacia forgot what exactly he looked like, and turned him into what galio is now instead.\r\n\r\nMaybe galio is secretly a darkin. &lt;- Super unlikely\r\n\r\n*Old lore, but it still essentially fits.","replies":[{"poster":"mr Boombastic787","date":"2017-03-07T10:05:08.007+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"WOW! This is a good theory!!\n\nIt would be really cool if he was made to protect Demacia and resemble a hero from an old legend, Aatrox. Maybe Galio was a statue of Aatrox (how demacians view him) from a long time ago to honor him. Then someone gave the statue life and he bacame a golem that protects Demacia.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2017-03-07T18:25:30.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought the same thing! Justicar Aatrox is how they portrayed him in pictures, and while not entirely accurate to his looks it's possible Galio is merely inspired by the legend of Aatrox and isn't meant to be his direct image.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-07T17:35:14.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"God damn that's a good theory.

It perhaps speaks to what Aatrox got involved with in Demacia if iconography of him is used in a more widespread manner than in other nations.","replies":[]}]}
