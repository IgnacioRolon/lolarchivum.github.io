If your jungler Is playing a farm intensive jungler and they are chain ganking.\r\nIf you see warwick attempting more than one pre 6 gank, then warwick is not playing correctly, and is getting himself drastically behind.\r\n\r\n3. If your jungler is playing a gank jungler and they are exerting no pressure across the map while the game is even.\r\nSpecifically if a jungler is too weak to gank, then farming is still fine, but so long as the game is nearly even a ganker like lee or elise should be exerting some pressure. \r\nI should also note that this is ACROSS MAP, just because someone isn&#039;t getting ganked that doesn&#039;t mean that there is no pressure.\r\n\r\nAnd to my knowledge there are never any other times to get mad at your jungler.

As a Jungle main I completely understand that if a gank fails you shouldn't tax, but then if the gank fails then it becomes a situation where laners will want us to gank again but we need to make up (in gold and time) for the gank we just failed by farming a bit. \n\n\nNext, If I get a kill and you get an assist but your laner gets a kill its super worth. your argument about you being at a disadvantage for that death in lane maybe true, but for 1, you get a certain amoutn of gold so it isn't just 300+ gold ahead, its as low as 150 or maybe 200 ish gold ahead os its not too bad. For two, Junglers can use that gold to snowball the game more because we influence the entire map. So with that 300 gold, we could gank mid again even stronger, we could go top and help top, or we can go bot, or kill the enemy jungler or take an objective whereas if you got the kill and I died, then every lane for an X amount of time loses map pressure and unless if you plan on roaming a lot, that gold only influences 1 lane. \n\nside note: either way I still find that worth if I die and the laner gets the kill or vice versa, don't get that twisted.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonDoetMaar","date":"2017-07-07T14:14:51.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it happened to me just now i litterally said in chat pls dont come top i can handle alone (cuz i know hes stupid) what does he do tower dive a gnar that was 80% hp and almost getting mega wow nice play","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThugWalrus","date":"2016-09-19T15:51:57.163+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"4) When a jungler mismanages your wave to an extent that it puts you at a disadvantage in the laning phase.

I think one of the problems for me is that since I main jungle, I don't understand why the whole blaming thing starts in the first place.\n1. It is not our job to win your lane for you. Our job focuses on controlling objectives and Ganking lanes to get them ahead to get those objectives is part of that. Is ganking part of the job description? yes. is it our primary sole mission? no. \n\n2. I don't understand (especially if they don't communicate) why they mess up so badly in the first place (besides bot lane). I don't even lane ( I hate laning tbh) but when I lane I Play under the assumption that I'll get no help at all. if I need help Ill tell my jungler but i wont force him to help me period. And most of the time I do decent in my lane. I rarely go 0 and 3 or 0 and 4 during laning phase which is why I don't understand why people who main laning need so much help. \n\n3. I think laners also  need to understand that where I spend my time is dependent on the champions and what dragon is up. So if I see that the first dragon is fire or mountain dragon, im sorry @ top lane but im going to focus bot or mid first if anything so we can get the dragon for free. if i spam ganking top then there's a good chance the enemy jungler will solo it or they will out number bot and mid and take it by force. I often focus mid or bot until that drag is taken unless if top lane is like free kills within the first few mins (from min 2 - 6)\n\n4. And the thing that tilts me the most, when Im playing a champ like Udyr and the opponent is playing Zac and my team blames me for not ganking as much as him.

I cant tell if hes farm intensive or early game gank potential. my instinct says hes a bit of both but even after playing him so much, what are my specific power spikes i should gank off of? and when?","replies":[{"poster":"Dryditch","date":"2016-09-19T17:54:05.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an old guide, but I think it should still be viable. \nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/s6-rengar-jungle-preseason-6-quick-pre-game-guide-ftw-443371","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-09-19T16:05:24.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately I'm not a rengar player by trade so i don't know his specific power spikes, But a good rule of thumb is to gank whenever or wherever there is a strict advantage, and to use your judgement. I know he gets a big one at 6, and i think before that he relies on his allies a little.
