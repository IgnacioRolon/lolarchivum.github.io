Every Vlad I've ever seen hits like a truck and can outheal nearly all damage done to him... to include the jungle ganking said lane and assisting. Old Vladimir wasn't a big deal, but the new one has some extreme healing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tukan Tonko","date":"2016-12-18T04:02:29.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yAFIssV9,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-18T03:54:35.015+0000)\n>\n> Many sustain based items have a lot of power in non-sustain facets, but most of the sustain based champions are consistantly trash through the seasons.\n\nWhat about Swain? He is not popular but he can heal a ton. And he is also strong. \nMundo, maybe? He was good jungler and I think he still is. \n\nCould you explain it a bit better? I think I don't get the point.
