I am not fine with losing to a yasuo that is my equal 80% of the time becuase I am playing a champion that relies heavily on a high cooldown fair* ultimate in teamfights. more so because there are a lot more of those than there are of malphite esc toplaners.\n\n*Fair meaning it is a skillshot and can be reacted to.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2017-04-09T15:45:21.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why there is a thing called baiting out his windwall.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-10T03:51:08.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not every champion can do this reasonably.","replies":[{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2017-04-10T14:56:29.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"List one champion that can't in the mid lane.
