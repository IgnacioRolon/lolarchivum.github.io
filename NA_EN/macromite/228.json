That already ruins a large portion of the point of the ultimate itself given you don't want them to just walk out, you wanted to CC them in _that spot._\n\nNow if Lee Sin's kick is based entirely around kicking them in a specific direction rather than just locking them down in a spot, and you could literally just walk out with a single right mouse button click to change where you were kicked, do you seriously not see the problem with that? The snare is only there because he has such a long animation time as compared to most other single-target targeted CC abilities and his ultimate is specifically meant so that they can't just walk out before it finishes (unlike things like Maokai's W for instance which is slower specifically so it can follow dashes/etc). If you don't want the snare, the ultimate animation windup time has to be removed, thus making it an instantaneous kick instead of a long delayed animation into the kick back.
