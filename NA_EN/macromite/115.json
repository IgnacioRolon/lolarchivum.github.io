The issue lies with wear you guys decided to put your particles on this skin.\r\n\r\nWith every other skin, (except comrade bear) you have the bulk of the particles placed on the front of the skin \r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/314195ff74814521c2b22cf02f302357.png https://i.gyazo.com/4ee236c12a32bc35f51def5b03472b5d.png https://i.gyazo.com/87a026eddf0ce1a8e7a13a731876147e.png https://i.gyazo.com/8ac7b8acb44a5c7b633de7d3e8592e0d.png\r\n\r\nBut with Sej&#039;n&#039;lion this was not made.\r\n\r\nSo now I&#039;m going to as kthe obvious question. Why did you not put the blue on the mane? It would look cooler, and it would also be more readable due to being more like the other skins in her lineup.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2017-04-19T20:13:10.218+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see where the blue on the front would be easier to see the passive but in my opinion it would look awful. Many people like myself that have bought that skin don't want to see a blue headed lion for 95 percent of the game because it would just be uglier than the live skin. I think the beast hunter one looks worse with the particles as well.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-19T20:29:53.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As it is it looks disgusting. PErsonally would prefer if it was golden on the mane, but that's asking a lot for a 750.\n\nat any rate blue on the mane would look better than blue on saddle shields and anklets.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2017-04-19T21:10:02.688+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree with blue on the mane being an improvement but I do agree something should be done. It's going to make it look like a muppet if the outline it's giant head in blue. It should really be a different color altogether for that particular skin as well as the beast hunter. Bear cavalry doesn't have a giant blue bear head for good reason.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Misticaltom","date":"2017-04-19T21:25:24.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm tired of seein' the Blue Boar's already, THERE IS TOO MUCH BLUE ON THOSE BOARS NOW.
