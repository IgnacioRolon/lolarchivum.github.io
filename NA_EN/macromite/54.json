I&#039;m sure that if he could use titanic you would see juggernaught ezreals out there.\r\n\r\nIts because of him that certain items are never allowed to be good, so instead of nerfing every item or nerfing him into oblivion, just change the way he works so he doesn&#039;t break everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Karma Deified","date":"2016-02-15T03:14:14.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/5BLGUpsU-regarding-blue-ez","replies":[]},{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2016-02-15T02:50:52.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still not sure why his Q applies on-hits.  A lot of what he breaks is because of how it interacts with his Q.  Remove that, then buff the damage.  AP Ezreal players don't care, and AD could still poke from range, just without consistent slowing fields.  It'd also prepare for another sheen item, so we don't get runeglaive Ezreal again.","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2016-02-15T02:58:28.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does that because it's his entire gimmick, where he can instantly pull out another autoattack if he can land it manually.","replies":[]}]}]}
