I have died too many times casting e and then immediately auto attacking only for the stun to not go off. an easy way to fix it would just be to apply the stun to his auto attacks for .25 or .5 seconds right after he casts.\r\n\r\nR- so many many things.\r\nMake it capable of dragging crystals around, honestly that capability probably doesn&#039;t even need a long cooldown, it should just be a thing happens, the crystals lose value as the game goes on, and they don&#039;t have a lot to begin with.\r\nMake it NEVER cancel. Lee and skarner both got that .25 second snare for their ults to help people get hit, but even with it people are still capable of jumping away. lee&#039;s ult always hits regardless though, but skarner&#039;s breaks. skarner has a harder than hell time getting to and locking down a target, so make his lockdown at least work when he manages to get into range.\r\n\r\nand finally. Class skarner as a blasted unique playstyle. he plays nothing like anything else, not even remotely like anything else, and honestly he shouldn&#039;t be playing like anything else. he is a duelist/support style jungler that is too mobile to be jugger, is too aggressive to be a warden, and has too weak of an engage to be a vanguard.","replies":[{"poster":"A FLUFFY BUNNY 1","date":"2017-02-07T00:00:52.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner is good as he is except he's jg dependent and depended on haveing his plates owned having said that.
