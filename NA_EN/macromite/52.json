It would need to be similar in nature to the tier list that is used in pokemon with the ou and such, but it would likely be the most fair way to provide the games that everyone is looking for, as well as letting different meta&#039;s flourish at different tiers of play.","replies":[{"poster":"SonaTitsAndAss","date":"2016-05-12T14:32:13.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Decided by the community... lets quickly run down something that just happened.\n\nhigh elo/pros/people that are outnumbered: yi is shit and only good for stomping low elo\nLow elo/most of the community: OMFG YI IS SO OP RIOT PLEASE NERF!\n\n*riot removes sated*\nout numbered people: every on hit jungler expect kindread is shit now\nCommunity: you just need to learn how to play them properly.\nor they will say\ncommunity: Stop defending your freelo champ you noob\n\nalso it be a horrible experiance for a game that is meant to be competetive...","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-05-12T14:34:49.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true true, but the high elo people aren't always right either. could have higher elo guys have extra votes to try and equal it out a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"SonaTitsAndAss","date":"2016-05-12T14:37:51.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok. you might as 2 people out of 100 going \"actually ap zed is really good\" but the other 98 are going \"that is stupid\" and if you made their votes worth more heres what you get. half the votes going to stupid shit like tryndamere. and half the votes going to problem champs like kindread it just doesnt help at all.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-05-12T14:47:46.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the system could be based on usage as well, and higher elo players might instead be given the ability to petition for champions to get shifted from tier to tier. more similar to the pokemon system that properly gives super high elo players, from high diamond up,  the ability to shift the things better. this satisfies your current argument quite well, I think.","replies":[{"poster":"SonaTitsAndAss","date":"2016-05-12T14:53:56.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its just a terrible fucking idea bro leave it alone and let this bad idea die. for everyones sack and so you dont cringe about it later in life","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-05-12T14:58:06.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's a bad idea, I've put more thought into it than it seems. you just don't like it for some reason, and that reason is one that you have thus far been incapable of communicating.","replies":[{"poster":"SonaTitsAndAss","date":"2016-05-12T15:36:08.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont like it... for the reason its stupid...  its like buffing tank ekko because he doesnt have a kayle ulting him every game... its just a stupid effect for a stupid reason.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-05-12T15:50:32.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not exactly the same, you should try a bit harder finding your reason, at this point there is probably a good one, but you just haven't spat it out yet, can't form it into words yet. keep trying.","replies":[{"poster":"SonaTitsAndAss","date":"2016-05-12T16:06:24.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok. your idea fails on very basic terms. im done discussing if you cant see the plotholes your blind to your own errors.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-05-12T16:16:35.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 things.\n1. i've asked you to point them out. i wrote it, I can't see it, if you could point them out it would be appreciated, yet you haven't\n2. plothole? plot? wow, apparently my paragraph was better than i thought, it has a whole plot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2016-05-12T14:41:21.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stagnating?","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-05-12T14:51:28.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even with the mid year update the game is getting rather samey. it's been going this way for a while.\n\nalso, if you were asking for a definition stagnating means that it is getting old. playing against similar enemies game after game isn't super fun, you gotta be able to shake it up with other things sometimes, which is a thing that league as a whole does horribly.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2016-05-12T16:02:58.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can google the definition of stagnating (tho I do not have to).
