They most likely will bundle her long lore with that of other Void denizens, similar to how they did with the Targon lores.\n\nThis way they can explore the relationships Rek'Sai has with their fellow Voidborn, and expand on the lore of that faction, rather than limiting themselves to what they can tell about her and Shurima.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-05-06T01:32:52.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should easy to stop her in a desert, field that Azir becomes the most powerful.
