Remember hide and seek. So I looked up information regarding it to find out which board it was usually posted on, (Player recruitment is unequivocally the wrong board, i&#039;m not recruiting players for anything, I&#039;m making an open custom game.) and I found a few things.\nFirst things first usually rules postings were actually on meme&#039;s and games. \nhttps://i.gyazo.com/85eb719091df5eb36e981eae57bb1494.png\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/f657299e90ca652449595d3ddfba9481.png\n\nBut it was not uncommon to find rules kind of anywhere.\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/9564d5380a2af58df79b5f57b0714143.png\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/234f7a759d30d7fe28d5961656bc9c61.png\n\nAnd then I found it. before this problem there was a sub board for these things https://i.gyazo.com/63d332f108eb0ade9c7203d074b27caa.png\n\nBut it was very clearly deleted at some point, and It is no longer a place you can post modern custom game modes.\n\nSo this is something that should be fixed. I don&#039;t think a minor board like maps and modes should make a comeback. with its over specialized usage, but the custom game modes needs an apt place to be. Player recruitment is not a place for custom game modes for obvious reasons, you don&#039;t go to player recruitment to find a custom mode to paly, you go there to find a group to affiliate with, whether a ranked team, a discord, or otherwise. It should also not be tied to misc or gd, as those are both places where any non-league content can essentially fit, and this is content that pertains specifically to league of legends.\nso in lies the main places that it may belong. Either within the gameplay board, fitting strangely but technically not being too disputable, or within the meme&#039;s and games board, Fitting as a game unrelated to the forum.\n\nSo with this information available. Several things should be considered.\nA: The specific location for this corner case\nB: A layout of rules or guidlines conscerning the placement of edge cases such as this one, that have as much of a place on one board as another.\nC:The powers of the wardens, and how much influence they should actually have within their own sub-board. one creating and enforcing the rules rigidly is probably not a good thing, fringe cases and edge cases end up with nowhere to sit.\nD: The specificity of individual boards. We don&#039;t have a lot of different boards here, and there are advantages and disadvantages to that, and one of the disadvantages is that each individual location for posting should be expected to be fairly broad in scope, and overlap is within reasonable bounds. Claiming a champion causes toxicity with evidence to support could belong on both gameplay and behavior for example.","replies":[{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-07-06T02:25:53.312+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya,\n\nI am actually a roaming warden and one of my jurisdictions is Player Recruitment. For custom matches, you can post those in player recruitment and we won't take those down (they belong there actually). Alternatively, you could come over to the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/qVlculPP-boards-moderation-discord) and talk to us there if you want more clarification. Just ping @roaming in the report room and all of us will come talk to you and perhaps we could find a solution for your issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-07-05T19:23:29.371+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A: The specific location for this corner case\n\nIf you're looking for players to join you in a custom match, [Player Recruitment](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) is definitely the right place. If you are looking to create your own type of mode and flesh out the details or just share it with others, you'd head over to [Concepts & Creations](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts). The old Maps & Modes board basically had posts that fell under C&C or Gameplay, so isn't necessary (sub-boards that have too specific content so receive very little activity aren't good to keep).\n\n> B: A layout of rules or guidlines conscerning the placement of edge cases\n\nThe fact that it's an edge case makes creating specific rules for it a waste of time, as it clutters the other rules and will inevitably rarely be read and abided by when those edge cases occur. The Wardens will make judgement calls sometimes; while I do typically trust the call they will make, if you have an issue with it please visit us on our [Moderation Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).\n\n> C:The powers of the wardens, and how much influence they should actually have within their own sub-board. one creating and enforcing the rules rigidly is probably not a good thing\n\nThe Wardens for each board are not there only to moderate, but to foster a good community there, and shaping the guidelines for their board is part of that. When LF wrote up his rules, he didn't do so with a blank slate and with no feedback; he actually merely worked upon the guidelines that were already posted before and took feedback from the rest of the Moderators and Keyru (the Rioter in charge of us and the boards). This board and our Discord are great places to leave feedback on these guidelines!\n\n> D: The specificity of individual boards. We don't have a lot of different boards here, and there are advantages and disadvantages to that, and one of the disadvantages is that each individual location for posting should be expected to be fairly broad in scope, and overlap is within reasonable bounds. Claiming a champion causes toxicity with evidence to support could belong on both gameplay and behavior for example.\n\nThere's a little bit of overlap sometimes, and our Archivists (a type of Warden/mod) are working to improve the culture and guidelines for C&C, so they may actually be able to help clarify where threads like this belong in the near future.\n\nAs for the \"champion X causes toxicity\" thing, depending on the content it might be clear it belongs in one, or it could be eligible for either; we'll have to make that call when we see it, but if it's ok in either then we won't remove it for being in either. There is nothing wrong with a post belonging on multiple boards.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-07-05T20:21:24.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As to your answer on A:\nThis is lacking.\n\nVery few people will join the game. and if any traction is gained the board within which posted will be questioned as to whether the post belongs legitimately.\nAlso, I have never seen any custom game posts in concepts, and I have seen fewer within player recruitment than memes and games.\n\nI have no issue with any of you other responses and I thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-07-05T20:35:27.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I have never seen any custom game posts in concepts\n\nThat's exactly why we don't need a new board for it.

In your specific post you were looking for players to join you in a custom game, so Player Recruitment would be the correct place to post it. Concepts and Creations would be used if you were suggesting that Riot make it into a featured game mode. There may not be many of those types of posts on C&C, but that is due to the niche nature of the post. It belongs on C&C and such posts are made sometimes, they are just rare. \n\nAs for how much power I have, those rules were actually just an updated version of the pre-existing rules. While I wrote them and I posted them, I did so with plenty of feedback from my fellow wardens, and the rules were approved before I posted them. \n\nIf you ever have any questions or concerns about a moderation decision, please feel free to contact us on our [Official Discord Server](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/qVlculPP-boards-moderation-discord).","replies":[]}]}
