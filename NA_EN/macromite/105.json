You have to be able to INSTANTLY peel them with perfect reflex or they will 1 shot you... So no this item isn't balanced in the sense that the uptime makes it very hard to find windows. IT needs a higher cooldown and then im totally fine with it as a mechanic in the game... but it shouldnt be up constantly. So sorry to burst your little bubble. The item is going to get nerfed seeing as the majority of player base agree its busted. I have a thread on it and I have 55 upvotes in counting... you have none. The only people that support Edge of Night are people that main champions that abuse it.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-02-12T20:29:53.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play tanks and I have no trouble with it. the thing that needs nerfed is damage, not edge specifically, and htey are nerfing that. \n\nand when has riot ever done anything because of the community.","replies":[]}]}]}
