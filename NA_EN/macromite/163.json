Like the previous but with more syllables so its better.\n\n8: {{champion:240}} This is lower on the list because to get the most out of it you need to also be cursing.\n\n7: {{champion:36}} Of course if you yell mundo it works better, but when you stick your tongue out to yell you end up with just gibberish so its all good.\n\n6: {{champion:19}} It&#039;s less of a yell and more of howling and sniffing, but It can&#039;t be discounted, you are still loudly creating noise for your team mates to endure.\n\n5: {{champion:150}} In enraged form you need to be constantly yelling or it will end prematurely. minus points for the small form though. \n\n4: {{champion:58}} If you just let in to your primal desire to start roaring like a giant monster you will sart playing like a giant monster \n\n3: {{champion:23}} Your ultimate lasts for 7 seconds or until you run out of breath.\n\n2: {{champion:2}} If you start shouting when you ult it makes you run faster and hit harder.\n\n1: {{champion:106}} If you are trying to play as a bear without constantly roaring then you are playing the bear incorrectly.\n\nHonorable mentions\n{{champion:14}} This is not a shout you can use for the length of a match, but it is there and it requires some real gutteral control.\n{{champion:31}}  The is is a champion where you might start roaring like godzilla, but only near top stacks and only for the very short periods of time where you can actually get in the middle of things. it increases resistances by 10%","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-04-27T17:29:07.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with your Mundo.
