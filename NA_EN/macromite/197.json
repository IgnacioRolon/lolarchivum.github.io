Another thing to note is that to use it to good effect, you need to be far away from the fight, meaning that your ult will more or less be something that hits after the fights started, which is not a good place to be as a character.\r\nAnother issue would be his q, it suffers from the same very hard to use, and lackluster gains that his ult does, and it requires the player to both be in a place that he can reliably hit opponents with the cc portion, as well as being able to not get cced by anything in the process, Because of this simple problem that Sion faces, I think that there must be a problem with this. An issue that I see often enough is that a Sion will charge into a team, and attempt to charge his q, only to be stopped and be forced to begin the channel again, which in turn means that Sion did not have real importance to that fight, except for taking maybe one hard cc. \r\n\r\nA way that I think could fix this problem of Sion not actually being a major issue for teams to deal around is for Sion to be given a cc proof when he is channeling his q. I know that this sounds like it would be very strong, but in reality it would not be that big of a buff, it would just mean that Sion would have a better opportunity to actually affect a fight more than just taking one cc spell, and actually being able to threaten a piece of ground.\r\nSome people would probably want to know where the counter play against this is, and the answer to that is simple, The counter play against Sions q actually comes with the ability itself, it has a fairly long channel, and its thin enough to where if you walk to the side you should make it out before he gets access to his stun/knock-up. If this did show to be too strong, because people would be able to just spam it for a second a cc proof if the needed it perhaps, damage could be moved from his e into his q. The damage could also be shifted from the beginning of the spell to the end, to reward players for hitting this very easy to miss ability.\r\n\r\nI believe that this change will both increase the skill ceiling that Sion has, as well as decreasing the skill floor, and overall it would increase the viability of Sion, as well as the pool of viable champions as a whole.\r\nThank you for reading my post.","replies":[{"poster":"Saruyan","date":"2015-01-15T06:22:22.608+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"if a team is wasting cc to stop a sion q, then sion is alredy doing his job, and hes gaining a reduced cd from it.\n\nit is also really good once you stop trying to hit it for max damage, and is easily one of the best level 1 teamfight skills in the game,\n\nhis ult is meant to get him in and does amazing stuff even at straight up instant cast melee range in the middle of a fight, try getting righteous glory for a more reliable initiation.\n\nthe only things sion needs right now is for his e to not occasionally bug out when using it to kill waves(randomly missing) and maybe his passive speed boost thing to d something about CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-03-28T21:29:06.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion is the 14th top laner out of 56 and sitting at a 51.7% winrate and a 3.16% play rate.
