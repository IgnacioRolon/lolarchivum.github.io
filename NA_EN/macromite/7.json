There should be a mastery system implemented that&#039;s called something like lane mastery. it will be like champion mastery but it will be based on champion mastery points given while playing on the lane. to play ranked you should have a certain amount of mastery points in at least three positions. this change if made will have to be given a certain amount of time before fully implemented as to not impede the climbing of players.\r\nThis means the feature for position mastery gets added, then a few months go by before the change to ranked is implemented.\r\n\r\n3. People need to not play new champions in ranked. Champion mastery two before you can go ranked wit them. that&#039;s at most six games per champion. six games is enough to understand a champion. That&#039;s 96 losses at most, and at least 32 wins. I can also pretty much say that most people that are reading this probably already have this.\r\n\r\n4. A way to make afk&#039;s less prevalent. Point 1 should help with this, and the remainder should be able to be dealt with with the leaver buster system.\r\n\r\n5. Toxicity. A recreation of the tribunal will help with this. just make it so that whenever a player receives 8 or more reports spanning three games, they get sent to tribunal with the worst offenders showing, and then the people take a vote. it should also show the timeframe between toxic games, as well as having a raising punishment scale determined by how many times you get sent there. \r\n1: Warning. 2: Low priority Queue. 3. temp ban. 4. Perma Ban and Ip ban.","replies":[]}
