Now you know your role, now its on to the rules.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------**CORE RULES**--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThese are the rules that both sides should really know.\n\n* Hiders Have 5 lives.\n* When a hider runs out of lives they are no longer allowed to affect the game, and must avoid doing so for the rest of the game.\n* When all hiders run out of lives, seekers win.\n* When the game makes it to the 45 minute mark, if there are surviving hiders, the hiders win.\n\n* Characters banned for everyone. {{champion:133}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:107}} \n\nQuinn is new to the permaban position, but she is just as bad as shaco or eve due to her movement speed and vision.\n\n**PUNISHMENTS**\n\nIf any of these rules are broken the game is to end immediately\n\nIf the banned champions are picked, the game should be dodged.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------**SEEKER RULES**--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game is much harder for a seeker than it is for a hider, so seeker rules should be considered much more lenient than hider rules, but this doesn&#039;t means to ignore them, as they are still very important. here they are\n\n* Seekers may not leave base until The two minute mark\n* Seekers may not stop backing after they have started, unless a hider hits them out of their recall\n* Seekers can not purchase an active or passive slow before the 10 minute mark.\n* The seeker team can not have more than one active or passive slow item until the 25 minute mark, \nand they can not have more than two total\n* Seekers can not purchase any items that gives the Twin shadows active until 30 minutes.\nany item with this passive is considered an active or passive slowing items\n* Hiders have a 30 second grace after they respawn\n\n**PUNISHMENTS**\n\nIf there are repeated breaks of these rules, the seekers lose 5 minutes of time.\n\nSeeker Tips\n Being a seeker can be hard, and here are some tips for newer seekers, or anyone that doesn&#039;t already practice these things.\n\nyou need to check everywhere, and keep you&#039;re eyes on the minimap for when hiders accidenty show up in vision.\n\nWork together, its much easier to kill a hider if there are two people hitting them.\n\nUse fog of war, if the hiders know where you are it becomes very easy to run from you.\n\nuse the speed relics, it is a good idea to gain speed.\n\nspread until you find a hider, if you are together the whole time you may as well be a single seeker.\n\nuse the stormshield. hiders may reveal themselves to stop you form getting it, and it will make it easier to get hiders.\n\nHere are some champions that I have seen make for good seekers. {{champion:33}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:84}} \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------**HIDER RULES**--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeing a hider is universally considered the more &quot;fun&quot; role, but don&#039;t let that make you think you can just bully the seekers, follow your rules carefully and correctly and you will still have a fun hide and seek game. here are the rules\n\n* Hiders can not attack backing seekers.\n* Hiders can not back. \n* Hiders can not purchase active or passive slowing items.\n* Hiders can not auto attack UNLESS their champion is udyr.\n* Hiders can not use abilities that do not have cc, mobility, or vision.\n* Game Creator can ban the use of any of those abilities.\n* Hiders are never allowed to use ability combinations if any of them do not normally have cc, even if any of them would gain cc if they combo their abilities. a few specific cases that are not allowed are {{champion:63}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:85}} \n* if a hiders ability only has cc in certain situations, the hider can us that cc only if the ability requires no other uses of it or any other abilities to activate the cc.\n* Hiders can not ghost, or tell seekers where other hiders are.\n* Hiders should avoid helping other hiders.\n* Hiders should Spread away from each other.\n* Hiders should try to not be lethal.\n* The preceding three rules are to be treated with average leniency\n\n**PUNISHMENTS**\nIf a hider breaks any of these rules repeatedly they are to lose a life.\n\nIf a hider has passive slowing item, in addition to losing a life the seekers gain 5 minutes to seek that game.\n\nA hider loses an additional life every time an active slowing item is used.\n\nHider Tips\nTry to not be predictable.\n\nbushes aren&#039;t always the best spots\n\n\n\nHere are the general bans and invis bans.\n\nPermas. {{champion:35}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:107}} \nThese are all banned unless the game creator specifies that Permas are allowed.\n\n\ninvis {{champion:35}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:62}}  {{champion:121}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:84}}  \nThese are banned if the creator states they do not want invis\n\nand any abilities that give any certain style can be banned by game creator.\n\n\n\nAfter reading the rules I hope that I see you on the scar.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"CrosisThePurger","date":"2016-01-24T05:44:14.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question on the ability's of hiders is anivia's W allowed because this may influence a few things for me.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-01-24T06:47:38.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the wall is a non-damage ability so generally its a-ok, it can also count as cc since it does technically displace on cast. safe bets.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Corrupto123","date":"2016-01-24T05:41:28.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember playing this with my friends when I was playing Lb, I just stood there when my clone came and they chased the clone, and I ran away :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-01-24T03:20:25.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should be a featured game mode","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-01-24T04:19:33.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of wish it was a normal game mode.
