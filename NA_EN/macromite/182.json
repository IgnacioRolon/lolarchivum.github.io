Call your roles, but they want to play that role, proceed to feed or afk, or does poorly in general. Talks in both chats about how either their team is bad, or the enemy team is a noob team. its idiotic but its much more common during the summer because that is when all the kids are out of school. it doesnt matter to them because they either dont play as often so reports more often than not will go unnoticed unless they continue to play. They just dont care because theyll have other things to play or do during the summer. And yet theyll be in our games, normal and rank. pulling this off because they can and it will cost people their time and effort into the game (especially in rank)","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-06-06T22:09:46.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm surprised you don't see that players like this are out all the time, even in times when the Teenagers should be incapable of making the remarks, therefore meaning that the part of the community is not exclusive to just kids. in all honesty, I've found some members playing behind the excuse from an older demographic, but its almost impossible to tell in a game. the situation is mostly made up, and has causes from other areas if it exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2015-06-06T22:14:03.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=2JtkX9Kc,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-06-06T22:09:46.995+0000)\n>\n> I'm surprised you don't see that players like this are out all the time, even in times when the Teenagers should be incapable of making the remarks, therefore meaning that the part of the community is not exclusive to just kids. in all honesty, I've found some members playing behind the excuse from an older demographic, but its almost impossible to tell in a game. the situation is mostly made up, and has causes from other areas if it exists.\n\nOf course it happen all the time, its just much more common during this time of the year because kids are out of school. There are different time zone so obviously kids are playing before/after school, but like i said its much more common during the summer because almost every school is off during the summer. so who else could it be?","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-06-06T22:32:00.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The secret is, its always common, and it always has been common, but now that its summer, you are paying more attention to the issue because you think that it has something to do with the large influx of teens coming in. There are in fact more students playing now in the summer, but you also need to understand, the ratio of good players to toxic bastards has stayed the same or shifted only slightly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
