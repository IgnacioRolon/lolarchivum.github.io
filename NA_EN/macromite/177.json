Nidalee has burst, mobility, poke, sustain, and decent camp clear.  However she is not a tank killer, has mana issues when out of the jungle, isn't amazing vs objectives, has OK waveclear, but has to get into melee range to do it.  She also lacks consistent damage.  Almost all of Nidalees damage can be dodged, in fact she only has one targeted damaging ability in her kit of 7 abilities.  This means that while she can burst, she does not have reliable damage output, especially since she is dependent on landing spears for most of her damage.\n\nAs such she does (or rather did looking at her currently) a number of things well specifically in the sieging and clearing departments.  However she struggled in the tank killing department as well as drawn out fight and consistent damage.  Add on her meh objective control and she is clearly a jungle who is focused on sieging for short periods of time but depends on her team to provide the waveclear.  Her AS boost further supports this.\n\nSo Nidalee is clearly not a generalist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"foinhas","date":"2017-02-25T19:05:19.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot wants lee-sin to stay mobile.

Generalist champions are generally good, but nothing makes them overbearing... Irelia for example is a champion that you don't see much but is pretty good because she does a little bit of everything and can easily not lose lane. The thing about generalists is that they don't stand out... Nami and Sona don't stand out the way Soraka or Karma does.
