(like if you are at 1 health it can&#039;t go lower unless someone hits you for like 500) This will prevent weak players from falling to pieces or missing as much farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nOR \r\n\r\nRemove the 300 gold obtained on kill. players that die are already losing a lot of gold without the 300 gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael702","date":"2017-08-02T06:06:30.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't want to decrease snowballing.
