I know thats hard to swallow, but they just were not satisfied with it as was, and obviously took it in a slightly different direction. \n\nI too wanted the storm Dragon, I had come up with some kit ideas as well:\n\nPassive: Storm Dragon's Talons. Passively grants Ao Shin magic damage on auto attacks. Every 5th AA deals the magic damage to the primary target and 1/2/3 other targets (with ult ranks). Small base damage, scales with AP. Increase magic damage by 50% while at maximum charge.\n\nCharge: Ao Shin's resource is called Charge. Everytime his abilities hit a target, he generates charge. At 100% charge, he can activate his ultimate.\n\nQ: Lightning Breath- Basically, think Xerath laser, except it doesn't pass through people, but if it hits a target, it branches out to other targets like static shiv. How many targets beyond the first increases with rank.\n\nW: Storm Armor- The cloud around Ao Shin becomes dark and thunderous, striking out at nearby enemies with lightning bolts at a rate of 1 per second. While storm armor is active, he gains 5/10/15/20/25 bonus armor and magic resist.\n\nE: Ride the Winds- Ao Shin spins into a lightning Vortex and dashes a short distance. Minions and small monsters in his path take dmg and are pushed away. Champions and large monsters take damage and are flung into the air and slowed. Ao Shin also passively gains movement speed. \n\nR: Storm of Vengeance- Ao Shin summons a large storm that covers the map. Mini map vision is reduced and enemy champions are slowed a small amount for the duration. Allies recover 3/4/5% of their missing health per second for the duration of the storm (10 seconds).\n\nI came up with that on the fly. Fun kit with new and interesting mechanics in it. Ultimately though, its RIOT's champion, and they just got over excited and told us about it too soon. \n\nTLDR- Im sad its not Ao Shin the storm dragon, but Im still hyped for this champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Kazu","date":"2016-02-20T05:27:19.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the secret.
