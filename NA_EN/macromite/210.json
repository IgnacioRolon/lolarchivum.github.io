The problem is far less that what it provides in the opposing jungle isn't good enough, it's that it's the ONLY smite that screams to the world \"hey guess where I'm headed?\" Though it could probably use being better in general too. \n\nThough I don't think copy-pasting raptor on every smite is the way to go. Maybe if it puts you in true sight automatically, but doesn't let you wander around being a ward sweeper every 60 seconds when smite is up","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-09-17T03:56:59.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, no, its for a poacher, or someone not  in their own land. you need to look at things from all angles young one, and this is something that I've come to the conclusion over after thinking long and hard about it from the moment they said they were deleting it.\n\nI am gonna be honest about your second point, I've no idea what you are suggesting, just the wording of it, it sounds like it could be cool, pls reply to say what you mean with a good amount of detail. I'm not really partial about the whole thing, just needs to be something with counter warding.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2015-09-17T04:14:06.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The perk for your side should be reduced, (maybe the speed boost, since it helps you keep moving around), because yes, as a poaching item you should be invading most of the time. But as long as it gives nothing, purple smite will still be preferable to white, even with ward clear potential on it, at least in my opinion, since it already kind of gives away your whole strategy.\n\nAs for what I mean for the second thing. Raptor buff stays on you for 90 seconds, and only activates when you get spotted by a ward. What I suggested was that using white smite should immediately put you in true sight after the camp dies (maybe with more than 10 seconds of true sight) so that you can't just go to any of the regular ward spots after every smite, so you'd be sweeping wards in their jungle, not wiping them out at lane entrances or in your jungle every time you head there.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-09-17T04:44:35.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the usage on your side should be reduced for two very important reasons. \nreason 1, this items passive will only be useful in enemy territory because of how it works. enemies are unlikely to ward in your territory early. \nreason 2, a big reason poacher's knife is bad right now is the fact that it only works in enemy territory, and you need to get it early before you know what the gamestate will be later, so poachers can turn into just regular smite + a small amount of gold, whereas if it gave revealing buff everywhere it would still be potent later on even if your team was losing, perhaps even more potent.\n\nI have to ask if you mean it **gives you**  true sight or does it **put you in** true sight. if it puts you in true sight the item becomes far more useless, even if it made it so you could smite enemy champions for full damage, no one would ever build that, because if it does that it means that the enemy knows where you are. one more thing, I think that it should have a draw to gankers as well as counter junglers, more specifically champions like Jarvan or lee sin, because counter junglers that focus on stealing farm already have a really good option, whereas counter junglers that focus on kills don't have many good options.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2015-09-17T06:10:21.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gives you true sight, lol. Not you being revealed, my bad, poor wording. The point is simply that you aren't getting 1 for 1 a specific camps smite bonus on every smite in the other jungle, essentially removing your need to ever smite raptors. \n\nI'm not sure what you could give it that would specifically help countergankers that also invade. If you make it something that activates simply by them showing up and smiting a champ, it'll also probably help regular gankers. If you make it something that requires them to smite something in the other teams jungle, that kind of conflicts with a countergankers need to spring into action at the drop of a hat if they're nearby. Probably not impossible, but nothing comes to mind that I would put for them.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-09-17T15:27:52.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that the poachers knife needs to help counter gankers specifically, but rather helping the actual gankers to get in undetected, maybe instead of raptors buff make it so that after smiting they get eve passive against wards and traps, something to let them in unexpected and to make the crazy attack plays.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord o teh Memes","date":"2015-09-17T04:14:24.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ward the enemy jungle some time and see how potent it is.
