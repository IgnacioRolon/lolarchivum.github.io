This system is not perfect, but it will help to prevent game botting by making it not affected by level, which means that the bots won't go into the games. And it should not affect the general player base, because players asking for friend invites generally ask people that they already know, and don't tend to ask more than a couple of people a day, unless they have been just added to a team, where there friend requests are almost sure to be accepted anyway.\n\nEdit: Another issue that there is is that even if we had a way to report bots and get those accounts removed from the game even, all its takes is a few minutes for the person setting it up to make a new account with more bots, and this is not good, because it takes more and more username possibilities out of the mix.\n\nJust whatever happens, Do not set a level minimum for friend requests, because low level games will just become bot games, with bots on both sides.","replies":[{"poster":"Mythic Minstrel","date":"2015-04-03T18:07:55.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a way we can accept these friend request and automatically block/report them?
