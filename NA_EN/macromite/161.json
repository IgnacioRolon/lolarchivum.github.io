In Season 1 we had our MMR visible, it showed you what your Elo was, there wasn't some silly LP system that the playerbase still doesn't fully comprehend.  Your MMR wasn't a secret or something Riot kept hidden for an obscure reason and most players liked it that way.  \n\n- As the OP said, HARD RESET every season.   Everyone starts from 0, or average, or whatever... regardless of the nomenclature you use, it's important that everyone starts from the same position to keep the system fair.  \n\nThink of it like this:  The Kansas City Royals won the world Series last year so for the 2016 MLB season they start with 30 wins for no other reason than simply because they were world champions.  Every season should be new, after all the game is constantly evolving and good players will still rise to the top anyway, while those that cannot adapt will be held back, as it should be.  \n\n-","replies":[]},{"poster":"TNHA Baritone","date":"2016-07-03T08:24:56.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're supposed to prove yourself that you belong where you were last year. That is reason for the resets.\n\n\n> Average skill played players with no skill\n\nAlso, it's almost never X team has skill and Y team sucks. So looking at it like that just isn't fair.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-07-03T14:54:09.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was soft resets. not hard resets. hard resets are the ones that require proving yourself. soft resets don't require a lot of proving again, it's why a lot of players are able to stay at high rank for a long time. It means that if you can climb once, you can climb again, and the second climb will be much easier.\n\nIt's that the there is less skill difference between a team with 4 different levels of plat than there is with one level of bronze. literally, the play levels are very similar in higher elo's a high gold and a low plat generally play at about the same level, but for the most part a bronze 2 and a bronze 2 can play at drastically different levels.\n\nThis means that if you have anything less than medium high skill you can't leave the bottom tier of play, which is terrible because at the bottom tier of play there is a very low chance of you learning to play with medium high skill, and this is made evident by the amount of players that play in the bottom tier without ever advancing, even with the soft resets that should be making their climb back to where they were easier season after season.","replies":[]}]}]}
