Her clear is unsafe for her and she is fairly easily counterjungled, but she packsa wallop from early to mid. she actually outduels most adc&#039;s when she is even with them with a generic build, so don&#039;t let her solo your allies if you can help it. realistically the only ability you need to dodge is her ult, but if you can dodge both her ult and q that should be enough to prevent her from doing any thing productive for a while, kiting her is really easy so long as you don&#039;t get hit in the first place, and her passive reduces slowing affects, so try to use those early rather than later.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-04-24T07:19:05.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never seen somehow call see broken op or underpowered she's just there and unpopular","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-24T15:20:51.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still though, I'm sure there are people that hate sej with burning passion. and I don't know any other champion as well as I know sej.","replies":[]}]}]}
