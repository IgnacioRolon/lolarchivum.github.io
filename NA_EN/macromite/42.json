It could help new players learn the mechanics in the game, that you keep trying to push for older fans. it could help lower tiered players learn how to play at a higher level. It could technically lower toxicity, as coached players should be able to lose coach players, and likewise. coaches should gain ip rewards, as well as chests if the coached player earned it naturally. perhaps let the coaching system be a way to gain keys easier, but another part would be to help supports and tanks to be more capable of earning the higher rewards.","replies":[]}
