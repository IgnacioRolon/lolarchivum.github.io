So planning for this and making that much less punishing is the goal. Obviously this passive is bonkers crazy, but that is just fine. Plus it&#039;s simple to understand, making it better for newbies.\r\n\r\nQ - Short dash (Similar in length to shens) with an average (20%-40%) movespeed boost on a low-ish cd (5 seconds-ish)\r\nSimple ability, very easy to undestand, quite versatile in use.\r\n\r\nW - Aoe cone that does X (X) Physical damage, Double against minions and monsters, can crit. Low-ish cd as well (gotta let them hit buttons)\r\nEasy ability to understand, it uses classical cone logic so it&#039;s technically instant and undodgeable, so It&#039;s easy to use, and It also functions as a waveclear and jungle clear tool, push button, swing sword. bam, easy.\r\n\r\nE - A missing health heal on himself. no other affects. Similar cd (All the buttons)\r\nI mean, it just heals. Simple easy basic stuff. when green bar is empty, screen goes gray, this button gives you more green bar.\r\n\r\nR - Health increase, Size increase, Range increase, on himself. (think nasus or renekton without the aoe part)\r\nFeels impressive, looks impressive, easy, and for a new player it could really feel big, and this character is for the newbies.\r\n\r\nSo this is what I think a super begginer friendly champion in league could look like.\r\n\r\nAnd if you think that the design looks op (passive) or useless (everything except the passive) that&#039;s because it&#039;s all supposed to go together into one ball of meh. It&#039;s not really meant to look like a great champion to players currently in league, but it is one meant to exist as a perfect thing for beginners, and also probably lcs because it has a teleport, but new players.","replies":[]}
