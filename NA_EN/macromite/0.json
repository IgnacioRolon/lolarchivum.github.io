People hate champs that force interactivity like Yasuo, Illaoi, Malphite, Alistar and Leona so I can't jive with that argument. If a champ out there has a kit that says, \"don't ignore me, this isn't a farming simulator\" they're hated.\n\nPeople wanted average length games for forever. Back in 2016 I remember topic upon topic bemoaning hour long or 50 minute matches while some matches lasted only 30 mins. People wanted consistency. In order to resolve this, Riot added more meaningful objectives like Rift Herald, and made Dragon more important. This made the jungle somewhere people traveled and they wanted to make flash less of a necessity so they added plants like the blastcone.\n\nThe game is the most skill based it's ever been, and it's also the most consistent. If the winning team plays their hand right they'll most likely win. If the losing team keeps making small mistakes, those mistakes will compound much higher and they'll lose.\n\nThe downside of more consistent games is the lack of upsets and comebacks so losing players tend to lose more w/o knowing why. They don't know that they lost due to miscalculating the importance of early game microagressions or lack of warding. All they know is that once the game reaches 20 mins they probably can't bring it back. They try, the game lasts for 10 more minutes maybe and the game ends at 30.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-04-06T23:19:02.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The downside of more consistent games is the lack of upsets and comebacks so losing players tend to lose more w/o knowing why.

People aren't machines even winning teams make mistakes, but the best players are the best BECAUSE of consistency, so that becomes a smaller and smaller hope. \n\nAlso, and I can tell you from experience as a Kled {{champion:240}} player, the reason I hate Fiora (a hard Kled counter in the right hands) is because of her rotations being perfect for killing a Kled and more importantly, the fact that SHE HAS COUNTER PLAY... but to understand her counter play as Kled you must play her and know the minute inner-workings of her kit. Her actions are quick and easy to miss or misunderstand. \nThere was NO other way I could have learned from display language on MY side of the screen that her pressure points don't work if I back into a wall. It took hours of thinking. No way for me to calculate a better build without seeing her damage scalings; and NO way I could have fought her in general without know what that champ WANTS me to do as a Fiora to get the upper hand. Where as I am Kled, you know what I want, I wanna fight you every time my ax shines, and I do not have the power to regularly make people look that deep into my kit to out play me. That in and of its self is a champion strong point. Some people can't handle or just don't like that IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpÃ¢rky","date":"2018-04-05T21:59:51.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Man. I love you for saying this. This is the most true thing ever. People feel like there is no counter play because there is none. The other team sometimes just knows how to close a game out. Which is showing skill. The team ahead should be able to snowball to victory unless they mess up in which case now its on the other team to show their skill and punish that. Also totally agree that it is the most consistent. 2016 was so wacky. Some games would be 50 minutes others would be the inhibs down at 25 ahh the ptsd is kicking in now XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2018-04-06T08:43:26.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I think the reason why people want games longer or want games shorter is because ~~games are really boring (uninteractive)~~ **players have no fucking idea what to do** between laning and hyper lategame.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-04-06T23:08:55.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait...
