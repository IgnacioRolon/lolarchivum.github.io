(support in reference to making the role a thing, rather than the actual role, support) This is a stupid idea, and for gods sake if you really need it just design a new champion with matching lore to become one rather than gimping the design of an already well rounded champion for the sake of it.\r\n\r\nPlus the fact that sej was one of the more unique vanguards already, with the ranged initiate.","replies":[{"poster":"Mcprowlington","date":"2017-04-15T16:56:07.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah. pretty worried that this will be impossible balance and will take away from what early 1v1 power she had. Nothing like bursting down over confident counter-junglers when they feel you're a free kill. \n\nAlso, the fact that she only seems to synergize with melee means she might be a bad pick when your fellow low elo teammates selfishly pick nothing but ranged squishies when it used to feel like i could save the entire comp. \n\nIn the long run i guess it'll be fine but there's no way her kit will be implemented and fine as-is. Think the amount of changes made to Illaoi from her implementation to now, at the very least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-04-15T15:35:46.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Plus the fact that sej was one of the more unique vanguards already, with the ranged initiate.\n\nExactly, just her ranged initiate, then she becomes a useless meatshield with pitiful damage accompanied with a lack of CC. I get how people uses the \"_he got mordekai'ed_\" meme nowadays especially with Malzahar, but this has to stop.\n\nFor instance, you just don't understand how lacking & underpowered Sejuani is right now.\n\n- She's only useful with her AoE stun ult.\n- Passive felt like nothing, as her early sustain is as squishy as Karthus jungle.\n- Q is 2nd most useful kit after her ult, but unlike Sion or Maokai, she has no form of self-defence.\n- WE combo is unnoticeable af, as it doesn't provide any noticeable CC or damage it deals.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-15T16:40:00.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"she was actually great, I could duel fighters and adcs. maybeyou just need to learn how to build.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-04-15T18:23:12.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably fought a ton of bad players to think Sejuani is in a \"good\" state right now.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-15T23:27:41.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"again, you still probably just need to learn how to build. getting some mpen and a lot of health with the proper defenses meant it was an easy task to get to a target and kill them. if they tried to mano a mano you and you wereven you would normally win so long as they didn't have a counter in their kits or items.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-04-15T15:28:07.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see what your issue with her is.\nI love playing Sejuani, but after you press R her kit is bland, and it feels bad when you don't get multiple people stunned in her ult (if anyone).
