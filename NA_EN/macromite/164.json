These are all things that can be changed to and the precedent is set here, in volibears change.\n\nIt means that all current lore is useless, because at any moment any piece can be changed, there is no reason to study lore, to understand lore any more, because any amount of understanding you have of the story will never be immune to riot simply going back and changing things that need not be changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2017-08-12T14:30:57.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The current lore for voli is a placeholder actually until they find a nice lore to go with for him and now that they do (which is a fantastic and personality wise for him cause he is a god of war) they change it. And some champs doesn't have any canon lore at the moment but some was retcon to make a unique breathing world for LOL. And i disagree with \"that all current lore is useless, because at any moment any piece can be changed\" because some has new lores already and doesn't need to be change in the future and i assure you that riot wouldn't mind changing that ones already cause they loop changing of lores unless its an old lore and summoners are involve.\n\nI suggest that you read lores of the champions that was retcon at the start of the bilgewater event until today, the retcon champs only cause some champs in some factions didn't undergo with an update like sona in the demacia eventcause i know riot has better plans for her and she might transfer from a demacia origin to ionia. and also the new champs in 2015 up to now cause some champs before that will undergo some updates.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-08-12T15:01:18.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">which is a fantastic and personality wise for him cause he is a god of war\n\nBut voli isn't a god of war, he is a sage. and there are already multiple gods of war walking around.{{champion:266}} {{champion:80}} \n\nand you mention the retcon a lot, but what you probably don't know that the retcon officially ignored the freljord event, the shurima event, and the bilgewater event which all took place at around the same timeframe, because all of those events had little to do with the lore of the summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2017-08-12T15:36:58.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i don't know if you just don't like voli's new lore or anything but as said he is now a god of war in the eyes of freljord (not the one you particularly you imagine like the 2 you've mention) and he is not a sage already as in ornn's new lore. As for pan, i think they are going for a diff route for him to make him unique and as for aatrox, there are diff kinds of gods in runeterra which means the same title but has diff ideals like in our universe (ex, zeus is the god of gods like to jupiter in the roman mythology but their ideals and belief have some difference)\n\nas the other argument, i think its best to assume that the once after the bilgewater is more clearer canon other than the 2 past events because you might never know if they could change some things specially some are placeholers there but as taliyah reveal, we've got some additional info in the shurima event, retconning some champs(but some might be placeholders) and now i'll assume they will permanently retcon freljord's champions in ornn's live reveal (if he is the herald of it).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Otarie53","date":"2017-08-11T20:59:06.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WeedWicker,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=RslaPF4O,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-08-11T20:10:17.200+0000)\n>\n> What do you mean by no reason?

His personality is perfect. \n\nRemember when we had a discussion awhile back about new vs old Poppy (I think this was with you, I'm so sorry if I'm confusing you with someone else) and I mentioned that the stoic badass comically serious character can be done well. And to me was far more interesting than the catchphrase spouting naive thing they replaced Poppy with. \n\nI see Ornn as having that personality. Basically the personality I thought reworked Poppy should have had. Or at least damn close. \n\nAs to his story. Again I am fundamentally opposed to the power creep of god characters because if they ever act with the normal characters it just becomes a stupid mess. However, as far as mythologies goes taken at face value. This does right everything Targon did wrong. With the sole possible exception of rewriting previously established champions to fit the new God theme when they absolutely had nothing to do with that before. Meaning Volibear got Pantheon'd. I hate that.  But it doesn't have the same sting, to me anyway. Because I never cared about Volibear. So I'll leave it to the actual Volibear fans to be annoyed or not.

Instead of a peace loving man having his hand forced to bring what he seeks to protect his people from to his people to save them (against their will if need be), he became a pride fueled monster that brings war to many peoples, and perversed nature to create strength, or in other words. a tried villain archetype that already existed within the league of legends.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Slayer","date":"2017-08-12T06:22:45.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wait till he actually gets a VGU then you'll see that this change would be good for him. His lore was already old and his character had so much more potential. He is a jealous demi god because of how Ornn's followers freely gave him love Volibear wants that but he is a god that loves fighting and only gathers followers that want to fight and change their bodies just to please Volibear. He isn't necessary a villain he is just a violent character you cant really see alot about Voli just through Ornn's story since Ornn only sees the violent side and nothing else like what Volibear could possibly feel on the inside of himself.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-08-12T07:54:19.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can name 5 reasons specifically why this change was bad even with any further changes made to volibear to make him seem like a nicer guy.\n\n1. It detracts from story A in freljord (The war of three sisters)\n\n2. It detracts from story B in freljord (The return of the watchers)\n\n3. It removes connections to fringe race (Ursine can't be vastayah if they spring from a non-vastayah)\n\n4. it fully introduces a Story C to freljord, (Freljord and the demi-gods) even though freljord already has multiple large scale stories that have still yet to be told\n\n5. The Freljord story C (Freljord and the demi-gods) is likely going to be incredibly similar to Targon story A (Targon and the aspects) which is especially problematic because these are also the two most similar locations in league of legends, the two frozen wastes within the games lore.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BestJhinUniverse","date":"2017-08-11T21:07:30.521+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"I dislike some champs being forced in factions or changed completely from the things that made them interesting.\n\nOld trundle was good then he went cliche troll king.\n\nXerath was a man basically born as magic incarnate, he wasn't evil or out of his way good.
