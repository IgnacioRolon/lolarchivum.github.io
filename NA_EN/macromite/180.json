If you were a true solo que player, then you'd understand that there are nuances in a game of solo que players that mostly use the chat as their main form of communication. Some players might not ping. Some might end up afking their character as they're typing out sentences. Alot of information can get lost through the process of typing your thoughts.\n\nCommunication won't get any better.\n\nBut thats IT. Communication should be worse because players aren't utilizing some type of vocal communication program like teamspeak thus there are more mistakes to be made. Good solo que players can punish this.\n\nQueue times will get worse.\n\nNot true. EVERYONE is a solo que player queueing therefore its much faster to find teams since in dynamic queue, the system has to check for premades and attempt to match premades with premades before anything else.\n\npeople will still get very angry at you.\n\nSo? that is league of legends solo que.
