Why shouldnt riot balance for a large section of their player base, that's also no doubt a large section of income on skins, to their skill level? Yes you can design champs for higher elo, but shouldnt majority be balanced for the largest group of players? \n\nIve only been playing a few months, but ive already dropped 40 bucks on skins and unlocking one champ. Why shouldnt it be balanced for me as well?\n\nAnd also, i also apologize for that first post.

Many low elo players don't even play champions to half their potential (at least for the mechanically intensive champions) so the balancing would be extremely skewed in favour of champions that are harder to learn and against easy champions. This in turn would completely fuck over challenger elo because they play champions to near maximum potential and thus the power discrepancy between champions will be black and white. You can climb out of low elo simply by getting better at the game, completely regardless of how the game is balanced. Challenger players, on the other hand, cannot get better (very marginally better) so balance is the determining factor of winning up there. And if riot listened to even half the suggestions made on these boards, this game would be exponentially worse across all elos.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LegitBusinessman","date":"2016-12-26T06:26:14.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JayLord,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=I9XBe6eF,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-12-26T06:21:37.443+0000)\n>\n> Or maybe I was alluding to the part where they actually influence the games balance by being one of the few vocal outlets for players to communicate to rioters.
