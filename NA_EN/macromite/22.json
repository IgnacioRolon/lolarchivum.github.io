It's got some cool features tho and Tundra Fizz and crew have poured their heart and soul into it so it's well cared for. It's by no means required but for those users who would like some of the additional functionality the boards yet lack and won't have for some time yet, fek is as good as it gets. Wuks is doing something similar as well and both will increase the options available to board users in the immediate future while we wait for the board dev team to do board dev things.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-05-18T00:58:53.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Well the fek staff probably won't let you have that as an avatar, lmao\n\nThey very clearly did though","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2017-05-18T01:05:33.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=deGhdmcE,comment-id=000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-18T00:58:53.886+0000)\n>\n> They very clearly did though\n\nAhhh hahahahahahaha, whoops.
