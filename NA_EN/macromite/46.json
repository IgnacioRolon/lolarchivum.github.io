Overall, the idea is actually a good one in the end, and should&#039;ve been implemented long ago, but it is nearing upon too late. This system needs to be implemented soon, within one year if possible.","replies":[{"poster":"lilpokfluf","date":"2016-06-17T14:43:45.759+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's happening to Dyna?

They should be praised for their determination in doing so...\n\nBut they tend to abuse that power, especially when they premade with like tongued people. Because instead of sticking with a language that even the solo players understand, they can and will troll people by only speaking another language. While this problem can plague EU more than NA, unless you can speak every language your gonna be in a bad situation should you come across a person that speaks a language you can't.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-06-17T17:23:11.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is true, but like in other games, there is a method of dealing with this. pings. we already have pings to communicate on a basic level, so if it comes down to it it still works as well as an omni linguistic and basic system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2016-06-17T14:43:43.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voice coms isn't going to magically make it okay for Pre-mades to litter the ranked system along with solo players.\n\nShould Voice coms be given to us?
