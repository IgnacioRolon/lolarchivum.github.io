(of course not picking marksman or tanks because that would be oversaturating one thing.)\r\n\r\nThe mid lane also remains open, so burst mages, battle mages, artillery mages, and assassins still find a place.\r\n\r\nSo rito, if you read this try to go for this. this is what Im pretty sure balanced league looks like.","replies":[]}
