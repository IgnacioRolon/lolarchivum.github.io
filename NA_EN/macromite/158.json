{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-29T02:20:43.048+0000","title":"Just realized something.","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"[](http://pre14.deviantart.net/c9a7/th/pre/i/2014/060/0/c/_lol___blackfrost__sejuani_by_zuqling-d78hz70.png)\r\nI&#039;ve been playing this game for a while but no matter how hard I try I can&#039;t find a champion I fully click with. Whenever I play one I feel like I&#039;m missing something from what I am trying to do. I like autoattacking, and I have had a lot of fun playing yi jax and trundle in the past, I love being tanky as hell and sitting in teamfights which is why I played sej trundle and sion as well, and I also have a great deal of need for initiation presence, which is why I&#039;ve played sej sion and rammus. but whenever I start REALLY getting into playing any of the characters I&#039;ve played a lot, I start Itching for that scratch they don&#039;t have for me.\r\n\r\nAmong the closest riot has ever gotten was old sej, a dps tank with solid enough dps while being tanky and havign really god initaion presence. amumu and zac both never did feel as visceral as sej, becuase they really don&#039;t want to slap one guy down as they dps in fights. With sej not being that anymore, I started freaking the heck out. but then I realized, Rito could fix this. I&#039;ve finnaly narrowed down exaclty why the sej change hurst so bad, and though it is probably going out, It wouldn&#039;t be too hard to explain what could probably replace it.\r\n\r\nKnowing what I know about the current roster and how the game works, I decided to try and design the thing that would scratch my auto heavy vanguard/juggernaut hybrid. \r\n\r\nFirst things first, for such a hybrid to work it would need to work like shyv, they are a vanguard only due to their ult, otherwise they just end up being one or the other due to the classes having a great deal of similarites.\r\n\r\nSo here is my Attempt.\r\n\r\n**Champion Name and title**\r\n\r\nRaiu Shin, The old shoguns armor\r\n\r\n**Description of appearance**\r\n\r\nClassical red armor from the japanese sengoku period (or something like it) With a full mask, in game larger than average (jarvan height atleast)\r\nhttp://www.samurai-store.com/armor/img/item/LA1/LA1a.jpg\r\nUsing a japanese studded club\r\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/deadliestwarrior/images/5/53/Kanabo2-0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150611173502\r\nWith electricty coming off of him all the time.\r\n\r\n**Personality**\r\n\r\nNot a lot of words, everything said should be somewhat insightful into the lore, or just noises for attacking.\r\n\r\nAlso the jokes need to all be dad jokes. 150% full dad puns.\r\n\r\n**Lore**\r\n\r\nThis is a reanimated armor character that fits within ionia. Kennen could be involved. Character should essentially fit into whatever ao shin could&#039;ve been, great threat to ionia, armor appears. \r\n\r\nBackstory could relate to ancient ionia, which is something that is very sparcely seen if ever seen in the stories of any character, perhaps even older than the vastayah as a race if it would be cool enough, like talking mordekaiser age.\r\n\r\nSpeaking about mordekaiser, important difference to make right here is that morde is more of a revenant within armor and less reanimated armor, this character will BE the armor, not a guy in the armor.\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\nI&#039;m not so good at the numbers, so I&#039;m going to omit most scalings and cooldowns unless I think they are important for describing what the idea of the ability is.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Passive**- You gain magic resist equal to 50% of your maximum armor, You do not gain magic resist otherwise.\r\n\r\n*Armor guy builds a lot of armor. also makes his builds unique among tanks and juggernauts, and gives him a natural weakness to magic damage due to lack of itemization.*\r\n\r\n**Q**- Raiu sweeps his Bludgeon infront of him and slows enemies hit.\r\n\r\n*This would be the bread and butter for laning, the thing he could poke with when not auto attacking, and also giving him a teency amount of cc while not ulting*\r\n\r\n**W**- Raiu marks an enemy champion, He then gains movespeed towards that champion and deals bonus magic damage to them for the duration of the mark.\r\n\r\n*Kinda like an electro magnet, the method of the mark should really determine how perful the buffs are, point and click = minor buff, skillshot that hits minions = major buff. the movespeed shouldn&#039;t be a huge amount though, its more of a sticking thing.*\r\n\r\n**E**- Raiu&#039;s next auto attack heals him equal to the damage dealt, and Then Raiu gains attack speed.\r\n\r\n*This is an attack reset and the healing mechanic that juggernauts need.*\r\n\r\n**R**- Raiu Leaps forward and stuns everyone nearby, gaining shield based on how many targets hit when he lands\r\n\r\n*I imagine it with decent range, essentially giving raiu the ability to initiate fights or act like a diver when needed, Essentially the part of his kit that lets him function as a vanguard. higher cd than most ults though, gotta make it fair for a juggernaut to just decide to jump into your team.*","replies":[{"poster":"CobaltTheMadMage","date":"2017-04-29T14:20:19.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried Tryndamere, Darius, Vi, or Garen?","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-29T14:27:53.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried trynda, Don't like the taste in my mouth when I play darius, mastery 6 on vi, and I'm actually too ham for garen to work.\n\nI've been looking for the champ I made for a long time, without truly knowing what I was looking for.\n\nThank you though","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-04-29T03:14:58.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm, why don't you just build slightly tanky Camille?
