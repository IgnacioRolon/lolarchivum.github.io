To draw a comparison, the nation of Noxus kind of thrives on their own version of the American Dream, but without all the pretense of moral limits. Any given beggar from the streets can slaughter their way up to the heights of Noxian society. \n\nNoxus is not overly particular about conventional definitions of power. Whether you use brute strength, political prowess, wealth, or intelligence as your implement of power, you're entitled to whatever you can make of it. Your reasons for exercising power are irrelevant as long as they don't interfere with the strength of the nation as a whole. Take the Noxus-Zaun alliance. The culture of Noxus opens its arms wide to madmen such as Singed who don't hold much in the ways of a shared history or forms of tradition. He probably cares little for Noxian authority except that they let him continue to create new and more horrible atrocities, and Noxus leadership as a whole is happy to let him have his jollies while he works for them. Granted, there's probably a lot of inner-bickering about what the best kind of power is and matters such as how one displays their honor as a Noxian among the diverse population, but at the end of the day if you have a problem with the way something or someone else in Noxian society is, you exercise your own power to make things the way you want.\n\nSejuani and her ilk, on the other hand, represent cold, hard tradition and strength. It's hard to say who is more cruel to the weak. Your Noxian bully in power might derive some sick pleasure out of tormenting those beneath them, or they might very well value them as a useful resource towards their own ends. It's likely something of a roll of the dice what kind of lot in life you get as an unexceptional person in Noxus. Not so with the Winter's Claw. You're weak, you die. No pity is afforded. You are a sacrifice to the strength of the tribe. Likewise, there is probably little bargaining to be had with the Winter's Claw as an outsider. \n\nOn the other hand, I feel the sense of solidarity and appreciation between those strong ones who can survive in Sejuani's tribe is bound to be much stronger. The mere thought of committing some underhanded trick to usurp the balance of power between them would probably send any given member of the tribe into a rage. Noxians might laugh off such an attempt with their rival over lunch the next day, after having their respective poison-testers carted off to the infirmary/morgue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrodinium","date":"2016-04-30T00:42:26.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe it boils down to their end goal: Winter's Claw want to survive, while the Noxian seek dominance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-04-29T20:36:22.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same ideology on one hand, but Noxus still wants to annex all of the Freljord in general which would involve the WInter's Claw giving up their freedom.
