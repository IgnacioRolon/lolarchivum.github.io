Its always a circle the top ADCs get playe dthen nerfed pushed to teh bottom then the next lot comes along .. nerfed then pushed to the  bottom until we get back to the start... \n\nIMO we need to have the supports change .... yeh we have lulu whio can buff atatck speed and do well against divers etc but when it comes down to it we really just have enchanters which support with heal and shields then we have the tanks who either focus on enaging or disenaging","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oxford To You","date":"2018-02-11T17:28:31.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?","replies":[]}]}
