Instead of everyone focusing on nerfs to the blind guy, they should just buff every other champion to have the same usability level of him, or make a hard counter champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-02-19T23:24:50.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, Lee Sin is only cried as OP because all the other junglers got gutted..

One Riot person will say they don't want to nerf people as badly as happened in the past so they want to get everything right before nerfing Lee Sin. Then another Riot person will throw in some nerfs to another champion that already got crowded out by Lee Sin or another champion that does exactly the opposite. Azir may be getting some small buffs soon but he still got hit really hard with the nerfs. So much for carefully thinking before nerfing! He is just the latest victim and given that it takes until the next patch to possibly address a change it's ridiculous how often it happens.\n\nIs it really so hard to communicate what your intentions are, Riot? How many times will you contradict yourself with changes or a lack of changes? It's easy to see why so many people get upset and saying \"sorry\" only works for so long before it has no meaning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2015-02-20T06:06:23.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You want to know the real reason Rito doesn't nerf Lee Sin?\n\nThey're scared!!!\n\nIf you can recall in about the middle of last season Riot had a nerf/rework on the PBE's for Lee Sin, and honestly I liked it and thought it was more balanced.  Can't remember everything about it but essentially his mobility was reduced, his base stats were reduced, his execution damage was reduced, but his ratios were increase slightly, and his sustain was increased to make up for the lower base stats. Something about his dash was also changed, can't remember what exactly but it was definitely a nerf.\n\nThat's what I remember at least, I could have missed something or got another wrong but I'm pretty sure that's the gist of it.\n\nSo what happened to this plan?  The Lee Sin community on the old forums went into such a ridiculous uproar that Riot scrapped the whole thing and said \"he no longer gets a shield when dashing to a ward\" and that was it!  The Lee community literally cried Riot into submission on this one, stuff about his \"identity being ruined.\"\n\nThe truth is they balanced him, which ofc has to be mainly a nerf since he's so freakin strong atm, so the multitude of people who play him got upset like anyone does on the forums and the rework was cancelled, and anytime Riot wants to try balancing him again they'll have to deal with the tidal wave of tears they know they will receive, just like last time.\n\nThat being said I'd rather see just J4 and Vi nerfed slightly while buffing the other junglers instead of nerfing Lee.  He is kind of OP due to his early game but he's not the most serious offender atm... *cough* J4 and Vi* cough*.... so I don't think nerfing him is the answer atm.  Was just saying why he won't get nerfed for a very long time is all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LANWhale","date":"2015-02-20T05:53:44.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But....\n\n*PowerCreep*\n\nT_T","replies":[]}]}
