This kit would be too good at laning top without the reduction of attack range.\n\nInvuln over stealth is probably healthier, it can&#039;t be used to outmaneuver opponents but it also doesn&#039;t need to be used like that anymore, and it gives the opponent a lot more to work with.\n\nPlus, unlike current vayne, with more number adjustments this version could probably be fixed if it under or over performs.","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk Succ ","date":"2016-12-13T01:41:08.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has to be a joke, right?","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-12-13T19:58:38.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fraid not, have you any problems with it please post them, and I may be able to clarify my choices.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BIackfox","date":"2016-12-12T19:48:50.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmfao\n\nLower her already microscopic range.\n\nW does physical damage and is lowered.\n\nPlease tell me You meant this to be in the meme section\n\nYeah, I'm sure this will need fixing since it will definitely be over performing....","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-12-12T20:04:46.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vayne's range is 550, which is about average.
