Right now tanks have had a ton of defensive power taken from them while ADCs and ad champions have had a ton of defensive power put into offensive items. It's an entirely unfair situation. Not to mention, mages have become too good at killing tanks because of the tank item nerfs, and Void staff still gives 35% magic pen","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-06-11T21:32:44.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a cyclical problem.\n\nMarksman are getting too defensive, so burst characters are getting more damage to compensate, withe the extra burst flying around the cc tanks bring is becoming more valuable, with cc locking to death being more prevelant, marksman need better defenses to help them survive it.\n\nIf you change out one kog at a time you end up making the problem worse.\n\nAnd of course its definantly more problamatic than this. they've been letting the game fall into this state for a long time, there are years and years of muck and nonsense to fix and rebalance.","replies":[]}]}]}
