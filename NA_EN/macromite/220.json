Aqua is shaco, darken is reksai, I'm the Queen (cringe),  Hades is - well - Hades, Face the Sun is Leona, MM is Morde, etc. It originally was kind of a small thing but then people got into it since it was pretty simple and others enjoyed treating others in character, and being treated through their character. Doing the RP stuff on discord is going to be something that not everyone has to do, but everyone will have the option to do.
