having it destroyed and losing those 600 gold makes it a noob trap. enemies who are ahead of you are very likely to be able to destroy the thing every time you buy it.\n\nthe better approach would be to make it a low cost, cost efficient/slot inefficient item that you would grab for momentary power when behind, and feel compelled to sell later on for a bigger item. very similar to

all.\n\ninstead the benefit could just be lowered. instead of putting flat 50% damage reduction onto it, even against enemies that are 1 level ahead, make it scaling on the opponents level for once. \n\nsomething like 5% damage reduction for every level the opponent is ahead on you, capping out at 20%\n\nplus you could put a cooldown on the item like {{item:3026}} to deactivate the passive for a time, when it \"breaks\". it would at least allow to keep that 200 health benefit.\n\nbut entirely destroying the item will more often than not put you even further behind than you already are. 600 gold down the drain. even if you manage to use the item to make a comeback and go even against the enemy, youll be instantly behind again as soon as it breaks. probably already when you catch up in levels.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-24T19:44:23.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"scaling would be a nono. a champion with so much as a two level lead usually

this item.\n\nwhich creates the weird situation that you get shiton for being slightly ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-24T19:56:41.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is why the item is a gold sink.\n\nan incredible negative along with an

Or an overall gold efficiency of 933/600 > 155% WITHOUT the passive.\nThat's just bonkers when the passive is what makes the item broken.\nIts passive is WAY stronger than an elixir which is still worth buying before end-game if you know when the important fight will be, at roughly the same price. \nI'm quickly coming to the conclusion that if such an item were to work, it would need to have a minimum price tag of 1000g with these stats, or ~800g with no stats and just the passive.\n\n \n> I came to the conclusion after thinking pretty hard about potential solutions. \n\nSolutions to what? Your enemy outplaying you and winning? I mean - I don't really see the need for such an item. It seems pretty unfair that you earn a lead and there's an item to negate it. Didn't check that they put themselves further behind in gold to get such an item? Too bad. Play a champion with good poke that doesn't need to all in? Makes this item worthless (poke till it breaks). Play a champion that can't poke and needs to go all in? Sucks to be you.\n\n> It would need to be an item above anything else to make it possible to see use, you shouldn&amp;#039;t have runes, masteries, or a champion&amp;#039;s kit designed around falling behind.\n> It can&amp;#039;t be an offensive based item or it would probably just turn into a lose to win contest.\n> If it&amp;#039;s defensive it probably needs some actual defense stats so that characters that need those stats to scale can still feel good about purchasing it as a crutch.\n> It needs to use a mechanic that could be easily viewed and understood, I went with levels because that&amp;#039;s a quick one to understand.\n> It needs to give enough defense to be useful, but little enough to not make the champ immortal.

I just still question whether such an item needs to exist in the first place, and if it really does have a place in the game it is definitely too cheap / overtuned. \n \n> What do you think?\n\nI'd say lower it to 20%-30% damage reduction (more in line with challenging smite), increase the cost to 750-1000g, and we could have a bit of a winner here. It should be highly situational, as in \"there's one fed enemy who I DIDN'T FEED that keeps popping me so I can't carry against them\" rather than \"I fed my lane and need something to help me come back\".\n\nI think it's okay for the mid laner who's doing fine to want help against the fed enemy top. It's not okay for the feeding top laner to get help against the dude he fed.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-25T01:04:34.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of problems with your knowledge base and conclusions.\nnot going to get into it though, it would just turn into a spitting match.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-01-24T21:49:02.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winrate 50% > 40%\n\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:121}} \n\ntake 50% reduced damage for 600g","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-24T22:21:20.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"melee only, annie, lux, and veig are out\n\nalso the rest of those are assassins, that can't afford to be behind, and who the 50% damage reduction would not be of great assistance in that behind situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-01-24T22:23:10.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm saying the enemies will buy them against these champs, making the assassins useless","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-24T23:06:39.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all of those champions have more than enough to kill through it, especially considering they will have a level advantage. it will just make it less of a, get killed immediately for trying to lane again, and more of a, another intense fight like the first one should have been.","replies":[{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-01-24T23:24:28.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same could be said about {{summoner:3}} , but its not always true","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
