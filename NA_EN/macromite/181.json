I don&#039;t want to see him every game, I just want to be able to play the guy without feeling like I&#039;m breaking a knee cap in champion select.","replies":[{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-09-03T04:39:22.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"renekton is actually not that bad. hes just not the best.\n\nIn retrospect however--when champs are the best for a while, a culture is sort of installed. The sentiment that he needs to be the best or should be better than others is flawed.  \n\nThere was a Riven Master main who made a thread last week claiming that she should get %max hp dmg or true dmg cause **she isnt the best anymore**\nlets say that ive seen worse downvoted thread filled with biased laughable opinions but i think we should acknowledge that Renek is good--but not worth picking compared to juggernauts.\n\nIm not going to say that its time for others to shine since darius and garen never were truly stars--like ever. But renekton was the king of the top lane for almost a whole season. I feel that the new items does help him, and that he can still bring a lane bully/splitpush 1v1 power with a reliable stun/bruiser aoe gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-09-03T04:23:27.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you've just been playing against bad Renektons. The ones I see go Hydra -> Cleaver and then 1 shot your carries while being impossible to deal with in lane and being impossible to gank.","replies":[{"poster":"Ezragus","date":"2015-09-03T04:33:13.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't faced one yet, but playing as ren, i've had a lot of success lately","replies":[{"poster":"Ezragus","date":"2015-09-03T04:33:42.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but yeah, he's super strong haha","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ezragus","date":"2015-09-03T04:10:31.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is really strong right now, actually. a buff would make him ridiculous. one of the best early games, and with the right build, (i go BC into Titanic into tank), his late game is even better. Lots of damage, lots of tankiness. At most points in the game you can combo down the ADC or mid laner before they can react. Titanic Hydra was a massive indirect buff to Renekton, to be honest haha","replies":[]}]}
