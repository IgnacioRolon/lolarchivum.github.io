Champions that don&#039;t get outplayed when they die, rather they outplay themselves.\r\n\r\nLike gragas. Generalist jungler champion with great range, great sustain, and one of the best initiates and disengages rolled up into one ball. essentailly when he isn&#039;t played its because he is either completely countered by atleast one champion every game or unusably nerfed.\r\n\r\nwell what if we were to attach the sej ult problem to his ult. hit directly or get weak reduced effect. with that one could even reasonably remove the current negative (Travel time is set to be a certain time, meaning point blank ults are not great)","replies":[{"poster":"Wet Dryman","date":"2017-03-22T15:31:39.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can outplay Gragas. He has 3 skillshots, all are telegraphed (sound, visuals, decent travel time). You can use his ult to your advantage unless you're CCed as it is game changing ability (both for Grag's team and his enemies, every group can use it to their advantage). These reasons alone doesn't fit him under your definition of problem kit.\nHe hasn't got great sustain, it is useful in early clears (before buffs to it he was outsustained, outdueled by every other jungler) but later on it is proced mostly once or never in teamfight. His range puts him in danger zone of enemy abilities so its not as great as people portray it.\n\nIn his current state he isn't problematic in LCS, according to lol.esportswikis he was played 18 times in NA LCS and got 50% win rate, in LCK he was played 19 times and has 26% win rate so far, in EU LCS he was played 15 times and ends up with 46,7% win rate.\n\nThe only problem people had and still have with his fixed ult travel time is either clunkiness or they can't abuse no counterplay combo anymore.\nPersonally for me his ult clunkiness is not a big deal, he just could use a better animation for point and blank cast because current one is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-03-22T17:02:50.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gragas is a problem champ, hence why he has that clunky mechanic in the first place. \nThe sustain is sleeper but actually very strong, like most of the sustain mechanics in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wet Dryman","date":"2017-03-22T17:13:13.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Gragas is a problem champ because he has a fixed delay on only ONE ability that isn't even a big deal when you use your combos properly? No one serious bothers about this anymore, pro players discovered that it isn't so bad, people that mained Gragas still play him and it doesn't bother them too. The complaints I see recently is mostly this ridiculous animation nothing more.\nEven Riot doesn't acknowledge him as a problem as he won't be touched at all in Tank Update.\n\nGragas sustain to be actually very strong requires HP building and Spirit Visage, other than that its ok, helping only in early jungle clears.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
