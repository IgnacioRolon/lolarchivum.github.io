Confused by the creature, he shrugs it off, as braum flies towards thresh  (For some reason dash isnt a summoner or it'd be here). Smacking thresh with his shield. (Passive of braums)\n\n{{champion:412}} : tho recovering from the attack, he throws his lantern down to give himself a shield, with the shield protecting him he looks to thresh and cuts him down his chest with his scythe. Braum flinches a tad from the massive gash that thresh's attack did (flay passive)\n\n{{champion:201}} : With a smile on his face, he looks to thresh. \"heh. Idiot.\" He jumps in the air to slam down, causing a massive crack in the ground. Thresh gets knocked up into the air as he slams his back down into the snowy ground. Braum smacks him one more time as a loud CLASH noise is  made. (Passive proc of bruam).\n\n{{champion:412}} as badly wounded as that blow was, thresh laughs and laughs at him. \"I'm the idiot? heheh.\"  Thresh smiles as he summons a massive box around them. Forcing braum to be on his own.  \n\n*As the fight rages on, blows after blow on each other, however like all fights and all things in life. This must end*\n\nBraum, bleeding heavily from all the blows looks to thresh... Who seems to be... dying? He looks badly wounded as well. With the box still around them. braum looks to thresh. He knows what he must do to save the people he loves. He throws his shield down and grabs thresh \n\n{{champion:201}} \"as my mother always said... DON'T LOSE!\" \n\n*He picks him up as thresh tries to grab  his lantern but fails to. He charges right into a wall of the box, causing a massive explosion.

Time slowly fades as {{champion:34}} flies around to locate braum to regroup with the armies of ashe (pretty sure he's with ashe, right?) she spots him, half frozen in the ground. As she flies down to grab him. Some small laughter is heard as a scythe flies out of the snow and wraps its self around the bird lady.
