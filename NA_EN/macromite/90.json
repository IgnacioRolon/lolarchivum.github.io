(repost)","subforum":"Memes & Games","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"[](http://images.clipartpanda.com/smiley-face-thumbs-up-clipart-dTre6KXT9.jpeg)\r\n\r\nBased on how this year has gone so far I think that a list like this should be made so that everyone can see what good things I predict will happen this year.\r\n\r\nTwisted Treeline is getting removed because not enough people play Twisted Treeline.\r\n\r\nBots Getting removed because not enough players play bots.\r\n\r\nLeague of legends no longer featuring a tutorial, because its hard on their system to keep running it when so few people actually play it. and besides the best way to learn is to play.\r\n\r\nMore buffs directed at assassins.\r\n\r\nMore Direct nerfs for tanks in all positions.\r\n\r\nwards are getting removed because they are considered unhealthy for the game.\r\n\r\nminions no longer give exp to characters that didn&#039;t last hit it, so that carries can get their levels faster.\r\n\r\nbecause wards have been removed lee&#039;s dash is now just a point and click dash, and his q now does % current health on the skill shot.\r\n\r\na new item that is rageblade plus a recurve bow, it also increases ad and crit every hit as well.\r\n\r\nvayne has not seen enough play recently so they are going to buff her and add another 12 percent to her true every third auto.\r\n\r\nillaoi is not in a good enough spot, so their going to add an additional 40% of her damage as magic damage on every ability.\r\n\r\nao shin is being delayed until late 2017\r\n\r\nyoricks rework has been canceled and yorick has been removed from the game.\r\n\r\nTaric&#039;s rework has been canceled.\r\n\r\ncass is the design standard for mages now, every mage has a stacking passive.\r\n\r\nmordekaiser is considered unhealthy so long as he is on summoners rift. he is currently auto banned in everything but aram.\r\n\r\nUrf mode is back, but you need to pay 1031 rp every time you want to play it.\r\n\r\nRanked is the now the only queue, because supporting other queue&#039;s takes resources they can use in better places.\r\n\r\nCustom games have been removed because the best way to get better is to play the normal game.\r\n\r\nnew special game modes based increasing one stat per game mode, wait for next month&#039;s +15% movespeed game mode.\r\n\r\nevery skin released will all be crammed into one splash art so that riot can focus more on making quality in game models instead of working on splash arts.\r\n\r\nMore unnecessary buffs to random champions.\r\n\r\nMore reflex nerfs on anything that happens to counter what riot wants as meta as soon as it happens.\r\n\r\nSkarner has been removed from the game.\r\n\r\nUrgot will probably be seen in lcs again. for one game. and then he will be nerfed.\r\n\r\nbecause rek&#039;sai uses the old capture animations, she will get removed from the game so that riot can allocate more effort into a more quality game.\r\n\r\nCinderhulk isn&#039;t helping tanks enough, so their going to make a new item, and then nerf it and every tank that could use it.\r\n\r\nRunic echoes isn&#039;t what they are looking for for ap junglers, so that&#039;s getting phased out for a new ap jungle item.\r\n\r\nad items and item buffs galore.\r\n\r\nWhat a good year to play league of legends, I&#039;m so excited for these things to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitty Darkstar","date":"2016-02-11T23:30:37.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, a lot of people play bots.
