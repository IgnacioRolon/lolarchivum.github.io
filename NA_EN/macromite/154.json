I don't have any exact math but overall it will increase the physical damage she takes by roughly 1-5% from all sources.\n\nSecond, it doesn't matter how small the change if it's stacked on top of many others.\n\nIt's completely unreasonable to repeatedly nerf something patch after patch, we saw the results from Kalista and Azir.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-08-30T00:04:17.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rek's armor per level nearly matches zac after the nerf. hence why zac was mentioned.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-08-29T22:16:23.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac is picked one time in the LCS because Meteos used to main him and there are already complaint threads.
