I don&#039;t care particularly much for him or if he stays in the gutter, but he is terrible to play right now. He&#039;s wonky af, especially his Q. His ulti should have 2 forms - the 2nd part where he liquidates and leaving his old ulti as is where when you just press R he jumps around.\r\n\r\nEven if you get fed on him, he&#039;s nowhere near as effective as he use to be. I feel like I do zilch damage on him. Really negligible, especially early on in the game (this is coming from the guy that was COMPLAINING about Zacs insane damage before).","replies":[{"poster":"Acheron16","date":"2017-05-04T08:31:32.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paradòx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U3E5zEtk,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-04T08:06:02.462+0000)\n>\n> I'm not a Zac fan, nor am I an avid Zac player.\n\nThen why do you think you're qualified to give input on how to change him?\n\nYou played one game, did poorly and instantly came here to complain?
