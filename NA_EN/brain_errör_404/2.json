Playing TOO passive is just as bad, if not WORSE than playing too aggressive. I hate passive players the most (on my team). They want help, but they effectively don't contribute anything to me even attempting to help.\n\nThere's a difference between passive and passive aggressiveness. Unless the lane is such a bad matchup that going in for an auto can get you killed, you should at least be trying to put out SOME form of damage once in awhile to guarantee that help can be attained. You can't expect your team to do everything for you and hold your hand in a game every step of the way.\n\nIf you're not learning anything for yourself, then that's simply a waste.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-02-15T04:42:58.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paradòx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5I86VKr1,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-15T04:21:42.975+0000)\n>\n> By committing suicide, it refers to the &quot;live a little&quot; post I said.

It's more important to learn how to cs and survive THEN push the limits of you champ. For instance, if you're used to people like Brand or Viktor, who have good AA animations if youre trying Zilean or Aniva it's gonna take awhile for you to learn how to cs effectivwly with them.\n\nI do get what you're saying though. I play much riskier in normals just to test my limits. Its important to learn that, but you shouldn't let that get in the way of learning the more basic things of that champ. Yes the adc only did 9k damage, which is terrible, but they did a good job practicing their positioning and keeping themselves from dying in a really dive/burst oriented meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Brain Errör 404","date":"2017-02-15T05:09:55.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just saying. Most of what I'm saying is in regards to ganks when I'm ganking a lane and they legit sit back stroking their scrotum worrying too much about outliers. \n\nI get practicing the basics, I really do. I implore the basics. If you're sitting back and PRACTICING how to farm and position etc, then by all means ping me back from lane if your don't want to be too aggressive. However, if it's a sweet spot to gank, then that's also something you should be practicing: \n\nHow to properly position for a gank. You can't wait till your jgler is in your lane trying to get behind them. You have to engage and try to STALL them for a better opportunity. Too many times ganks go awry because lanes just sit back expecting lcs big plays from one person, often leading to kills getting away.\n\nOn that note, not even getting off a single auto attack in a teamfight isn't practicing ANYTHING. You're not doing damage. You're legit practicing how not to play the game. If you want to practice proper position, you should watch videos and high level adcs do their job and try to re-enact it. if you're sitting back the ENTIRE fight, after ALL big summoners are blown and NOT even trying to clean up, then why are you bothering to play the game? Effectively, you're a glorified minion. If you were afk, the out come of the game would NOT change. That's not the type of play that I see promising. I see absolutely nothing to be learned playing that way. You're not shoving a lane, you're not getting any objectives and most of all, the only thing you're contributing to is your cs count.\n\nJamming the basics into your head is one thing. Not even attempting to learn anything else is a fatal flaw that won't lead anywhere.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2017-02-15T04:20:21.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only good time to commit suicide is if you're being chased by four people and the only option is to offer yourself to the tower gods lol","replies":[]}]}
