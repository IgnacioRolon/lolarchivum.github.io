Not a huge problem, but a problem nonetheless. Though she is a problem, I think it&#039;s important that we talk about some serious misunderstandings here rather than a clear cut circle jerk. &quot;Wahhh, Ahri main crying so that his champ doesn&#039;t get nerfed&quot; is probably what most people are going to assume coming in. While she is one of my mains, I&#039;m just here to dispel some... misguided thoughts, if you will.\n\nSo, to keep this short and sweet, lets jump right into it. First things first, lets get rid of some incorrect line of thinking:\n\n*  Ahri&#039;s numbers are in no way high enough to warrant any nerfs to numbers\n\n*  Ahri is a purely skill shot reliant champ, but that does NOT mean she has a HIGH skill cap. in fact, she has a very moderate skill cap\n\n*  Ahri&#039;s core problem is the movement speed on her Q and that is one of 2 things that should be addressed\n\n*  Ahri&#039;s ulti CD might be a little TOO low (40s lvl 16 40% cdr)\n\nSuggestions:\n\n*  Tie her movement speed to her ultimate. It can be an ultimate passive where she gets a movement speed boost for hitting a champ. There could also be      an internal CD tied to the passive where it only procs on the same champ every 5/4/3 seconds based on ultimate rank. However, she cannot use this passive if she&#039;s already used her ultimate. Or, this passive can be completely removed. I&#039;m indifferent to it on Ahri, either way.\n\n* Her mid and late game ultimate timers can be increased slightly capping at around 50 seconds cd. Any higher could still be detrimental to her as most ultimates in this game cap at 60 cd come late game anyways\n\nNow that all of that is out of the way, lets clear up some other misunderstandings. The above suggestions is the ONLY thing that has to be looked at for Ahri. Ahri has one of the lowest burst and number scalings on most of her abilities out of all mages. I won&#039;t go too far into detail explaining anything, because anything I have to say as to why her numbers shouldn&#039;t be touched has already been said.\n\nOn that note, the reason why a champion like Ahri can have such a high winrate is because of her kit. Ahri doesn&#039;t have the most mechanically intensive kit, nor is her kit confusing to use. As a matter of fact, Ahri has one of the most linear, easy to use and easy to understand kit in the game. You don&#039;t have to be a master at Ahri to be good at her -- all you have to do is be good at hitting skill shots. That is the ONLY requirement needed to be good at Ahri. \n\nDue to how fluid her kit is, it gives players an easy time playing on Ahri. Also, unlike binary kits like Garen, she has so much flexibility in her kit that she can adapt playstyles fitting to any game. Most, if not all, matchups against Ahri is skill matchups; albeit those she hard counters. And lets face it, your statistics is taken from Plat+ games... think about how EASY it is for a Plat player to pick up Ahri. If they made it to plat, picking up Ahri and doing well with her is a task that is in no way difficult -- at all. It takes around 15 games playing Ahri to become more than efficient at her. I literally can&#039;t think of any champion that&#039;s so well rounded, easy to use and safe all at the same time that comes even close to Ahri.\n\nSo before you go throwing play rate and winrate around, just remember that she isn&#039;t the ONLY champion to boast good winrate numbers from the time she was made. Those numbers don&#039;t paint the whole picture.\n\nUntil Riot figures out what to do with her Q passive and you aren&#039;t banning her, then you can deal with her till then since she isn&#039;t worth your ban slot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-29T13:26:55.474+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":">Purely a skill shot reliant champion. \n\nExcept you know, her W.","replies":[{"poster":"Brain Errör 404","date":"2017-03-29T13:33:17.730+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Her W nor R are skill shot reliant, however they're not point and click either.

Ahri is doing well but at the same time not overstepping even the lowest line of \"yep thats op\" and her Q movement speed is indeed one of the Problems because it makes her poke and laning phase comparably safe. \nirony has it that the movement speed was originally intended as a nerf but now is amongs the main reasons why she is strong.\nbut sad as it is riot is likely to nerf her exactly because of how well she does lately, sure, winrate and playrate dont paint the whole Picture  there i totally agree, but they on the other hand do make decisive factors whether or not a champion is struck with a buff or a nerf or even a slight change entirely, and ahri is likely to be a target for a nerf i mean NA statistics have her at a 20% playrate, not pick or ban but an playrate, which is essentially THE highest playrate of all midlaners this patch, and to top it off a 54% winrate to These 20% playrates? trust me, she may be in a good spot but These numbers are high, and to riot a definite thorn in the eye thats gonna be milded down.\n\nwhile i disagree on the fact ahri is OP i equally disagree that she is to be untouched. something does Need a slight nerf, nothing big, but something about her Q. maybe make the movement speed scale with Skill Level? from 40 flat at all ranks start at something rather low like 20 at rank 1 and work it up to 40 at rank 5? or increase the decay time for her movement speed? because she has with (i believe) 2 seconds decay for her movement speed a comparably HUGE time wondow to turn around and run.\n\nplus, correct me if im wrong but her W isnt a skillshot, probably why she isnt lee sin lvl difficult to master, since her W is basically homing and auto Targets champions.\n\nanother Problem in my personal opinion would be the duration of her charm, sure, it is low at the first skillranks but it isnt rare to me to see an ahri max her E first in lane or at least put 3 points into it before even the 7 minute mark passed. Sure, her E is rather hard to land compared to her other skills due to it's much thinner and slightly Shorter hitbox, but the duration itself is something that makes an all out against her frustratingly difficult to not just a few. \n\nto your suggestions i can almost entirely agree, her Q passive movement speed is seriously difficult to deal with and it would be optimal for her to have it given a slight scaling that makes her at least a bit more difficult","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-03-29T12:11:35.138+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">another Problem in my personal opinion would be the duration of her charm, sure, it is low at the first skillranks but it isnt rare to me to see an ahri max her E first in lane or at least put 3 points into it before even the 7 minute mark passed.

I'm totally fine with it's cd, the mobillity it gives is the point of the abillity, and ahrie relies on that alot later on, so lowering her acces to that would be not great imo.\nAnother good point for nerfs imo would be her passive, just lower the power vs minions and increases it vs champs like prettymuch all other per target heals do(renekton for example helas only 1/3 on minions with his Q), so Ahrie would have to try and lans her spells on a champ with the passive up for sustain rather than just spaming Q into minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Brain Errör 404","date":"2017-03-29T13:04:03.699+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"You'd nerf her already crappy early game passive? Not to mention people have to stop using the \"once x champion gets ahead\" argument. It's a complete fallacy in itself and for good reason. Ahri has subpar early game trading potential. If you're losing trades early to Ahri on an early game champ, you're doing something wrong. Her Q has a 8 second CD early, you should be abusing that long window of time you have to trade with her once she misses.\n\nShe has to cast around 3 abilities (around 120-180 mana early) to get her passive, THEN burn her ability again (another 75/40 mana) to get her passive. Assuming you have AP runes and you have the standard 30 AP most people get at levels 1-5 Ahri heal grants her 3+2.7x6 (assuming you don't force her to waste her passive) -- this is the equivalent of popping a health pot. So lets say you trade at level 3 and she starts spamming skills to get this heal for it to be meaningful; she'll end up shoving wave to your tower and have no mana before she hits level 4. I highly doubt 25 hp every 40 seconds is something to really be complaining about, since you generally get more from passive HP regen anyways. And that's only IF she has a full wave of minions to hit. If she lets the wave build up to where she has around 12-15 minions to hit for a juicy 50-70 hp recovery, then she just played it well and should be rewarded for it anyways.\n\nHer numbers don't need any tweaking. If you move anything around, it could potentially put her into a real balance issue state. As I've stated above, working with CDs and the movement speed Q are the only thing riot has to touch.

Did you stop to think the items were the problem? Giving champions free damage so to speak? \n\nSay Ahri doesn't get Ludens, doesn't run Thunderlords, or buy a protobelt. Her R and W by itself will not kill anyone.\n\nThunderlords adds roughly what? 250-300 damage, Ludens adds about 150 - 200 damage. And Protobelt adds upwards of 350 damage give or take.\n\n250 + 175 + 325 = 750 damage, not taking into Magic Pen for simplest terms.\n\nWith those 3 items/spells alone, that is literally half of the work done for a champ like Ahri. Then when she R > Ignites > W > R > Q > R - There is the rest of the damage.\n\nSee, you have to look at it from both sides. The items are what breaks champions 80% of the time, not the champion itself.\n\nAnd as for her passive, she has to use multiple spells before she get's access to it. Renekton for example, has it on a 12? second CD. There is a big difference.  And early game it only heals for like 50-60 health every 2-3 minion waves?\n\nLater in the game i have to agree it might heal a bit too much., But then again, she is right in the middle of a fight.

Not to mention that she's also horrible when behind. She's not op by a longshot, only when she's fed, but so are a lot of other champions. If Ahri doesn't get fed and you force her to teamfight you pretty much win the game.\n\nPeople also say her mobility is an issue. That mobility is traded for damage.

She has utilize three dashes in conjuction with two skill shots. You also have to find ways to burst and pick off important targets in fights, which is incredibly hard to do if the enemy team has good cc/peel.

As I've said, once you hit Plat+ (where most statics are taken into account) you have to understand that certain champs simply aren't that hard.

This makes it a lot less inaccessible early (but still giver her it nonetheless), but still makes it really good come mid game when she has less mana problems. Though, I guess that might be your accessibility issue. So, to clarify: \n\nAs for my proposal, most people who wants the MS buff tied to the ulti isn't saying to \"put it on R\", but rather include the passive Q MS buff to the ulti itself.
