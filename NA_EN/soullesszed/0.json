Q and W... The argument is that W shouldnt be able to provide 2 procs for electrocute (agreeable)\n\n\nThis post kinda discusses his issues:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IpY4Xc8s-feedbackanalysis-how-to-fix-serious-power-curve-issues-with-lethality-and-how-to-fix-zed-all-elos","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Gragas","date":"2018-09-16T06:12:01.522+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because Zed's counterplay is standing under turret after he hits 6, its not interactive at all.

They need to make him more interactive during his laning phase and that is about it. the only interaction currently is you dodging his skills and waiting for him to go all in.

If you are, the ONLY reason Zed should be able to beat you is if he gets fed off of your teammates. Even then, that's NOT on him. That's on your teammates for being literal fucking acorns. If your earlier \"points\" are so true, shouldn't everyone struggle against him? Should he not have a 100% banrate and a 100% winrate when he's not banned?\n\nShouldn't all Zed mains be in Challenger because they just roflstomp the poor enemy mage and proceed to steamroll over their team?\n\nShouldn't Zed be the number one picked champion in ALL Elos? In Bronze-Silver, where nobody knows how to play against him, so Zed absolutely demolishes people like you, or Gold-Plat, where people have a better idea how to play against him, but still struggle due to their teammates not knowing how to play against him, or Diamond-Challenger, where he's absolute shit because EVERYONE knows how to play against him up there, and the top champions played are mostly M A G E S?\n\nShouldn't Zed be a Pick/Ban in Pro-Play if he's SOOOO dominating just like... oh shit, M A G E S HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST FEW SEASONS?\n\nShouldn't your points apply GLOBALLY?\n\nIf so, why DON'T some people struggle against Zed?\n\nWhy ISN'T Zed at 100% winrate and banrate?\n\nWhy AREN'T ALL Zed mains in Challenger?\n\nWhy ISN'T Zed the number one picked champion in ALL Elos?\n\nWhy ISN'T Zed a dominating pick/ban in Pro-Play?\n\nWhy DON'T your points apply GLOBALLY?\n\nBecause the problem is with you. The player. Not just YOU in particular, but most people in low elo who DON'T know how to play against Zed.\n\nRun Resolve Secondary, with Barrier. Play champions who give Zed a hard time like Vlad, or Annie. Get Stopwatch ASAP and rush Seeker's, into Tabi's. This early game denial is so strong it will force Zed to either roam to get kills, or you'll have to fuck up MONUMENTALLY for him to get him a kill. Once you get Zhonya's. Don't let Zed push you in. His Qs deal SIGNIFICANTLY less damage through minions. Stay out of range of his W, or try to bait it out so you have 22 seconds of free reign over midlane (huh, that rhymed). There's a myriad of options. \n\nDon't look to Riot to nerf him 6 ft under just so you don't have to see him again. Look to high-elo players who stomp Zed. Look at what they run, what items they rush, how they play. Take what they know and apply it to YOURSELF. You won't get better at the game if everything you hate gets gutted. You'll only get better if you can beat everything you hate as they are. The stronger they are, the more of a challenge it'll be. Zed's in a decent spot right now. He's not as absurd as Season 6, while not as dogshit as he was in Season 7. Now would be the IDEAL time to beat Zed.\n\nAnd Zed's main complaint is his damage. THAT'S what people think is making him strong. The truth is, even if Zed's damage was nerfed, people will STILL find shit to complain about, like his W, or his R, or his E. It's not his damage that's the issue. It's peoples' refusal or flat out denial of counterplay that makes him so \"strong\". People refuse to build armor. People refuse to go Resolve. People refuse to get Stopwatch early. Then Zed takes advantage of that and absolutely decimates them.

None of your most played champions, as far as I can see, are ideal for dealing with Zed as a Support. If anything, Zed can actually easily play around your champs and get to his target. You have a few champions (mostly tanks) which work, but they aren't one of your more played champions. That's probably why you're having a hard time as Support with Zed. With mid, since you're mostly a Support Main, you aren't as proficient in Mid-Lane as a proper Mid Main. I'd know because I was there as well. I started out as a Lux Support, and eventually moved into Mid Lane with Ahri and then Zed. But I wasn't as good at Mid (or Zed/Ahri for that matter) as I was with Support.\n\nReported? For what? Calling you out on your post? Alright. I've got nothing to lose at this point.

But I've changed to support lately because of all this crazy snowball damage fest of a game.\n\nExcept... most of them were?\n\nI've also barely played this year due to balance. Also due to the game simply not being very fun (mechanically, that is. Nexus Blitz and Odyssey are really fun). \n\nAnd there's another issue that might have some effect on why you hate Zed so much. Your champions simply aren't that good against him. You don't have to really change who you play Support generally-- but you should consider picking Janna, Lulu, or even Nautilus or Tahm Kench if you see a Zed on the enemy team and your team isn't already equipped to deal with him (e.g. heavy CC from Jungler, good bruiser Top to duel, someone who can push Zed in at Mid). \n\nZed's runes and Duskblade have been nerfed. Duskblade's gonna become an exclusive with Stormrazor. A lot of the champions who used to do well against him still do, with a couple of exceptions (i.e. Liss and Brand, who come to mind).\n\nBut Zed WAS legitimately a stupid OP champ a few years ago. He was ABSOLUTELY absurd in Season 6, and many Zed mains claim Season 5 (and 3) as the BEST season(s) for Zed (despite the Tank Meta in S5), and you know us Zed mains. Never satisfied unless Zed is ridiculously broken, right?\n\nI digress. Perhaps your switch from roles had SOME effect on your playstyle? It's happened to a few of my friends. One of them, who mains Jungle, wasn't very familiar with playing mid on anyone aside from Veigar and Ryze (i.e. spam bois). He eventually got better, but still makes some key mistakes whenever he plays Mid because he's not a Mid Main. \n\nI have a sinking suspicion that your Support Playstyle clashes with your Mid Playstyle, and this has SOME effect on your fighting against Zed. Especially considering your main champions of Lux, Nami, and Morg, who generally play more passively in lane until they see an opportunity for a good Q, which isn't as effective as a playstyle against Zed in Mid as someone like Vlad or Kayle, who play more aggressively against Zed and have a few safety measures to fall back on in case something goes wrong (albeit Kayle's W isn't as useful as Vlad or Zed having their Ws up in the event of a gank from the enemy JG).","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2018-09-19T02:42:58.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are not true.\n\nI know my main champs for support don't do well against him.
