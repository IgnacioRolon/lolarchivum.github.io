Please help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 Days ago i began having some weird issues with the game. The client took more than 3 minutes to authenticate me and after i finally logged in, the game wouldn't display my profile, my missions, wouldn't let me create a lobby, accept invites, etc. Obviously i googled the problem, got linked to the connection issues section from riot, changed my dns, restarted my router, computer, used the repair tool and completely preinstalled the game, which at the end kind of helped me. I could play now. Thought i've fixed it forver, except that i was wrong. Now 2 days later me, a friend of mine from the same country (Bulgaria) have the same problems, except now it's worse. After loading for ages into the game and waiting more than 20 minutes for features like creating a lobby to work we managed to get into champion select and guess what.. we couldn't see any champions. So that's a 6 minute punishment for my friend. Few hours later we try again, the problem seems to be fixed now, we get into another champion select and now we cannot ban any champions... (The ban button is grey and seems like everything else is frozen) And after a short delay boom 10 bans suddently appear. Then it's time for us to lock, we cant even do that properly. My friend had chosen yasuo (ofc) and the game didnt let him press lock so he picked ahri and somehow locked in cho'gath??? Anyways what im trying to say is that i really need some help, i ran out of ideas how to fix it and the other \"stuck on authenticating\" threads dont seem to help. Another interesting thing is that when i open the league client, i see 3 league clients open in the tast manager, not sure if that's supposed to happen.\n\nBut yeah here's more info.\nMe and my friend are both Bulgarian, but we use different Internet providers. Also i had another guy complain that he  faces the same problems, but for much shorter than us (also uses different internet provider)\n\nWhen we managed to get in game there was a massive delay sometimes and everything used to freeze and afterwards you could see just everything happening at once (definitely packet buffering or packet loss, not FPS drops), but our ms was consistently low (30-40 ms)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-29T22:39:08.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you've mentioned going through the connection article already, but this is definitely sounding a lot like some kind of connection issue. It may not have anything to do with your network perse, but more along the lines of packet loss which essentially means that the data coming from your network is getting corrupted before it hits our servers. Let's check for that really quick using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Try to grab a screenshot of what it says so that we can go over it together!","replies":[{"poster":"Galekin","date":"2017-06-30T13:20:05.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are my network logs for the past 3 days.

There's a chance that the packet loss is the root issue here, and I know a lot of EU players have been having issues with certain ISP nodes.

Let's say that there is coming to the data corruption in my network. My question is what can I do about it? \n\nSometimes I get to the client fairly normal. I can make custom game a bit lag here and there, but I don't mind that. The biggest issue for me its... normal ping, normal MS.. and I still get some lag or delayed animations in the game.\n\nI will get so logs later today.\n\nThank you for your help. :)","replies":[{"poster":"V4L","date":"2017-06-30T12:00:42.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Galekin,\nIt turns out the problem is on RIOT's side.
