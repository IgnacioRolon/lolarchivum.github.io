On the other hand Kindred seems to not like the shadow isles since they can&#039;t claim the souls. Does this mean that they will play a big role in this year&#039;s Harrowing? \n\nI also noticed in Kindred&#039;s splash that the person they are on top of had a crown on their head that fell off when they hit the ground.

They have the motive (death probably isn't a fan of undeath), and almost certainly have the power.

Kindred likely hate the Shadow Isles for perverting the natural order of life and death, but they're busy dealing with day-to-day death. I can see Kindred attempting to hunt down the undead of the Shadow Isles in their downtime, but they wouldn't prioritize Bilgewater as a whole.
