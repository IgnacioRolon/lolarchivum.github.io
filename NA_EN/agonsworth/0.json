I recently bought my first gaming laptop and I am very excited to be finally playing LOL. My issue is that when I have the game in fullscreen or borderless mode, my FPS drop from my capped 120 FPS to 30 FPS every 30-45 seconds. It does this cycle repetitively throughout the match. However, when I run it in windowed mode, I have no problems what so ever. Its kind of annoying to tun in windows mode though. My drivers are all up to date. My computer has a GTX 1080 gpu, 32GB of ram, and is running the I7-6700. Any ideas why this is is happening?
