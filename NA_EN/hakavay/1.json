Then there&#039;s Teemo, who has never been viable for competitive play.  I realize if you try hard enough you can find a video or two of him in a game but if we&#039;re being serious we know those are extreme outliers.  \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have the answer as to the necessary changes but it would be great for the Swift Scout to be viable in competitive play.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bardic Gay","date":"2016-07-27T02:02:09.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a snowball's chance in hell. Teemo's core gameplay is built around non-interaction and is extremely binary by nature. not to mention shrooms discourage risky plays, which means he is against the riots vision for lcs. Trynd is pretty much in the same camp. Their core thematic idetities are tied to fundamentally unhealthy mechanics, so reworking them without those abilities would only garner the ire of the playerbases.","replies":[{"poster":"Almighty Teemo","date":"2016-07-27T11:20:20.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet this is exactly why they should rework those champions. Riot chose the lazy approach and nerfed to hell champions that were considered toxic instead of solving the problem and reworking them.\n\nYou are right about Teemo's kit promoting non-interaction. But their vision of the lcs is even worse. I don't see why players should clear waves over and over again and play team deathmatch in mid and late game. This is uninteractive, and is worse than Teemo's kit. At least Teemo is not consistently picked in the lcs. The lcs portrays this lack of interaction by making professionals play in front of a large audience.\n\nPersonally as a Teemo main I would be glad to see him reworked. This at least shows that riot cares about Teemo's playerbase. He got ignored and his kit is outdated. Them ignoring Teemo infuriates me more than if they were to rework him. Many more mains feel the same.","replies":[]}]}]}
