I remember people arguing that he was actually better post rework because he can farm more safely &amp; efficient but from what I can tell that&#039;s rubbish.  \r\n\r\nAnyone else still feeling the sting from the Veigar rework?  I miss everything about playing him, he great lines, that laugh, his play but it is so frustrating pretending his stun is in any way reliable.\r\n\r\n - Veigar is dead.

All I wanted was for him to still be a niche pick: underrated but very powerful. Now he is a nearly instant lost lane with a horrible pick rate, whose popularity is below Urgot's and whose ban rate is nearly 0%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AhhShucks","date":"2015-05-21T21:20:57.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing him a lot lately. He seems pretty decent. He has some matchups that used to be skill matchups that are now just bad, like Yasuo or Zed.

The ability to both poke and farm with Q in the same cast is pretty significant. There are more advantages to Q being a skillshot than disadvantages.\n\nWhen you catch a team in your stun, or another person's CC, your new Q allows you to burst 2 targets, or a squishy behind a tanky target without having to get to close.\n\nHis W hit's harder than most ultimates in the game, It absolutely should not be more reliable. A weaker and more reliable W wouldn't be any fun. Half the fun of Veigar is getting to that late game where Q-W can just blow up a squishy ADC all on their own from full health.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2015-05-22T06:49:55.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can tolerate the E delay by itself, but I despise the fact that Veigar's W is still reliant on it.\nDark Matter should be changed so that it can be used effectively by itself (without CC— ex: larger AOE, shorter delay, etc.), or it should be reworked entirely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-05-21T20:45:31.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"your mad u cant insta stun anyone anymore , now you know how i feel about zileans stupid worthless rework","replies":[{"poster":"SirPacifista","date":"2015-05-23T20:16:49.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why are you angry against Veigar player and dont make a threat your own for zilian? quit shitty from you to flame the op\n> your mad u cant insta stun anyone anymore\n\nhe didnt do anything against you or zilian.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2015-05-21T20:44:46.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am still bitter about the Soraka rework","replies":[]},{"poster":"jDVL20eCYs","date":"2015-05-23T20:39:18.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is ok if you want to play him and master him he is totally fine","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trídent","date":"2015-05-23T20:24:02.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main Veigar... and I really hope he gets a good rework.... ;/","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-05-22T06:39:00.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post 6 Veig is a terror for my main man Vlad","replies":[{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-05-22T09:43:56.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrNova,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dB36ljEV,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-05-22T06:39:00.450+0000)\n>\n> Post 6 Veig is a terror for my main man Vlad\n\n......... what do you do stand in his meteors or something?\n\nno way in hell should vlad be losing to new veigar unless you somehow got to a point where he can literally one shot you with ult, because even if you fuck up and can't get out of the stun hitbox in time you can just press W.","replies":[{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-05-22T14:56:50.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"POST 6.

Otherwise, he would never see a buff again and every time he started looking strong, he would get nerfed. \n\nI do feel the Veigar rework has a minor problem and it is his Event Horizon visual delay. I feel the delay should remain the same between casting and it taking effect, but I feel the visual for the opponent should be reduced slightly. Much like Cho Gath's Rupture, where there is a delay between the cast and the visual appearing. \n\nThis would require Veigar to still be more calculated about how he wanted to use Event Horizon, but makes it a bit less easy to escape with mobile champions.","replies":[]}]}
