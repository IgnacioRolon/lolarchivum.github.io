Everyone hates the new Veigar's stun.  There are aspects we like, nerfs we are *ok* to accept, but in a couple days NO ONE is going to be playing Veigar.  I'm trying, I honestly am, but it is like playing with a built in 400 ping.  If Veigar was in fact broken before in an OP manner, why wasn't he seen in competitive play?  He works just fine with the current meta (minus crap mobility.)  The reason: because even with that stun he had plenty of counters.\r\n\r\nIf Veigar needs changes then fine, but toss him back into PTR for your feedback so we can continue to use him as a viable champ.","replies":[{"poster":"AHeroNamedHawke","date":"2015-02-26T18:36:10.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar was seen in competitive play\n\nPrimarily support abusing his broken ass E","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agidyne","date":"2015-02-26T18:03:31.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that keeps Veigar, Rammus and Fiddlesticks from Competitive play is that they need to max out everything in their kit before they are powerful.\n\nOne of the main things Mages are picked for is Waveclear.\n\nThat's the #1 in competitive play, just look at the champions picked all the time.\n\nVeigar needs to max out his W to have access to it, but W usually gets maxed last.\n\nIf he doesn't max Q, he doesn't get any Poke or AP.\n\nIf he doesn't max E, he can't land W on champions.\n\nIf he doesn't max W, he can't wave clear.\n\nWhile this is not as bad with Rammus and Fiddles, because they only need 2 spells to be effective and therefor are very good in High elo SoloQ.\n\nThings are different with Veigar, Veigar needs to be level 15 before he becomes trully strong.\n\nWhich most of the time, it's already too late in competitive play.","replies":[]}]}
