It doesn&#039;t actually say my FPS dropped, but it&#039;s clearly dropped considering my screen doesn&#039;t show what&#039;s going around for like 0.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nI do not know if this would occur if playing with Jayce.\r\n \r\nHe doesn&#039;t need to be switching forms on my screen for the freeze to happen, which makes it even worse.\r\n\r\nI have a lenovo laptop, 2.13 gHz processor, intel graphics card, 4gb ram and generally run league at 30-40 fps, 15-20 in teamfights\r\nAdd 10 if I set the game to high priority on the Task Manager. (the bug accurs on both normal priority and high priority)","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2016-11-28T20:07:32.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was fixed in patch 6.22.
