When these problems started occurring (which was july 4th in my case) I immediatly went that link you had sent me and done every single step provided to fix the issue, problem is like me and the others are facing is none of these fixed the load in/black screen of death followed by the network error. If there is anything else on our end that we can do please let us know. but for now i will take it being safe to say that this issue is on riots side of the servers connections not ours...  thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-07-07T02:51:09.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand where your frustration is coming from, especially if you've tried every single step there.

As you may notice, there are multiple posts regarding this issue, and the only feedback anyone has given is \"it might be a server connection issue.\" The problem is I haven't done anything different, or tried to change anything, but it will allow me back into games for maybe two or three games, then this issue will start again. It was especially frustrating when I personally bought a skin boost for a few friends, and suddenly I can't connect to a game. I only ask Riot to take a look with some many people from so many regions to see if there's anything wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Red Ryu","date":"2015-07-07T03:31:05.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=NZfBhApx,comment-id=001400000001,timestamp=2015-07-07T02:51:09.502+0000)\n>\n> I completely understand where your frustration is coming from, especially if you've tried every single step there.
