Since the cycle ends tomorrow, does that mean that I missed out on PBE and I can only get on tonight and play, or will I also be able to use PBE for the new cycle starting tomorrow?\r\n\r\nSorry if it sounds like a dumb question, I just have never been picked for PBE before and it would be depressing if I missed out on it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-08T22:13:01.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey botomb! \n\nNot a silly question at all! \n\nYou won't be missing out on PBE, you'll be able to log in and test the new 6.6 content that just hit PBE today! (Meowkai tho. \\*-*)\n\nThe wording around cycles is kind of weird, and I apologize. Once you're accepted into PBE, you're in for the long haul, unless, of course, you show negative/toxic behavior. So, if you aren't a jerk (you seem nice!), you're welcome to stay and test out the new content! ^-^ \n\nThat said, **welcome to the PBE**! \n\nWe have **[PBE boards](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/)** where you can find info on the latest content, as well as leave feedback and talk to other players!  There's also a beta **[bug report tool](http://pbr.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/pbe/en_BE/bugReport/create)** where you can report any issues you're encountering. \n\nLastly, **Lunar Revel** made an **[amazing post](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/G2h6QTbN-useful-information-for-new-pbe-players)** that entails all the info you'll need to survive the PBE! \n\nIf you have more questions 'bout the PBE, please feel free to poke me, or even add me on PBE! (Same name as on here.)\n\nEnjoy! ^-^","replies":[]}]}
