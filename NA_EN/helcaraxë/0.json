This has happened before and to fix it I turned off game dvr (I have the latest version of windows, and turning off game dvr seemed to help other people), but now the screen flicker is back. As well as flickering, I am often disconnected from games, even in practice tool. I have rebooted my computer, uninstalled and reinstalled league, turned game dvr on and off again, but nothing is fixing this?\r\n\r\nIs it a graphics card problem? I doubt it as this problem is only a problem for league and not other games (My laptop runs smite, portal, etc fine).\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help me out here","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T04:52:20.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Game DVR does cause a lot of problems when it turns itself back on, so do make sure that is disabled, but I'm thinking this might be more driver related off the top of my head. Check to be absolutely sure that all of your drivers were fully updated, but I would for sure check out the other steps in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as a precaution. It might be worth it to reset your config settings also to make sure there isn't a weird resolution mismatch going on too.","replies":[{"poster":"Helcaraxë","date":"2017-12-29T06:38:29.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I updated all my drivers (there were a lot out of date), and it seems to work now.
