I&#039;ve left games on my old accounts a few times a season and I was never really punished.\r\n\r\nEveryone has to AFK a game once in a while.\r\n\r\nFast forward to Season 8 I&#039;m on a different account, after exactly 50 ranked games I left one game. ONE GAME. \r\nI got placed in low priority 20 minute queues for 5 games.\r\n\r\nThat is ridiculous, is it not? I had one AFK game and now I have to wait a total of 100 minutes to play 5 league games.\r\n\r\nThe system is flawed. I didn&#039;t get a warning like you used to get for an AFK game. Not even a 5 minute priority queue. Straight to the dreaded 100 minute wait to play this game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure the people at Riot are so egotistical to think that they can make people wait to play their stupid game.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2018-11-05T22:33:44.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You skipped through all the other tiers of punishments and went straight through the 20 minute one?
