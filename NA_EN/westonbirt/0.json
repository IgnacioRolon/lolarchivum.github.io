Most guide you&#039;ll find recommend getting him one, two sometimes three mana potions at the start. For a reason, he uses mana like he uses oxygen. This is a serious oversight.","replies":[{"poster":"urgotdangit","date":"2015-11-11T18:02:53.808+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I JUST CAME HERE TO POST EXACTLY THIS. \n\nI play  a LOT of Urgot (probably too much, honestly.) He has middle of the road starting mana, scaling, and regen, but probably uses more mana than possibly any other champ in the game. Also notably absent from that list of compensation: Yorick. Somebody forgot these two gents are VERY thirsty. Oh, and Manamune costs more now. Makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-11-12T05:10:54.999+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Also notably absent from that list of compensation: Yorick\n\nI think that's on purpose.\n\nRiot is trying to pretend he doesn't exist until the eventual (as they keep telling us...) rework.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Urgot2BKiddinMe","date":"2015-11-12T04:57:18.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank god someone posted it first.
