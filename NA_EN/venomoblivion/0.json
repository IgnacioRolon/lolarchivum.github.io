HELP!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am running on Dell Inspiron 3558\n\n\nGPU: nvidia geforce 920m\n\nCPU: intel core i5-5200u cpu@2.20ghz\n\nMemory: 4gb ram (3.91gb usable)\n\nResolution: 1920x1080, 59hz\n\nDriver version: 372.54\n\nOperating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro\n\nPatch 6.16 hehexd\n\n\nFor around 3 days ive been looking for a solution. A few weeks back, I was playing a 1v1 and my fps was like the usual 100+ on low settings, after i got the driver update from nvidia. (I still dont know if this is the cause). My fps started to cap at 60. The in-game settings show that my fps is \"UNCAPPED\". All of the discussions and suggestions online is for me to turn off V-Sync from nvidia control panel which i have done. I am 100% sure that it is off. I play other games like CS:GO and i have the same problem with fullscreen capping my game at 60fps. But when i change my game to windowed it then works and goes on with the normal fps which is 100+. At first i dont mind playing with 60 capped fps. But in big teamfights, sometimes the fps can drop to 20 below which is very uncomfortable for someone who usually plays with 100+ fps. Ive seen some people say its my monitor only having 60 hz refresh rate, but i dont think its the problem. Ive had this montior for a while and before this issue, ive been playing with this 60hz refresh rate monitor and i was playing on a smooth 100 fps. Please note that this happens to all my games, league of legends ( which i care about the most), and CS:GO. Note: My fps is capped at 60 as if vsync is on, but its actually off. So my fps most of the time stays at 60 and not jumps to 61 or 57 or 58 so its definitely not my rig. Help me out please. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"XxXMilfHunterXxX","date":"2016-08-31T03:54:50.540+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"I found the solution... open the xbox app and turn off dvr, enjoy :)","replies":[{"poster":"Big Shero","date":"2017-02-02T07:56:10.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude U are A HEro <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlyDoge44","date":"2017-01-28T00:44:03.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY MAN IT WORKS!!!!
