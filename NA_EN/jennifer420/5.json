Your lack of consistency makes me sad.\n\n>the fact that riot employees can call all males crybabies on twitter and no official statement is given.\n\nIf memory serves, they got fired. Isn't that sad...for them?\n\n>the fact that i as a female feel disgusted by the stuff that happened at pax with riot still saying \"we stand behind our decisions at pax\"\n\nIt's sad that you think your gender matters in any way, shape or form\n\n>that is a sign that lol is slowly dying. and it is sad. cause i love this game.\n\nPeople have been claiming that league is dying since season 2.

However It's enormously easyer to detect flaming rather than inting. but that doesn't mean that punsihments for inting never happen.
