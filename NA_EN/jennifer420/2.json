I dominated 3 games in a row walking straight to my promos. Then I got 2 team in which my teammates were on an 11 and 4 game lose streak or dieing 3 times before the jungler even finished his second buff. Then after those game I got a game where I could have went afk and would still win as my team was far superior in all things.\nThe skill gaps between plat players right now is very big and awkward. I would say climbing out of it without being something like high dia or higher is based on playing way more games then usual as you will most likely climb but it will take way longer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"boltactionpanda","date":"2019-09-02T05:24:55.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro gold in NA is not easy.
