I can&#x27;t imagine what would have happened if his/her account was permanently banned? :O Which is understandably a bigger stress for anyone.\n\nWhat you're missing is that what leads people to suicide varies, and is never *just* one thing. It's a pile of things that build on each other. While being permabanned may be a huge stress inducer for some people (because of the effort/money put into the account), it could be a huge stress reliever for others (because they have a way to move on instead of feeling tied to their investment of effort/money). \n\nWhat is nearly universal with people suffering suicidal levels of depression is the feeling that everyone/everything would be better off if they were dead.  It may be a thought about how their life insurance money could help their family, or it could be feeling like their very existence is a burden on their loved ones. \n\nThis is where \"kys\" comes in. \"Kill yourself\" feeds into their perception that *literally everyone* would be better off if they just died. After all, if *you* think you're completely worthless waste of resources **and** strangers think you're completely worthless and should die, then obviously you must both be right! (And of course family members just lie to you because they don't want to hurt your feelings) \n\n> Ps.: I hope things got better since then!\n\nThey have, thankfully! It has been a long, slow process. There was a time when they tried some medication that ended up making things worse for a time (I don't recall if this incident was in the middle of that or not). In the last year or so they've been removed from a lot of the stress inducers in their life (like living paycheck to paycheck), moved to a more peaceful place (not on a main street), got on some new medication (which really opened their eyes to \"wow, thinking about suicide once or twice a week isn't normal\" as they've moved past that), switching what games they play (less League, and if they do play League mostly ARAMs) and they're pretty optimistic about the future right now. They've got different stress inducers in their life (a baby, finishing a college degree, figuring out financing on a home), but it feels like they might be out of the woods now.\n\nStill, you can imagine why both of us still take \"kys\" extremely seriously as a result of what happened.

So it's one personal experience vs another one.\n\n> After all, if you think you're completely worthless waste of resources and strangers think you're completely worthless and should die, then obviously you must both be right! \n\nIf you are permanently banned it's shown, that you are overly toxic and you are in the 0,06% of the most hated players in the LoL community. I think saying that you are the worst trash of the community and nobody wants to play with you even online, ensures me more in my uselessness feeling, than ONE person telling me this.

Are we having a fake conversation just because it's being carried out with text messages online instead of being spoken face to face? Does empathy for others have to die when you can't see or hear their reaction to what you say?\n\nOn emotional level my real life ends when i talk with people who knows nothing about me. Since they do not know me, they have no base to judge me on any level, so emotionally i do not care what they say. On the logical level it never ends, since we are having a discussion, sharing ideas, forming our and each other's view all the time. But if you would tell me, that i'm ugly and useless, when you do not know anything about me, i would simply ignore your statement, and not give a fck about it. If you back up what you say with anything objective, i would think about it.\n\n> It's not in my nature to try and put someone down like that, and I wouldn't much like the results even if I succeeded.\n\nKind of expected this, but you should not worry about this when i specifically asked you to do it :D\n\n> Hopefully I've at least helped you see where I'm coming from, and why I disagree with people that saying things like \"kys\" is OK. Maybe you'll even agree with me after this.\n\nYes, i think i clearly understand your point. And \"kys\" being bad is not a question. I did never say either that saying \"kys\" to anyone is a good thing. (Yes, i said that i like to get flamed by somebody who i just rekt on lane, but it's still not a \"good\" thing from him to tell me to \"kys\", i just take it well.) I just want to say, that everyone has the right to be an asshole, until it restricts other people to do something. By being an asshole in LoL chat, you do NOT restrict any of the other players to do something what they want. (Chat can be muted, and chat has no gameplay effect, so if you want to mitigate the effect of the flamer it costs you one click.)\n\n\nSo maybe instead of punishing players, who voice their opinion about something/somebody or whatever. Maybe we should not encourage mentally ill people to play competitive online games, where some kind of toxicity is inevitable and then punish the players because somebody else is not mentally capable of distinguishing real life and online bantering. And yes, it sounds bad, but i will say it again: \"Mentally ill people should not play online competitive games with chat possibilities, if they can not distinguish their real life from the online world.\" It would be the best for THEM, since things like you mentioned could not happen. Or if you know that you have mental problems at least turn off the chat...","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-10-10T13:58:48.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So permabans are okay, since for some people it feels good to get permanently banned, and only a part of them would kill themselves for it?\n\nBreaking the rules should result in some punishment, or else the rule exists for no reason. In cases where it's impossible to judge another person's capacity to cope with the punishment (AKA: where you can't have a trial or bring more evidence forward) then the punishment should be the same for all who break the rule. \n\nYou can argue whether permabans should exist at all, and you can suggest other punishment systems, but that would be a subject for another thread.\n\n> If you are permanently banned it's shown, that you are overly toxic and you are in the 0,06% of the most hated players in the LoL community.\n\n*\"Because a player-triggered review found your in-game comms extremely inflamitory and offensive, your account has been permanently suspended.\n\nYou are among 0.006% of players negative enough to be permanently banned.\n\nOther players judged your comms to be far below the standards of the League community. The vast majority of players agree that while League's an intense, competitive game, everyone deserves respect on the Rift.\"*\n\nI don't see anything in there suggesting \"hated\", \"trash\", \"useless\", or that no one wants to play with them. Just that their comms are way below standard. \n\n> But of course it's always a strange thing to try to use logic in the thinking of a mentally ill person O.o\n\nYeah...\nThere is a trail of logic for them, it's just got some twists in it. \n\n> I understand that ONE personal experience can turn a person to think this, a lot of people believe in bearded imaginary friends in the heaven as well, after surviving a near death experience, but that does not make them right.\n\nFirst, my experience represents a scenario in which 1) I was in the game with the person told \"kys\" 2) the person in question had suicidal levels of depression 3) things were weighting particularly hard on that person that day 4) I was in a position to stop them. It's being told to you because 5) I feel comfortable sharing it 6) I think it's important to share 7) I happen to be on the Boards often enough to see threads where people try and defend \"kys\" 8) I happen to think the particular poster is reasonable enough that talking about it might change their mind.\n\nYou could swap out some of those points (4 could be swapped with the person died, 7 could be replaced with talking to a reporter instead of the Boards) but in general all of them need to happen for the issue to be noticed. \n\nSecondly, if you doubt being told to kill yourself by strangers can contribute to suicide, then I suggest you talk to mental health specialists or professional counselors. This would be in their area of expertise, and would make them far more qualified to talk on the subject.\n\nThird, and without getting too far off topic, belief in God isn't based on near death experiences and old books. Those most convicted base that conviction on what happens in their lives. To my knowledge there's no scientific theory on \"human subconscious communicating with others without other sensory inputs\", yet that's an experience that happens extremely regularly, and many (myself included) attribute it to God. Science has done many great things to expand our understanding, but it's not complete enough to dismiss God.\n\n> I just want to say, that everyone has the right to be an asshole, until it restricts other people to do something.\n\nAnd everyone hosting a party has the right to kick guests out when they're being overly disrespectful to their other guests. Riot is choosing to exercise their rights.\n\n> Maybe we should not encourage mentally ill people to play competitive online games, where some kind of toxicity is inevitable and then punish the players because somebody else is not mentally capable of distinguishing real life and online bantering.\n\nThe problem isn't exclusive to online games, it's encompassed a lot of the internet. \n\nWe've tried the \"anything goes\" approach with interactions online, and have amassed quite a body of evidence that people are more willing to act inappropriately because they're anonymous. Death threats, rape threats, encouraging suicide, and many more behaviors are just flat out unacceptable - regardless of if it's in League, on YouTube comments, Twitter, where ever. These people wouldn't walk up to random strangers at the mall and threaten to rape them and their sisters - so why are they doing it online? \n\nNo, enough's enough. \"Just don't use the internet\" doesn't cut it in today's world. It's not unreasonable to expect people to display common decency, there's no need to defend those causing problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenixdust","date":"2018-10-10T14:23:34.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Breaking the rules should result in some punishment, or else the rule exists for no reason.\n\nI totally agree with this, but then please nobody tell me that \"we care about suicidal persons\" when with these punishments Rito can push a suicidal person over the edge.

Nobody forces you to watch porn, or endure a flamer's chat. You have every right to cherry pick the parts of the internet you like. But just because YOU DO NOT LIKE porn, the porn sites should not stop existing.\n\nTLDR:\nIn my opinion everyone should be able to do anything (be it bad or good), until it stops other people to exercise this same right. So you should be able to flame, since it does not break the right of other people to not see your flaming. You should have right to be racist in a facebook group, and if somebody does not like that, he wont join that group. You have every right to be a christian, until you start forcing your view on other people. But you also have the same rights to be satanist and try to summon demons IF YOU WANT, and you do not force it on other people.\n\nAnyway, this is just my idea about a good world. This is partially why i argue about punishments for chat related issues. I know that spamming \"kys\" is not good for somebody, but that somebody has the right to ignore it, so imho it should not be punished.\n\nPs.: Please send me the reproducible experiment about \"human subconscious communicating with others without other sensory inputs\", since what you state is true, you can be the next Nobel-prize winner.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-10-10T14:40:17.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Phoenixdust,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=g1E08Kb5,comment-id=00010000000000000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-10T14:23:34.068+0000)\n>\n> Ps.: Please send me the reproducible experiment about &quot;human subconscious communicating with others without other sensory inputs&quot;, since what you state is true, you can be the next Nobel-prize winner.\n\nFirst, reproducible experiment implies that you can control every factor.

It is, sadly, basically a limitation of the available technology in the report system.\n\nI personally encourage you to send a ticket to player support. I don't honestly know if they're allowed to intervene with the automated punishment system in cases like this, and I know they will be unable to tell you if they take action against this particular player do to their privacy policy, but that's going to be the best way to ensure that human eyes see this specific case, and I think that's a good thing due to the weaknesses in the automated detection system when dealing with issues like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-10-10T20:50:39.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hey OP,\n\nI deleted a recent edit you made to your original post.
