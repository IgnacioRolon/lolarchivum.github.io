I didn’t wanted to continue with Heiran, but after seeing Azir… Riot again created an awesome kit that I never thought of and I want this challenge once more. [Prologue: Healing Through Pain]( http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/ZjWoTeMo-prologue-healing-through-pain) )  \n\n-----------\n\n#***Lore***\n***\"If we want the world to change, we have to believe it’ll happen.***\" **- Heiran Maintainer of Restoration**\n\n*\"For many there is a way to live a dream, to become something that one admires most. Unfortunately, Heiran wasn’t someone like that. In fact, he had no choice after all, except accepting his fate given by his father and his ancestors. Heiran is a strong, young boy who determines his priorities not by how strong he is, but how strong he can someone make. *  \n\n*But Heiran wasn’t always like now. He was forced to fight as a warrior, to take the lives of those who were called enemies of his kingdom and ancestors. A never ending war that took his world too long to battle, as many centuries passed by and most have forgotten the reason of fighting. Heiran didn’t believe that he belonged to his world, as death and pain were the only things that his eyes had to admit. * \n  \n\n*Heiran, stubborn as he is, tried to accomplish a technique to heal his allies and even the enemies, instead to continue to wage a war that none could remember how it started. Nonetheless of his truest and best intentions, he could not find anyone who knew such technique. He heard of rumors of a deep cave that leads to a pit of darkness where one will find his final challenge and become one of the strongest warriors in this world. This particular rumor was said to be not true, as many were seeking the challenge, but never came back from their journal to the darkest pit.*  \n\n*Nevertheless, Heiran travelled inside and arrived at the last spot. He couldn’t see his own body nor could he estimate the size of the cave, but a empty feeling claimed his heart and a light source appeared right in front of him. The great light formed to the shape of his appearance and imitated him as best it could. Heiran didn’t attack it, like many would, but tried to communicate friendly. The copy of Heiran somehow disappeared and all what was left was a trail of source that flew into Heiran’s body easily. \"*\n\n*Bad news, Heiran’s homeworld did not accept his unlocked powers of healing because the civilization accomplished the rule that honor lies in death and killing for its own country. Heiran lost hope when he finally had to admit that he, no matter what he did, could never belong to the world he was born into. Until the League heard his plea and summoned him to the Fields of Justice. *”\n\n-------\n#***Appearance***  \n(I made the picture long time ago)  \nhttp://halfsteps-neverworld.deviantart.com/art/Heirus-the-Blade-of-Reversion-433637344  \n(Please click on the picture if you want to be redirected to DeviantArt and its Creator)\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n#***Champion Explanation***\n\n* *Heiran (No real origin – fictional by me) is a 26 years old young man who, though seems to be young, is wise and calm, although sometimes he can be a hothead when he gets annoyed/angry.*  \n* *Heiran’s ancestors were great warriors who fought for the kingdom since many generations, some say that it needs ones whole life to even name all of their names. Although Heiran should be a honorable warrior like his past generations, he turned different. He began to question the need of this war – As his father could not answer him, Heiran knew that the war has been waged too long enough.  *  \n* *The reason why Heiran became the one today, is mainly because of his thirst of knowledge instead of strength. When he found out that the reason for war between two kingdoms has been forgotten, he tried to figure out ways – ways to show that there are other things than death and despair. Nonetheless, he couldn’t convince anyone, thus gave up on himself and his world. “Fine! Destroy yourselves as you plea!” *  \n* *Heiran was known for his foolishness to heal instead to kill, thus the kingdom’s ruler called for a assassination of Heiran. What Heiran doesn’t know, the assassination didn’t take place as Heiran’s father, nevertheless of the disappointment that Heiran brought to his family, his father fought against the assassinator. Because of this his father has been exiled, and Heiran doesn’t know anything about it as he was summoned shortly after the assassinator has been killed in the attempt of murdering Heiran.  *  \n* *Heiran uses a technique that heals and strengthens his allies by using brute force. Although it seems weird, he channels his hidden power to instead heal and close wounds by slashing with his blade through his allies. He can control that power to overcome instead the enemy when he needs to. *   \n* *Heiran is supposed to be a AD Support. His focus lies in converting AD power into supporting abilities like healing, weakening and buffing. He is best played as Support on bot lane and can, though hardly, be a pain in the ass if played well. *\n\n\n--------------------\n#***Stats***   \nHealth \t425 (+80) \t\nAttack damage \t56 (+3.1)   \nHealth regen. \t7 (+0.78) \t\nAttack speed \t0.625 (+3.1%)   \nMana \t235 (+44) \t\nArmor \t27.5 (+3.1)    \nMana regen. \t7 (+0.55)    \nMagic res. \t28 (+0.40)     \nRange \t135 (Melee) \t\nMov. speed \t345    \n-------\n#***Abilities***\n-----\n#***Innate Passive - 'Compensator ':***   \n *For each **10 Bonus AD** Heiran receives bonus 20 Health*\n------------------------\n#***Q (Basic Attack Reset & Basic Attack Enhancer) – ‘Reversed Resonance ‘:***   \n**On Enemy: ** *For 6 seconds: Heiran’s next three basic attack damage will be increased by **30%/40%/50%/60%/70%** and **1% of the damage done each strike will fill Heiran’s ‘Fragmented Soul’ capacity**.*  \n**On Ally:** *For 6 seconds: Heiran’s next three basic attacks can be made on any ally and it will heal the targeted ally for **50%/55%/60%/65%/70% of his basic attack damage** (**Not counting Critical Strike or On-Hit Effects**)*\n\n* **Mana Cost: **   60/75/80/95/100  \n* **Health Cost:** 5%/6%/7%/8%/9% max health\n* **Cooldown: ** 14.5/13.5/12.5/11.5/10.5\n-----------------\n#***W (Heal) - 'Fragmented Soul '***   \n**Passive: Heiran receives for each stored Fragmented Soul +1 AP & +1 AD. **  \n*Upon activation, Heiran will place a fragmented soul of himself on his current position that can’t be collected by him in the first 1.5 seconds and the fragmented soul will disappear after 4 seconds.*  \n*Each Fragmented Soul will heal ally Champions and Heiran for **1% of their missing health** and grant the collector of it **+1 AD and +1 AP for each** collected Fragmented Soul up to **10/20/30/40/50 stacks**, and lasts for a max of 6 seconds.*    \n**Heiran stores a stack of ‘Fragmented Soul’ every 2 seconds and can store up to 10/20/30/40/50 stacks.   \nThe recharge time is NOT affected by cooldown reduction.**  \n**Fragmented Souls can be faster depleted by holding the button**.\n\n* **Mana Cost: **  None  \n* **Cooldown: 0.5 seconds (Stack Cooldown: 2 seconds)**\n----------\n#***E (Teleportation / Stasis) - 'Cloud of Ecstasy ':***   \n*Heiran targets an ally unit within **550 range** or himself, he immediately disappears and appears at the targeted location. Heiran’s body manifests into a great cloud that surrounds and follows the target ally (or stays immobile if targeted himself) for 1.5 seconds. While as a cloud, ally units receive bonus **+15%/25%/35%/45%/55% movement speed** and enemies are slowed by the same amount, if they get in contact with the cloud.   \n**Heiran can use any ability except Q – ‘Reversed Resonance’**.  *\n\n* **Mana Cost: **  80/85/90/95/100  \n* **Cooldown: ** 19.5/17.5/15.5/13.5/11.5\n------\n#***Ultimate (AoE) - 'Superior Equality':***  \n *Heiran **COPIES** (NOT STEALING) the power of his enemies within 450 range in a 350 range circle. All enemies suffer **150/250/350(+50% Bonus AD) magic damage** and heals Heiran for **20%/25%/30% of the damage done**. *  \n**In addition, one or two of the enemy Champion hit by who has the highest current AD or AP, will transfer *20%/25%/30%* of his current AD or AP to all ally Champions 350 range around Heiran for 4.5 seconds.**\n\n* **Mana Cost: **  100\t\n* **Cooldown: ** 110/100/90\n\n----------------\n\n#***Concept Explanation***\n\nAs you may think, Heiran seems to be a bit overwhelming and I must say… perhaps, but this is somewhat intended.  \nHeiran impersonates the AD Support I longed for. An AD Support who can also play on other lanes, but excels against superior Supports on bot lane too. He can escape danger with his E, he can put up to 50 little buffs on the battlefield that can be picked up by himself again or by his allies, he can deal tremendously great damage with his Q or tremendously heal with it. Ultimately, his Ultimate is one of the best mechanics as it doesn’t just deal damage, it heals Heiran for his sacrifice as fighting as a melee AD Support and additionally supports his allies by giving them bonus AD and AP.\n\n***Innate Passive*** allows Heiran to go for his full itemization as AD Support, but to get health as an compensation for his lack of survivability once the fight starts. \n***His Q*** deals tons of damage in a short time or heals tons of… damage in a short time.  \n***The W*** leaves (like in most games) a little buff on the ground that can be picked up to heal and be buffed.\n***E*** gives him the ability to escape dangerous situations or to surround a ally to boost his movement speed and heal him – His W works pretty fine while as a cloud, dropping the buffs directly to the ally.\n***Last, but not least - The Ultimate***  which can change the course of a fight dramatically. However, the most damage Heiran can deal on a single enemy is about 350-500 – half of this damage, 175-250 will heal him, thus it isn’t very effective when used in a 1v1 situation.\n\nHeiran is strong against bot lane combination that consists of “Heavy AD & Heavy Tank” like Caitlyn & Leona, Lucian & Braum, ecetera.  Heiran is a great AD dealing assassinlike Support who excels only against tanky opponents who can’t deal great damage, but can be abused to draw attention. In the meantime, Heiran can control the battle due to his W to drop supplies for his ally and can heal himself with his Ultimate whenever he is in grave danger.   \nHeiran is weak against strong assassins or burst-like champions who, once get the advantage, can poke him out of the lane or disengage easily.    \n\n------------\n#***Quotes***\n\n**Champion Selection:**  \n*”Only courage in the face of doubt can lead one to the answer.”*  \n\n**Attacking:**   \n*\"We will discuss your intentions later.

Either nerf his passive to oblivion, change it, take away his healing, or completely change his E.  \nI guess you can argue that he doesn't have THAT much CC, but even then, it seems really difficult to lose lane with this champion on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"The Neverworld","date":"2014-08-31T08:46:12.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your feedback! \nWhat I think is necessery is that he needs some sorta defensive stat to withstand. He has no real gap closers, he can be kited away and can't do nothing against.\n\nHis weakness is that he lacks of healing himself. He's not concipated as tank, thus his armor, magic resistance will be pretty low when he goes for a full AD itemization. Another weakness is that he lacks of escape, except that he can use his E on an ally who is further away. His only CC is that he slows with his E. I still think that it is very hard to place all 50 buffs because you need 25 seconds to place all 50 buffs on the ground - and they'll disappear after 6 seconds. You can't place them all at once, because after 1.5 seconds, Heiran is able to collect them while he stands on the same place. This ability is more effective in teamfights, Heiran can walk around and place (similiar to Singed's Q) a trail of buffs for his team to pick up when they are close to die or are getting chased.\n\nI think I'll add to his Q costs \"10% of max health of Heiran\" for no excessive use","replies":[{"poster":"Usernamehere1235","date":"2014-08-31T22:05:33.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds about right.  And to be honest, we do need a defensive Leona in the support meta.  I feel like everyone is limited to either squishy offense, squishy defense, or tanky offense.  I can't really think of a support champion who effectively fills the role of tanky defense.  Also, I'm afraid that this champion might be prone to being picked into \"protect the ADC' comps.  Maybe this is a problem with ADCs, but he seems very strong in that regard.  \nPlus, he should be consumed by the void.  We need a voidy support. :D\nGreat champ idea.

His passive allows you to be tanky by building damage, his fragmented souls seems counter-intuitive, his ult punishes enemies for doing well, and he heals for *so freaking much*. The only truly interesting effect here is the E, and it doesn't really make sense for an AD champion in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"The Neverworld","date":"2014-08-28T22:28:53.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh my gawd, he has 300 Bonus AD! That makes 600 HP! Unkillable!  \n\nFragmented souls counter-intuitive? Go and drop some buffs on the ground - the enemy will know that either you or your marksman will go there - go and grab it before he grabs it.  \n\nUltimate punishes... wait, so a Ultimate shouldn't deal damage at all? You know what 30% of someone's AD or AP is? Let's say enemy Champion has 200 AD - that makes 60 AD. So you basically say, in late game, a Support shouldn't give his allies (who needs to stay close to Heiran) some bonuses? Can't work with that.\n\nHeals \"freaking\" much.. hmm.. one buff heals 1% of someones missing health. Lets say you have 1600 HP and you are at 100 HP - you have 1500 missing health. 1% of missing health is 15 - each picked up buff heals about 15, 10 makes 150, 20 makes 300, 30 makes 450, 40 makes 600, 50 makes 750. Theoretically, nothing's against. The less health you have, the better you gain. However, on paper its 750, but the more health you gain, the lesser missing health you have and it gradually shrinks about to 400-500 health regained with 50 stacks. And who in the world would think that 50 stacks to gather are easy? You need like 10 seconds to get all 50 on the field and in the same time picked up. This is more of a situation used in critical moments or in teamfights. You can place up buffs and let your allies take them whenever they need it in the battle.\n\nE makes sense, you know why? Because he's a Support, not just an AD Champion. Only because he's AD based doesn't mean you can literally force him to have a certain kit, only because its \"nature\" to give an AD Champion an assassin-like or marksman-like ability kit. E lets him literally dash to a ally target and makes himself untargetable. Helps in critical situations and he can heal his targeted ally more easily.","replies":[{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-08-29T01:11:33.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Tanks getting 4k HP is usually uncommon. 15% more HP than the next guy is a pretty big deal.\n\nFragmented Souls *is* counter-intuitive, because you drop 1 or maybe up to 50 souls in a single spot, granting somewhere between 1 and 50 AD/AP. It can be used to grant invisible power to your teammates (use it outside of a fight, then run in and wreck) and it screws with allies in team fights by creating excess visual noise and encouraging weird artificial positioning. Not to mention the casting mechanic is one stack per 0.5 seconds, but an unknown number of stacks per second when you hold the button down.\n\nUltimate not stealing AD and AP =/= Ultimate being useless. I encourage you to look at literally any other ultimate in the entire game of LoL for inspiration. Try taking defensive stats from enemies (like Trundle) or inflicting strong crowd control (like basically every support except Soraka) or *flat* AD/AP reduction (even though that's still not good). Also please try not to represent the arguments of people who disagree with you.\n\nUm, no. He can heal for 90% AD 3 times at his attack speed (Something like 600 HP), 50% of the missing HP of an ally (1% per stack, 50 stacks) with all his stacks and then maybe 50-150 with his ult. His Q literally gives him a maxxed out Soraka Q on a champion regardless of their current HP pool, and he can heal tanks like it's nobody's business. But now that you're talking about weird things (like waiting 10 seconds to drop all fragmented soul stacks, which actually causes *more* problems with your champion) I think you are playing Schroedinger's Champion with me. List out the drop rate at each rank for holding the Fragmented Souls button, because I think it's even more unintuitive than imagined beforehand.\n\nFriend, did you know that champion abilities are designed to synergies within their kits? The draw of an AD champion is that they autoattack, and the draw of a tank is that they tank damage. A tanky AD character should not have an ability that stops them from attacking and also stops them from tanking, because it does not make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"The Neverworld","date":"2014-08-29T07:03:34.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"4K? Can you even read? The max bonus AD someone can get is about 300 (+-) and this means 600 HP. Heiran base stats gives him ~1700 HP - plus 600 is 2300 - that's not 4k. Hell, even some burst mages have about 2300 HP or more.\n\nAgain, can you even read ? If Heiran places one fragmented soul, he can't take them unless 1.5 seconds is over. If, however, he stays on one place to \"let it free\", after 1.5 seconds (or after 3 fragmented souls) he'll continue to gather them when he keeps staying on one ground. Besides, this is just a Custom Champion Concept, not a official Champion. Use your fantasy, there'll be visual validation somehow.\n\nAgain - The Ultimate IS NOT STEALING, ITS COPYING. It says it DRAWS power, not STEALS - It means power will be SHARED. And the Ultimate's name's even \"Superiour Equality\", why should be there a \"equality\" if there is obviously no equality? Superior is an addition because, even if the powers were shared from the enemy alongside to the allies, its still a buff that increases.\n\nFriend, did you know that I'm creating since last year march Champion Concept and I've made like +40 Champions? You obviously have no idea. You come in, you don't ask how it works, you don't give advice how to change - you just keep blabbering that it's OP, only because you can't understand it. IF a Champion has no Gap Closers, you give him a stat to increase his chance. Take Sion for example - The passive that he gets for bonus health by killing will still be in the Reworked version. Take Yasuo for example. He's a Ohmwrecker, he kills people mostly in an instant and has bonus critical strike. Why? Because otherwise his damage spike would be too low in early and probably too weak in late when he lacks of burst or situational finishing moves.","replies":[{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-08-29T18:20:44.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Interestingly enough, most champions do not go full glass cannon with their items, and in fact like to buy tank items when they operate as a tank. Between 3 tank items (~1.5k HP), 2 offensive items (~280 AD), and 1 pair of boots, your champion gets 1.5k + .5k + 1.9k for about 3.9k HP by building like a normal tanky DPS. Since 3900 is pretty darn close to 4000 and I'm not accounting runes/masteries, I'd say that's a fair estimate. *In addition*, even the idea of building damage while gaining tank stats is something Riot Games designers have constantly said they think is bad (it's part of the reason Atma's isn't getting buffed).\n\nI'm going to point out now that your insults are immature, but are also kind of entertaining considering you're accusing people of not understand your champion while not seeming to understand it yourself.\n\nYou have not answered properly to the problems of the number of stacks or the amount of power (we're talking about integer increments of souls between 1 and 50. Do you plan on having a floating number over their head?). But now that I think I understand how your Fragmented Souls drop rate works (you haven't explicitly described it still, so I'm assuming it's just one drop per 0.5s) I have another problem with it -- namely that it's not actually useful. 1 AD per 0.5 seconds with a duration of 6 seconds means 12 AD/AP tops, which is not a good buff for forcing your ally to artificially position for 6 seconds straight. Unless you are implementing some sort of refresh on the timing stacks, which should probably be mentioned in the tooltip of your W.\n\nSo when you said this (bold for emphasis)\n\n> In addition, one or two of the enemy Champion hit by who has the highest current AD or AP, will **transfer **20%/25%/30% of his current AD or AP to **all ally Champions 350 range around Heiran** for 4.5 seconds.\n\nDid you mean the champion would **copy** a percentage of their AD/AP and give that as a buff to Heiran's allies? Because that is definitely not what the tooltip reads as. [Insert reading joke here] With your edits in mind, the ultimate still punishes enemies for doing well and still feels pretty bland, but at least it's not as overpowering as I thought it was!\n\nOh goodness. Appeal to authority is a fallacy (it's also funny considering you placed 4th to my 3rd in the Concept Contest), and besides there is nothing to confirm that those \"+40 Champions\" are any good. If I spray-painted tic tac toe on 40 different walls, I would not be a good graffiti artist. I saw this champion concept was rife with problems of an uninteresting kit, vagueness, anti-synergy, and bad design and I told you about it because those things are true and I think you can do better. I also told you it was overpowered, because that was true. You have failed to actually provide a retort to those complaints outside of handwaving and insulting me (neither of which give you credibility as a designer). Now you have seem to have also forgotten the point of this paragraph, so I will bring it up again for you to respond: The E on this champion does not synergize with the rest of the kit, because it stops him from attacking (as an AD champ) and stops him from tanking (as a tank champ).\n\nIf you would like advice that isn't self-evident, I can give it to you: Rework this champion from the ground-up with a cohesive idea of what the kit is supposed to look like. The abilities should be at least somewhat unique and should be intuitive, and the abilities should synergize with each other and the desired playstyle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
