Almost everything is changed heavily, except his origin from the Shadow Isles. I’ve created a prologue about Tocharian [Rise of the Gravewalker]( http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/34M5OT23-prologue-rise-of-the-gravewalker) but it seems like no one liked it.)  \n\n-----------\n\n#***Lore***\n***\"Foolish mortals denied my conquest once, they won’t again! ***\" **- Tocharian, the Lost Conqueror**\n\n*\"**Tocharian’s** grip of death awaits for foolish mortals who dare to underestimate him. Like an endless curse that Tocharian himself claims his damned soul, he continues his dream of conquest. With frightening six powerful arms and a chariot with demonic creatures on his rein, he is indeed nothing else than the true Conqueror. *  \n\n*The Shadow Isles were not always the land of the rising dead and hollow corpses that is now. The Shadow Isles was once a prosperous land, with a kingdom to call its own nation, but lost and forgotten in time, by both mortals and undead alike. Tocharian, believed to be the most powerful man before the disaster, was a Conqueror, who sought of world domination.  * \n\n*Unfortunately, the last decisive battle could not be won. Tocharian’s pride and greed was too much for one life to endure, thus forced his own people to die in battles that could not be won. He was said to be a Tyrant in the end, and his own men, led by his **General**, hanged Tocharian for his miserable decisions and mischievous destruction of a once so great kingdom.*  \n\n*When Tocharian awoke from the afterlife, he was blessed with nothing but his armor and a malevolent greed to conquer everything and everyone. He conquered parts of Shadow Isles and gained access to powers worthy of a Conqueror and his quest to claim everything for his own. \"*\n\n-------\n#***Appearance***  \nTocharian’s appearance is pretty much similar to the one below. He has six arms. \nhttp://numioh.deviantart.com/art/Nezha-115357984  \n\nTocharian has six swords on his back. Unfortunately, there’s no picture of six swords on someone’s back, but it is like the picture down below.  \nhttp://benedickbana.deviantart.com/art/DemonTower-Guard-with-his-cursed-sword-483059130    \n\nTocharian possesses up to six familiars, all similar to each other. His familiars are fierce spectral wolves.  \nhttp://mayhemcat.deviantart.com/art/Concept-Spectral-Wolf-329412550  \n\nIf Tocharian is in Swords-Mode, he’ll use each sword out of his back and fight with six arms with each one sword holding.  \nhttps://farm2.staticflickr.com/1029/696955263_dd1226de43.jpg  \n\nIf Tocharian is in Chariot-Mode, he’ll drive a Chariot that is led by up to six wolves, similar to down below. Beware that up to six familiars will stay parallel to each other.   \nhttp://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1058610-chariot_16657_lg.gif  \nhttp://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/058/a/e/warhammer_goblin_wolf_chariot_by_samflegal-d5we6z0.jpg  \n\n(Please click on the picture if you want to be redirected to DeviantArt and its Creator)\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n#***Champion Explanation***\n\n* *Tocharian (**Tok-arian**)(**Imagined name by me**) is another cruel creature from the Shadow Isles. He’s the first shadow isles character in the League to wield a sword, six swords to be precisely. His six arms are a devastating fact for every warrior who gazes at his strength. Tocharian is depicted as cruel, but also as a formidable King and Conqueror of the Kingdom that now the Shadow Isles is.*  \n* *Tocharian's familiars have two forms. One is the form they take when they drive the Chariot, the other is the weapon form. They become blades when Tocharian needs them to fight, and materialize into their true form once Tocharian needs their bodies.  *   \n* *If you read Tocharian’s prologue [Rise of the Gravewalker]( http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/34M5OT23-prologue-rise-of-the-gravewalker) then you will know how Tocharian received its special weapons. There is a great tower on the Shadow Isles that even frightened the undead themselves. Everyone who entered the Tower was never seen again, but Tocharian, as the Conqueror himself, conquers everything what he desires and thus conquered the tower and defeated all 6 guardians and controls them as his familiars.   *  \n* *The reason why Tocharian entered the League of Legends is both to conquer Runeterra and to hone his skills. He’s not just a Conqueror, he’s also a warrior who takes pride in his skills. *  \n* *There are proofs of Tocharian’s existence in Runeterra and even the League. First, the west ocean where also the Shadow Isles residues, is named “**Conqueror’s sea**”. There’s also a buff in Dominion that is called **”Mark of the Conqueror”** that is given after capturing a marked capture point after it has been marked as a quest.*    \n* *If you’ve read the prologue or if you’ve read part of it here, then there’s two things that are currently a secret. First, when Tocharian entered the Black Tower to conquer it, he defeated 6 guardians, but there were originally 7. The **7th guardian** fled before Tocharian could defeat him. He may return. Second, the general who led the man to execute Tocharian when he was a King, is the same General that we all know – The Master of Metal, **Mordekaiser**. However, Mordekaiser’s lore indicates that he lost his memories and he seeks for information about his origin. Tocharian himself doesn’t recognize Mordekaiser due to the humongous armor, but time will tell if nothing else. *  \n* *For clarification: Tocharian is a Conquerer, thus conquers by simply claiming things. Tocharian has two stances: One is his Six-Sword-Technique where he uses six swords to deal damage. The second one is his Chariot-Stance where he drives a Chariot that is led by six spectral wolves.*   \n* *Tocharian in Chariot-Stance has a significantly bigger hitbox due to his wolfs and due to the chariot.*  \n* *Tocharian is a great Champion who is best played top or as jungler. He offers great damage, some CC and the less HP he has, the more dangerous he becomes.*  \n* *If Tocharian is in Chariot-Stance, his attack range slightly increases because his familiars attack, not he himself.  *\n\n\n--------------------\n#***Stats***   \nHealth \t445 (+91) \t\nAttack damage \t56 (+3.1)   \nHealth regen. \t7 (+0.78) \t\nAttack speed \t0.625 (+2.9%)   \t\nArmor \t22 (+3.0)    \nMagic res. \t28 (+0.90)     \nRange \t135 (Melee) \t\nMov. speed \t345 (Chariot-Stance: 380)  \n-------\n#***Abilities***\n\n***TOCHARIAN SPENDS HEALTH OR FAMILIARS IN ORDER TO CAST HIS SPELLS***  \n\n***TOCHARIAN HAS A UNIQUE MECHANIC – HE CAN CAST Q IN BOTH STANCES NORMALLY, BUT W AND E REQUIRES TOCHARIAN TO HAVE CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEALTH OR LOWER IN ORDER TO CAST***\n\n***TOCHARIAN HAS TWO STANCES CALLED “CHARIOT” AND “SIX SWORDS”***  \n\n***Chariot: Tocharian drives a chariot pulled by a max of six of his familiars. The amount of familiars is increased by kills/assists and will be used as ability costs in Chariot-Stance***  \n\n***Six Sword: Tocharian fights with six sword at once as his familiars are the swords, but need souls in order to materialize their bodies in Chariot-Stance.***  \n\n-----\n#***Innate Passive - 'Conqueror’s Tribute ':***   \n*Whenever Tocharian kills a enemy unit or is granted an assist, his familiars consumes its soul and for that one familiar can take **Spectral Form**. *\n\n**In addition, Tocharian can only have *1/2/3/4/5/6 familiars* in Chariot-Stance at once. (Champion Level *1/3/6/9/12/15*)**\n\n------------------------\n#***Q (Six Sword-Stance) – ‘Sword Roulette ‘:***   \n*Tocharian’s next basic attack within 1.5 seconds will deal **bonus 50/55/60/65/70/75/80/85/90/95/100/105/110/115/120/125/130/135 (+5%/15%/25%/35%/45% Bonus AD)(Scales Per Champion Level) physical damage**.  \nIf this ability is cast a **sixth time in a row**, the damage is **doubled** and Tocharian’s familiars are **fully regained** upon successful basic attack. *\n\n* **Info:** Basic Attack Reset & Enhancer. Can’t critically strike. Applies On-Hit effects. Works with Lifesteal.  \n* **Health Cost: **   5% Current Health   \n* **Cooldown: ** 3.5/3/2.5/2/1.5\n------------------------\n#***Q (Chariot-Stance) – ‘Stampede ‘:***   \n*Tocharian gains **+15% [x(current Familiar active)] movement speed bonus** and can travel through units for **1.5/2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds**. In addition, whenever Tocharian goes through a unit, he deals **25 [x(current Familiar active)] (doubled against minions & monsters) magic damage**. *\n\n* **Info:** Movement Bonus & Damage dealt is multiplied by the amount of familiars summoned and actively used.\n* **Health Cost: **   10% Current Health\n* **Cooldown: ** 15/14/13/12/11\n-----------------\n#***W (Six Sword-Stance) - 'Unbound Frailty '***   \n***This ability is only available if Tocharian has 70% or lower health***   \n*Tocharian unleashes a battlecry that trembles the very bones of his opponents. Enemy units who are within **350 range** around Tocharian, are **thrown back 350 range away**. For every enemy unit that has been **thrown back at another terrain**, Tocharian **heals himself by 5%/8%/11%/14%/17% of the target’s max health (max 160/190/220/250/280)**.  \nIf Tocharian is near by terrain, he’ll **bounce from the wall 350 range back**, too. *\n\n* **Health Cost: **  None\n* **Cooldown: ** 15/14.5/14/13.5/13\n-----------------\n#***W (Chariot-Stance) - 'Super Kamikaze '***   \n***This ability is only available if Tocharian has 70% or lower health***  \n*Tocharian commands for the cost of one familiar, to jump in a **high arc** above the ground and land on the corresponding location within **1200 range** around Tocharian. Upon arrival, the familiar dies in a spectral explosion, dealing to all targets **75/85/95/105/115(+50% AP) magic damage**, **slowing** enemies by **25%/30%/35%/40%/45% for 1.5 seconds** and **healing Tocharian for 10% of his missing health, if hit**.   \nTocharian can **recast** while the familiar is in mid-air to stop the familiar and immediately let explode the familiar, and several spectral fireballs fall on a greater place on the ground, but the damage is split into **multiple small AoE’s**.*\n\n* **Info:** Projectile speed similar to Morgana’s Q. Recast will stop the familiar in mid-air to deal damage at its current location on the ground.  \n* **Health Cost: **  None\n* **Cooldown: ** 10/9/8/7/6  \n\n\nhttp://s14.directupload.net/images/141022/4746b56v.gif    \nhttp://s14.directupload.net/images/141023/tc74aycp.gif \n----------\n#***E (Six Sword-Stance) - 'Tainted Quadrille ':***   \n***This ability is only available if Tocharian has 50% or lower health***  \n*Within **400 range** around Tocharian, he **locks** a enemy target whom he unleashes a furious series of sword strikes. For **2 seconds, each second** Tocharian **deals about 35-65 / 55-85 / 75-105 / 95-125 / 115-145 (+30% Total AD) physical damage** and the** last strike (at 1.8 second) will root the target for 1 seconds**.   \nThe damage depends on the amount of familiars available, dealing the minimum damage if none familiar is available, and maximum damage if all six familiar are available. *  \n*However, If the enemy target walks further than **400 range** away from Tocharian, this ability will stop.*\n\n* **Info:** Tocharian can freely walk while dealing a series of strikes. Counts as basic attacks, thus can critically strike, apply Q or On-Hit Effects. Works with Lifesteal. Once the ability has stopped, can’t work again. Stuns break up the ability, but silence won’t. Each familiar represents +5 damage bonus, multiplied by 6 means +30 damage.    \n* **Health Cost: **  5% max health\n* **Cooldown: ** 14/13/12/11/10\n-----------\n#***E (Chariot-Stance) - 'Conquer! ':***   \n***This ability is only available if Tocharian has 50% or lower health***  \n*Tocharian sends forth for the cost of one familiar, to **walk fast** in the **designated location** up to a max of **550/650/750/850/950 range**. The familiar deals to all enemies he goes through **5%/8%/11%/14%/17% of their current health as magic damage** and the familiar, once arrives at the max range location, stays for another **2.5 seconds** there like a stone until he then dies. *  \n*Upon recast, Tocharian, as long as he is within **550/650/750/850/950 range** of his familiar, shall grip his live and destroy. A spectral cloud appears and immediately chases Tocharian’s current location. All enemy Champions hit by the cloud are **dragged by** to the end.   *\n\n* **Info:** Enemies can’t be dragged through walls. Travel speed is about the same as Vel’Koz Q. If Tocharian leaves the max range, he won’t be able to recast and the familiar disappears immediately. The familiar can’t go through walls, but once he enters a slightly higher/lower terrain difference, then he jumps over it.  \n* **Health Cost: ** None\n* **Cooldown: ** 18/17/16/15/14   \n------\n#***Ultimate - 'Summon Chariot!' & ‘Manifest Swords!’:***  \n *Tocharian switches stances from **Chariot-Stance** to **Six Sword-Stance**.  \nIf Tocharian is in Chariot-Stance and has no familiar anymore, he will be forced to switch to Six Sword-Stance until he has at least one familiar ready.*\n\n* **Info:** Tocharian begins with Materialize Swords! (Six Sword-Stance) upon begin of match. Ultimate is available from level 1 on. Tocharian has no familiar at the begin of the game.    \n* **Health Cost: **  None\n* **Cooldown: ** 2.5 \n\n----------------\n\n#***Concept Explanation***\n\nTocharian’s kit is pretty much unique. The only thing that is common, is the Stance-Mechanic, used by Nidalee, Jayce and Elise. However, Tocharian can’t use W and E unless he has reached a certain health threshold. This is new and allows both Tocharian and his enemies to play fair and square. Tocharian can be overwhelming once he unlocks his powers and falls below 50% health, but this is also a risk he has to take because he is more vulnerable. He’s a great durable fighter and tank who can initiate, engage, disengage and be very useful for his team.  \n\n* ***Innate Passive*** Recovers Tocharian’s familiars as they consume the very soul of the fallen enemies. Tocharian gains more strength and ammunition by that.  \n* ***His Sword-Q*** is a powerful tool to deal damage. Upon sixth strike, deals double damage and all familiars are awakened.  \n* ***His Chariot-Q*** speeds himself up either to flee or engage and deals damage, even though low at the begin.    \n* ***The Sword-W*** gives Tocharian the ability to bounce his enemies off of him. This is great once he becomes high-priority target, like for example when he’s low at health and everyone tries to execute him as fast as possible. Tocharian can bounce himself away, this can be very nice in situations when Tocharian wants to dash short to buy time, like when he gets towerdived or when he towerdives himself, he can kill his target and bounce from the tower away to safety.  \n* ***The Chariot-W*** kind of makes an artillery fire, sending forth one of his familiars to explode on arrival, deal damage, slow the targets and heal himself. While this kind of seems a overall strong ability, it’s course can be predicted, thus has a recast ability to activate to outsmart the opponent.   \n* ***Sword-E*** unleashes a series of sword strikes. This is pretty unique as Tocharian doesn’t need to stand still, he can simultaneously walk, activate other abilities – but he needs to stick very close to the target in order to perform the whole series of strikes and the root at the last strike.    \n* ***Chariot-E*** sends again one of his familiars, but to come again and pull his targets to him. Great ability to gather a group of enemies, but can end up killing Tocharian if poorly executed.  \n* ***Last, but not least - The Ultimate***  which does nothing except changing Tocharian’s stances from Sword to Chariot.\n\nIn a 1v1, Tocharian is strong against other fighters, but has its problems against Tanks. Tocharian is weak against ranged fighters who can kite him pretty hard. Due to Tocharian’s lack of gap closer, he is not best suited against Champions who can go in, damage him, and go out without any harm.  \n\n------------\n#***Quotes***  \n\n***Selecting him in Champion Selection:***   \n***\"Conquer!

When the king of the Shadow Isles ordered his sorcerers to crack open the barrier separating life and death, the forest served as a well of power the magi drank deeply from.\n\nAnd I've upvoted your Concept already, remember me from the comment section, telling a guy that \"Rannek\" and \"Renekton\" aren't too similar?
