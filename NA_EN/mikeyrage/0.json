To clear things up, by crashing do you mean a bugsplat?  If so then your drivers or game files could be having issues.  A repair might help, as well as our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide.\n\nIf there's no bugsplat but a no response error then you could have a network block preventing comms with the game server properly.  Double check your anti-virus settings for that, as well as port forwarding/DNS config in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-04T14:14:52.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you receive any type of errors when you crashed?
