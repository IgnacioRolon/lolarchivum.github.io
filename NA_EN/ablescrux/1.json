Our discord has Riot approval, as shown by Riot Keyru making that post, it's prominent place in the board sidebar, the multiple Rioters we have on Discord, and it's official role in our moderation.\n\n2. Discord doesn't interefere with League any more than Skype or, for that matter, Microsoft Word. You can turn off the overlay if you're concerned.\n\n3. To my knowledge the Discord doesn't have API code to LET anyone get your IP, even if they wanted to. Further, they can't execute code on our Discord server either way, and we don't collect any data -- nor do we want to. All Orion Bot does is give some handy moderation commands.\n\n4. We're not licensing it or selling it: we're just using a well-known free chat app for communication. No TOU problems at all.\n\n5. We're not trying to steal your IP, money, kidneys, or souls. We just want a handy place to chat to you guys.","replies":[{"poster":"rêalizêd","date":"2018-03-17T15:35:40.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Excuse me but i got suspended and waited the suspension but league client still says im banned.
