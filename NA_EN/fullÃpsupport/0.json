Also this can happen when i move around the lane . I click on some point but the character doesnt do anything.The really weird part is that this seems to happen mostly around the lane meaning when i go to base and click around to test , the character seems responding .I have good ping and fps capped at 80 all game long .Also i dont think this is packet loss as everything else is ok as i can throw abilites just fine and there is no other lag .Is it my mouse maybe? \nPls help i cant even cs.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-21T03:29:27.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh that sounds almost like a perfect example of what happens when your connection is having issues with packet loss. Let's run a quick test for that using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run a trace to the EUNE server at 31.186.224.42.
