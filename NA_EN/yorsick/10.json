I see my mistakes as they happen.  I learn something new every few games i play. I was bronze 4 2 weeks ago. I can shot call.. but better at it as the jungler.  I believe that i have a decent understanding of playing from behind.. and i know that if i win early the game is over at the elo i am at.  I have a drive to get better at anything i do.. Skateboarding Gloving Writing Music.... and league is my main focus right now.\n\nWeaknesses:  There are some times where i get frustrated at the game... and it will take me off focus and ill find myself tilting but i am working on keeping it under control.  Sometimes when im ahead i will tend to get cocky and lose focus and throw a game. but i think now i have fixed that after noticing the problem.\n\nWhat i am looking for:  I am looking for a team to not be afraid to give me constructive criticism and also be able to take constructive criticism without getting offended and through that better ourselves as players.  My ultimate goal is diamond or master tier and becoming an elo booster one day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"greg33z","date":"2016-06-19T04:31:31.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still looking?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hi Im Chai","date":"2016-06-19T03:49:31.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Hi Im Chai\nRank: S3 \nTop 4: Lee, Kha, Nunu, Nid\nStrength: aggressive playmaking jungler","replies":[]},{"poster":"YorSick","date":"2016-06-19T03:48:15.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Ever","date":"2016-06-19T03:32:44.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Youngster\nCR: Silver 5\nTop 4:  Nunu.
