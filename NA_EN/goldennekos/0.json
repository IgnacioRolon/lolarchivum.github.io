I've never had any luck with Riots loot, EVER.  I have opened 15 orbs so far and not a single sign of any loot besides pathetically lame 975 skins ( and only 1 at a time at that). I truly believe these event orbs have some of the saddest loots I've ever seen from Riot. Seriously, playing 20 games to open an Orb to get a MUNDO MUNDO skin is the most infuriating thing I've felt in ages. Has anyone gotten the Bag? How many orbs did you open? \r\nI don't care of we have to pay more tokens or something for an orb, just for the love of god give us better loot. no one wants these cheap out dated skins. Have the orbs cost more and give better stuff, everyone wants that. \r\nPlease share your thoughts and opinions on this.","replies":[]}
