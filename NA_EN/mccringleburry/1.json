None of my friends have had their account messed up and i havnt even heard of anyone either so why the sudden change it makes absolute no sense at all and its frustrating. This game used to be one of my favorites but theres been so many changes whether small or big that have made my opinion change, and yeah ik my opinion doesnt matter that much bc hey im just silver/bronze and im not famous so of course why even listen to me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UberAndLeet","date":"2017-05-19T21:35:34.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the NA region, having the same problem with my password.
