Give us a voice, Riot.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":70,"down_votes":19,"body":"I typically turn to the League of Legends subreddit to process my frustrations and seek more perspectives. It is a large community that I know is visible to Riot Games, so it offers a voice to players. However... recently there was a response from someone on Riot&#039;s team who essentially said that while they see our frustrations, we are just one part of the League of Legends community.\r\n\r\nThe League of Legends subreddit is comprised of a diverse group of players who experience the game in entirely different ways, and they are now being dismissed entirely.\r\n\r\nI have lost my voice within the League of Legends community.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve personally been playing League of Legends since Season 2. I started out in Bronze 5, but I kept playing and over time I&#039;ve climbed up to Diamond 5.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been through a lot of frustrations that are felt at lower elo or to more casual players related to not having a thorough understanding of the game&#039;s mechanics and patch notes. I&#039;ve experienced the more specific frustrations about seemingly minor changes having a huge impact on my gameplay at higher elo. I&#039;ve had periods of time where I played a couple times a month to a dozen of games per day or more.\r\n\r\nMy point is, that I am a member of the League of Legends community, and I deserve to have a voice.\r\n\r\nThis season I am frustrated. In the past, we have had substantial changes across a variety of aspects of the game, and it always took time to adjust, but it always made sense. It was interesting and effective, and it benefited a player&#039;s ability to make impactful decisions about their gameplay.\r\n\r\nRight now the changes we are seeing with the Blue Essence are frustrating, because it feels like the incentive to keep playing has been taken away for a more long-term goal-oriented reward system that is underwhelming at best. But most importantly, the changes with the Runes are disappointing and even infuriating.\r\n\r\nI keep seeing the rune system being presented as more diverse, but it is anything but. I used to be able to run Janna with Attack Speed, Armor, and Ability Power in my rune page and Windspeaker&#039;s Blessing with utility buffs in my masteries. It took time to find the balance for my setup, but it was very user-friendly and customizable. Combinations were seemingly endless, because the masteries offered essential meta-directed buffs, while rune pages offered user-determined options suited to their individual playstyle with the champions they played.\r\n\r\nThe new system is extremely limiting and ineffective, and I want to know if my voice (and the voices of other members of the League of Legends community) is being heard and what response, if any, will be offered so that I can confidently continue to move forward with the League of Legends game and community as it shifts and evolves.","replies":[{"poster":"Micbran","date":"2017-11-26T14:53:09.079+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":5,"body":"Boards are retarded 89% of the time so I’m not even surprised.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowplosion","date":"2017-11-26T20:27:07.252+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reddit it slightly better.

Yet, and I hate to admit it, the amount of Riot comments has been slowly dwindling over the past couple years. Every now and then, we'll have one Rioter like you that comes out and tries to answer everything they can. Repertoir did this once, and possibly even Cactopus. Even Meddler seems to be taking a step back from commenting these days, despite his Quick Gameplay thoughts. Rioters like Kateykhaos, Sweet, Bioluminessence, and others would be on these boards day in and day out. So much so, that their comments would even drown out the Help & Support Rioter comments on the Red tracker. Now, unfortunately, you're lucky to see a comment from them every 2 weeks or so.\n\nI can't really blame you for that, though. When people make posts that compare Riot to that of EA, it must be really discouraging to get on these.

I give huge props to someone like Cactopus, because it's really hard to wade into a topic where everyone is really angry (and will definitely be angry at you specifically if you post there). As for some of the Rioters you've mentioned, they're definitely still around chatting in other ways like Twitter, Tumblr or Reddir.\n\nI've seen a lot of topics on Boards semi-recently personally attacking an individual designer or a team, and I don't think I could ever in good faith ask another Rioter to come talk in a topic that starts out on such hostile ground. It's really unlikely it would be a productive conversation, and honestly there's a real emotional cost there for the designer/team in question. It's also unlikely that I could personally post there - I won't speak on a project someone else is doing. Thus, those topics very often go unanswered.\n\nPersonally, I believe that there are a ton of productive conversations where both players and Rioters can learn really valuable things (like this one!) but if a topic is just looking for a punching bag then there are probably better ways you could be spending your time, yeah? Any time spent here is time not spent making stuff for League (or, in my case, sleeping) haha. So I get worried when I see so many topics starting off super emotional or hyperbolic - it's really, really hard to have a conversation in those where participants walk away with more insight than they started with. Now, I'm not saying a topic needs to be a cuddlefest or can't be critical, it just needs to be reasonably framed with the intent of actual discussion.  \n\nAnyway, that's my honest opinion and I totally get wanting to hear from a larger variety of Rioters.

The **ONLY** case were they use the data argument is when someone says something along the line \"EVERYONE hates that stuff\", and Riot typically replies \"No, not everyone (because data).

That's called skepticism, and it is absolutely vital to healthy conversation that both parties can learn from. It was only by exposing the false assumption about DQ that party queuing and new champ select were one feature that we got to an understanding in the first place. We were told over and over that (paraphrasing here) \"internal data suggested that most people enjoyed queuing with friends\" and it was only by suggesting that their data was flawed in its assumptions that we came to an understanding. Without that skepticism we might not have solo queue now. \n\n> if your goal is to convince players, it doesn't work. \n\nIts not their job to convince players, and that shouldn't be the goal of discussion. If riot is setting out to prove that they are right then they have already failed. It needs to be about coming to a mutual understanding. That will only come if both parties are willing to have the conversation in good faith. There are lots of examples of bad faith conversations on these boards from both sides, and its a damn shame, but I'm dubious about your premise that \"most people aren't arguing in good faith\". I'd point you to some examples, but rioters haven't had any actual conversations on these boards in quite a while. The closest thing we have is Meddler's corner, and most people there are asking questions in good faith. The only reason why so many think your premise is a given is negativity bias. \n\n> The ONLY case were they use the data argument is when someone says something along the line \"EVERYONE hates that stuff\", and Riot typically replies \"No, not everyone (because data). But WHY do YOU specifically hate it?\"\n\nAgain, data is only part of the picture, and you've completely missed the point of why doing exactly what you've described shuts down the conversation. Asking how they came to their conclusions deserves a response, and it isn't a post that starts with a confrontational attitude of \"No, you're wrong because of data *that i won't show you*\". By responding in that way they have set the tone for the conversation, and that is one where the rioter has all the power in the conversation to selectively shut down statements using mythical \"internal data\" while the other person has nothing to turn to. If they aren't willing to explain the data they cite then they are basing their argument on a statement of seemingly scientific/mathematical importance that the other person can not possibly have the means to disprove, and for all intents and purposes of the conversation the rioter is not even wrong. It no longer matters if the rioter elicits more feedback after that because they have already removed the foundation of the discussion, and more importantly the dynamic of conversation that both sides can meaningfully contribute to. \n\nThey really have two options, either be open in having their conversations like they used to so meaningful discourse can resume, or retreat from conversations entirely and become passive listeners. Sadly they have largely chosen the second, which was the observation of this thread in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-01-06T22:23:21.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are tons of subtle but important mistakes in your post, and I kept this tab open for a month hoping to find some time to point them all out, but I give up, \"real life\" won't let me.\n\nSo let's just say that what you wish for isn't realistic, because PLAYERS will never have the necessary good will and attitude to reach that \"common understanding\" you're wishing for.

They are just jerks or trolling or w/e. Call it unrealistic if you want but what I've learned over the years is if it isn't forbidden by the laws of physics then it is possible, and I've always been able to work with possible. Once you give up on discourse then the whole system falls apart, and that's what we see happening Riot has all but given up on the boards and as a result they have nearly completely fallen apart. On the other side creating and maintaining an online community is hard, it takes effort, and it requires expectations of how people are allowed to behave, but if we hold ourselves to a higher standard then we can create a forum where we can share ideas and learn something from each others experiences. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/liAp9iGg7oc?t=29\n\nI'm sorry if you've given up, i truly am, but i haven't yet.

We will take burst damage for instant, and Ez procing things with Q.  This are two big ones.  First the high damage is cause turrets to be weak.  They die to fast.  Then champions are 100% to 0ing you before you have time to react.  From the end of last season to now damage has been too high.  (or at least on some)  What did they do when the new runes came out.  They buffed AD.  Why would it not have been better to let damage be too low and move it up.  Now, look at the runes.  AD get ton and ton and poke or scaling.  AP get more poke.  This are what people didn't like about them to begin with.  Ap pokes champs out of lane.  And AD zergs you in .3 secs.  So they make them better.  Now you have champs that were hit at the knees with the nerf bad and told they can't zerg people, watching other champs zerg people fast than they did pre-nerf.  Non meta mages use 200 to 300 mana just to do 1k damage while AD can AA crit /procs for that now.\n\nYou look at the patch notes and Aery is nerfed.  Everyone was like well its was op because melee could proc it close and it could come back really quick.  Casters could proc it and run up to get it back soon.  Instead of making it a set CD to fix this issue they nerf the damage.  Sure it might have been needed to be, but the breaking issue was how fast you could use it again.\n\nNow look at EZ. Other champs things get one day on the test realm and scrapped.  one day live and destroyed.  Every season EZ breaks something because how he can proc things.  So Riot then goes and nerfs items, runes, masteries and or leaves him op rather than fixing the procing.  One champ can get a 52% win rate and 1% play rate and then get his knees broken.  others can have a 65% win and 50% play rate and get a \"we are watching it.\"\n\nWhen these things keep happening I see two issues.  Its failed management and No common direction of game / champs.  Then people like you post and give there heart and soul into the game and trying to make the player base happy.  Taking your job above and beyond.  A true value to a company.  Then its gets hard to answer questions you have no control over.  They are also very valid questions that also show no true common goal or direction.\n\nLook at the classing of champs.  First they put you here then change it to this then re-class them to that.  Now change the kit to do more this role.  All of this is making chaos when you don't have to have it.  Management needs to come and have a common goal / direction for champs and roles.  Look at AD / tanks.  You have some many different types and subtypes.  Now look at AP.  They are lumps to but be AP.  AP assassins aren't really a thing.  Most take AD items too.  AP fighters, bruiser, divers, dot, burst.... nope just Mages.\n\nNow people have been yelling up and down about this things.  But instead of easy fixes till things get more stable, they totally change classes, items, or etc.  riot always hyperbole instead of small changes.  Then adds on all the changes for more money.  I get it.  I'm deal with money and now to make / increase revenue steams all day long.  Look at all the older skins.  Now how many are bought compared to new ones.  I would say new ones are sold ALOT more.  The time to make a new skin cost a lot more than to update old ones.  If other non-meta champs were allowed to become meta and then you fixed the old skins (which are a lot less cost) you come re-sale the old ones to increase it without a lot of work.  Instead you screw with the money system and piss everyone off.  Why when you didn't look at all the other options first.  Its like leaving money on the table.\n\nAll of this going on and you look at the patch notes to see Lux loses .1 ad and some champ like Mord that isn't meta nerfed.\n\nThese aren't to you.  I would say then are more to the \"top Tier\" leadership that never seems to be accountable for the direction or actions they take.  Then you complain about something for months and finally they said yep this might be a little strong.... its like have you been living in a box.\n\nI get that a lot of balance is subjective but tell me where I can go to see the future direction of the champs roles and impact on the rift.  Where are the end goals they want and how to get there.  Not exact info just a outline path to go down.  Right now it feel like the \"top tier\" have multiple personalities and direction of the game changes every few month from one end to the other.  One month gailo is a tank 3 month later he is the best AP mage on the rift.  don't get me started on mobility not be correctly budget in the sense of power.\n\nAll in all, 95% of the people think you are great.  And others like you go above and beyond.  But in the \"game Thoughts of the day\" most of the time he will not address the major issues until way past time.  At least acknowledge the issue and state where he wants to go as in a sense of direction.  \n\n\nsorry for so much of my thoughts on the matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im Jayce Top","date":"2017-11-30T10:06:31.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot listens, then how come we see now changes?\n\nDamage is too high, Ezreal/Kha/Ornn/Malz/J4/Twitch/Trist/Shen/Mao/Xin need to be gutted.
