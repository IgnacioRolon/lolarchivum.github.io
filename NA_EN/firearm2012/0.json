It seems kinda... well honestly, dumb, to push content out the door to \"test and gather feedback\" and not have the resources available to act on said feedback. Why not hold onto VFX/Voices/Sound/Art resources for a week after content is pushed to PBE.

Whats mind blowing about that, is that they don't gate these changes from ranked queues at all, meaning that they can completely ruin games for untold numbers of players in ranked before they can start to perform damage control to fix any issues that might exist from a balance standpoint.\n\nThe recent changes are especially perplexing, and im sure im not the only one who is starting to seriously question riots decision making capability from a balance/diversity standpoint with how hard theyre shoving AD champions as a whole down our throats at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Andrew","date":"2016-02-11T18:59:23.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would hope that's all the PBE is for? \n\nPBE stands for \"public beta environment\"\n\nAnd what is a beta generally used to do?
