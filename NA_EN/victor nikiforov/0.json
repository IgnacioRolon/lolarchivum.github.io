You've taken a lot of the visual language of Hextech and created a beautiful rendition of a personalized player space. There's a lot of things that actually replicate some personal exploratory directions myself and others have made too, which is awesome. If you'd ever like to explore the option of working here, I'd be more than willing to review your portfolio and talk to you offline about opportunities we have available. We have quite a few openings in LA and other regions worth exploring here: https://www.riotgames.com/work-with-us/disciplines/art (look under visual design). Add me in NA under SpicyMemeDreamz and under your posting name here and we can talk more.\n\nSecondly, it makes me sad that so many people here have said \"too bad Rito will never do this\" but I understand where the frustration comes from. Ultimately, things like this can fall into a balancing act of prioritizing delivering new features vs. innovating already established ones. It's a pain point that myself and others are very aware of and constantly trying to improve, but progress takes time. I WISH it was as easy as taking a new design and copy pasta'ing it into the client to make changes like this, but there's an intricate web of data being fed into each part of the client that takes a lot of problem solving and up-front work to do correctly. Just know that this particular problem space is something we are aware of and working daily to improve on. \n\nThank you all for not only highlighting the need for improvement in this area, but congratulating OP on the level of quality in these design directions.","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2017-12-08T01:33:54.465+0000","up_votes":82,"down_votes":0,"body":">This is actually my first red name post\n\nRun while you still can lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-12-09T02:38:41.013+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/484/054/f43.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jama655","date":"2017-12-08T03:44:50.305+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow i wish i was cool enough for riot to go and offer me jobs lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChemicalBuster","date":"2017-12-08T10:01:35.871+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"S/HES GIVING YOU A JOB OFFER","replies":[]},{"poster":"Firethorn","date":"2017-12-08T01:35:08.267+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"First comment of your first red name post, give me all skinz plz. :P\n\nJokes aside, good work on the health bar designs and I hope to see some spicy memes from you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irokaiser","date":"2017-12-08T05:11:27.358+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!

Compared to your available profile settings right now I'm asking myselfe, why is there only the Option to change your Summoner Icon and the Splashart to only Ultimate Skins. Adding some options shown in that post would not only make you invest more time into the game since you will have to make your profile as fancy looking as possible but lets you also be creative in the client and not only in game. Of course you can be kinda creative when it comes to runes/preset Itembuilds but that's about it and I wouldn't really put it as a \"creative act\". Even if it would need some time to implement Profile Settings like these, I'd really love to see them so I can get even more Creative, be able to test even more and to have more motivation to level if there would be changes available after you have reached a certain level.
