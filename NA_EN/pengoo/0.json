The notable flaw is primarily snowball. until you had it fixed why not do what you used to do and make certain champions that used dash unavailable and snowball unavailable until you had solved it.

It's immensely different. I pride myself in being able to turn around bad snowball dives. The ability to see someone dive is a HUGE difference. It allows me to save spells and mana and potentially line up my character position to help in the need of a threatened dive.  When I can't see them till they're already on top of me or someone else, I pretty much have no choice but to waste the cd every time, on top of that they will always get the jump. Which for assassins is really all they need. Not to mention the team loses all their reaction time they would have spent while that person was traveling in. For a team fight where you can't base heal that's pretty big distinction if its instantly 5v4 all of a sudden.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sair","date":"2018-07-25T23:00:03.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, since disabling the entire game mode would be less than ideal, why not temp disable the worst offending champions for ARAM only?
