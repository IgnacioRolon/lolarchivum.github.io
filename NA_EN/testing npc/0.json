So uhh what happens to the lp if i get into my promos? Or if i win my promos before it comes, what even happens? I feel like lp from d5 wouldn't matter in d4 lol. I'm so confused. If i had the lp i would already be in my promos but I want to play more games today not just wait it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T15:15:37.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like there were some ghost game issues last night, but everything should be okay now.  The server will try and send the ranked details to the ranked server, though it may take some time.  I can't guarantee that it would succeed, but fingers crossed!  Issues like this are rare, and I'm really sorry if it set you back.  :(","replies":[{"poster":"The Ice WÃ®tch","date":"2017-09-21T17:46:14.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say its rare but this problem seems to be everywhere the past couple of days, is there a solution? Ive been stuck in this game for hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T17:55:33.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aside from the instance yesterday, we haven't seen any other issues causing ghost games or getting stuck at the reconnect skin.  If this has been an issue for you the past few days then there might be another problem causing it specifically for you, either a local or routing issue.  When you get a chance, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to the NA game server 104.160.131.1 for a few minutes.  Remove the first 2 IPs, and let me know what you find so we can see if there's any hiccups along the way.\n\nUpdate -- I'm seeing some more posts about this now, might be another occurrence.  Will take a look and find out!","replies":[{"poster":"BallerPinoy","date":"2017-09-22T01:18:17.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes please look into this I wasnt able to gain my LP from my win earlier today either","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
