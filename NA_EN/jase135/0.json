Use night hunter skin and put your hood down for swag points (Ctrl + 2)\n2. Use your q as an auto attack reset\n3. When you have 5 stacks, ult. Before you jump on the enemy use Youmoos and Empowered Q. AS you jump use W, Hydra, and E (e only if you can one shot, otherwise save to slow their escape) and Q again once you land.\n4. When jungling you can use empowered W and normal W but use them separately not back to back so that you get the longest time with the armor and mr boosts. \n5. Use Scuttle to stack ferocity.\n6. Mid game build: Rangers (warrior), Hydra, Youmoos, Last Whisper, Mobis\n7. End game build/Fed build: Infinity Edge, Hydra, Youmoos, Last Whisper, Tri Force, Phantom Dancer.\n8. Top lane rengar. Take ignite and hide in bushes. only auto creeps when you have q up and when you get to 5 stacks go into bush and empowered q leap to enemy then q again and spam other abilities and ignite. Usually ends in first blood. Also works at the enemy red buff if you are on blue side. \n9. Always target squishies and get upgraded red trinket to see enemy wards.\n\n\"A true hunter never rests\"\n\nEdit: Yes, Nightblue3 is a decent rengar. look up Ryan Choi if you want to see a GREAT rengar ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chatillon","date":"2015-08-09T14:10:34.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go listen to sempai nb3 -kun\n\nthat's how i know how to jg and now i cant top instead of top and jg","replies":[]},{"poster":"nimabi69","date":"2015-08-09T11:39:16.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i like rengar but i haven't been successful  against good players , i focused on dmg with attack speed","replies":[]}]}
