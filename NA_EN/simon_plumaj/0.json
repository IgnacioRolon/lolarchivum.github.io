Reign in your offensiveness - yelling and cursing won't help your cause, and probably just angry the people whom you are looking to for support.*\n\nI personally think Lee Sin is an incredibly balanced champion. I have my share of difficult games against him, and I was never quite good playing as him, but my own lack of skill shouldn't come into play here. He is a champion beloved by all.\n\nAs Woofaira said on reddit: \"[Lee Sin is] one of the most balanced and well designed champions as he is right now. He's one of the few champions you can play with or against in this game and say \"oh, that was a good outplay\" rather than it being a foregone conclusion of champion pick. I see a Lee Sin on the enemy team and say \"If he's good I'm going to have a problem,\" not \"That champion gives me problems.\" I feel that's an important distinction and the only champion that he shares that with that comes to mind right now is LeBlanc.\"\n\nI couldn't agree more. There is a general feeling that the game is becoming \"dumbed down\" (I see the word 'homogenized' being thrown around a lot).\n\nI understand that your balance team must face many challenges, and has numerous factors to consider (skilled players, unskilled players, the bosses at Tencent, personal bias against champions, and a thriving e-sports community). There are details that I don't understand, because I don't have the responsibility of creating a good experience for the largest MOBA playerbase in the world. However, what a non-trivial portion of your audience really seems to want is balance and diversity, and I believe Lee Sin embodies these values quite well.\n\nWith that being said, I respectfully ask that you reconsider the proposed changes to Lee Sin.\n\nThose who agree, please show your support here. Riot has wanted us to embrace the Community Beta for some time. Let's use it as a positive force.","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-03-08T21:24:17.453+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Most people here are overlooking many aspects as to why these changes are happening. Saying that lee sin is balanced is rather untrue. Lee is a champ who has no definitive role he can go top, mid, jungle, and even support and still excel. He can build to be a tank, a carry, an assassin, and a fighter. Does he have and incredible skill cap? yes he does, but that alone does not justify the state he is currently in. Lee sin is one of the most mobile champions in the game and some of the highest potential damage early game. But he also has one of the most unsatisfying late games as well. You could snowball out of control early game and feel invincible until suddenly you hit a brick wall and you feel like the weakest most useless person on your team. That is what these changes are aimed at changing.\n\nIf you take a step back and remove your bias for a moment and compare what lee is now and his current game health and what he will be with these changes he isn't losing anything aside from some early game damage. He is still keeping all of his skills and how they function and even gaining some new pretty cool mechanics as well. Heck they could have retuned lee to only be an assassin or tank but instead they kept his versatility and that to me is pretty awesome.\n\nIs lee sin going to feel the exact same after all is said and done... no, and no one likes change all that much. Is he still going to be a viable champ and play his role well? I think so and that in the end is what truly matters. If everything was simply kept the same and never changed, the game would feel stale unbalanced and not very fun to play.","replies":[{"poster":"rastarogue","date":"2014-03-09T03:05:45.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Got to emphasize what this guy said. They aren't changing him because he is unbalanced, they aren't intending to nerf or buff him. They are looking to shift his power curve so that he's a little less strong early and more useful late game. To do that they have to trim certain things and change them. Please don't hate and get angry about the changes. Wait, try them out, then if they are truly terrible talk to riot. As a group we could convince them to change their mind. However, they aren't likely to change their minds if you've never even played with the changes and don't actually have any grounding for your thoughts, just fears.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Toyo","date":"2014-03-08T23:37:27.414+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally, I believe Lee simply has too much diversity in what he can do, in addition to his insane mobility.

I don't know how higher elos go with some of the champs that get nerfed, but honestly, it seem that whenever a champ at low elos dominates and people are able to dominate games with them, they get nerfed. Lee is a rare ban for me too see because it's rare that I see an even mildly competent one, but when I do, it's a sight to see. But, when a Nasus or Kassadin gets in and carries a game, I just get upset because, unless I was top against that Nasus, there was nothing I could have done about it. I feel that riot needs to leave the higher skill cap champions alone and focus on the easy to play champions, and punish people who play champions that require little or no mechanics. Among many of the people I know who play this game, all of them say that Lee is either the highest or one of the highest skill cap champs in the game.
