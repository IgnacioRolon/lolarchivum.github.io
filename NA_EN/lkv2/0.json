Her W is still disgustingly bad and Zenon is still trying to find the time to get a coder to implement the QoL change. They just need to fix these two skills and she'd be fine for the time being.

While i agree that the q wave clear removal was a major nerf for taliyah, riot added a hidden nerf to her q. Her q now starts to go on cool down as soon as it starts casting versus when it finished. And due to the reduced cool down you can now permanently have q going on as long as you move around enough. They have changed her to an extremely kite able late game champion and while it has taken some getting use to i believe she is over all extremely strong right now. (yes i did copy and paste this from another post, im lazy okay? I will add however that she is more one dimentional with all her power in her q, i do miss the old taliyah where you had to e before w. Basically when she her w e combo was insanely hard to land but had a high reward.
