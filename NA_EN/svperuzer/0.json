People who are good against Aurelion Sol are those with the range to stay away (Lux, Ziggs) or those with the mobility to stick themselves right up his butt and stay there (Zed, LeBlanc). Ahri can't really outrange him, but with her ult she can definitely stick inside his star range.\n\nAlso worth noting is that if you charm him while he's using his W (Celestial Expansion), not only does it make the stars go away for as long as he's charmed, it puts the W on cooldown meaning that his damage is gutted for a few seconds after, as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-08-15T12:28:38.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you have ult just go into his face and stay as close to him as possible.  If he ults you just ult back into his face.  Sol can't instantly reactivate his Q for a stun so as long as you are next to him he can't do anything other than ult and aa.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raven Elizabeth","date":"2016-08-15T12:24:57.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"step 1: bait stun \nstep 2: stay right in his face\n\nHe has no abilities for close up except his ult. with you're mobility you should be able to dodge it with you're ult/flash.\n\nEdit  1: also i think charm makes him lose his balls. You know kinda like irl.","replies":[]}]}
