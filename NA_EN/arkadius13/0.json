At first when I start the game I don't lag until I hit lvl 3 and start punching the lane and fighting is when I start to lag then it times me out in the middle of the fight or my fps and ms just sky rocket like crazy. At first I thought it was my internet so I reset,but it still kept happening. I played one game where I had to reset my internet like 3 times in like 10 mins cause of how bad it was. Then that is when I disconnected every device that was connected to my internet to see if it helped. Well it did ... for a bit at least. As soon I started to get in team fights or fight anyone it would lag like crazy. So then that's when I realized that it can't be my internet and so far it's only been happening since I've played ekko today. Also i don't know if it's the severs that make me lag like that. If guys can give me anything as to why it is I'm lagging the way I am I would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T18:27:51.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have this issue when playing other champs?  Playing Ekko might just be a coincidence here, but the issue may actually be a network problem maintaining a steady connection to the game server.  You can run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) of the match to find out for sure.  I'm suspecting that the results will show potential packet loss or connection issues.  No worries, you'll also get a list of troubleshooting steps specific to your case.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
