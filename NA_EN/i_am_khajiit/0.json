Sure we argued back and forth after he threw his fit but I told him to go ahead and afk, not letting him have his way. I said nothing even remotely reportable besides calling him silver because he said I was bronze. Not to mention in the post game lobby he calls me middle eastern trash and black face, etc. I report him for verbal, afk, and griefing. I&#039;m sure NOTHING happened to him though. Riot you are the biggest fucking joke of a company I&#039;ve ever seen and I deeply regret buying any skin from you giving you my money. Fucking joke.","replies":[]}
