I was playing league of legends perfectly find earlier on 7/28/2017 around 11am  it all happen after a ranked match. I was playing as tahm support and we ended up losing the game but after end game screen couldn't load it so I simply skipped status and then I couldn't click on lobby at all it was grayed out I still could send messages. but I couldn't play after that match I restarted the game and I been sitting at Authenticating for good 3 hours. My wifi is powerful to run 4 league of legends games on 4 laptops at the same time. So that's can't be the problem I have a Dell 7000 so I have the specs to run it? any ideas what could be the cause of it. I did a quick repair and didn't solve anything reset my wifi still nothing any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-28T18:41:16.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like some specific services are being blocked off.
