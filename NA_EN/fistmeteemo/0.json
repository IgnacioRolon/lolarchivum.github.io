(which i believe is because i werent their premade) and i got mad and eventually muted them. they did harass me and call me stuff that was unnecessary. and then after the game 5 mins after i got a permaban for negative behavior which i feel is a mistake and unfair. i feel that because i got 4 reports on me then riot banned me for being negative and they go free continuing playing because they never got 4 or more reports on them. so is there anyway i could get a ban remove or anything?","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-07-31T02:22:51.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whether it's 4 reports or 1 report it's all the same since it only takes 1 to flag a game and anymore does nothing. If they started harassing you then you should have muted them right away without saying anything to them since talking back to toxic behavior with more toxic behavior does not make it right.\n\nAnd they will be punished in due time if they continue to show the behavior you described.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T02:52:06.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though you felt like you might have been ganged up on by that group of 4 premades, there were still some things that were said by yourself that might not have been quite positive.
