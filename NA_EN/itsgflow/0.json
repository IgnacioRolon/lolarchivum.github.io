Is this the case?\n\nYep. Pre-season doesn't give you borders. Borders are given before Pre-Season. It's basically Pre-Season 5. So Season 4 has been over for awhile now. Even someone who has a Gold border at end of Season 4 can't get Platinum border during Pre-Season 5. Cause it's already done with.","replies":[]}]}
