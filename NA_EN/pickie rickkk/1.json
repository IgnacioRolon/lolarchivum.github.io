Just the same as the free spins at some casinos, you could earn the bestest prize of all, but 99.999999% of the time you won&#039;t, which creates similar impulses as drug addiction.\r\n\r\n#Opinions past this point\r\n##children do not have impulse control and companies know it\r\nYes, people can resist it. You may be able to resist it. Other people cannot. Knowingly selling people things (to children) to feed an addiction and make profit is unethical (which is why casino&#039;s are so heavily regulated and are strictly for adults).\r\n\r\nBut hey, who needs business ethics anymore.","replies":[]}
