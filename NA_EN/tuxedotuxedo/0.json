This fight decided it all, as he had taken out three of my backline with Amumu.  No ultimates, no summoners.\nAxe met Mace in this duel to the death, I spammed my Axes but my pinky was growing tired.  In a last ditch effort I shifted my hand one to the left on the keyboard giving me the stamina to press forward.  Both of us on the brinks of death, anything to tip it in our favor, a dazzling sound filled the air as a gemstone rocketed towards Mordekaiser.  Confused and debilitated, I summoned Odyn one final time to bring judgment this day.\n\nA Pentakill, and my death all in one.","replies":[{"poster":"BlazinChaos","date":"2014-08-14T18:56:22.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Musta been a great event. u made it sound so epic","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProjectRay12","date":"2014-08-14T17:34:26.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That brought a tear to my {{champion:161}} , BRAVO!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-14T17:35:27.504+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first pentakill was with Arcade Sona in ARAM!","replies":[{"poster":"D White Knight","date":"2014-08-14T18:48:53.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first penta was with jax and we all know jax wrecks everyone and now the reason i came here is ask for some help from a member of riot's staff.
