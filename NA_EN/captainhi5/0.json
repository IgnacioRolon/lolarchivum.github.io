I feel like for the most part I have the potential to go up, realistically probably not good enough to play professional I don't have hopes and dreams of that, but I would really like to play with other people that are wanting to be more serious about it and play roles.\n\nI would really like a team that is serious enough to put some real effort in, but at the same time not looking to bicker and argue, I am completely ok with constructive criticism but at the end of the day I think it is important to remember it is just a game. I am not asking for perfection I know losing can be frustrating, but as long as its done constructively and at the right time I am a-ok with it.  \n\nI own every champion in the game, I have 20 rune pages. My strongest roles in order are Mid-Support-ADC-Top-Jungle. I can fit in and don't mind settling for one role and playing that one primarily no matter what role it is. \n\nIf you look at my runes/mastery pages you will see I narrowed my champs down to 17 (Yeah I know a lot but it is solo que) I like to be flexible in whatever role im playing on top of being pretty comfortable playing any role. \nIf you are too lazy to look here are my '17' in order from best to worst.\n\nMid - Ori, Lux, and Yasuo\nSupport - Janna, Leona, and Sona\nADC - Sivir, Cait, and Jinx\nTop - Shen, Renekton, Nidalee, and Gangplank.\nJungle - Vi, Master Yi, Elise, And Lee Sin\n\n_****My schedule that I am available to play/practice in is:\nSunday-Tuesday I am completely off so anytime really on those days I am completely free.\nMonday-Friday I work 9:30 am - 9:30 pm so any time between 9:30 pm and 1:00 am on those days\nSaturdays I usually work from 10:30 am - 7:00 pm so anytime after 7:00 pm I'm good to go****_\n\nAll of those times are EST \n\nI am 29, and I live in Texas... not opposed to playing with people of any age really as long as everyone is mature, I have played games with plenty of 30 year old people who acted like they where 12, and plenty of 15 year old's who acted 30.  Not a complete stiff, do like to have fun, and would like for it to be a fun yet competitive experience for everyone.  \n\nAlso do not mind being a sub for a team if needed, I'm not in any rush so really whatever the team needs I'm willing to fill in.\n\nLeave me a msg and your in-game name on here or shoot me a private msg on how I can get in contact with you, and if you read this and pass me by... I hope to see you on the rift ;)\n\n_**TL:DR: Silver player - all champs - 20 rune pages - My strongest roles in order are Mid-Support-ADC-Top-Jungle (See bold text for times available.) **_","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainHi5","date":"2015-09-07T09:00:16.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump\n\nalso slight note I wanted to add to this...
