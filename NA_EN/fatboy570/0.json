We wouldn't give out information on accounts, but our account team will help players recover them.  If an unauthorized party had specific information to the account, they could have attempted to recover it.  I can lock the account in the meantime as a precaution, but I recommend filling out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) asap so our account team can help you directly.  Is the account you're posting from the impacted one?","replies":[]}]}
