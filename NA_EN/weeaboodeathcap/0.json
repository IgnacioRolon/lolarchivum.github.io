I finally get around to updating my drivers and fixing my FPS and ping and my computer still being a toaster, I boot up League, and press \"Launch Legacy Client,\" The Beta client closes as it should and then I see the old League Of Legends emblem/kernel and then all of a sudden, \"Nope.\" \"Pvp.net patcher kernel has stopped working\" Something along the lines of that. So.......... Wat do.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T18:00:15.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The kernel error is usually caused by a security issue blocking it game from loading.  You'll want to use [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to fix this up.  You can also return to the legacy client another way:\n\n-  Create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"WeeabooDeathCap","date":"2017-01-04T21:14:57.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The shortcut doesn't work but fortunately the permissions tips helped so I just launched Beta as admin and clicked Legacy and it worked.\nSo it's just a little out of my way.","replies":[]}]}]}
