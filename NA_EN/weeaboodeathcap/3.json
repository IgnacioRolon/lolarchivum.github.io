Double sound. It looped it's self twice and a bit higher pitched. So to me this was odd. I was wondering if it was just that button or if it was my speakers, so I went over to my champions. Clicked {{champion:17}} and not only am I now deaf from his squeaky voice but I am left clueless of what to do. I have gone on to several other websites like YouTube to test my sound and my sound worked occasionally. Also my in game frame-rate is down in the dumps because of it. Also I have tried restarting my computer. Don't know what else to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2017-01-04T11:44:29.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Queue is French for tail, from Latin \"cauda\".

I'd first recommend going to your PC manufacturer's support site to ensure all current available drivers have been updated and installed correctly before we troubleshoot this further.\n\nLet me know if those driver updates caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"WeeabooDeathCap","date":"2017-01-04T02:51:13.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, small issue... Laptop I bought at best buy so there's no asking for that. Honestly their tech support is useless... I tried trust me, but how would I check if my drivers are messed? Is there a way you know to manually see if they are updated in installed or if you know trusted software?","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2017-01-04T04:21:11.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you run a dxdiag you can see who provides the drivers for your sound and look on their website.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WeeabooDeathCap","date":"2017-01-04T03:06:44.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm... Well never mind now. It seems to have fixed itself. I remember a long time ago when I played CS:GO in the old days my sound did the same thing... Well, thanks for the advice anyways.","replies":[]}]}]}
