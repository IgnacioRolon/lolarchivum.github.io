Ping is constant at 37ms. The lag is that commands don't go through or they lag.

Result=0 packet loss. Why I didn't have any problems before the new patch? I mean, before the patch the game run perfectly, after the patch I get \"packet loss\", just wow. And the other thing is that i can play normal(no lag problems) games like cod, battlefield, dota, fifa, overwatch, hots, cs go... but this one? Nope! Really now? Really? Packet loss?

This may not be a hardware or fried modem problem, but I suggest ruling out possibilities that can cause this.  Go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for some troubleshooting steps towards getting these resolved.
