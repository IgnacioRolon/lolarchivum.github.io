Should be after the announcer talks. It might not work immediately if she had just said a move or attack line, but should happen every few teamfights!","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-04-02T21:57:31.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry for bothering.

Why does Infiltrator Irelia not have the black headpiece and pink eyes in game? She looks way better on the splashart, it looks like she has some amazing black headphone thingies and in game it just doesn't have anything to connect the two pieces into the one headphonish looking headpiece, also pls fix Infiltrator Irelia's eyecolour to pink and make her hair less like old Irelia it looks like a cape rather than hair, like pls guys ilysm and everything u do","replies":[{"poster":"Blazehhh","date":"2018-03-30T04:28:34.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity what does the new recall look like?
