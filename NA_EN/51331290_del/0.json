Kill laner, push and gank bot or top, push and get some jungle vision etc.\n\nStart tracking enemy sums (if you blow at the same time remeber they will have it up roughly the same time) and forcing things while they don't have them.\n\nThen track enemy ulti cds and if they have longer spells (darius pull is 18ish sec, blitz pull is 20 sec, yas windwall etc).  This requires much more knowledge of the champion base but once you have it down it makes trading way easier because you always know exactly what the enemy can do at any given time.  \n\nI would also recommend playing every champion at least a couple of times so you know both sides of matchups.  This also makes it waaay easier to recognize their weaknesses and what opportunities you find when playing against them.","replies":[{"poster":"51331290_DEL","date":"2017-01-28T12:31:45.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This have worked for me very much!
