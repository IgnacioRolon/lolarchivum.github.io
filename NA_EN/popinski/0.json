Either the LoL Client or PvP.net. The issues vary widely (unable to connect to chat, unable to pick champions, etc), but the ones that are extremely bothersome to me are the ones that obviously bring about a negative experience for everyone who would have been in the game with me, AND myself (this part is important).\r\n\r\nSo, the client gives me issues and tells me it encountered a problem and sent a report? That's fine, I'll just restart. The problem is, sometimes it takes more than one restart because I need to manually kill every LoL and PvP.net process in order to get a fresh restart and actually be able to connect. Or, you know, my first attempt to reconnect doesn't actually do anything and I'm just stuck in the loading screen for 10 minutes before I realize that if I were to tab out, I'd see a message that says there was a problem, or that I disconnected. The other issue I get is that sometimes, in the middle of the match, the game tells me I have disconnected from PvP.net or chat, and it doesn't allow me to play and is stuck with a message saying \"attempting to reconnect\". Sometimes it goes through, sometimes it happens multiple times during a match, and sometimes I need to kill the client and restart.\r\n\r\nHere's my gripe. I understand that this puts stress on my teammates because they have to play with one less person, and (sometimes) puts stress on the enemy team because its simply not fun for them to play with a handicap. Why should I get punished for something that is out of my control? I've gotten a message that because of AFK/Leaving behaviour, I will no longer get loot crates (its been about 2 or 3 months since I last saw one?). I also just recently got a message that because of my \"AFK/Leaving bhaviour\" I am banned from searching for a game for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nI've called my ISP and they tell me my connection is fine. They've done ip routes and haven't gotten issues. I don't get issues with the counteless other streaming or gaming that I do. Its just League of Legends.\r\n\r\nSo, I have a few questions:\r\n\r\nCan I appeal and see if I can become eligible to recieve loot crates again?\r\nCan I appeal and see if I can remove these soft bans because of issues with the client/servers?\r\nHas anyone else experienced these issues and know of a way to fix them?\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post, and thanks for your time.\r\n\r\nP.S. Just thought I'd add this screenshot. I thought I was writing this post while the softban was counting down, but it wasn't. So I had to wait for the full 20 minutes from the start. I then decided to browse the internet while I waited, and tabbed back in to see the progress of the timer and saw this:\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/pZeNS\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, I clicked ok and the timer was still counting down. I'm kind of scared of trying to join a game, though, for fear that the client will give me even more problems and then I'll get an increased soft ban or even a real ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T18:42:58.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into your account and I don't see anything that indicates you're ineligible to receive loot due to your disconnections from matches. \n\nAs you mentioned, disconnecting from a match negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is true regardless of the reason the disconnection happens and is a prime reason why the system treats all disconnections equally and why penalties cannot be removed or modified. \n\nBoth the context you've given and the screenshots indicate that these disconnections are caused by an unstable connection to the servers. Your screenshot shows you on WiFi, which may be contributing to these issues. I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), starting with switching to a wired connection to see if anything changes.\n\nLet me know if you still see these disconnections after working through those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LEADlNG","date":"2016-08-08T04:59:28.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm... This is a weird scenario i've never encountered myself or have seen anyone else come across.\n\nIf you've already contacted your ISP, repairing the client, and PC Cleaner than all i can say is send Riot a support ticket about it and hopefully they can get back with you on this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Popinski","date":"2016-08-08T02:27:20.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: Just as I thought. I was in a game lobby, champions were picked, and the timer that the game would start went to zero. I guess my client froze because it never moved from there. Panicked and afraid of getting in trouble (again), I closed my client, killed processes, and restarted the game. Took about a minute of trying to log in to finally get this message:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/0RtWM\n\nSo I quickly kill the processes again, restart, and I was able to log in normally. But there was no game to load into, just the option to look for a match. So I click it, and I am presented with another 20 minutes wait timer.\n\nPlease help.","replies":[]}]}
