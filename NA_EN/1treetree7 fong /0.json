Also sometimes if the monitor does not lose signal i get black screens during game that may or may not come back. I've searched tirelessly and still can't find a solution to this anywhere on the internet.. Help plz!","replies":[{"poster":"1treetree7 FoNg ","date":"2016-07-26T04:20:07.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE!\nSo i tried another monitor to see if that was the problem. About 25 mins into game my screen froze while using my lux ult and stayed there. I had to restart to fix, but the game froze again soon after i reconnected. The difference however is that this new monitor has greater resolution and instead of a black screen, the game froze in full color. I couldnt tab or hear anything but my pc was still on as usual","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T16:43:20.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update on this.  I'd like to get some more information to see how I can help.   Is your monitor going completely black, or just the game freezing?  For example, can you still hear sounds?  \n\nAre you able to tab back out to your desktop?  Do you receive any errors, or experience any input delays while in game?  \n\nI know it's a lot of questions but they might help!  Looking forward to hearing back!","replies":[{"poster":"FULLMETAL337","date":"2017-12-27T20:25:48.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend is having the same issue, the screen is losing input, we are playing together and i can see for example even though he cant see anything he can still activate his recall in game, he can still hear in game sounds. It is simply the screen no longer receiving input, (the screen is powered on and displays no input detected message) the game is still running and he can interact with it(as much as you can without seeing anything). this has been happening pretty consistently lately while playing LoL, it doesn't happen during other games, and we even changed the HDMI cable, updated drivers ect. hoping someone can help or point me to a solution","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chor grunkular","date":"2017-02-21T05:54:07.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the same issue as fong, except sometimes my client will minimize by its self, and sometimes it will give me a black screen.  when it minimizes, i can get it back in just a few seconds, but when it goes black i have to restart my computer; and both are without any warning whatsoever.\n\none difference of note is that my game doesn't even seem like its freezing, it just stops(in one way or another).  although when it minimizes and i reopen the game my monitor goes through an \"auto adjust\" for its picture, which it wouldn't otherwise do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1treetree7 FoNg ","date":"2016-09-30T12:56:40.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Sorry for the soo late response) No sorry, its going black and there is no sound when that happens. I can't tab or do anything. No delays at all even.
