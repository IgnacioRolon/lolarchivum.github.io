IN. THE. LORE, the lore is one of the few things i still enjoy about this game, nothing would shatter me more than to see the lore and champions drive down a slow hill of toxic political correctness, Kled getting voicelines changed, female clothing changed (Imagine Ahri and Eve wearing a full skin suit), all this kind of shit, i don't want it, nobody wants to see lore being forced arround shurima even tho it would have made 10000% more sense to be put into places like Ionia because you needed an excuse to give a champion Shuriman (african) heritage, i don't want it, the lore fans don't want it, no lore fan wants to see lore being forced for the sake of diversity.\n\n  If you have a good shuriman lore, good for you, but don't put someone like (for example)  a doctor, which kit would make 100% more sense to be resembled by a Zaunite instead of a Shuriman, in the game, just for the sake of diversity.\n\nDon't make the whole lore of a champion by resembled by their sexuality.\n\nDon't make the whole lore of a champion resembled by them being trans.\n\nAnd most importantly, do not stop making pretty champions! Like, if you make them different, at least have a good reason to, like Illaoi, if Gragas was a girl, it would also make sense to make her fat, because lore and kit resemble it perfectly, but don't make shit like a Noxian spy a 200 kg women just because diversity, it fucking sucks, have a good reason to make the women creepy/weird/ugly (void corruption as example), or  fat (something like an ultra ordinary cheff cook?) else it just fucking sucks, and nobody wants to see it.\n\nK thats my 2 cents, hope Riot won't go down this hole, else this will be the final nail on the head for me to quit this game forever, i can forgive every bad gameplay change, but i will never, never, never, forgive Riot for messing up lore with SJW poison.\n\nEDIT : If you take your sweet time to vote anything, up or down already, why not also take the time to write your oppinion down :) would love nothing more than to discuss different views","replies":[]}
