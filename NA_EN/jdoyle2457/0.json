Everything was normal except it took me a little longer to load into than normal. We get into plat and my FPS is fluctuating between 20 and 5, I usually play around 60. My laptop was running league normally yesterday and I didn't change/update anything so I don't know what happened. I have Windows 10 and everything is up to date. While in game I opened my Task Manager and nothing was running more than normal. Also, I was watching YouTube videos after and the video was playing at half speed with the audio playing normally and it would buffer every 10 or so seconds to resync, but only when I put the video in full screen mode. Can someone explain to me what I did to my computer?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-20T16:55:56.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be a computer issue causing a hiccup with your game.
