The secret entrances to Bandle City or where Ionia sits and how to get the Shadow Isles. I also wanna make a Minecraft map of Runterra.... (please no judgement). Are we ever gonna get one? Riot?

And I loved the one from Treasure Planet (link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTa-8RzsAbg) for the unaware).\n\nWhile those are nifty ways to show a map (projection in both cases - 2d vs 3d) who would those maps be created by, and for, and what would be their purpose?  In the Treasure Planet film, its a treasure map through space - but while it looks really cool it isn't very pirate-y in form once you solve the puzzle ball.  In How to Train Your Dragon, it functions as map and dragon encyclopedia - used by ancient peoples to keep secret dragon information (and its form is pretty good for that, even if it feels a bit like a plot crutch ;)\n\nAs an example - if the Treasure Planet map was made by Aurelion Sol, then I imagine that map would be _very_ different from a galactic map created by the Targonians.  His relationship with the stars is one of love and unfathomable affection - unlike the Targonians.  \n\nMaps aren't just 'what', and they're often not even just 'where' - they're 'who' too.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-04-09T18:56:44.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought the Project promo already gave that treasure planet map vibe; I like how it builds every release too as if we got another key.\n\nI would like to see a landmark based map maybe from the Freljord inhabitants \n(seems like the best fit).\n\nThe maps we have are 'carry with you' maps rather than 'there when you need them' maps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2017-04-09T16:07:20.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A 3D map summoned by a wizard would be neat.

Sorta like if the animals all got together and made a map, what would they care about? And sure it still may hint at civilizations in so much as magical creatures would find Demacia off-putting or they may mention a particular mustachioed man up in the freljord who has the warmest of hearts and gives out tasty snacks. Now again not really sure why such a map would be made, be it from Ivern, Yordles, Vastayans, etc... but I think this would be really cool to see.","replies":[]}]}]}
