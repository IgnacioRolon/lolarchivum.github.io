All I can do is warn you that this type of behavior is absolutely not tolerated and the next offense will result in a permaban. I hope you take this time to really think about the things you say in-game, and realize there is no reason for them.\n\nIt IS possible to get your account back into good standing.

It may seem harsh and unforgiving, but people have to understand that Riot has put their foot down here and are saying that if they're not willing to change their behavior for the better, then they're not welcome here, hence the 4-strike rule in place.\n\nAlso, the reason it takes 3 months to drop down a punishment tier is to make sure that the offenders in question are actually making the effort to properly reform and change their behavior for the better. It also helps get the message out that they can't just stop playing the game for a week or a month or two and expect to have a clean slate right away after that; they actually have to put in the actual effort that it takes to reform. If they're not willing to do that, then this game is not for them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2016-01-10T04:24:45.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well too bad.

If you haven't been perma banned then you can change how you act. In fact, people have come to the forums after having a ban experience and have talked about how they really enjoy playing more after they've stopped being toxic. Riot really likes to see that. \n\nEveryone has games with bad people in them, but dont let them drag you down with them. Learn to control yourself and if you have to, mute them. I get pissed from time to time by toxics, and most of the time I stay out of it and do my best to help my remaining teammates. \n\nThe best way to not get banned is to just say nothing. If someone is being toxic in chat, just say nothing and report at the end of the game.

One of my favorite things to come look at in the forums.\n\nIt's amazing how people have no problem posting their chat logs ad feel all confident that they did nothing wrong when the chat logs are full of toxicity. \n\nIf you are THAT stupid and that toxic, the Tribunal is doing its job","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilQuacker","date":"2016-01-09T03:09:44.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your the idiot that is cusing out a jg for not ganking just calm your tits kid and try to dodge the system,reason you got banned was because you said Reported","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha KhaZix","date":"2016-01-09T00:55:50.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Should this system of banning people from chatting because of a report from other players stop or not?\n\nYeah, they should stop.\n\nThey should move to just banning people like you from the game outright. \n#**/s**","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-01-09T01:01:41.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mecha KhaZix,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pGK4AlJ3,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2016-01-09T00:55:50.540+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, they should stop.\n> \n> They should move to just banning people like you from the game outright. /s\n\nHow do you expect people to reform if you don't give them the chance to do so first? Riot's policy is Reform first, Remove second. In other words, they want to try to get people to understand why the behavior that got them punished in the first place is wrong, and if they still refuse to listen to reason and change, well then that's when Riot will remove them from the game permanently, as there's no place in any community for someone who would rather be a jerk than be respectful.","replies":[{"poster":"TjohnnyT","date":"2016-01-09T05:29:54.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I agree that I deserve the first 2 punishment and I had good behavior for few weeks, but humans can't handle their behavior forever, and I was so mad at shen and I asked him but he did nothing.

However, the more and more you act up the more and more leniency you use up until it gets to the point where you don't have any leniency left. Also, it's okay to be mad and upset, but lashing out the way that you did in the chat logs is the wrong way to go about doing it. If you need to rage then do so at the computer screen rather than in chat. You also did get valid reported several times across multiple games, hence why you were punished.\n\nFrom [Mini KB: Chat Restrictions](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4533668&page=1#post47204415): \n\n>**\"How did they determine that I was toxic?\"**\n\n>As part of the development of Team Builder, Team PB&J built \"sophisticated language models to determine the quality of communication. (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/23ky31/why_is_the_lol_community_so_lazy_that_they_dont/cgyahjq)\" Lyte has mentioned on several occasions that they could - and probably would - use those models to detect toxic chat. Given Lyte's penchant for accuracy, it seems likely that the detection system was thoroughly vetted before release.\n\n>From WookieeCookie, (link (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=47153866#post47153866))\n\n>_The chat restrictions are not based off of the last game you played but rather an investigation of a series of games you've been reported in. Just a few of the things we look at: frequency of games played, frequency of reports received, # of unique players reporting you, types of reports received and so on._\n\n>From Lyte: (link (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=47282287#post47282287))\n\n>_Secondly, we have a system that's been analyzing millions of chat logs, and become quite good at detecting whether a conversation in a game is negative or positive. I presented some of this work at the previous Game Developer's Conference. It's an interesting system because the more chat logs you feed the system, the more accurate it becomes at determining whether a player communicates more positively or negatively than the average player in League of Legends._\n\n>Keep in mind that Riot will NEVER release details about this detection system, as people would use it to skirt the system.\n\nAlso from [Mini KB: Chat Restrictions](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4533668&page=6#post48004373):\n\n>**How do people get chat restrictions after a game where they don't talk or only call timers? Are those people lying?**\n\n>Asked on Reddit by Ryzolryzol (link (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/27zq5t/chat_restriction_system_based_on_number_of_bans/ci65z9u))\n\n>_Chat restrictions are handed out after the system and Player Support detect a pattern of negative behavior, so it's rarely, rarely for the behaviors you exhibited in your immediate last game. It could be the last 10-20 games, last 40 games, depends on the severity of the behaviors._\n\nFrom the [Tribunal FAQ](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284): \n\n>**That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\nI'll keep this one simple: those other players in your game that you thought were worse are probably also banned. Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on.\n\n>We strongly believe that it is not OK to retaliate. If a player refuses to cooperate and says something negative, then players should ignore the player and report them after the game. Players can ignore or mute players by pressing the “Mute” button on the Scoreboard [when you hit TAB] in the game. \n\n>If a player retaliates and says something bad back, then the two of you have made a negative experience for potentially the other 8 players in the game. Rarely do teams start working together better when players begin fighting back—great games only happen when players cooperate and don’t make the issues even worse by fighting back and forth.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
