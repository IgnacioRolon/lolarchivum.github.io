This video has a good point. I would like to request that they at least update Singed&#039;s particle effects for this new skin. I am going to buy the skin, but can you please grant me my request? \n\nWhat would I like? Anything new or fitting to the theme. Black? Brown? \n\nThe reference can be found in the link above.

An upgrade to a 1350 tier, with new particles and the like, is definitely warranted.

This new looks is amazing, why not go all out?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-04-20T19:35:08.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This skin definitely deserves new particle effects, please reconsider!
