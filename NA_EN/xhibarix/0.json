I tend to &quot;feed&quot; with Leona, Annie, Morgana or Lulu because my engages aren&#039;t being followed up by my ADC.

Just have to be really good with skill shots (his e particularly) and good at predicting things. Only thing is you have to go at least even in lane in order to stay relevant since he's a bit feast or famine. Not too hard with all the tools he has access to though.\n\nFocus on supports that can either 1 shot carries in lane by themselves (zyra, annie, vel'koz) or can play safe enough to never get engaged on if playing properly while still doing good damage.(vel'koz, karma) Basically avoid trades and either push enemies out of lane via poke or get fed enough off of killing them to solo carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-18T09:28:45.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Alistar, click W on enemy adc or support when they get close.\n\ngg {{champion:12}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scarlet Firefly","date":"2015-05-18T08:14:15.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really depends on the lane.

Is your support an early lane bully?\n2. Can your support roam around and pressure elsewhere in a useful manner in the mid game?\n\nSupport is a role for your team, you're not tied to your ADC.  If you have an ADC that is not a play maker you can quite easily split from them and assist your team elsewhere while they split and keep the minion waves pushed.  You want to switch to supporting the duelists on your team, as your team's team fighting will be weaker if you don't catch people out ahead of time.","replies":[{"poster":"xHibarix","date":"2015-05-17T23:34:29.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i do that, adc usually feeds cause they dont ward when they push and i'm considered a troll because i'm off ganking and helping my team.

I don't mean camp out in other lanes and sap EXP, but you can always look for opportunities to roam and get down vision or gank for mid lane or something if your ADC is just freezing under tower. There's also a chance you're playing too aggressively, but you'll need to decide that for yourself. The supports you're playing are also pretty good at ganking other lanes because of the CC they offer; Lulu also gets around pretty quick with her W. If you're playing with passive players, though, sustain or poke supports are probably better, like Soraka, Sona, Karma, Lulu, Zyra, etc. You can just use your poke to zone them out of lane and your ADC gets ahead that way. Of course, if your ADC is just running from fights, it's probably a better idea to focus on supporting players that will actually help you win the game (for example, I was playing this game where my ADC was not doing bad by any means, actually a pretty good ADC and I was able to get him a few kills, but our Akali mid lane was just going ham, so I was flashing over walls just to shield her and let her kill everyone and we won pretty convincingly)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kãtãrinã","date":"2015-05-17T21:51:30.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That type of ADC shouldn't be playing ADC if he runs from enemies when he first sees them honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"xHibarix","date":"2015-05-17T21:55:52.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver Elo, you find them everywhere.
