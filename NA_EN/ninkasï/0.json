Last night, I put my computer to sleep and ended up going to bed, so I forgot to shut it down. I woke up this morning and the LoL client had crashed (was using the beta). I couldn't launch it at all, because it told me the files were corrupted. Ok - I uninstalled both the beta and the old client, reinstalled them... but now it just doesn't work. I don't seem to actually be patching - it takes all of 5 seconds, and I know patches take longer - and when I hit the Play button, the first window disappears, but the login screen never comes up.\r\n\r\nWhat's next?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninkasï","date":"2017-01-14T18:33:42.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: I reinstalled again, and this time, when given the prompt to upgrade to the beta client, I declined it. After that, it patched properly and I was able to launch.

Today, I wanted to go back to the beta client so I clicked Upgrade Now and download it. I never actually got any download or anything to install, and now I'm having the same problem with the login screen never opening when I press launch.","replies":[]}]}]}
