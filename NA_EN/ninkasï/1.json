My FPS drops to 15-20 and stutters until I press alt-tab again. I'm running Windows 10, off the integrated i5 graphics card, and using the alpha client. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninkasï","date":"2016-11-20T21:51:36.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only one of that guide that really applied to me was the driver updates, but I'm getting an error trying to update my drivers. \n\nThe strange thing is this doesn't happen all the time - sometimes, I can tab out successfully, and sometimes it doesn't work at all. It doesn't change within a game, but maybe 1 out of 10 games I can tab out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T03:37:08.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible there are some issues with your display driver or windows power settings that causes your integrated graphics to get all wonky.
