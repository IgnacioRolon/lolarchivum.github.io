But I would Like a timestamp on my private messages. So if someone asks if I'm on and I didn't see it I know what time they said it. I've looked all over the new client and can't find it anywhere to turn on out of game private messages(Found the in-game ones)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-28T17:00:15.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Timestamps are auto-enabled!  You just have to mouse over the DM, and it will show the date and time of the message.

It makes it harder to check timestamps for several messages you would receive when afk and doesn't really have a benefit other than having 3-4  less characters in the chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Funky Bone","date":"2017-05-14T12:14:55.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This feature is bad. It's clearly not a good user experience to have to hover over each message to know what time they've sent something. We come to get used to things in a certain way, just look how instant messaging works on our cellphones and Facebook. Take lessons from a proven model and give us the option to have it that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Temeritas","date":"2017-05-04T12:16:02.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty please add an option to permanently show timestamps and also add a divider between days in chat.\nAt the moment you have to hover each and every message if you want to know if they were sent continuously or with a break.\nMessages can have days between them and they are shown as if they had happened directly after each other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spzi","date":"2018-03-07T12:15:53.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Google quickly showed me your solution, and now that I know it, I kind of like that feature.
