I have been waiting for around 3 years for this and am very sad that it is not working. I have tried using a different browser all together and still will not work. I am doing this at 3 in the morning, and much later after the huge wave of people have tried to create one at the same time, making it hard to believe that the only problem is that there are multiple people hitting the 'sign me up' button at once.
