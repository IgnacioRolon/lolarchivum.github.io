This was naturally frustrating as I had just payed money for these but on further inspection this is actually in her base skin as well, its just more noticeable with the black dress. It would be nice to get this fixed so the chroma doesn&#039;t look like butt, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-03T18:47:22.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ParadoxSpace - \n\nThanks for the report!
