I can not stress enough how awful it has been to play Quinn these past few months, and it's saddening that the champ will never be looked at unless her players plead for Riot to do so. Everything she relies on is nerfed with zero compensation, and everything she dislikes is buffed. Quinn's counter matchups are a thing of the past - most notably Riven, Darius, and Renekton, who have the tools at their disposal to out scale her very early into the game and render her useless. \n\nAs a veteran Quinn player who maintains a low-mid Diamond ranking for the past couple of seasons, I barely manage to win games in my MMR, let alone Gold and Platinum, and have to actually put in effort more often than not when playing in lower elos. The Quinn mains subreddit, filled with devoted players who have stuck with the champ through thick and thin, feel the same way. And it feels like with every patch, her already small win condition timer decreases rapidly. \n\nNow, I understand Quinn is a champion that causes frustration in the top lane, particularly among lower skilled players, however, the champ is far too weak to justify her current state. \n\nI would recommend reverting the nerfs she received last Summer, save for the passive damage nerf. Which means increase her armor and attack damage growth back to justifiable top lane levels rather than bot lane marksman levels, and perhaps remove Skystrike damage on champions altogether in favor of bonus damage on minions and monsters. \n\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-05-03T03:18:37.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically I would love for someone like Quinn to be buffed, but that will only make more ranged top laners viable, maybe if they buffed her base HP, regen, armor, and MR scalings I would be fine, just not that Lethality/Crit damage nightmare","replies":[]},{"poster":"MessyStuff","date":"2019-05-03T03:13:04.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's not exactly weak. https://champion.gg/champion/Quinn/Top?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-05-03T02:19:14.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Judging by your username, are you this guy?\nhttps://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FFXIV_Ultima_Weapon_Art1.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"SHIN0BU","date":"2019-05-03T02:41:48.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What the hell's that?","replies":[{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-05-03T02:54:40.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ultima weapon","replies":[{"poster":"SHIN0BU","date":"2019-05-03T15:45:10.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's it from?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-05-03T10:50:38.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adcs dont deserve buffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"pugsters3","date":"2019-05-03T04:38:16.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"girl needs a buff","replies":[]}]}
