They would say \"oh, I see, thanks for clearing that up\" and move on.\n\nAlthough this Board and the game both call for appropriate behavior in general terms, they are different places with different purposes. In game, you're supposed to use chat to work with your teammates and secure a victory. On the Player Behavior Board, the idea is to discuss the behavioral system and inform punished players as to how they can improve their behavior. If you see a comment on Boards that you find offensive or harassing, report it.\n\nMany people vote without commenting as an easy way of indicating whether they agree or disagree with the OP.\n\nTL;DR: Telling a toxic player exactly how they're being toxic isn't negative or unhelpful even if that player disagrees. Telling a toxic player that they did nothing wrong and the rules stink would be negative and unhelpful even if that player agrees.","replies":[{"poster":"Nimblepaw","date":"2019-05-30T09:54:48.378+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":11,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-05-30T11:21:02.020+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gabriyel,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WBEyecEE,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2019-05-30T09:54:48.378+0000)\n>\n> Your entire forum history is you going to posts and calling out the OP's toxic behavior and what you think they did wrong, in fact you left an extremely generic yet critical comment on one of my posts where I was asking if people thought I deserved my 14 day suspension.\n> \n> Edit: on top of this according to Op.gg and your league of legends match histories you haven't even played a game in 31 days, and summoners rift isn't even within your last 20 played games.. you are exactly the type of person this post is addressing.\n\nI also see a lot of posters bringing up irrelevant things to attack someone else about when they want to discredit them but wont address the argument.

If you come in saying \"this is absolutely wrong and dumb and stupid and this bad is ridiculous,\" while your log has, say, hate speech, I'll be extremely blunt. If you come in saying \"I'm really puzzled by this one and I'd like to prevent it happening again -- what was my issue here and how can I avoid it again?\" I'm likely to be *much* softer.\n\nIn the comment you specifically called out, the OP said the following:\n\n>...its gotten to the point where oneshotting the adc and typing in chat \"get off my screen\" is deemed toxic.\n>\n>...oops you said that jax with no full items at 45 minutes was useless, hey thats bad.\n>\n>...Im just so fucking sick of people being hyper sensitive to any criticism or somthing they dont like.\n\nHad the log not been full of obvious insults that a minute of self-reflection would have found were definitely above the \"get off my screen\" or \"calling someone bad\" level, I would have been much softer and more helpful in my tone (as I often am, if you look through my posting history).

They hold themselves to a pretty high standard of respectfulness and impartiality, so unless you've got evidence, I'm gonna have a hard time trusting what's already put forward as a subjective feeling.\n\nAnd, like KFCeytron said (though not precisely), more often than not, the people who come here asking about their punishments seldom actually want to or try to learn or understand; I can see how the responses to those players can be seen as putting them down, since, naturally, when folks are uncooperative, it's going to color the responses they get from people who initially try to help, but at the end of the day, it's a two-way street.\n\nIf one party isn't coming at the other even, the discussion isn't going to go anywhere, no matter how civil and respectful the other party tries to be.\n\nSo if people _really_ want to learn and improve, they wouldn't shut us out when we explain where they stepped over the line, and they wouldn't adamantly insist that they did no wrong, or that their behavior was justified by someone else's misbehavior - etc.\n\n> Most people are trying to learn, or at least get a secondary opinion about what they did.\n\nAgain; more often than not, we wind up seeing people shut out opinions that disagree with them. There are certainly a fair handful of people who do try to understand and learn, but the greater portion are looking for validation or an echo chamber.\n\nAnd you can explain the same stuff over and over 'til the cows come home, but if the person you're trying to explain it to refuses to hear it, then they're not gonna learn.\n\n> I actually feel like some of the comments on this forum would be getting you a chat penalty in game lol.\n\nSome, I've seen, yes. And typically, those comments also earn some form of punishment on the Forums when reported, too. Mostly comment/post pruning/removal, but sometimes warnings and temporary suspensions are used when someone is proven to be belligerent.\n\n> But am I the only one who's noticed this?\n\n\"Noticed\" is probably the wrong term to use here; at least, it's inconsistent with your opening by saying that what you perceive is \"feeling\". So, for the sake of semantics, I'm going to take this question as \"has anyone else felt this way\" instead of \"has anyone else noticed this\".\n\nAnd the answer is that there are doubtless some out there who feel the same way as you. I myself ain't one of them, being frank. I've hung around PB for a while, so I'm pretty well familiar with the way discussions go. While I can say that there are some (myself included) who could certainly do better to keep composed when people start throwing up walls, I wouldn't say that people frequently talk down to others.\n\n> Not to mention mysterious amounts of upvotes or downvotes that are multiple times the actual comments.\n\nDefine \"mysterious\".

I've done it myself a few times. People for whatever reason build up this preconception that criticism is always harsh (I.E., flame) and that banter between strangers is the same as banter between close friends (I.E., flame), and there are times when you need to hammer home that constructive criticism exists and that the abusive language that's fine between close friends and whomever won't fly with people who don't know (you).\n\nAnd, being human, we sometimes take the low road, like that.

Maybe they even wrote the manual. Maybe the answer is available not only in the manual, but via a quick Google search. Maybe they think the answer is so blatantly obvious that they're not sure if it's even a serious question.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Gabriyel,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WBEyecEE,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2019-05-30T10:28:58.458+0000)\n>\n> I found Kfc's comment on my thread to be lacking in thought, In fact I completely agree with Dynikus's summary of why I received my penalty, in what is the most upvoted comment on my thread.
