Seriously?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"So I'm in a low silver Game, I won my lane and it was something like 20-4 at the end of the game (even tho I won lane after 10 mins we just had no chance) I have people cussing at me, calling me names, the entire team is basically typing up a storm, and then suddenly they blame me for us losing the game and I responded basically it's not my fault, but we can't win.....  And then I get a 14 day ban? really?  My team was sitting in nexus trying to basically Open mid the game at the end, just typing at each other.. Why is it that I get penalized for pointing out that other players don't have any game impact, and that as a WHOLE our team CAN'T win?  This is not abusive behavior?  I can see my very first comment to Malzahar being toxic bc I firstblooded him 2 games in a row..     \n\nThe dumber bit, zyra (our supp) spam pinged me to help her, we both died, then the enemies killed themselves running into tower, and she started saying how stupid they are, then she tells me that i was r%%%%%ed.. it's not her fault I chose to come down (when she pinged me to do so..)   I used to just play mute all, and even then it was so rare to get an actual penalty.. I've legitimately got penalties for being abusive in games where I didn't speak on my jungler alt..  It just feels like if salty people decide to mass report me I end up with a penalty for disagreeing with them.  If someone says X was your fault and I say\nno, it was your fault, I've received penalties for being \"toxic.\"  It just doesn't even make sense to me anymore how this game operates. \n\n\nEDIT: Maybe I'll just go back to always playing mute all bc I've had people in low elo literally cuss me out bc they die to something silly and I type in an lol.  So tired of people cussing at me all game then I get penalized when I'm not even at a tenth of their intensity because of these report algorithms..\n\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nGabriyel: not trying to be mean but didnt I do the exact same thing to you last game malz\nGabriyel: no R XD\nGabriyel: underestimated the minion wave's damage there\nGabriyel: ummmmmmmmmmm\nGabriyel: ok\nGabriyel: gl with your lane then zyra\nGabriyel: >~>\nGabriyel: you have a lot in common\nGabriyel: I didnt think you could make yourself look dumber but I am impressed\nGabriyel: muted\nGabriyel: double muted\nGabriyel: wtf\nGabriyel: ok\nGabriyel: didnt realize my ignite which reveals you doesnt reveal your clone LOL\nGabriyel: you when you clone*\nGabriyel: welp\nGabriyel: this games over imho\nGabriyel: hard int top lane\nGabriyel: gg anyway\nGabriyel: I'm not mad, we just lost the game lol\nGabriyel: botlane has 0 impact\nGabriyel: useless af\nGabriyel: she sits behind me waiting to ks me *sigh*\nGabriyel: (zyra)\nGabriyel: hwut\nGabriyel: tfw u win lane and every else gets rofl stomped\nGabriyel: >.>\nGabriyel: LMAO\nGabriyel: what\nGabriyel: OK\nGabriyel: enjoy staying low elo where its never your fault\nGabriyel: I spoonfed nasus his ONLY kill\nGabriyel: he then went from 1-0 to 1-7\nGabriyel: then I took over his lane and died ONCE\nGabriyel: so according to my team I'm the reason wukong won top\nGabriyel: love low elo tilt\nGabriyel: welp, all I can say is I report toxic people\nGabriyel: also, team isnt leaving nexus except to cs so gg\nGabriyel: calling me r%%%%%ed is literally bannable so :I\nGabriyel: gg :)","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-05-29T04:53:40.903+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">Gabriyel: I didnt think you could make yourself look dumber but I am impressed\n>Gabriyel: hard int top lane\n>Gabriyel: botlane has 0 impact\n>Gabriyel: useless af\n\nNot the worst, but a bit negative.\n>Gabriyel: calling me r%%%%%ed is literally bannable so :I\n\nThis is most likely what did it though.

The system is based on given data (e.g. from the tribunal time) and is also constantly learning. Of course it is logical that the punishment is orientated what Riot as the company and a majority of people dislike seeing in-game **but** you will not always be banned because a certain amount of people disagree with it. I would rather word it as: \"If you break the rules, you will get banned. The rules are based on the opinion of Riot and the community\". \n\nNow you might ask: what's the difference?\n\nLast season I prefered playing Xerath as a support - I really did. And I played him as a true support - support items, warding, trying not to ks and so on. Three guesses who still had a problem with me. Right, often my ADC or other teammates. Picking him in champ-select? REEEEE, Julevi is trolling. Taking the kill because otherwise they would escape? REEE, no support just ksing. ADC dies because their own decision and not reacting to my pings/chat? REEEEEE, report!!111! Enemy team sees me? LOOOOL, Julevi is trolling, Xerath no gut, Xerath only midlane - should we report him? \nThat was my experience and gosh, I got reported so much for it (even when we won) - never ever received I so many threats or actual evidences (sent pictures in the post-game lobby) that they reported me. But you know what?\n\nI am still playing. Even when a lot of people didn't enjoy playing with me at that time it never ever broke the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"Nimblepaw","date":"2019-05-30T08:11:50.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This resonates with me, partly bc I recently spent 50 games learning aurelion sol support...\n\nA couple games I had 1-3 kills and 0 deaths by 15 minutes while my adc had more then 4 deaths and either zero, or 1 kill (which I made the play but I digress) and they inevitably start blaming me for not picking a tank, explaining that, in essence, a tank would be able to save them from themselves hahaha XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nimblepaw","date":"2019-05-30T08:09:47.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was a 30 minute game, I wasn't spamming. \n\nAlso I think I ended the match 2/9 or something, I didn't do well at ALL I just won the laning phase, like I said 20-4.
