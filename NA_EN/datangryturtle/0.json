I always have to wait for all 9 other players to connect and go in game before I'm able to get to the loading screen. This used to happen very rarely and now after the most recent patch it happens during every single game. I tried running a full repair and completely uninstalling and reinstalling the game and it worked for maybe 2 or 3 games before it came back and happened every game consistently. This bug makes the game very hard to play because I'm forced to join the game around 3-4 minutes (usually). It's happened where it takes me about 8 minutes or not at all. \nThis also only happens in league. I don't ever run into any connection errors outside of League.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-28T04:06:56.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you don't have any connection issues normally, it sounds like your network is having a hard time connecting you to our game servers for some reason.
