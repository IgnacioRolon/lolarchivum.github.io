If you know no one will care why even post it? It just makes you look like a baby that's blaming everyone else but yourself. If you want to carry then improve yourself, don't just cry about how you always get teamed up with shitters because if that's true then the enemy team is full of shitters and you should be able to beat them easily. It's way easier to never get banned in this game than it is to get banned, you have no one to blame but yourself for it. And if you used the skins in games for 6 years you're not really losing your money, unless you bought skins with the expectation that they would last for literally eternity which is stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"SourDeezNutts","date":"2017-01-11T02:25:19.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"the only reason im saying anything is bc i used to be able to play games and talk shit and have fun with people all the time like a year or so ago. now you get reported for saying \"you suck\". and get a 14 day chat ban or a 14 day account ban. its ridiculous. any salty person in the game that could be mad about any little thing you did could see you type a curse word and know you will get banned and report you. even if it wasn't hateful or something you said once without harping on them making them uncomfortable. and that can be just a few game out of like 60 you play and you can still get that same ban. like dang. at least make sure that its a malicious person before you permanently ban them. lol. for real.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Scar Face 60","date":"2017-01-11T03:51:04.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"why do you have to be an ahole to the guy ?","replies":[{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2017-01-11T04:49:27.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because he's being a whiny bitch","replies":[{"poster":"SourDeezNutts","date":"2017-01-11T05:15:15.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is exactly the type of player to try and convince a lobby to report you after the game.

FYI to allllll \"rioters with attitude or whoever toxic players that show up to judge, most Honest low elo players suffer from what he mentioned! and remember that high elo player are very low percentage of the whole player community ! it can't be all those are just bad across the years ! this simply means your methods can't easily define good players from bad ones in low elo....it can't just depend on winning and losing game ? what about a NEW scale for testing each player contribution in the game ? or each player skill level regardless of losing or winning...how about stopping the shitty LP dropping system!!! so you Only gain LP as you win and don't lose any if you lose, you only lose if you went AFK for example...what I mean is...it CAN BE ADJUSTED if they put their mind to it instead of a new champ every couple of months and TONS of useless ugly skins almost ever couple of weeks...\ninstead of talking trash to him you should consider making a difference. Also not every one like to be illegally \"elo boosted\" or \"carried by a friend\" or whatever people casually name pushing their idiot friends or their cyber fake girlfriends to gold on the cost of Honest players...\nand in case you don't know There are REAL SITES which offer boosting for like 15 or 20$ and real offers from many in-game players to boost for money or expensive skins. You need to get your shit straight people and not criticize others casually for speaking the truth.\nI'm Not considered an old player like him but I'm sure getting stuck for 6 years in low elo is pain to any of us ! which Only shows something in the system is not right. Not all players are good, many are trying and there should be a system to help them out not frustrate them. Now a days whenever I play a ranked game it MUST contain a pre-made duo...No one can laterally advance on his own easily now a days unless he's a preteen with No real life/job and he spends all of his time spamming league.","replies":[{"poster":"SourDeezNutts","date":"2017-01-11T05:13:06.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is what I was saying in better less frustrated words.","replies":[{"poster":"Scar Face 60","date":"2017-01-12T09:20:46.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm Not frustrated dude LOL, you are the one with the goodbyes and all:D...what I said was facts !

LOL if I want to leave I'd not care to send a good by message anyway. the fact is this...game will go on as long as people pay money, till something better comes to replace it and it will happen.

You are the unskilled player in most of your games, your ego got in your way of becoming good because you figured you knew better than them because you've been playing longer.
