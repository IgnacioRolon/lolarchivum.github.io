I HAD a lvl 30 account i&#039;ve had for 6 years and i&#039;ve never had a problem with getting banned very often, id receive reports here and there for the occasional tilt. Then somehow in the last few months i get a 14 day ban 2 chat bans and a perma ban in 2 months..... like for real Riot? Cant even say someone sucks anymore without getting 5 reports. idk if its the Babyshit soft community or the overly strict rules of Riot but it really has taken the fun out of the game for me.... i cant even have a back and forth with other summoners while competing? Has anyone ever been on a team and competed for something before? there is trash talking. alot of it. most of the time not very nice. i don&#039;t get why people get banned for it when they can just be muted and have chat filters to block out all the cursing if it really offends someone that much. i get if you are being racist/sexist/homophobic or just being a strait dick for absolutely no reason. but just saying someone is shit playing like a shit feeder gets me permanently banned? Come on people. I just got another ban on this account for talking shit to someone who was intentionally feeding bc they didnt get the lane they wanted. but i said some &quot;oh no bad words!&quot; and i got a ban for it and that asshat got one too for feeding on purpose. obviously people want to say stuff to those people. why would you encourage us to not interact with the person ruining the game im playing and making it not fun. you guys really care that much about the intentional feeders feeling after wasting 9 other real peoples time bc they dont get the lane they want? I say you tell everyone to stop acting like a bunch of soft babies and quit crying when someone says they are playing like trash. ill take all the criticism given to me right on the chin but it seems as if no one else can.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-09-29T11:57:18.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking this thread, as it appears to be pretty old.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-01-10T20:40:07.922+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"To put it simply, the average player doesn't want to be forced to play with an asshole for 20-60min.

It's more likely that this match was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak.  If you have received this many punishments recently, that is a sign from Riot that the behaviors you have been displaying are no longer acceptable.  The problem is not that other people are too sensitive and cannot take your trash-talk.  The problem is that you are not listening when Riot point blank tells you to stop treating the other players in your matches this way.  And after Riot tells you to stop 3 times and you don't, they do not tell you again.  They simply take the account away.  \n\nYou ask if anyone has ever been on a team and competed for anything before.  When I was in high school I competed in Track & Field, Cross Country, Cheerleading, and was part of a nationally ranked competition Choir.  When I was in college I competed in national and international Judo tournaments and I've competed against two different Olympic athletes.  Yes, I've competed.  \n\nTrash-talking is not necessary.  It does not make you play better, it does not make your teammates play any better, and it's dishonorable to the spirit of sportsmanship.  Many competitive sports not only discourage trash-talking and negative behavior, they actively punish players for it.  Why do you think players can no longer spike footballs in the NFL or excessively dance in the endzone?  They'd be fined thousands of dollars for it.  If someone spouted off some of the things I've read in chat logs in this board at an Olympic Judo match, they would be disqualified and thrown out.","replies":[{"poster":"SourDeezNutts","date":"2017-01-11T01:06:37.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"thats not competing on a team first of all besides cheer leading. in what instance would you trash talk in choir or a 1v1 sport? or track? but i guess since its a free online game their are probably a lot of emotionally unstable pople stuck on thier computer screens for a life and cant stand to see a curse word on their screen. o well. guess this isnt the community for me. bunch of sissies.","replies":[{"poster":"PROJECT Fizz","date":"2017-01-11T03:51:45.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SourDeezNutts,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gbH8eGuI,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-01-11T01:06:37.318+0000)\n>\n\n> in what instance would you trash talk in choir or a 1v1 sport? or track?\n \nYou'd be surprised how competitive choir can be. I'm saying this from the point of view of a guy whose school normally ranked high in our regional and state competitions. Seriously, it can be pretty cutthroat. \n\n1v1 sports are as competitive and shit talking as it gets. Sure, there isn't a team to badmouth, but isn't the point to be honorable in victory and graceful in defeat (aka don't be an ass?)\n\nAnd track? Don't get me started. Where I come from, it was always competitive. No one decided to be an asshole. Sure, there was messing around. But I grew up in a _very_ small area. The whole everyone knows everyone. So, we could mess with each other because we knew it wouldn't hurt anyone.\n\nBut on the internet, it is WAY different. You don't know the people your mistreating. You have no clue how it could affect them. So finally:\n\n>bunch of sissies.\nIs it so damn hard to ask you to have the smallest _sliver_ of human decency? All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, or at the least don't be an ass.\n\nIf you can't manage that, then this community is no place for you.\n\nBest of luck\nP Fizz","replies":[{"poster":"SourDeezNutts","date":"2017-01-11T05:09:16.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one is even getting the point of this. Which is another reason why I can't believe this community. Talking shit is fun when it's not being personal or making the other person into something lesser. I don't make fun of people without regard and make them cry that's stupid. It's mostly ass holes that will have a comback for everything you say and provoke you then report you and get you banned. I don't pick on people unless it's someone who is obviously either inting or completely refusing to coordinate with the team. That's about the only time I ever actually say something mean.
