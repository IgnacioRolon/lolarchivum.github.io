He dashes around at the speed of light and makes trading very near impossible through his passive. Not only does he have that but he also has his w that blocks _all_ ranged attacks, effectively punishing players for playing champions that should be what counter him.\n\nNow if this wasnt bad enough he also gets twice the auto attacks thanks to his q which makes his damage just absurd due to them scaling with attack speed. What i think could be a potential fix to this problem would be if riot increased Yasuo's q cooldown by 2 seconds and made it scale off cdr. This would make him easier to beat in lane and would thus make yasuo live up to the fantasy of a high skill carry as opposed to what his current state is. Right now yasuo falls short of what his high risk high reward play style should be and is one of the safest mid lane picks in the game, but by nerfing some of the raw power of his q he would feel more fair and like there is counterplay.\n\nedit: you guys are mean i spent 2 and a half hours on this and you guys called me bad. im done trying to help the game if you guys arent going to be more supportive and appreciative of my ideas. maybe my mom was right and i really am just a disappointment","replies":[{"poster":"Highlord Crime","date":"2019-03-01T05:12:55.073+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Celestial Lion12","date":"2019-03-01T05:14:19.039+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"my reaction exactly what is this guy talking about","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-03-01T06:11:12.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"w that blocks all ranged attacks\"\n*insert yasuo getting melted by vel'koz ult through a wind wall here*","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-01T06:14:50.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Apex,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3o2TPgG0,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-03-01T06:11:12.251+0000)\n>\n> \"w that blocks all ranged attacks\"\n> *insert yasuo getting melted by vel'koz ult through a wind wall here*\n\n_insert Yasuo getting hit by Annie Q through a wind wall here_\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56FGCPUPeYE","replies":[{"poster":"Ranmiaku","date":"2019-03-01T07:23:24.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3o2TPgG0,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2019-03-01T06:14:50.450+0000)\n>\n> _insert Yasuo getting hit by Annie Q through a wind wall here_\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56FGCPUPeYE\n\nLOL the annie q going through is a bug, and other than that velkoz and lux ults are the only things that go through the windwall, so not sure what point you're trying to make","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-01T07:33:04.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ranmiaku,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3o2TPgG0,comment-id=000700000001,timestamp=2019-03-01T07:23:24.999+0000)\n>\n> LOL the annie q going through is a bug, and other than that velkoz and lux ults are the only things that go through the windwall, so not sure what point you're trying to make\n\nIt's hilarious.\n\nP.S.: Xerath Q, Ziggs R, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Ranmiaku","date":"2019-03-01T22:55:19.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3o2TPgG0,comment-id=0007000000010000,timestamp=2019-03-01T07:33:04.958+0000)\n>\n> It's hilarious.\n> \n> P.S.: Xerath Q, Ziggs R, etc.\n\nwell yeah thats true haha,and yeah xerath q because its a laser, like velkoz r and lux r, but ziggs ult etc dont go through the windwall, they go over the windwall","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-03-01T06:17:20.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All we need now is every ranged ult being to go through yasuo's wind wall.\nBecause it's annoying to wait every minute or two for an ult to be blocked.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Light Burner","date":"2019-03-01T05:21:22.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":17,"body":"Played against one today as lux carried the shit out of the game.

It's really annoying to keep seeing the same arguments made where if you check the numbers theyre just inaccurate. \n1st claim: he dashes around at the speed of light making it impossible to trade with.

Absurd in what way? After he had shiv+edge? Does he want him to deal no dmg by that point. Like its okay for veigar to pop someone with his R syndra the same, lux can pop multiple people and so on but a melee auto attacker who has to risk himself to do dmg isnt allowed that much dmg?\n4th claim: one of the safest picks in mid lane. (Where does this claim come from) most mages are safer picks than yasuo in mid lane due to their scaling and range into the late game teamfight.\n5th claim: High risk high reward (where does this claim come from) He doesnt need early game kills to scale well into mid and late game and has a 2 item power spike. He has  a strong level 1 and maybe 2 as well but besides that hes not really that strong and his ult isnt that easy to set up alone.\n\nSo again how many times does this need to be repeated on the boards before it fades and people learn how to play against him. As for the cdr claim if he's against yasuo's wind wall making yasuo's Q scale on cdr would then force yasuo players to build cdr also scaling down the cdr on wind wall and theyd have to increase the duration that yasuo can hold his nado and we'd be back to tri force tank yasuo.
