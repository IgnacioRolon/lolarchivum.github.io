Going ER first actually makes you weak considering sivir is an autoattacker not a caster due to high cd and mana cost on q which deals significantly less damage if multiple targets are hit. If u build her to auto attack she can actually have a strong midgame with auto w auto q,\n\nLucian gets away with building ER because he has all damage spells that also make his passive fire off a lot more. Sivir's ER only benefits q because w cd is already low, mana cost is decent and her e and ulti gain nothing from ER.","replies":[]}
