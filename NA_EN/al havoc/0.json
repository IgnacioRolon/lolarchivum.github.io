He just is a frequent play and has a lot of bad teams. It's not his performance doing bad.\n\nHe also always succeeds in solo taking 5-6 turrets. He never has lane problems. His KDA is reasonable. His damage output is high.\n\nAlso, you're quoting the wrong win rate:\n\nhttps://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Tryndamere/ 50.9%\n\nThey are taking 2 seconds off his highest damage skill, AND his mobility skill. He literally can chase someone forever now. There is no double wall jumps anymore.\n\nThis means he can Spin> Slow a runner, AA, AA, AA.....Spin > Slow runner.\n\nWith this change he's going to be a Nasus strength hitter who isn't impeded by walls.","replies":[{"poster":"BEK Makadur","date":"2018-06-27T22:38:13.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3153}}  Is mostly played in Korea.\n{{item:3026}} Dont know since when this is a core tryn item.\nAlso old {{item:3031}} costed 200 less than it does now, even tho most people did build {{item:3508}} for the 30%cdr.\n{{item:3046}} Yes 300 Gold.\n\nAka. price went up by 500 and the building path is worse because of 2 B.F. swords.\n\nJust alot of bad team? That would mean that that is a thing specific for tryn...\n\nThere is no such thing as \"always\" in league.\n\nWin rate vrie from source to source thats true, but i also like to look at the overall winrate with bronze, silver and gold included. Especially since most people who complain about tryn are bronze and silver.\n\nTryn lost 30%cdr because of the essence reaver change and with the new nerf to rageblade he also looses alot of dmg.\n\nI think that a buff for tryn was definetly a reasonable thing, maybe the E wasnÂ´t the right choice but still a reasonable one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Al Havoc","date":"2018-08-19T19:40:11.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Makadur,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7Ufd9nTs,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-06-27T21:40:35.299+0000)\n>\n> His core items got more expensive and rageblade got nerfed, also without old ER he lost cdr.\n> \n> Also where does he have the highest jg winrate?
