At a recent meeting, we were talking about some mage champions and how we felt about their Mana usage, and one of the things we got to talking about was that it would be nice to feel like there were greater benefits to being a Mana champion, because Mana serves almost exclusively as a tool to restrict champions in the early game.\n\nIt would be really cool if there was a world where people could feel good about their champion being a Mana user, because it provided them with really cool itemization and playstyle options, or maybe it had really powerful late game implications. Unfortunately, it's just mostly used as a tool to hold harrass and sustain patterns back in the early game, and there are probably opportunities for us to utilize it better.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-11-27T07:15:10.934+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that not the main purpose of mana, though? To be a type of resource that restricts you in the long run, but not so much in short trades? Aka, a resource that limits your sustain in lane and long sieges, but not in teamfights and short skirmishes? And you can play around these limitations by careful mana management (playstyle) or lowering the restriction through dedicated itemization.\n\nMeanwhile, energy is a different resource that limits you in short trades, but not in the long run due to its fast regeneration. Meaning, not a limit in lane, but a great limit in teamfights - the antithesis to mana. Additionally, the pattern generated by energy makes CdR a less desirable stat.\n\nBefore the changes to Banshee's all the way back, it used to be more suited to mana users than to manaless champs. Additionally, manaless APs will never get as much AP or CdR as mana-using ones - both high AP and high CdR are mostly tied to items giving either mana or mana regen. Same goes for tanks, for whom the high CdR values are coupled to high mana values.\n\n----\n\nP.S.: How are you feeling about 5.23 Quinn? Is she performing to your expectation?
