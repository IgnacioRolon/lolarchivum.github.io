I, for one, am not interested at all: I don't dislike (actual) chess, but I find this mode weird. I think Riot somewhat assumed DOTA's user base was comparable to League's, which is at least partially wrong, in my opinion, because I believe League's players are averagely younger (and therefore less likely to be interested in a pseudo-auto chess game mode).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-06-27T04:13:49.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most of that is just windows 8/10 or games that were built upon proprietary software (like whatever it is for fallout 3 that was a microsoft product)\n\none OS will have fine backwards compatibility and then the next has a storm of problems\n\nconsidering most fixes are EASY to implement (almost all of them just requiring a file be present in order for things to run...), it's rather sad that they pretty much just lie about that part (the modes ran on the new client...it was the new client that started glitching and causing queues to crash, rotating game modes not to show up, etc)\n\ntypically the complicated game fixes are where the source code has to be rewritten (such as for available memory (some games were programmed to take everything available), resolution (things made for lower resolution show up small if not scaled\n\nhowever...what is usually not complicated...is literally just moving something.
