When I go to log into League, the login screen is very small, as is the client after I log in. When i get into game things are okay, but when I set the in game resolution to the same resolution as my computer's, everything in game gets very small. I can't seem to figure out what resolution to set my game at or to figure out how to fix this problem. I don't want to lower my laptop's screen resolution to 1920x1080, even though it fixes my problem, the overall quality drop is very noticeable.\r\n\r\nIf you have any answer to my problem I would very much appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"SpAnUrEd","date":"2016-09-18T01:19:02.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the same boat. there is nothing we can do about this right now its all about riot rescaling the font sizes for the new resolution. trust me its killing me also it looks so beautiful at the 4k but makes the game harder. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-20T21:09:06.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice rig, that's quite a resolution!  The game doesn't fully support your resolution currently, and you may need to scale down to the 1920x1080.  The issue you are having can also happen through alt+tabbing.

Text and icon scaling would be enough for the beginning. We write 2016 and 4k is rising fast.","replies":[]}]}]}
