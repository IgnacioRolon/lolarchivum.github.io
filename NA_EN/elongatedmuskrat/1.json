Very frequently, in game, my game will become unresponsive and lag even though my ping stays at 40. Eventually it will tell me \"Attempting to Reconnect\" and I do reconnect, however, by that time I have either died or I've been afk in base or under tower.\r\n\r\nHas this happened to anyone else? If so, how did you fix it (or did you even fix it)?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T18:30:04.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble maintaining a connection and causing you to get kicked off.  The game requires a constant connection, so if it can't communicate information to you then you'll have delays or issues like this.  I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide which will provide a series of steps to get this fixed up.  Hopefully, this will get you back in game!","replies":[]}]}
