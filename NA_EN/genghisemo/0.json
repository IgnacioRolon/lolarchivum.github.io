They will not load, it won&#039;t even crash when they fail to load. It is just an Eternal Limbo of a Black Screen and nothing more. Way to get out is to End Task or Launch another LoL client that will forcibly close the one that failed to spectate.\r\n\r\nThank God the actual matches i play still load and I experience no lag (ping 17, yep it&#039;s good). FPS is stable at 60 fps (locked it at that since  i  noticed the fps is most stable  at 60 fps locked, i could go a bit higher). So i really doubt this is my internet connection  or my hardware (not submitting a ticket, i know Riot Support is real good about actually helping people who submit tickets with  generic things  that blame me even when i barely have minor packet loss or barely have a drop in fps or the rare lag spike).\r\n\r\nNoticed a few other bugs, like auto attacks failing to hit even when the projectile lands, the animation plays our of target being hit, and you hear the noise. Yet target lives with Miss Fortune.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Miss Fortune issue includes her Q. I can Shoot a Q and like 1 out of 4 times approx will fail to actually register even when  it sounds like the target was last hit and that a second  was supposed  to take the 150% damage. If i recall, there are different sounds  that Riot stated were included to help give feedback that a Q last hit a minion and ricocheted to another target to deal the 150% damage. Yet i see nothing visually that the target actually took damage nor do i get the gold.","replies":[{"poster":"FriendGuutsu","date":"2015-07-23T05:27:06.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this problem as well in terms of the spectating bug. Either the screen will be pure black and it will fail to connect to the spectating server, or it might by chance get to the loading screen portraits but freeze again with people at random percentages.","replies":[{"poster":"HBTourSlam","date":"2015-07-23T06:44:20.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The spectating is not working for me.

So you can spectate through frontpage, but if you try to spectate a friends' game through your friends list, it doesn't work?\n\nCan you try to spectate a game by creating a custom lobby with a friend and a bot and putting yourself in the spectator slot? What happens when you try to spectate via friends list? Do you just not have the option, or you click it and nothing happens?","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-01-22T20:49:55.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know someone who was having an issue with this for quite a while actually.
