(I know I sound like a baby but...)","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday I had a 75ish % winrate on Teemo and 100% on Garen (for the last 20 ranked games). Point I&#039;m trying to make is I&#039;m not a *bad* player. Earlier today (around the time Riot started &quot;investigating issues with matchmaking&quot;), I started losing *every game*. And not just losing. These were stomps. All five enemies were going 15/1/20 while my team lost horribly, like the kind of losing that you would get flamed for if EVERYONE weren&#039;t also losing. In case you don&#039;t believe me, here are some links:\r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2824630358/238192276?tab=overview\r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2824637261/238192276?tab=overview\r\n(^Teemo vs Garen, should have been an easy win)\r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2825164559/238192276?tab=overview\r\n\r\nIf this turns out to be just me sucking, or bad luck, or whatever, then that&#039;s fine. But, like, if it&#039;s a bug, I just wanna stop losing, ya know? Because usually at least one opponent gets fed and one of my teammates dcs, but I can deal with that as long as we have some chance.

In a perfect dream world, every game would be 5 people playing perfectly of evenly match skill where the tiniest mistake in the end is the only deciding factor, a true nailbiter of games, but this is the real world. You can't expect five random people to play perfectly every game. It isn't Riot trying to punish you, or hate you, or whatever, there are too many factors to get both teams even and too many factors beyond that to ensue that your allies don't feed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Killer1123581321","date":"2018-07-13T04:49:13.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL welcome to my week https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2825125788/235149774?tab=overview\nI like how Riot introduces these ~~cashgrabs~~ events to try to get people to play matches as different champs, but matchmaking is so fucked that its a choice between picking one of the meta champs and praying you don't get stuck on the short bus, or a loss.\n\nNothing will happen though.
