I have outplayed Yasuo's with Veigar. Hell I bring him top lane for lols and still win against people like Xin Zhao.

I think he's just over reliant on his E, that's all. His kit was designed with it in mind, and he can feel great when you can pull it off. But there's too much mispotential in his kit for me not to be slightly upset by it.

People knock the double Q but I tend to double Q about half of my Q stacks. And if I can't I try to harass with my second hit to help keep them off me. I invest in mana regen and CDR to make sure I have a faster ramp up. 40% CDR means faster AP farm and faster power spike as well as less downtime late game (48s CD ult OP af).\n\nI personally prefer the build which minimizes his weaknesses: {{item:1056}} -> {{item:3028}} -> {{item:3070}} -> {{item:3174}} -> {{item:3158}} -> {{item:3040}} -> {{item:3089}} -> {{item:3135}}/{{item:3157}} ->{{item:3157}} /{{item:3135}}\n\n40% CDR is huge and the mana regen and pool are also major on him. Most people underestimate having double chalice passives (his passive acts like chalice).\n\nI would personally like to see his W being made somewhat easier to hit without landing the stun or relying on it.

RIP.\n\nExcept that I generally have 600+ AP by 25 minutes. It's not even late game at that point. The point is you can contribute a lot more and your build has more utility in it.  600 AP is enough to make you contribute more than the average mid laner in fights especially with 40% CDR. You get used to sitting back and farming. It isn't that hard, they even buffed his Q range to let him do it more. And building mana regen lets you sit back and do it all game.\n\nI am 19/12 with Veigar in ranked since his rework.
