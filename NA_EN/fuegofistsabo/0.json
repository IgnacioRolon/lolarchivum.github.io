I would like to know how can i get this removed because i want to play i had to make another account because the same thing happened to my last account but it wouldnt let me earn loot.","replies":[{"poster":"FuegoFIstSabo","date":"2016-11-12T20:00:18.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can u get perma banned from loot if the game keeps loading slow an it says your afk?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T00:48:12.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A *low-priority queue* cannot affect your loot eligibility as a whole. If you go AFK or leave a match, you *will* be ineligible to earn loot from that **single match**.\n\nYou cannot receive an LPQ for disconnecting from a single match, and it, in fact, takes a *trend of disconnections* before you'll see a penalty like this. Regardless of intention, a disconnection negatively affects everyone in the match, which is big reason why all disconnections are treated equally and why we cannot remove penalties.\n\nI hope this clears up your confusion around what happened. Let me know if you have any questions or any further issues.","replies":[]}]}
