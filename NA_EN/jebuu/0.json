Basically, in champion select the countdown for ban or pick goes to zero, i can still chat with people but eventually my turn to pick/ban comes around and I cannot select anything. I am getting 30 minute penalties now everytime that happens. I have seen many people post about this, I do not know why it has not been fixed/there is no help on the support page for this.
