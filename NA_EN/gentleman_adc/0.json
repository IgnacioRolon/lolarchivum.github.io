The Forgot password thing has been clicked and no emails have been sent. he sent an Email to service support and they sent blitz bot who asked for info he gave the info and now its over 36 hours later and still no help. He asked me to post this because he can't even get on here. Please he hasn't played in 2 months because stuff was happening he just got a new job and wanted to play and mystery gift with his friend. Please this is ridiculous its an honesty mistake and he hasn't been able to log on for 3 days. can a riot employee get in touch with us thru phone or email this shouldn't take more then 1 min to fix he has his original password he has no idea why it isn't working and he sent like 20 pieces of info that \"blitzbot\" wanted. This shouldn't be something that takes 3 days to fix and There should be a way for people to check their tickets on here when they have forgotten their passwords.","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman ADC","date":"2016-09-28T22:01:17.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. Thats good to know its just a little stressful because we never even got a confirmation that \"blitzbot\" received my responses to the list of league info needed and that was sent at 2:07 AM ET 9/27/16. It just would be relaxing if we could be told that the ticket is still open or something it just sucks that the \"forgot Password\" button thing isn't working or this would of been finished quickly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T21:56:43.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can take a bit for our account team to investigate the case and respond.  The ticket with the information requested by the auto-reply was escalated to our account team.  They will review the case and respond as soon as possible.  Your brother will be in good hands!","replies":[]}]}
