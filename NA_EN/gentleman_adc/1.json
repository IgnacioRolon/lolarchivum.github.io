Having so many at once can cause some delay or confusion in responding, so it's likely all but one will be closed for consistency.  The ticket will be escalated to our account team who will look into this!  It's important your brother doesn't reply to the ticket until he receives a response, otherwise it can drop his ticket to the bottom of the queue.  In the meantime, he can also try using our [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) to help with his recovery or prepare for any questions he may be asked.  We will respond to the ticket as soon as possible!","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman ADC","date":"2016-09-30T15:52:10.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you. I told him to stop a few days ago so he hasn't sent another request I told him to be patient. We just wanted to make sure one was still open. Thank you. THe account recovery thing for some reason wasn't working which is weird because he said he forgot it in past(bad patterns) and it worked that time.","replies":[]}]}]}
