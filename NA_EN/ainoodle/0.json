Fortunately though, your Honor is now unlocked and is progressing at a steady rate. Work to keep your behavior as positive as you can and cooperate with your team, and you should soon see your Honor grow. :)","replies":[{"poster":"ccam0498","date":"2017-11-18T17:52:51.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about my honor can you check why mine is still stuck at level 0 even though i got a message saying i was doing much better in my games with not leaving ect","replies":[]}]}]}
