However, I've noticed that in champ select and in game that the langauge filter is some how turned back on and censors words. I've looked through the settings in game and there is not a different place to enable it. So I was wondering why the filter settings are being different when I'm in the main menu and when I'm in game. So I was curious to if anybody else is having this happen to them as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T00:06:53.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client may be having issues disabling the feature. This is a fairly rare issue we see pop up in the Beta Client. You should be able to resolve this with the steps listed below:\n\n>**1.** Launch League and Log in then minimize the client\n**2.** Navigate to the Config Folder *(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config)* and open the **LCUAccountPreferences.yaml** file with Notepad any other text editor\n**3.** Find the line that says \"**chatFilterDisabled: false**\" and change it to **\"chatFilterDisabled: true\"**\n**4.** Save the changes you made to this file in your text editor, then close League and relog.\n**5.** Your chat filter should show as disabled after checking your settings (cog in top-right of the Client) under your *Chat & Friends* section.\n\nAfter taking those steps, hop into a custom match to confirm the changes went through and that everything is working as intended. Let me know if this worked for you, please! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hagrids Double ","date":"2017-01-11T02:21:37.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I did what you said and when I opened it in Notepad it already said the \"chatFilterDisabled: true\" so I deleted the true and retyped it to see if it would work and it did not.
