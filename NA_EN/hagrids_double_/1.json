Or is level four the first level in which you can get these capsules from getting honored post game? I can't remember what was said for this and if you were supposed to get those capsules for reaching level four I have yet to recieve them. Thank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-08-26T20:26:58.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get honor capsules if your honor level is 3 or higher.\n\nNote that honor capsules can't actually exceed your normal monthly key drop cap, so if you have already hit your key drop cap for the month you will not see honor capsules drop until next month.","replies":[{"poster":"Hagrids Double ","date":"2017-08-26T20:50:59.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"odd I never got an honor capsule the whole time I was honor 3 all i ever got was key fragments and thats honestly all I have ever gotten from honor 3 and honor 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T20:47:05.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quepha hit the nail on the head here, but I wanted to add that these capsules are random drops. You aren't necessarily guaranteed a drop, but it sounds like most people have seen one after their total number of available key fragment drops refreshes.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-27T21:02:15.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so if i don't get one after it refreshes do i need to wait one month?
