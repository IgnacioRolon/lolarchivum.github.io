Today when I logged on I saw that I have received the Devil Teemo one and figured that the pumpkin one would also be right after it but it was not. So I was wondering if those were still being sent out or if the mystery chests dont count as gifts towards earning that icon. Was just curious. Thank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-09T00:35:31.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Icons are stilling rolling out, with an aim to finish by the 17th per the [Teemoing ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/the-teemoing-2016)page.
