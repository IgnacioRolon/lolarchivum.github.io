Originally I didn't have a problem with it but a couple friends did. However, the past three days I have been getting it as well. I've cleaned my computer, League has been the only thing running, and I know my internet connection isn't that bad. So I was wondering if there was anything being fixed?","replies":[{"poster":"karuaan","date":"2016-10-27T06:26:19.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are same issues in NA.

In that case, I strongly recommend working through the steps inside of our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are pristine and compatible with League. A lot of latency (ping) issues are caused by unoptimized network settings that simply don't play well with League.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
