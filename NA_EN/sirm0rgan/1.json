We were doing well and I had gotten my ADC nicely fed (like a good supp main) and my team being the competent individuals that they were, ended the game quickly.  And I got demoted.  Why in the hell does it count as a loss?  I understand not letting it count as a win, and I understand that leaving games ruins it for other people, but when you&#039;ve carried hard enough that your team wins even in your absence, why does it count as a _loss_?","replies":[]}
