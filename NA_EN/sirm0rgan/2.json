Nothing you can do about it.  Happens to everyone.  Obnoxiously, if the client crashes twice in a row, you get a timer for leaving.  It&#039;s not really a big deal, only 5 minutes for 5 games, but it still sucks, if only because it wasn&#039;t actually your fault.  Riot&#039;s game crashes, and you lose LP/get a timer and meanwhile, you have team mates who actually rage quit but get no penalty because they keep running around in base/afk farming.  I can&#039;t think of a way to penalize the afk farmers (sometimes it really is best to avoid fights and powerfarm) but it seems like the leaverbuster could be tuned to at least exclude some cases where the client crashed through no fault of the user.  \r\n\r\nThe following are some suggestions for how the system could be adjusted to focus more on intentional leavers rather than the chronically unlucky:\r\n\r\n* Give the option to send an error report when the game crashes to show that it wasn&#039;t your fault.  \r\n* Scan chat to see if they had talked about leaving.  \r\n* Look at scores to see if a rage quit is even remotely likely\r\n* Take into account how long they were actually AFK (i.e. disconnect at the very end of a game and still get penalized for leaving because the game ended before you could reconnect)\r\n* How many times they attempted a surrender vote\r\n* If team wins in your absence, only get penalized if someone actually reports you.\r\n* If your team wins a ranked game in your absence, leave your LP unadjusted\r\n\r\nThis list isn&#039;t meant to be exhaustive, but the combination of these factors would go a long way to make the leaver buster system more fair.  Failing promos to next league with 3 wins because your client crashed right as your team took baron and they ended before you could reconnect is bad enough, you don&#039;t need a timer on top of it.\r\n\r\nBest of luck in the rift guys, and may your fps be steady and your ping low\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
