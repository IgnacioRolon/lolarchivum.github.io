His success depends almost entirely on his ability to maintain distance from his opponents, but once the distance is closed, he has no ability counter play at all.  This would be a manageable disadvantage, but he has very low mobility, and insufficient CC and consequently, any player with a dash (or willing to burn flash) gets a free kill on Xerath whenever his flash is down, regardless of skill, champion level, or build.  This sounds like a pretty extreme statement, but hear me out before you call me crazy.\n\nFirst lets review his kit:\nP:  Mana surge; Grants mana for auto attacks, half as much against minions and monsters.  Has a 12 second cooldown.\nQ: Arcanopulse; Very long range, high damage, short cooldown.  Very high mana cost, but all around a very good skill.  \nW: Eye of Destruction;  Long range, good damage, applies a 2.5 second 10% slow on the outer ring, and a rapidly decaying 70% slow on the inner \nring.  Costs only slightly less mana than Arcanopulse, but is a decent skill nonetheless.\nE:  Shocking Orb;  Long range, relatively low damage, and applies a stun that lasts .5 to 2 seconds depending on distance traveled.\nR:  Rite of the Arcane; Amazing range (especially after level 11), good damage, roots Xerath in place while he&#039;s firing, .8 second delay between firing each shot.\n\nSince this discussion is intended to center mostly around players with a high mastery on Xerath, we&#039;ll forget about the inherent difficulties of playing ap characters that are 100% skillshot based, and we won&#039;t get into the details of why his passive is almost useless late game or why it is a major source of conflict within his kit.  For now I just want to focus on why its so critical fro him to maintain a long distance from his enemies, and why he isn&#039;t able to do that right now. \n\nThe trouble with this kit is that both E and R become unusable at close range.  A .5 second stun doesn&#039;t do much to help you escape, the damage from it is low, and the cooldown is long.  Similarly, while the damage from R is good, the fact that it locks all other abilities, roots Xerath in place, and has a delay between each shot prevents it from being useful in close combat.  This leaves Xerath with only 2 useful abilities up close neither of which is an escape, and then he&#039;s down to auto attacks, which don&#039;t do much damage, but hey, at least he&#039;ll die with a full mana bar.\n\nAt this point you may be thinking to yourself, &quot;Having trouble at close range is just the price you pay for having good long range skills, just practice keeping your distance and you should be fine.&quot;  and you would be right too, if his kit made that possible.  \n\nThe trouble is once again with the E, but this time also W a little bit, but still mostly E.  Unlike most (all?) other stuns in the game, Shocking Orb does not cancel abilities or stop dashes (this might actually be a bug).  This means that even if you land your stun on an approaching champion with a dash and a stun, snare, or knock up, it still won&#039;t help you escape if they started their dash ability before your orb actually hit them.  Even worse are the champions who can&#039;t be hit during their dash.  On any other champion, you would just wait until they use their dash but on Xerath, waiting also means forfeiting most of the duration of the stun.  If Eye of Destruction applied a longer/stronger/less rapidly decaying slow or if Xerath was naturally a bit faster, you might be able to use it to put enough distance between him and his opponent after the dash for his stun to become meaningful again, but a 70% slow that decays rapidly just isn&#039;t enough to give him that space.  I know that every champion has hard counters, but the size of the list resulting from just this issue is huge.\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:84}}  {{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:81}}  {{champion:9}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:121}}  {{champion:7}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:238}} \nThen you have to add to the list any Champion that&#039;s just plain fast or has teleports\n{{champion:86}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:163}} \nThen account for the ones that can use spell shields to ignore your stun\n{{champion:114}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:15}} \nThen all the ones who can close the distance just by walking up to you\n{{champion:28}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:29}} \nAnd on top of those lists, you can start adding all the champs that counter Xerath in ways other than closing the distance to negate 2 of his abilities.\n\nI could keep adding to the list, but I don&#039;t need to to make my point.  Honestly, what other champion has more than 60 hard counters?  Xerath will always be my favorite champ, but until he&#039;s given more mobility and his stun is fixed, he just isn&#039;t viable at higher levels of play where opponents know to dive him.\n\nGoodbye old friend\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"1st Movement","date":"2016-10-13T11:52:05.116+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"... maybe if you understand xearth kit wasnt meant to be a melee champion then you would differ \n\nXearth is a siege Mage that excels at sniping off targets \n\nHis two cc is enough to help him\n\nConsidering how you play him as a support is prolly why \n\nXearth is in a good spot","replies":[{"poster":"SirM0rgan","date":"2016-10-13T12:14:42.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Of course he's not meant to be melee.

All of Xerath&#x27;s abilities out-range Zenith Blade.\n\nActually, Zenith blade has a range of 875, Eye of Destruction has a range of 1000 but has a .7 second delay before it lands.  That gives you a 125 unit margin of error which is pretty hard to play around.\nShocking Orb does have a range of 1050, but travels slowly enough that if she's already moving toward you when you fire, she'll be in range of you just before it hits her.  If she procs a speed boost from activating her shield, She's almost gauranteed to be well within range of hitting you with Zenith Blade before your stun lands.\n\nAmumu is even more dangerous, because bandage toss has a range of 1100, and he doesn't even have to actually hit you with it, just a target  semi close to you (minion, monster, derpy team mate).  Even if he's all alone, 2 levels under you and half health, do you really think you can finish him off with only 2 abilities before he ults and finishes you off?  Let's say that you're level 13, and just for argument sake, say you have 400 AP already, and you have Q and W maxed.  You will be able to do a maximum of 1080 magic damage total, 1452 if you manage to get a shot off on your ult which is 1652 if that procs thunderlords.  Lets further assume that he has built no magic resist whatsoever  (unlikely if you're doing well enough to have 400 AP at level 13), and only has what is natural to him at level 11.  You deal a total of 1156 damage, and then you're down to Auto attacks, which might add another 120 damage if you get off two of them?  So now our total is 1276.  We assumed that Amumu was at half health when he dove you, so that means that for him to survive this play, he only needs a total of 2552 max health.  Without Items, at level 11, Amumu has 1350 health so he would only need to have built items that grant him a total of 1202 health.  Health costs ~2.67 gold per point, so if he's managed to accumulate more than 3210 gold by the time he reaches level 11 (ridiculously low requirement), he's been able to buy what he needs to be able to know that he'll survive the play.  Odds are he's actually accumulated more than 3210 gold by level 11, has magic resist, and probably also has the capacity to deal more than 1350 damage it would require to finish off a heavily CCd Level 13 Xerath.  At this point, even if you get away (which you might), you would have lost the trade against a level 11 Amumu with no mr at half health, and for the rest of the game, that Amumu will have every reason imaginable to spend the rest of the game trying to make you his personal bitch every time you get within 1100 units of him, and if he manages to land the bandage toss, there will never be anything you can do about it.  This means you either stay under tower forever (impractical), hide in the middle of your team (not gonna go well in team fights), or start apologizing to your team for feeding Amumu (good luck trying to explain to them the details of how a melee character out-ranged you as Xerath).   \n\nIt's a mess kappa.  Unless Xerath's stun gets to stops dashes, or works better at close range, my favorite magical space cannon just can't compete against enemies familiar with his kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirM0rgan","date":"2016-10-13T14:34:01.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"It has similar range to Shocking Orb","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-10-13T14:57:26.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zenith Blade has a range of 875\nShocking Orb has a range of 1050\n\nSave Shocking Orb for someone worth stunning, don't waste it on their support.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ViiLLAiN","date":"2016-10-13T14:13:51.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirM0rgan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uktbEQFO,comment-id=0000000000040000,timestamp=2016-10-13T14:07:53.207+0000)\n>\n> Do you play him?

Xerath isn't meant to have a lot of damage at short-range because if he did he'd be so horribly oppressive (a bit like azir, only with a lot of cc in exchange for the dash/getaway azir has). Mid-lane specifically, Xerath suffers massively from the same meta-related issues that are currently preventing the likes of Kayle/Azir/LB from being top tier, in that \"skirmish\" is ridiculously rampant right now forcing people to either be extremely dominant on poke (which I'd define xerath as) or get obliterated in the mid-game. I still don't think he's entirely bad or needs any sort of buff right now, the meta itself just isn't friendly to him.","replies":[{"poster":"SirM0rgan","date":"2016-10-13T13:38:21.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not suggesting increasing his damage output, but if the stun would at least stop people when/where it hit them, that'd go a long way toward fixing this.

And Late game i feel you really shouldnt even be using your qwe... Xerath should be fighting from ult range imo. He has 4-5 shots of his ult which is a full ability rotation. Q W and E are for laning phase, waveclearing, and picking off people after the teamfight has happened. \nLate game you can destroy teams with literally just your ultimate.

If you do go to that lane you out range her by a staggering amount, so you really still shouldn't be getting caught. You shouldn't be playing chicken e for e, you should be using q for poke on the adc. Heal is reduced by 50% so you really shouldn't double up on it as it just means your summoners are worse than her team.\n\nThe idea if she does get on you (assuming you weren't caught in an unwarded area or flanked) is to have been positioned in a way to make her have to over commit to get on you. If she has no damage to follow up with her you just w after she stuns, create distance to throw e, congrats you can now kite with rylais q.\n\nEdit: Not to mention if you went mid you could afford to pick up a cheap banshees 3rd or 4th item to really mess up their engages.\n\nDouble Edit: Just realized you say he is one of the 10 least played champions.

It's easy to Talk about idealized situations where all you have to do is build Rylai's, but in game, landing every skillshot doesn't happen, people build MR, other players feed, and you're left in a situation where anyone who has a dash and enough health to face your full combo gets free kills.  Yes, positioning is important, and you can go a long way by just staying out of situations that'll get you killed, but there are too many occasions where that simply isn't enough.

Velkoz may have more reliable CC but all his damage is in his ult where as xerath has more up front damage in general. I played velkoz for a good amount of games during S4 and was one of my mains to get to diamond (back when league was my life lol) and in all honesty I had to make sure I kept my range against my opponent because of they broke through that range then I got outplayed and it's normal for someone to die when you get outplayed. If I was able to keep my distance most of the time as a velkoz then I'm pretty sure as an avid zerath player you should have everything an easier time keeping your range because of that ult range and his stun plus slow. I don't think it's much of an issue on xeraths behalf but maybe that xerath just doesn't fit your play style?

They dash to you and still have 3 abilities left to harass you, whereas you are left with your W and your Q to try to escape.  \nI guess my point in this entire point is \"Hey, for a character that relies on keeping range, you would really expect his stun to help him keep his distance, does anyone else think it's weird that it doesn't work against dashes?\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndGamer11","date":"2016-10-14T03:42:55.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I'm a Xerath main, and I found your problem.\n\nYour build is absolute garbo.\nTips and tricks:\n1.

Level 7, high Silver and looking to get Gold by the end of the season. I've used Xerath for 56% of my ranked games, and have a 55% win rate with him. Some of what I'm going to mention might not hold up at super high levels of play, but since neither of us are there why worry about it?\n\n-----\n\nHis kit is pretty awesome, *particularly* his passive. His passive might as well read \"save yourself 2900 gold\", because with it you don't need to buy a mana item *at all*. Trust me, I've gone more games without a mana item on Xerath than with. Use it pretty much any time it's up. And roaming bot lane to ~~steal~~ secure a kill? Auto attack the Rift Scuttler for free mana! While getting the passive attack off on enemy champions is nice, as long as you're not using your Q as soon as it comes off of cooldown you'll be OK with using your passive on Minions most of the time.\n\nRiot's mentioned before that this passive, combined with his high mana costs, is designed to give opponents a chance to fight back against Xerath, particularly in Laning Phase, and it does that, so it's not going anywhere any time soon.\n\nWhile your lane opponent is rushing {{item:3165}} to have the mana to keep fighting, you should be rushing {{item:3285}} . Why Ludens? Well, because it's the perfect starting item for a Mid Xerath! It gives you extra damage (lots of squishy targets will be dropped to nearly half health by a single Q once you've got this) *and* it helps cover your low mobility weakness because it gives you extra movement speed. \n\n(Note: {{item:3165}} is a great item, and particularly useful if the enemy team has lots of healing. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with starting it, particularly if the situation calls for it, just that most games you can get an extra advantage on Xerath by *not* getting it early.)\n\nNext up is the item that's so broke it's going to be changed in the Preseason: {{item:3116}} . Once again, it's a high damage item (for now), *and* it helps cover Xerath's weaknesses. The slow is stronger than Xerath's weaker W slow so it buffs that, while also making it so that his Q and R slow, helping you get away from your would-be killers. (As an added bonus, each splash from {{item:3285}} *also* slows, so even if your enemy dodges the Q if it hits a minion near them they will get slowed.) You can now use your ultimate to help Allies escape or help them chase down fleeing enemies, while being no where near the fighting itself. The health also helps you survive any pesky enemies that do manage to get onto your face.\n\nFor boots, I personally recommend {{item:3158}} because the build so far has had no CDR. It gets your {{summoner:7}} and {{summoner:4}} up sooner too, which are your big get away tools if someone does get too close for comfort.\n\nAs for what to do if someone gets too close for comfort, just leave. Throw a W on them and walk as far away as you can, throwing an E or a Q (remember, it slows now that you've got {{item:3116}} ) at them as needed if they keep chasing you. It's not uncommon, particularly if there's a teamfight going on, for your enemy to get tired of chasing you and want to turn back to help fight others, at which point you can use your ultimate to turn the tides for your allies. \n\nThe rest of your build is going to be situational items. {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3151}} are usually what you're picking from.\n\n***Absolutely NEVER, under any situation, pick {{item:3100}} !!!*** You ought to be **ashamed** of yourself, calling yourself a Xerath main and buying that! You ***never*** want to be close enough to your enemies to auto attack them late game, so why would you buy an item that's based completely around that? You wouldn't, so don't.\n\n--------\n\n***TL;DR***: Xerath's fine, but he requires you to think about what you're doing. If you change some of what you're doing (where you play him, what you buy, how you handle being jumped on) then you'll be in a much better place with him.","replies":[{"poster":"SirM0rgan","date":"2016-10-13T22:23:08.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get lichbane situationally.

Then again, lots of Supports die while warding. The upgraded Sweeper will at least give you a warning there are enemies in the bush ahead.

Your stun orb has a range as long or longer range than the dashes of most champs who would be trying to dive you, and you don't have to stand there and wait for it to land, you don't even have to wait for them to be in range since they are moving towards you and will end up inside it's range by the time the orb goes it's distance. You can throw it at them before they are in range and walk away and gain almost 50% more effective kiting distance just from doing this. If they are too close already for you to do this or you didn't see them until they were too close, you messed up your positioning and also probably didn't have enough wards to see them coming.\n\nAlso, stuns don't stop abilities or dashes from going off of they've already started. Only snares (which stop all movement) and displacements (knockups, pushes, pulls) do that. For 5 seasons veigars wall didn't stop dashes, you would finish the dash and end up stunned on the other side - the ability to stop dashes was specifically added in his mini rework during the mage update. So enemies finishing their dash if they started it before you orbed them is consistent with how it works for all other stuns in the game.\n\nAdditionally, heal is a poor choice of a summoner. Exhaust allows you to almost completely shut down the damage of a champion for several seconds while heal is only a tiny burst of healing and movement that actually only has 50% the normal effect if its been used on you in the last several minutes which is one of the reasons why people almost always take exhaust on the support and heal on the marksman in botlane. If you had exaust you would be able to slow and reduce the damage of someone who tried to dive you, which would buy you time in distance to stun and slow them and run away and maybe give you team time to help you if they decide to bother. Which leads into my last point - teamates may decide not to waste precious time and abilities to protect you in a hectic teamfight if you play xerath as a support because...\n\nXerath is a midlaner not a support. Stop playing him as a support and play him mid and you'll have a better time. Noone has time and resources to spend protecting a support who gets dived, you are there partially as a sacrifice to buy time for the carries - that would be the marksman and the mid laner. If YOU are the midlaner it will be the job of the jungler, toplaner, support to protect YOU instead and you'll find it much easier to keep people from jumping on you when you have allies whose reaction to you getting dived is to peel for you instead of leaving you to die as bait to distract the enemy. Most 'real' supports are capable of peeling enemies off of themselves and surviving for a while from their cc, shields, sustain, item actives, etc. Xerath is not a real support, hence part of why he has such a hard time with this.","replies":[]}]}
