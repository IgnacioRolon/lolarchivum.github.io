I have tried countless times, but there seems to be absolutely no way of letting this patch work. I've used the Repair tool as instructed. I've done a clean uninstall of the entire client _(multiple times)_. I'm kind of at a loss of options. Everything worked completely fine as far as the client goes for the past few months, and I just can't seem to find a way to fix it. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-20T22:18:44.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you're trying to update to the new client, but for some reason League isn't able to scan the game files in order to see what needs to be updated.
