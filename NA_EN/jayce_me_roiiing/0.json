Make sure your firewalls and antivirus are turned off temporarily while updating, or be sure to add exceptions for League's PBE servers with the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) if you aren't sure how. \n\nIf it doesn't help, be sure to post over on the PBE boards for a little better help!
