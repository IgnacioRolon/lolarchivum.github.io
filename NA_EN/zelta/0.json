The autoattack projectile flies off and disappears upon contact with the target, I think before doing its contact animation (ex. explosion for Jinx's rockets).\n\nHowever, I've seen it happen with turret shots too - I mean it's unlikely to be unable to notice a turr shot's damage on an ADC's health bar 8 minutes in, right? And there again, I think the contact red light and sound don't play but I'm not sure.\n\nNo reproduction steps that I know, except well that it doesn't happen on melees afaik.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-24T21:24:15.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm, personally, no, but that wouldn't be surprising because I'm on skins. :P I'd be happy follow up with Champion, though!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zed Zedd n Zeddy","date":"2016-03-24T17:30:05.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me yesterday as I played Jhin, it either bounced twice or 3 times","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Downtown","date":"2016-03-24T15:54:43.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can confirm, I noticed it earlier today.
