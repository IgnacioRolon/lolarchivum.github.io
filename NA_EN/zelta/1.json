I was unable to reproduce this particular bug, so if you could find a consistent way to make this happen, or have a video, I will be able to track down the issue better and figure out what is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Septimus","date":"2014-12-09T03:50:31.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://gyazo.com/e5cd6167156192c81a475f7b6d36835c\n\nI was in a game where my friend got killed by smite by warwick, and it skipped the egg passive, but it still went on cooldown then when he spawned he was stuck in egg form.  I included a gif of him moving around stuck in egg form. He was able to use spells but couldn't auto. Kind of game breaking.","replies":[{"poster":"Raja Chachki","date":"2014-12-09T14:25:25.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would actually be pretty interesting...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"alaskaneagle","date":"2014-12-09T22:20:46.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"54367\n\nThat happened to me once last season.\n\nO and Afic, I think it would be MUCH easier for you to simulate issues since you have abilities to manipulate the system that we don't and intermittent issues can take a lot of time to reproduce.  I understand why you wouldn't want to since I was in the navy and the electrical glitch that only happens when a certain program is running and the ship lisps 25 degrees port side is really hard to track and fix, but I'd say that is the job if you are in the bug fix department.  \n\nUnfortunately it was before I found a program I liked for recording my games so I can't help you with the video.  Good luck if you take the time to try and if not good luck having a player with a video pop up. \n\nO and if you couldn't tell from the name; I love anvia and really want her running smooth so I can play her more, and guess which skin I own ;-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raz al Ghul","date":"2014-12-09T19:39:51.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this happen to me as Anivia as well. In my case I was Singed flipped and died while airborne. I never went into egg. It was very early into the match and so I hadn't proc'd the passive prior to that in the match. It seems like a movement displacement is interacting with her passive. If you search my thread history (I don't post often; it was maybe 2 months ago and I post like 3 times a year or so) there is another post I made regarding this that was handled by another Rioter. Perhaps you can glean some more information based on that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyr0mrcow","date":"2014-12-09T17:29:54.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might be the Skirmisher-smite bug that's happening with GA, Trynd, ect?\nIf so, this is getting really interesting...","replies":[]}]}
