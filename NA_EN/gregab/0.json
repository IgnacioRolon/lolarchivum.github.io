I&rsquo;m Riot Gregab, a Tech Game Designer working on Runes Reforged. Today I want to show you a slot from the Resolve path that offers you three different strategic options around tankiness: Perseverance, Demolish, and Font of Life.\r\n\r\n**WIP DISCLAIMER:** All of these runes are still in active development. Names, numbers, icons, mechanics -- anything about them might change before release.\r\n\r\nThe first option in this slot gives you personal defenses during key moments of conflict:\r\n\r\n\r\n| | &nbsp; | Perseverance\r\n|-|-|:-\r\n| https://i.imgur.com/WobHKN1.png | | After casting a Summoner Spell, gain 25% Tenacity and 25% Slow Resistance for 10 seconds. Increase your bonus Armor and Magic resist by 10% for each Summoner Spell on cooldown.\r\n\r\nTaking Perseverance could give you the critical edge in a 1v1 duel or make sure you stay alive and functional in a team fight where you&rsquo;re eating a lot of damage and crowd control effects.\r\n\r\nThe next option, Demolish, on the other hand, gives you a way to turn your existing tankiness into power for taking objectives:\r\n\r\n| | &nbsp; | Demolish\r\n|-|-|:-\r\n| https://i.imgur.com/Of4c0ca.png | | Charge up a powerful attack against a tower over 4 seconds, while within 600 range of it. The charged attack deals 375 (+20% of your max health) bonus physical damage.\r\n| | |  Cooldown: 60 seconds\r\n\r\nDemolish gives tanks a way to siege turrets that is based on their unique strengths: the ability to walk right up to a turret and occupy that critical (and very dangerous) area with their massive bodies. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like in action:\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1cVAMsD.gif\r\n\r\nThe final option in the slot lets tanky champions use their signature crowd control abilities and massive health bars to help their teams in fights.\r\n\r\n| | &nbsp; | Font of Life\r\n|-|-|:-\r\n| https://i.imgur.com/0nKAfRb.png | | Impairing the movement of an enemy champion marks them for 4 seconds.  Ally champions who attack marked enemies heal for 5 + 1.0% of your max health. \r\n| | |  (Healing values are reduced to a third for your own attacks.)\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/s2xG4pY.gif\r\n\r\nNow, this may sound familiar. It&rsquo;s an iteration on the live keystone mastery, Stoneborn Pact. The key differences here are that Font of Life offers an instant heal instead of spreading out its heal over time and that, unlike its predecessor, Font of Life users can also heal themselves with it.\r\n\r\nOk! Hope you enjoyed reading about these new Resolve runes. We&rsquo;ll be around in the comments to answer your questions and discuss them with you.\r\n\r\nYou can check out the previous posts in this series here:\r\n\r\nRunes Corner: [Runes Content Development Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/MZd3jemX-runes-corner-runes-content-development-peek)\r\nRunes Corner: [Meteor Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/nVHz5tjE-runes-corner-meteor-sneak-peek)\r\nRunes Corner: [Hunt of the Bloodmoon Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/hFIemE4p-runes-corner-hunt-of-the-blood-moon-sneak-peek)\r\nRunes Corner: [Domination Major Slot Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/9ls3OEo8-runes-corner-domination-major-slot-sneak-peek)\r\nRunes Corner: [Stormlord&#039;s Mandate and Spellslinger&#039;s Surge](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/8uzGEMn4-runes-corner-stormlords-mandate-and-spellslingers-surge)\r\nRunes Corner: [Guardian Soul](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/HWPhZNsU-runes-corner-guardian-soul)\r\nRunes Corner: [Summoner Specialist and Hextech Freezeray](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/4KAg8Y1F-runes-corner-summoner-specialist-and-hextech-freezeray)\r\nRunes Corner: [Late-Game Focused Runes](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3THTrhmb-runes-corner-late-game-focused-runes)\r\nRunes Corner: [More Precision Runes](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/EA0AujlR-runes-corner-more-precision-runes)","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-09-13T22:23:24.402+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reduce the CD on Ohmwrecker so I can just come out of the jungle or leave my lane every 90 seconds to knock on the nearest undefended turret with Demolish :3","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2017-09-14T05:31:06.105+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knock knock\n\nWho's there \n\nNot your turret","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2017-09-13T22:51:49.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"Tbh. the whole new rune system does not seem to be thought through.

My only problem with it is that towers are already useless and this mastery will make them more useless. If there's a plan to deal with towers being paper towels than I'm all up for this mastery, otherwise considering the current state of towers this mastery makes me kinda sad.","replies":[{"poster":"swampert919","date":"2017-09-14T00:17:34.340+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"But it's the exact same as the current stoneborn pact... just with self healing in exchange for the bonus health it used to give.

Font of life is basically the current 40% front loaded value of pact (1% of max life + 5) except now you can also benefit by hitting your CC'd target. As a tank support I'd rather keep both the 1% on hit and 1.5% HoT for whoever is attacking the target. \n\nWhy take away part of the healing and give it to the support? Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"dreadnoughtus01","date":"2017-09-14T06:04:56.563+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nerf? How is this is a nerf, this is a rune not a keystone.

Its a very hidden impact much like old auras were, especially in laning situations.\n\n\nI can also see Raka LOVING this if the current Ardent-Stoneborn Pact interaction is preserved in the new rune.    This would allow her Q to apply Ardent for her carry, letting her avoid absolutely having to waste her heal to proc it to boost her carry's DPS in situations where the boosted damage output would be nice, even when the carry isn't being actively targeted.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JarPoop IV","date":"2017-09-14T00:56:42.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The font of life might be actually a little better in the sense that the healing is instant and there is no split between melee and ranged.
