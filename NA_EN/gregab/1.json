And welcome to another Runes Corner. I&rsquo;m Riot Gregab from the team working on Runes Reforged and this week we&rsquo;ve got a sneak peek of a new keystone we&rsquo;re working on tentatively called Meteor. Check it out and let us know what you think down below! \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HvXteg0.png\r\n\r\n**Meteor**\r\nDamaging a champion with an ability hurls a meteor at their location. If the meteor hits them it deals bonus damage [40-100, based on your level +0.2AP and 0.2 bonus AD]\r\nCooldown: 20 - 8 seconds \r\n\r\n_(Note: all the specific numbers here are tentative and are likely to go through significant changes before launch.) _\r\n\r\nHere&rsquo;s what Meteor currently looks like in action:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3ugxkVY.gif\r\n\r\n_(Note, as usual, that these are temp vfx and not what it&rsquo;ll look like at ship.)_\r\n\r\nWhen Syndra&rsquo;s Dark Sphere hits Cassiopeia, the meteor fires off from Syndra&rsquo;s position aimed at the spot where the sphere hit Cassio. Note the red circle that shows up on the ground after Dark Sphere hits.That&rsquo;s an indicator showing where the meteor&rsquo;s going to land, giving opponents an opportunity to dodge it. Plus, note the small orange sphere orbiting Syndra before she casts Dark Sphere. It indicates that Meteor is off cooldown and will fire with her next ability. Despite these warnings, Cassio stands still, allowing the meteor to hit her. If she&rsquo;d walked away before it arrived she could have avoided its damage.\r\n\r\nOne excellent way to prevent your targets from walking out of the meteor&rsquo;s path is to stop them from being able to move at all. This gives Meteor excellent synergy with CC abilities like Lux&rsquo;s Light Binding.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3ePDVQ7.gif\r\n\r\nLike Perxie, which we [showed off before](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/coming-preseason-runes-reforged), Meteor is a Sorcery keystone. We&rsquo;ll have more to say about the identities of the individual styles soon, but here&rsquo;s the short version: Sorcery serves champions who want to enhance ability-based damage, especially AoE spells. Our motto for it is &ldquo;unleash destruction&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s take a look at some similarities and differences between these two keystones to get a better idea how you might decide when to take one over the other. The first obvious difference is that Meteor does significantly more damage when it hits (40-100 based on level vs Perxie&rsquo;s 10-40, plus lower AP and AD scaling ratios). That&rsquo;s because Perxie is more consistent. It always hits its target while Meteor can be dodged. Also, Perxie sacrifices some raw damage for versatility. When you shield an ally with it, you give up its bonus damage until the pet returns. Whereas Meteor, on the other hand, is all damage. \r\n\r\nOne similarity between the two keystones it that they both play off of your positioning relative to enemies. However, each rune requires very different positioning to get the most out of them. Perxie asks you to move towards your target to get the pet back sooner and shorten the cooldown. When Perxie&rsquo;s available it automatically hits enemies you damage, but to land Meteor, you have to position your spells with it in mind, placing them so it&rsquo;s hard to dodge the flaming rock from the sky that follows.\r\n\r\nI hope this quick post gave you a clearer idea of what a keystone can be and got you excited to try out Meteor. We&rsquo;re looking forward to hearing your reactions. Who would you take this on? What cool synergies can you think of with it?\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ll stick around in the comments to nerd out with you and answer any questions you might have. Thanks for reading!\r\n\r\nFor previous Rune&rsquo;s Corner posts, check out:\r\n[Rune&rsquo;s Corner: Content Development Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/MZd3jemX-runes-content-development-peek).","replies":[{"poster":"Berserknurple","date":"2017-07-12T21:39:22.356+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":6,"body":"I really like the concept, I'm just not sure how I feel about the visual of a big fireball. In my opinion at least, I'd prefer if rune effects didn't look so much like actual spells. Maybe if it was something more toned down but still visible, since I imagine you want clarity. Or maybe it could even be some kind of \"eruption\" ability, where it works exactly the same, just fire erupts from the ground after a delay rather than a projectile. To me that would be less clutter while still being clear.\n\nBut don't get me wrong I really love the way you guys are going about all the new runes.

I think that's because I like to feel like the things I'm doing ingame are stemming directly from the champion I'm playing. That's cool to me, because each champion has distinct lore, visuals and gameplay, and I play champions that I like for those things. If a significant portion of your power and gameplay comes from something that isn't unique in that way, I feel it detracts from champion identity. If every champion midlaner is lobbing meteors, then it isn't special or unique or cool at all. And I'll be less interested in the choice between playing, say, Lux or Syndra, because whichever I pick I'll just be throwing the exact same meteor at people. This is doubly true for stuff like this that has a major visual effect, since inevitably they won't fit in with most champions' aesthetics, making the game seem more disjointed and discordant visually. Of course, this is already the case to some extent for summoner spells and keystone masteries, but I don't mind them too much because they have very long cooldowns (in the former case) and limited impact (in the latter case). \n\nI have to say, I particularly dislike Perxie, mostly because of the way it seems mostly intended for supports. When I'm playing support, I usually feel like the champion I'm playing just isn't as awesome as all the other champions in the game, because I don't have nearly as much power and gameplay impact. In part, that's because a big element of playing support is warding and vision, and that doesn't really feel all that cool and doesn't make you feel like you're fulfilling some kind of champion fantasy. No-one's champion fantasy is buying a sightstone and throwing down wards, and no-one's fantasy can be that because all supports do that. I think this is part of why support is an unpopular position. For me, Perxie would make this even worse because I would feel like as a support, my job is to carry around wards and play taxi service for a magic cat, with my champion starting to feel secondary to that.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-07-12T22:44:55.836+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree with this.

It should be totally possible to see people in game sharing at least one Rune.\n\nThematics matter when it comes to a champion and its kit, but Runes are designed to be used by multiple champions. They can't be one-size-fits-all without looking generic. If it isn't a fireball, it'd be a lightening bolt or an explosion or a spout of water, it'd have to be something eventually and it'll never fit every champ perfectly.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-07-13T00:56:51.929+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"You misunderstand. Is am complaining about the vfx side of the runes, not the gameplay mechanics. I do not mind titanic hydra, runans hurricane or thunderlords because they are very mild effects that do not take away thematically how a champion feels. Having thresh with a cutsie little furby hovering next to him is very distrating and thematically clashing. If I buy, for example, omega squad teemo skin is because the thematics of the skin spoke to me, and meshing fire breathing or flying unicorn special effects over my character while I am playing that skin takes away from it in my opinion.\n\nFor example, if the rune \"Meteor\" was a surge of energy that erupted from the ground and had effects similar to thunderlords, that would be a lot less distracting/thematically diluted than a meteor being chucked from your character (I know they are placeholder vfx, but I don't knwo what rout they want to take things)\n\nMore concretely, Helpsy or whatever his name is as an Sakura Card Captor animal is very dissonant with dark characters. however is the vfx for Helpsy, for example, an orb or a minute totem or something like that, then it wouldn't so heavily clash with champion mechanics, because its look would be more \"neutral\".\n\nThat being said, I'm not sure runes that give champion \"mini games\" would be fun, since they would maybe sinergize extremly well with some and very poorly with others, but I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt until I have my hands on them","replies":[{"poster":"gregab","date":"2017-07-13T03:09:41.431+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hear you about the thematic concerns.

Also, it seems like you aren't a support player... I think anyone who doesn't enjoy the support playstyle isn't going to enjoy a Rune designed for supports. \n\nAlso, \"no-one's fantasy can be that because all supports do that\" - this is incorrect reasoning. Items are shared across league by many champions, which don't seem to detract from their theme. Redemption's active doesn't fit with a bunch of supports themetically, but I think most supports were happy with its inclusion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-07-12T22:37:02.043+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'm not particulary fond of these types of runes.

This meteor and Perxie are more game play impactful and visually clashing than other effects. \n\nTake the keystones, obvious visual effects that have an okay impact but aren't that graphically intense or thematically clashing. Thunderlords is a flash of lighting that can easily be missed, Grasp of the Undying is an obvious heal graphic that doesn't detract from the champs that use it. \n\nPerxie though is a 'rune' with a whole model that is constantly there. Similarly there is Pix, which is unique and part of the theme of lulu. Cute, minor, helpful. Adding that element to any champ you want can have thematic consequences. Thresh is the go to example in this thread for some reason, dark, deadly, haunting. Those themes don't exactly mesh well with Perxie. \n\nThen there are minor effects of items; Ruannes, Liandrys, Ludens, etc. Most of these don't add anything passively to the champion with the exception of Ruannes which gives a small orb where the bolts come out. But even that orb doesn't have a personality or theme to it, its just a ball. All these effects are minor, don't add a passive effect that clashes with the champion theme or provide a visual that overshadows normal abilities or summoner spells.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Metallmeister","date":"2017-07-12T21:44:19.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-07-12T21:50:42.251+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've seen this one proc'd with all kinds of creative abilities - for Jinx & Ashe ult it works like you think it would.

Hope we'll see some of the old masteries and ketstones ported to the new rune system, examples: Thunderlord, Grasp of the Undying, Windspeaker (instead of Perxie, does what it currently does to allies, but deals bonus damage to enemies with a certain CD - 30 seconds to 12, based on level), Warlord and many more.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot HoneyTower","date":"2017-07-18T00:26:53.772+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This placeholder icon is actually MF ultimate rotated by 90 degrees <3 :).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mr Boombastic787","date":"2017-07-13T19:32:54.630+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it, it will be doing the same kind of work as ludens echo so that would be a strong synergy. If you play some poke and burst Mage like Xerath it would be really nice. \n\nMy concern is that compared to a keystone as Beserk it will be really underpowered unless you give it a ton more damage. Berserk is not such an interactive keystone as this but still just gives so much power it makes this feel less awesome. Just my thought on it.\n\nAlso a sidenote I would like you to make the Ruined kings keystone function more like Grasp since it don't feel as tactical and interactive as Grasp\n\nGreat job on the runes reformed!
