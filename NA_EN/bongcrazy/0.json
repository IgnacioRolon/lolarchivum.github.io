So i shifted to EUNE, now i get like 160-180 ms. Better but still a lag spike for games which require fast response. For me its a delay of 1.6 seconds which makes huge impacts in team fights and overall gameplay. \r\n\r\nAs a League of Legends fan, i have not withdrawn my support and love for the game. So i humbly request RIOT games please listen to the gamer&#039;s in India and other South Asian countries with no general server. I also request the community to help my post t reach riot so that they can look into the matter or at-least give a reply back.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSincere LOL fan from India","replies":[]}
