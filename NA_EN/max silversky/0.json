I feel that his Q is as slow as old Heimer grenade, which makes another (important) problem: It&#039;s very hard to tag your own allies, specially mobile champions like Zed or Fizz. \r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-04-16T04:05:50.541+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I miss Zilean Mid.\n\nZilean support can go away and suck a screwdriver for all I care.\n\nAlso\n\n> 2 targeted nukes and permahaste were a bit too much for healty gameplay.\n\nConsidering Q had a low range that any mage like Xerath and Lux could laugh to while poking Zilean, and permahaste was only viable lategame with Seraph's plus Athenes, it was pretty balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-04-16T04:51:57.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"it was pretty balanced.\"\nIn Riots world:_ if you champion isn't Zed and has no skillshots = isn't balanced_","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-04-16T05:01:32.960+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Literally every midlaner rework has been: Champion limits mobility plays/counters melee midlaners, reworked into oblivion.

One on the duration and the second on W synergy.\n\n* E was nerfed, the amount of slow/haste does not compete with duration of slow. I will take my 5.5 duration back instead of this 99% any day. This is especially true for slows/hastes above 65%.\n\n* Delay and \"miss chance\" on Q.\n\nWhat was he given?\n\n* Less early game base damage on Q.\n\n* Stun on double Q, which you can almost never land without an E on the target.\n\n* Mana cost reduction.\n\n* This doesn't mean {{champion:26}} auto attacks faster, he just _finishes_ his attack faster. <--- but seriously this one was nice.\n\n\nWhat I think? He was Veigar'd.\n\nHe was given delays on his spells, have them turn into skillshots and cutoff a massive part of his reliability. [ which was a very good reason to play him ]\n\nVeigar'd champions need a good source of CC to land their abilities. Slows will work against immobile champions, stuns will be required against mobile ones.\n\nZilean and Veigar can't fight mobile champions, but will bully immobile ones pretty hard. Which in my opinion makes the game so much worse because {{champion:16}} & {{champion:14}} basically do the same thing. Champions are reworked to be highly effective against immobile champions while mobile ones get away scot free. Does this mean Riot is planning for an anti mobility item? Summoner spell ? Mechanic ? Nerf mobile champions over the board ?\n\nI don't know, but this is a bad time to be an immobile champion player. That's what I think. :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-04-16T10:41:48.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"same with soraka's q, you basically can't get any heals unless they literally walk into them","replies":[{"poster":"Robert Smith","date":"2015-04-16T11:53:39.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You under estimate the power of bananas.

I was playing Zilean the other day and landing a double Q was so unreliable.\n\nEither use the OP's suggestion or make the landing of the Q \"un-seeable\" for the enemy (kind of like how you can't see the range indicators of Ori's ball). B/c when Zilean throws a bomb, there's a clear circle where the enemy can see it land before it lands, and he can just dodge it.","replies":[]}]}
