From the beginning I've had a affinity for champions who in particular, are rarely seen and not played by many other players. I have become really good with these champs, at least I think so. But a few years back I was in Gold 4. I made it there on Renekton's back when players started to heavily play him again and you would see him just about every other game. I went inactive for about 6 months when my woman gave birth to our child. Came back to Silver 5, which blows. But since then I've gotten back to playing champs you don't see often no more with the mentality that I'm not gonna be like other players, I'm gonna show these guys that I can ride this all the way back to Gold and maybe higher. But this task I gave myself is pretty damn hard. For instance I have been playing Aatrox just about any chance I can lately. I'm not a bad Aatrox but I'm still in the lower silver, high bronze area. If I play the meta champ that's Op at the time I win way more and advance much quicker. I played Jayce when he was really strong on another account and felt like I had a cheat code against my opponent. I get bored playing with a champ who is handicapped for success. I like playing champs who are not as capable and more challenging to master with tons of counters. I like being different. But my question is, if I want to get back to my Gold status, should I just go ahead and hop on that ever changing \"OP champ\" band wagon to achieve this??? I don't see me getting there playing my mid Zilean all the way up.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-03-07T03:40:14.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same mentality as you, I was an {{champion:12}} main since season 2. Whatever you feel comfortable with, personally I think I got used to the certain unplayed champion playstyles for so long, I find it difficult to play the freelo like {{champion:238}} & {{champion:7}}.\n\nI used to think the reason I didn't play them was because I wouldn't steep so low, but now I think I'm not even capable of playing the champions correctly.\n\nSee what works for you! I abused the hell out of release {{champion:121}}, people didn't even realize he was broken. I didn't enjoy it though because I found it to be repetitive and did not provide a challenge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OhOkYea","date":"2015-03-07T03:34:10.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"buy a skin and you will do better","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selvos","date":"2015-03-07T11:56:15.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to play tier 1 champs to win at any ELO. There are plenty of unorthodox picks at all levels of play, and those picks do work at least some of the time. That being said, if you're an Urgot or Veigar main, then the fact that you play a weaker champion will correlate with your ELO. If you played a stronger one, you might as well be a division or so higher than you currently are.\n\nThe trick is to play a set of champions that aren't tier 1, but aren't the worst either. Those champions rarely get banned or 1st picked, so you should be able to get your champions every game. For instance, Xerath is a great pick for mid as you can have an impact on other lanes with your ult, and even if you're shut down, you should be able to farm up with q. It's hard to be irrelevant in the mid and late game when playing Xerath, while Zilean unfortunately falls off much harder unless you have a dedicated hypercarry comp where you're just trying to protect 1 champ.\n\nIf you really want to play the champs that are the worst of the worst, then know which matchups they are stronger or least weak against and pick them when applicable. Don't pick a weak champ into a weak matchup - that's just asking to lose lane and possibly the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kögâ","date":"2015-03-07T09:41:53.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stay strong brother.

If you start seeing that you win more games than you lose as Aatrox, then go to Draft, still winning? Go ranked.\n\nBest advice I can give, otherwise, yes. Jump on an 'OP' champ and faceroll your way to the top.","replies":[]}]}
