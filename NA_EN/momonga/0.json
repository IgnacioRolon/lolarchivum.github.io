However you're looking at this too complexly URF shouldn't be meant to be played as a \"meta\" game mode or even needed to be balanced, URF itself is the solution. If we saw new champions being played in a number of different ways, followed by Riot making changes, then theoretically there should be a large amount of diversity in playing each champion because no one is technically \"the best\" in URF, who's \"created\" the meta where so and so champion is the best champion hands down, no, URF hadn't been long enough on live for someone to even come close to this. There's also gonna be a meta no matter what, you can't control this, without nerfs/buffs/items that is. Like right now you're bound to see at least Ahri, Azir, J4, Gnar in solo queue almost every game either banned or picked. I would even go as far as to say URF promotes anti-meta, for example I myself half way through URF was kinda pissed at all the Zed's and LB's one shotting me while I was squishy, then one game it hit me, Swain, his infinite ult was the solution was for tankiness, sustain, and not getting one shotted so I went to the store and instantly bought him, it did take me a few games to get use to him but when I did it was really fun. I even went to play him fairly successful after URF in solo queue, and how many Urgots, Sonas, Skarners, Alistars, and other non-meta picks at the time did you see on URF, fairly more than usual. All I am saying is that in URF every champion is theoretically given a chance to be able to be played as a really strong pick, and you know why? Because of the PLAYERS, in my opinion League of Legends players are some of the most creative people I've ever seen, with being able to play odd picks at odd roles, and fairly well or even better than currently strong picks at said role.\n\nWith all that being said in my opinion Riot needs to only do 2 things in URF and do it good:\n\n1) Fix champs where they are OP enough to take down baron at spawn, render you completely paralyzed to the point where you can't take a step without dying, or never die i.e. Sona/Maokai, Teemo, Zilean. I don't know the \"best\" possible solutions to these but I'm sure Riot can easily come up with them\n\n2) Probably the more important one, make an MMR or ELO exclusively for URF where it's based on the number of wins and games played respectfully. This way players with more experience play with each other and if one player discovers a certain champion does something extremely well and practically carries the game single-handedly then he deserves to win for putting the time and effort to discovering things. I feel like this way people who know better/more will at the top and people who don't know who are \"the best\" picks will play each other and to me that's perfectly understandable.\n\nSorry for the long post and if I am not clear enough, I am not really good with words and I feel like this isn't exactly what I'm trying to say but it's the gist of it.\n\nEDIT: Since this was kinda long (from KILLER X 12)  I did not bother to proof read this, and i do not intend to. lol Peace.","replies":[{"poster":"Isajohoff","date":"2015-02-09T18:07:45.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Got an idea for all the healers: make all heals no permanent shields","replies":[]},{"poster":"LelouchViBritian","date":"2015-02-09T18:04:23.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is surprisingly very well thought out.{{summoner:2}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AXDSorcerer","date":"2015-02-18T18:55:50.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iluvalar,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=Z1GuYEYL,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-09T00:57:35.176+0000)\n>\n> The unsolvable problem in URF is a balance issue.

No mana needed...cooldowns were close to nonexistant and so on. Yes some champs were banned just because they had a little bit too much of an edge but could've potentially just lowered the max cdr on those champs to help \"even\" them out a bit. All that being said...I would love to see URF mode back. Not as a permanent part of the game as I would assume everyone would end up tired of the game mode and then feeling Summoner's Rift is too \"slow\" and quit the game. I'd like to see URF mode as a game mode that would happen for a week every few months though not just a possibility of once a year....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-02-09T22:56:48.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does URF need to balanced?

Forgive me if its long. I'll try to give a TLDR at the end. \n\n1) Back before Urf came out i was having a pretty hard time in college. Not grade wise or anything like that, i'm a good stupid and was getting ready to take Grad classes. I just had a lot of stress on me, and i like to relax by playing video games. League is one of the games i like to relax with, but i can't play to many normals  because it won't be 2 games before someone pisses me off and i'm worse off than before i started. I play a lot of aram's because those are relaxing...but they get boring quickly. I quit League some time in March last year. On April Fool's a friend of mine linked me to the Urf video and i was honestly excited. I remember it saying stuff about how things that cost mana aren't fun, having no mana isn't fun, and having to wait for cool downs isn't fun. I 100% agreed with those statements. I then read the comments about how it was a joke...i was upset. Luckiliy though they did release the mode and i could have a shit load of fun. I must of played 60 or so games of Urf. It also got my old 5s team back together so my friends and i could mess around, and we kept playing after the mode was done. Now they only come back to play when new game modes are out...and until recently i've been the same way. \n\n2) Smite, yes that OTHER MOBA, has a game mode \"cooldowns runneth over.\" I check Smite almost every day to see the game mode of the day (and to get favor since they want you to actually be able to buy things lol). This mode was on yesterday and i didn't check smite till like 1 in the morning before i went to bed. Fucking, i was pissed, becuase i had wasted time playing league normals when i could of been playing this mode. \nIn this mode you play in the Arena map, with all GOds unlocked but you are assigned a random one. You all start at max level with 100k gold and 75% CDR (used to be 80%). Shit is crazy. I played that for a good 4 hours before i went to bed (i do feel bad because it seems like the people who play smite are just...worse  at games so i  won like 10 games and lost 2).  I will stop what i'm doing to play this mode of the day. Same with Urf. \n\nTLDR: \nI quit LoL. Urf came out. I play LoL again. I only stick around for new game modes. \n\nSmite has an improved version of Urf. I will stop what i'm doing to play this mode, because the shit is great.\n\nEDIT: I did not bother to proof read this, and i do not intend to. lol Peace.
