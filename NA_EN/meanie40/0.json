CDR and regen runes are still superior and low risk.  Even with 20 AP the Q would heal 16 health more, and spell thief gives 5 ap.  Considering the fact you risk getting poked to land Q, and that mana regen is a major issue as well if you spam Q, and that hp regen runes can net you over 8 hp regen per 5 and the ancient coin 5 health per minion killed in lane, the AP is a terrible tradeoff.  Just the ancient coin itself is going to give you 30 hp back over a minute, along with the hp regen another 96 from runes, that's 126 hp a minute for just standing safely in the lane.  For the 5 AP from spell thief to do jack, assuming max heal of .8 ratio, and landing Q every time it is on cooldown for about 10 landings a minute, that'd be 40 health to 80 health if you hit 2 people every time and she will be completely oom and take poke and harass completely making it a terrible decision.  Making it realistic, it'd be more like .6 ratio, making it 30 hp to 60 hp a minute verse the 126 hp i can get with runes and coin.  The only factor outside this is that maybe all that harass will put your lane ahead.  But if you're doing soraka right you're doing low risk poke or your adc is anyway, so really you're losing nothing by going regen and losing a lot by going AP.  I think I know what I'm talking about as I got plat this season playing Soraka support like this:\n\nEvery time I see an AP soraka in lane I wince.  Here is my rune page for her:\n    Armor\n    +8.2\n    Health Regen / 5 at level 18\n    +18.2\n    Magic Resist\n    +12.1\n    Health Regen / 5\n    +8.1\n\nAnd unless they totally revamp runes this will be way more viable than ap soraka.  Which I'm glad.  Ap Soraka is a stupid design.  Talisman is a very under rated item as is coin on her.  Being able to control engage/disengage is huge in the team fight stage.\n\nAdditionally her AP ratios SUCK!  Her W and R heal ratios only approach average if you're healing people already close to death's door.  I'd consider AP if her ridiculously long cool down ult had a 1.5 AP ratio.  Or her W was even .8 base.  But it's not.  So cooldown and hp regen far superior.\n\nSince most in game hp regen items really sucked before the regen changes and suck even more now, and suck even even more after this patch, and I never really bought them anyway, the only thing this patch's nerf and the regen changes really did was lower my early game regen from 18 per 5 plus ancient coin to 15 per 5 plus ancient coin.  Which will effect things, but I'll still scale well thanks to scaling regen runes and the masteries on defensive tree :)\n\nIt really sucks when one of your favorite champs (kat in the past, shyvana right now cough) gets riot's attention b/c they tend to leave a champion in a bad state for 6+ months.  Or forever if you're Urgot.  So I'm glad that them ruining soraka is gated by the fact that for 6+ months they can't do a rune pages revamp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Keith","date":"2014-12-10T17:11:44.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have my upvote because of that old Robin reference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2014-12-10T11:11:31.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder how they think we're gonna be able to build any AP before we finish half our build.\n\nWhat Soraka  needs is a stable speed on her Q, and a new passive that makes her able to do anything at all when there's no enemy champions in lane.
