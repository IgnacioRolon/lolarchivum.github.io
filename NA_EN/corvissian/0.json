Then I have to wait for another patch. Cool, that's fine. It's my night off, I'm in no rush.\r\n\r\n'Client restart needed', or whatever it said along those lines. Cool, alright.\r\n\r\nRestart the client. i get to the log in screen and I see 'We can't log you in because you may be offline\"\r\n\r\nUgh. Fine, I can be patient when I so choose. \r\n\r\nI look up the problem and find Reds commenting on the issue. I flushdns in cmd, I delete the mentioned line of text in the YAML file (Yes, I made sure it was the correct text), I even use the repair tool.\r\n\r\nNothing worked. Now, when I try and log on, it automatically brings up the 'you need an update, so restart this shizz' message. it restarts.\r\n\r\nAnd then doesn't. Connect.\r\n\r\n\r\nAAAGH. I just want to play some fucking League of Legends!\r\n\r\nWindows 10, if it matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T22:51:48.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm sounds like the update files might not be downloading correctly due to hiccups in your connection. Let's double check your connection before trying to patch again by following the DNS and port forwarding steps again in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), it also couldn't hurt to try using an ethernet connection instead of wifi too. Also, make sure any firewalls are disabled and that you're running the patcher as admin.","replies":[]}]}
