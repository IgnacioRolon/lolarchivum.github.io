I have had a Ribbon since the start of the Honor System&#039;s release. I never worry about losing it, and I&#039;ve helped hundreds of players since then get their Ribbons back through my YouTube channel.\r\n\r\nTo affirm to myself that getting a Ribbon is possible for anyone, I upped the difficulty to obtain a Ribbon with the most hated champion arguably in League of Legends and playing in ranked on top of it. I obtained a Ribbon from a fresh level 30 account that had well over 100 games on it with no Honor. After 25 straight ranked games through the end of Season 5 into Season 6, I obtained the Great Leader Ribbon - the rarest on NA.\r\n\r\nI created a completely 8-part episode series around my journey with silly commentary, which demonstrates every act of sportsmanship I am going to explain below-\r\n\r\n**[My YouTube Series - Getting a Ribbon as TEEMO in Ranked!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwL7GviQPy8&amp;list=PL2jY5GULGWHs7jJP96p8cFjSfSYZOeUTG&amp;index=1)**\r\n\r\nThe above video links to a playlist of my demonstrations of sportsmanship, mixed in with some humor and my painful mistakes being on a smurf. I was playing with Silver and Gold Players to obtain the Ribbon. On my main account however, which is mid Platinum to low Diamond, I get Honor even with the bigger guys-\r\n\r\n**Anyone can get a Ribbon - If you want one, here is where you begin.**\r\n\r\nI first would like you to take a quick look at your summoner profile, look at your Honor count, and *throw it out the window.* You can forget your total count completely when it comes to getting a Ribbon. It is a completely inaccurate representation of how close you are to a Ribbon, it&#039;s basically a mileage counter.\r\n\r\nIn order to get a Ribbon, you have to be honored consistently from **today**. I&#039;m talking more specifically about getting honored just about every other game, or getting **at least** one honor point every game. A Ribbon is awarded based on what type of Honor you get, being in a percentage of players who are honored more frequently.\r\n\r\n**It&#039;s a set percentage as far as we know, however because of the amount of players that join a server on a daily basis, that means there are many more ribbons ripe for the taking.**\r\n\r\nHere is the deal - The people in League of Legends really only Honor if you are *Honorable, Sportsmanlike* -\r\n\r\nNo, it is **NOT**-\r\n\r\n-Customer service\r\n-Sexual Favors\r\n-Bribing others\r\n\r\nYou will only consistently get Honor without exploitation if you are genuinely sportsmanlike. You do not have to make every player you encounter happy, unlike customer service. If someone treats you poorly, you can still earn honor while having half of your team muted, and through employing leadership, you can earn Honor without even giving a single compliment to anyone on your team too.\r\n\r\nGetting a Ribbon and keeping a Ribbon is all a labor of love, drawn from being **a sportsmanlike player**. Notice how I use the word **Sportsmanlike** instead of positive. You do not have to be overly-optimistic, happy-go-lucky, and filled with sunshine and rainbows. Being sportsmanlike involves **respect** and complete display of that said *respect*. \r\n\r\nBeing a highly sportsmanlike player **includes** -\r\n\r\n-More enjoyable games\r\n-Less Tilting\r\n-The chance to make more friends-\r\n-A better attitude for winning games\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s no big secret. Be an Honorable player, you get Honor. Many people in our community think that no one really honors anymore. \r\n\r\nMy profile on NA - **ristiuMMask** essentially proves that wrong - I have nearly **7,000** Honor points. I choose to be **nice and memorable**, rather than **salty and forgettable**. When I am in my peak condition and I&#039;m ready to be an honorable player when I play ranked, this is what I have learned to set yourself apart and make you a memorable player that is worthy of getting that thumbs up clicked up-\r\n\r\n**1. I say hello to both my team and the enemy team.** When my team gets together in champion select, I say hello, ask everyone to check their runes/masteries, and I get involved in conversation only if it&#039;s present. That&#039;s it. When I get into the game, I say *GLHF* to the enemy team, and I disregard all snide comments from the peanuts gallery.\r\n\r\nYou might receive a **negative comment or two**, and I know, **discouragement really sucks**.\r\n\r\n**This is the point where most people give up**\r\n\r\nWhen you disregard those comments, and -\r\n\r\n**2. Admit when you goof up** - Whenever I died playing on this Teemo account, I would automatically type in chat *&quot;Very nice/nice catch/I messed up.&quot;* Take a quick count of the people you know in League that instantly admits in game that they screw up. Those players may not exist for you, and you&#039;re not alone. \r\n\r\nLet everyone know in the game that you take your own responsibility for your actions. It&#039;s direct, and a clear demonstration that you take your opponents seriously in addition to the consideration of your teammates. Each one of these messages is visible to *nine players* on a game of Summoner&#039;s Rift, and each of them now are actively evaluating whether or not they should honor you after the game.\r\n\r\n**3. Stay after the game to talk with players.** When a Summoner&#039;s Rift game ends, there is *one team that wins*, and *one team that loses.* Some players leave in frustration, some players just want to move onto their next game, but others are sitting in champion select, silent, pondering their ideas about *how the game* panned out.\r\n\r\n**Un-Tilting someone is easier than it seems**. The biggest emotions I believe someone on a huge losing-streak tilt feels is being *alone* and *helpless*. Everyone is winning and moving on to their next game, or everyone is fighting with each other and losing in frustration. While they are staring off into space in the post game screen, offer a talk, it can even be about their summoner name. Break the wall that helps us identify *players* as actual *humans* and help the player sort things out.\r\n\r\nOffer feedback **only** if they are open to talk about their performance. Help set their head straight. Tell them to take a nice break, and don&#039;t worry, because two days from now they will **forget about this miserable game they had.**\r\n\r\n**4. Keep calm, and do not be a jerk.** This may be the most obvious of them all, but it really needs to be addressed. If you want to be an honorable player and ready to earn honor, there are something that are *going to make people forget completely about their nice impression of you*\r\n\r\nThese include, but are not limited to-\r\n\r\n1. BM&#039;ing at the turret\r\n2. Tilting enemies with subtle phrases (&quot;?&quot;) or Champion Mastery Spamming\r\n3. Arguing with players and playing the blame game.\r\n4. Being passive-aggressive\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tested all of these in Neutral showcase games, and my Honor frequently dropped faster than anything I&#039;ve ever seen before. Sportsmanlike players who choose to be honorable follow the lines of being *positive standing players.* Because all of this frankly is choice. You could be a really nice person irl, but choose to let all of your anger and frustration out on this game, and *choose to be a negative player*\r\n\r\n*No matter who you are, getting Honor involves choosing to be a positive or sportsmanlike player player*\r\n\r\nChoose to be a Sportsmanlike/positive player every game. Connect with others, admit your mistakes, actually say GGWP at the end of games, don&#039;t be a jerk in game, and be *graceful*. \r\n\r\n*If I can get a Ribbon playing arguably the most hated champion in league in the most heated game mode type, you can do it too.*\r\n\r\n*I&#039;m running out of space in this post and I haven&#039;t even finished what I&#039;d like to say. I have made a video guide that goes more into how the Honor System works, with breakdowns and what it takes to get a certain Ribbon, you can see it* - [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIAeisuevwc)\r\n\r\nAsk any questions, let me know what you think about my channel, check out the Teemo series! (You honestly may laugh), but please, *let me help you get a Ribbon if you really want one. I want to see more Ribbons in League of Legends. I want League to have a better community.*\r\n\r\nTL;DR - **Start being Honorable consistently if you want a Ribbon. I did it with only playing TEEMO in RANKED, so you can do it too.**","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-03-28T17:55:33.715+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could probably X-post this in behavior and moderation.
