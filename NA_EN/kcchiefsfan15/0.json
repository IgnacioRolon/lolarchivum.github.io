I agree completely.\n\nIf we're talking about progressing to semifinals? That's where it gets tricky. If they come out as the #1 seed in group A, they'll probably face LGD or KT Rolster. If they come out as the second seed, they'll most likely face EDG or SKT. They're the best team in NA, and played like it at MSG but in order for me to buy into them beating KTR, LGD, EDG or SKT, they'll need to play the same way against their group as they did against TSM at NA Finals.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-09-17T23:30:54.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So Origen and TSM are screwed...","replies":[{"poster":"Predatore","date":"2015-09-17T23:33:34.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TSM has been practicing in the korea bootcamp as much as they can.
