I mean it's not terrible, I think my kda w/ my main is only 3 or so over 130-140 games, but I also have shit kill participation a lot of games bc I focus more on towers and farm (which are op as fuck to get in low elo lol). However, I have 2 or 3 champs that I have a half dozen or so games on that I tend to pick in specific spots (like malphite into a game with top or jungle (or both) that relies on autos, such as xin, tryn, yi, or jax) and those champs I average around a 5 kda on bc they're a strong pick into the team and generally safer champs. Plus when I don't play into bad match ups and first pick something frequently where I get a lot of counter picks against me, it's way easier to get a good kda. I'd say what you should shoot for in terms of being a really good kda is 4+ since that means that w/ 12 kills even if you have a low assist game (yes if you're team fighting frequently you're probably getting a decent amount of assists from them bc that happens, but maybe you split pushed to get this instead of just last hitting champs) and get 4 assists you only die 4 times so you aren't feeding a bunch of gold to the enemy. If you have 16 kills and assists w/ the majority as kills, then you aren't helping your team get fed bc you have few assists, and w/ a 2.5 kda you're about 6 deaths which, even assuming you spaced them perfectly and didn't give multiple shut downs, and then die after 1 kill, means you fed an extra 600 gold minimum, and probably closer to 900 or 1k with assists. That's money that increases the damage enemies are doing and while it's not game breaking 600 gold is a big lead early, and 1k gold is something that's a reasonable team lead if every player on the team made this mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-06-08T17:19:15.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, finally someone that realizes a 2.49 kda is not amazing lol.

Not ksing, just doing tons of damage mate. Dont even bring up that you are higher than me lol i was silver 2 last season and trolled my series because i joined the military and left in january. I was bronze 4 like 2 and a half weeks ago when i started playing again and im already silver 5 one game away from promos to where you currently sit. My KDA, stated above if you could read correctly, is 4.434 which is very good especially for silver. It isnt quite as high with darius as he is a very easy champ to kite and a majority of games i am tanking so i happen to die a little more than if i was playing adc and the whole team was peeling for me. because as you can see when i play jungle mid and adc i have half as many deaths.

My KDA, again KDA, is roughly a little above 4.5. So yes if i include my assists, which i can get 5 of them if darius presses q and i hit everyone with it, then it is much hgiher, but i dont count that because pressing one ability and getting 5 assists should not correlate into how good you are playing or  dominating with that champ. You may think it does for whatever reason but i dont. If im going a champ like full ad darius then kills are what im aiming for and thats what i use to measure if im dominating. 2.49 would be average something like 14-6. If that isnt impressive on a champ with 0 mobility or defense then you are downright retarded. For example trick2g is probably the best udyr ive ever seen in my life and his K/D average with udyr is 2.2. KDA is 4.5. And before you say, oh QQ he plays with other diamonds QQ. You are just finding excuses. If he was bronze or silver you would say oh hes in bronze its easy to do that good and then if i say he is in gold to challenger you say oh well hes playing against other players of his equal skill (derp derp) so thats why it isnt as high.
