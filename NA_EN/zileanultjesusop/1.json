He can peel for isi adc just as good as anyone in the game (braum status) and has great base damage with his ult passive while building full tank. The catch is that he has 0 mobility, literally none. Yeah he has his ult but as far as dashes move speed increases, etc. he has nothing. It is pretty hard to land his passive so basically i just focused on using my devour on their initiator so my team could counter initiate and he couldn&#039;t touch my adc. In my opinion his kit is extremely well designed with obvious strengths and weaknesses. Riot did a great job designing this champion.","replies":[{"poster":"canpan14","date":"2015-06-24T16:10:52.339+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you nom an enemy can you flash over a wall to really remove them from the fight?

It was nerfed to 32% and its ratio was also reduced to 2% per 100. While it doesn't do true damage, with just a RoA and a Liandry's or Rylai's, you'd have about 200 AP, so it would've done 44% of a tanks health. Say they have 150 MR. That's 150/250 (Formula is MR/MR+100), which is 60% reduction, on a tank. So that's 40% of the 44%, which is still about 18% of their max health, which for a single shot can be a lot.\n\nMost won't do this to a tank with 150 MR though, they'll usually hit that diving carry, Bruiser, or APC. If it's a carry, they usually have 27 MR from runes at max level and a base of about 50-60, so we'll go with 60 to make it easy. That's 87 total MR. Say you're going PURE tank after the 200 AP, not even getting any MPen in runes or items or anything. So that's 87/187, which is about 46% reduction. So you're doing around half of your W says it'll do. That's still about 22%+ of their health while they're being CC'd for 3 seconds, which isn't QSS'able or cleansable.\n\nYeeaah, it was scary before. At least now it'll max around 16-18%ish on carries, and closer to 12%ish on tanks, making it a lot less threatening, but still incredibly scary since it's 3 seconds of CC.
