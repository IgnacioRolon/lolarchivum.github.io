If one of the accounts was better at normals before doing ranked, even though you get the same w/l , you might  have placed in different divisions. It would be a great experiment to go w/ a friend and level up to 30 from 1 only and only playing w/ him. So you will have the same w/l ratio. It would really be very interesting but probably very time consuming experiment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XssijX","date":"2015-04-12T16:28:03.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-04-13T09:50:00.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what does bump mean?","replies":[{"poster":"Klatn Yelox","date":"2015-04-13T10:56:52.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adds a comment to the list so the post is placed higher, and gets more views.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-13T01:48:46.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as the differing placements it would almost have to be based on MMR, which to my knowledge is not known how to calculate it, but it does not entirely base off W/L so it is possible you had a higher MMR than your friend even though you played together all 10 games, factoring in you playing better in certain games having better stats all that cool shit that we don't know about","replies":[]}]}
