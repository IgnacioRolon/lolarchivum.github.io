In fact, I usually don't have time at all for it. But during the week, if I can, I like to be able to find one or two of the most entertaining games.\r\n\r\nProblem is, of course, I don't know what those games are. I remember when Riot used to mark those themselves, which was perfect for me. I'm not sure why they stopped that. But now I look at the list of games and think, \"I could spend some of my limited free time trying to hunt down the really exciting/skillful/close/newmeta/insert-adjective-here games. But I'll probably just wind up watching a really standard game.\" And then I end up not bothering.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any official or unofficial list of some of the best LCS games of each week? I usually watch NA, mostly because of the casters, but any League would be good, I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-23T07:23:34.471+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found the recommendations of the LoL VoD subreddit to be quite good. For the LCS games at least they run polls on which games are the most worth watching.\n\nExample link:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/LoLeventVoDs/comments/2xhgar/na_lcs_spring_split_2015_part_2/\n\nAnd then just scroll down to the 'Recommended Games' link below the VoD links. From this Saturday for example the TSM/Gravity's game's the one with the most votes by a large margin and it's certainly worth a look.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-03-23T22:47:07.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well a few of the most entertaining games I remember are UOL vs FNC week 8 (best LCS game I've ever seen), TSM vs GV week 8, TSM vs CLG week 4, and TSM vs TL week 5. Even if you don't like EU, I still highly recommend watching the UOL vs FNC game. It had almost everything I ever wanted in an LCS game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaedi","date":"2015-03-23T11:31:39.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are okay with watching EU, then you absolutely NEED to watch the UoL vs Fnatic game. Easily the best game all split.","replies":[]}]}
