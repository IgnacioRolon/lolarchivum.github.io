So, I'm currently doing that now. Will I get leaverbuster even when it is litereally impossible for me to connect to a game while it scans?","replies":[{"poster":"Noxe Out","date":"2016-08-16T06:34:42.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you'd have to leave a lot of games to get a leaver buster.

It will still count as a leave and regardless of intent, because it still causes other players a negative experience.  Hopefully, this repair will get you fixed up and get you back in the game.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
