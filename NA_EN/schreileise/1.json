Especially when it's not my fault. I understand that it has good intentions, but when I can't even load into a game because there are \"corrupted files that need to be scanned and repaired\" is complete and utter blashpemy. It's not my fault that I do a scan every day before I play and it still has issues. It's not anyone's fault that we can't load into the game unless the internet is bad or there are \"corrupted files\". It's Riot's. I also understand that a game can't be completely perfect, but it should be the game developer's job to aim for the highest rate of success. All this week I've had the same problem. Get loaded up in the loading screen, crash, try to again, crash, try to restart the client, \"Corrupted files need to be scanned and repaired\".  It's ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"61939590DEL1","date":"2016-08-01T16:40:47.530+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like kids don't understand how to use  Hextech Repair Tool.

This is also a key reason as to why penalties cannot be modified or removed in any way. \n\nWhen you're seeing frequent errors of corrupted assets in League, it's a good indication that your installation is beyond repair and needs to be cleanly reinstalled. You can easily complete this by grabbing our awesome [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) and running the repair feature. Simply check the boxes for both **'Reinstall'** and **'Clean Uninstall'** and let it run until completion. Afterwards, you'll want to boot up the client so it can finish patching, then you should be good to go.\n\nLet me know if this resolved the issue for you.","replies":[{"poster":"SchreiLeise","date":"2016-08-01T14:44:24.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been trying to reinstall since yesterday, because scanning and repairing kept giving me an error.
