Is this the game you played as Kayle today, or another?  I don't see anything after that, so there is a possibility that our game server had a hiccup.  If that's the case, it would act as if it never existed.  Hop in a custom game just in case as well, just to be sure there isn't a potential ISP issue or bad node.","replies":[{"poster":"Window View","date":"2017-09-15T23:20:54.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is a j4 game\nstill going on, assuming happened to everyone. dont mind tbh, no masteries and i dont jungle >.< could you close the server though please? want to get into a new one, on that LP climb woot woot","replies":[{"poster":"Window View","date":"2017-09-15T23:21:27.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also a reward possibly for this charming esports athlete who reported a serious problem? ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Window View","date":"2017-09-15T23:21:53.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like aetherwing kayle possibly for a poor high school student with no job ;-; no worries if you cant of course im just an ass and tryna milk it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T23:30:05.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL, I admire the effort.  Nope, afraid not but I would like to help troubleshoot.  It sounds like your game is still going on if it's loading to a black screen, it means your connection is having problems downloading assets.  You may want to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to be safe, and when you get a chance, do a custom game before queuing up again.","replies":[{"poster":"Window View","date":"2017-09-15T23:31:24.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks homeboy, doing that rn","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T23:33:05.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, thanks for the heads up as well.
