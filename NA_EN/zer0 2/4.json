I&#039;ve stood beside teammates and had them taunt me, been close to enemies in lane and had them taunt me, and I never ever hear her taunt responses (which is sad because they&#039;re so sassy!) {{sticker:sg-ahri-3}} \r\nI&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re just super duper quiet, or they aren&#039;t triggering at all.\r\nAlso, her charm lines, ability lines, and kill lines are _extremely_ quiet compared to her movement and attack lines. I really really have to listen out for them if I want to listen to what she&#039;s saying. And her charm ones especially are unintelligible.\r\nPlease fix this soon! :D Her voice work is so wonderful it&#039;d be such a shame to miss out on so much wonderfulness. {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-09-20T19:54:46.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TheyCallMeJinx,\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to give this feedback. I've heard this from a couple folks, and I agree it would be a shame if we aren't able to experience Ahri's VO in all its sassy glory. I will look into getting this fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"ZER0 2","date":"2017-09-20T22:57:02.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much!
