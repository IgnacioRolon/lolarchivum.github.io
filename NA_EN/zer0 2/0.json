The tunnelers were a problem because once you heard about them and how dangerous they are it makes the rest of your actions in the game feel meaningless, as they will eventually take over the wasteland no matter what faction you sided for. They are creatures that come in swarms, breed faster than you can kill them, with each requiring 2-3 strong fighters to actually take down. It will just become a war of attrition that the human race has no way of beating.\n\nI bring them up because the harrowing seems to be heading towards a similar situation. Each Harrowing is stronger and larger than the last. Which requires a larger fighting force  to fight them off, but that only means more zombies will attack you the next year while you have less soldiers. It just seems like a hopeless battle of attrition that makes anything happening in Bilgewater meaningless, as the entire island chain has at most 10 years before its population is either forced to evacuate or become zombified.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2015-09-24T03:44:14.619+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like Bilgewater needs a **savior**...","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-09-24T04:03:04.021+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"So pirate Jesus confirmed?","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-09-24T04:25:43.682+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can walk on rum.","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-09-24T04:31:38.793+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"He turns rum into more rum, and intoxicates (?) the sober.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-09-24T03:45:54.245+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:111}}?","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2015-09-24T13:16:10.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.

Given Jaredan's words here, I highly doubt that will be the case.  They look to be going the deus ex machina route, and that is a difficult tactic for even some of the best writers to pull off convincingly.
