It seems were not going to be getting any sort of intellectual response from them. I would suggest everyone simply stop playing to resist their nonsense, but I doubt most people don&#039;t even know what&#039;s going on, or that people are too addicted and that they can&#039;t stop. But we must show them that this toxic nonsense does not solve any problems.","replies":[]}
