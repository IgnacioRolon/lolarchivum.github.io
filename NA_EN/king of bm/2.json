I just can't move. The same has been occurring for many other people in the game that I've played in. I would like to know exactly what is going on with the riot servers as I'm quite sure it isn't an internet problem if it happens to many others, even those who live close to NA servers.\r\n\r\nYou guys earn a lot I know, but wouldn't it be a lot better if you could invest more in your servers?\r\n\r\nty","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T22:30:44.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find a record of issues with the gameservers lately on NA. This certainly sounds like packet loss or high packet buffering, which can affect multiple players in a game if their connections take the same network route to the server. Is this still happening or did it only happen in this one match?","replies":[{"poster":"King of BM","date":"2016-10-21T00:07:14.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It constantly happened for days. It's fixed now.\nThe problem was packet loss.\n\nTo other players :-\n\nIncase you see packet loss, don't play.\n\nTo check packet loss, Open cmd and type ping 104.160.131.3\n\nand it'll show you your ping/packetloss stats","replies":[]}]}]}
