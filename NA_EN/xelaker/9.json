A quick player has time to react an entire extra time before a lvl 5 Zoe Q comes attcha again because of this nerf. Hell, at level one you can react to her like 4 extra times before it&#039;s off cd again. She&#039;s a burst mage for goodness sake, how do I live out the power fantasy of being a god among men if you give people all this time to react to me not having Q!?\r\n\r\nRiot please buff Zoe&#039;s damage to compensate for this utter travesty.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-02-07T21:05:30.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sarcasm detected? lol Great guess I'll just live 4 seconds longer  and .25 secs longer once it's rank 5, average human reaction time( in the mind) is prob close to that, but does the body react?
