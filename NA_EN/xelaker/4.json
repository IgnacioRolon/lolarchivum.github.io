Building Ninja tabi's as a mage is often bad unless they are 100% AD. And if you fight someone like {{champion:45}} you almost need {{item:3111}}. Ninja tabi isn't always an option when you have to factor in 2 heavy damage dealers of opposing stats.

That wouldn't be problem because of his reload, except it's a pretty damn short reload time and I'd probably die before the reload happens more than once, so it doesn't do as much.\n\nTurtling is even harder because his Q will auto hit you if you're under tower and don't have a directional dash to get out of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2017-03-12T02:12:49.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just buy Ninja Tabi on everyone, geez...it's 2017 people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2017-03-12T08:37:16.111+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Only thing that blows him up is a fed burst mage?\n\nYou mean, nothing blows him up because lul {{item:3156}} {{item:3814}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2017-03-12T16:08:46.216+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves has fluctuated a lot this last year.
