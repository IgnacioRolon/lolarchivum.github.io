Again that&#039;s just an example, I dont actually want that in league, turrets are lame enough lol.\r\n\r\ntry and stay in the moba, or moba-like game style. I don&#039;t need to hear that league would be better if it had killstreak attack helicopters like COD...","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2017-02-27T02:02:42.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smite's perspective. You know, how you look from behind the champion's back and control the way your champion is facing? That's honestly the only thing about Smite I genuinely like; feels much more immersive than just looking from a helicopter view.","replies":[{"poster":"Bhagswag","date":"2017-02-27T02:06:50.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ironically, that's something that kinda irritates me. It's so weird to maneuver it after you've played League.\n\nHonestly, they should actually keep something like that, but make the camera more free. As of right now, you can barely move it up and down. only side to side. Kinda like how GTA V does it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-02-27T02:06:02.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"revenge!:if someone has killed you ten times with out dying, you can permanatly see them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2017-02-27T02:03:50.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age of Empires\n\nYou go Wololo and the enemy joins your side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-27T00:58:39.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balance in general.
