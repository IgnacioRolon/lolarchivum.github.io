It also gave some minor damage to minions if it was off of cd.\n\nIt was removed from league in 2011, due to a lack of use (back then, if you can believe it, turrets weren&#039;t made of wet paper) and as another step of shortening game lengths and preventing perpetual stalls. All good stuff...then. Now with the increase in damage and a hard lean to faster games, most games are decided at the 10 min mark, as one team will have first turret gold and the added pressure of roaming that comes with it causing the other team to collapse to defend or face increased ganks and roaming. Fortify might be a good way to put the brakes on the 4min 4 man gank bot to take bot turret.\n\nMaybe nobody would use it, and maybe it would end up doing more damage then good. Just an idea, any thoughts?\n\n\nand before ya&#039;ll hop on and tell me about the time you 1v5 and got a penta kill, saved your turret and was crowned &quot;the greatest player ever, and nobody can say any different because, internet!&quot; I don&#039;t care...There is literally no part of me that cares about your story. There&#039;s a person(s) who has defied odds and common outcomes on literally everything in the damn game.\n Lest we all forget the time Ap crit {{champion:16}} fought 6 champions in hexakill after being afk the first 20 min and got a penta, against all odds saved the turret and thus doesn&#039;t need fortify... Put forth conversation and reasoning, not campfire stories about glory. You wanna do that write fanfiction about league or some nonsense....\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\n\n\nEdit: this is my first post to really get beyond 1-2 pages and get an real number of likes. thanks guys it's pretty cool, lots of good ideas on both sides and tons of new ideas I didn't consider.","replies":[{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2017-01-15T19:49:23.296+0000","up_votes":74,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I won't lose my tower the first time I recall?

If you can always threaten their combo with that Summoner Spell, why would they even engage you in the first place, if it meant certain death?\n\nYou call it obnoxious but their kit has been designed with that in mind.\nIf you simply shut it down until you get a kill, that kit has no real value in games.\n\nIf you're suddenly giving champions a _**\"healing/shielding\" debuff**_, then Soraka, Jaina and SOna are completely worthless, if you manage to apply Grevious Wounds as well. Their entire gameplay revolves around such utility and if you shut it down with a click of a button, their entire gameplay falls apart.\n\nThose \"counter\" situations you're talking about aren't proving to solve any issues.\nIt looks to me like you're looking for a way to shut down particular champions.\nAnd i'm not a fan of adding _**Anti-[Champion Name] Spells\"**_ to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDelighted","date":"2017-01-16T20:23:10.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mechanics I'm talking about are mobility, shielding and healing and stuff like that.

LeBlanc has 2 dashes and a Flash, Syndra only has a Flash. If Flash didn't exist, Syndra would have no mobility while LeBlanc only two dashes still. The mobility to immobility ratio remains the same. One champion's Flash cancels the use of another Flash on the same lane.\n\nNow, one could say that since those summoner spells you propose are just that, potentially every champion can use it so if you cancel your opponents healing/sheilding or mobility,\nhe can do exactly the same to you.\n\nBut here's where the difference lies:\nWill those summoner spells become default Summoner Spells like Flash?\nSo will you have Flash + [New Summoner Spell] being the default spells?\n\n**If that's the case:**\nBad design - the rest of Summoner Spells are never used.\n\n**If that isn't the case:**\nBad design - these new spells are used as hard counters to the champions who's kit revolves around the use of skills it blocks.

The same happened to masteries. No. Having more options for summoners spells don't reduce the effectiveness of others. There will just be new spells to choose from. They are not locked behind any items so anyone should be able to take them just like flash exhaust, ghost and all the current spells.\n\n I suggested these spells as an example and not a ready in game spell. With more spells I wish we finally get away from summoners spells meta of adc picks heal, support picks exhaust, etc. If new spells were to be included support could choose between getting a cc to shut down mobile assassins from killing them, and the assassin could pick up heal/shield debuff to reduce the effectiveness of the support or picking the current choices if that's good. ALWAYS HAVING A CHOICE. \n\nAlso THERE ARE NO DEFAULT SPELLS! Spells and masteries should be used based on the situation and not because of their power. Heck even flash gets replaced for other spells in certain champions.\n\nNow, we have ignite a pretty straightforward spell. Point and click damaging and applying GRIEVOUS WOUNDS which reduces the effectiveness of heals. Is this a bad design? From your point of view it should as it reduces healing effectiveness against certain champions with regen and healing spells in their kit. \nAnother current example exhaust. It slows ms and as as well as breaking resistances. It counters attack speed reliant champions like yi or most of marksmen and/or assassins \nAnother spell including both of your above bad design features. Cleanse. It removes all cc (not suppression) and gains resistance of 65% for new ones. It counters all cc heavy champions as well as it is rarely actually used. A skill that by your standards of bad design should make most spells obsolete.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-01-17T01:34:34.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, on Olaf Flash is replaced with a Ghost.\nRyze doesn't need combat spells, he's pretty strong himself so he uses both Flash + Ghost. And honestly, this is the default setting for mid laners in general at the moment. They want more escape options to guarantee their escape or chasing the target because they're inherently immobile.\n\nFlash is the default for all champions. Only a few champions actually can make that switch.\nIf you do make that switch as a Marksman or Support, if you get flanked by the enemy champion, you have no escape options if your champion doesn't have an inherent blink or dash. Assassins would never get this utility block as they could kill through it anyway.\nThey use flash and Ignite or something else, very rarely, if they need it. They can get through shields anyway and with Ignite, it already counters healing effects.\n\nSupports don't use anything else besides Flash, Exhaust or very rarely Ignite as everything else offered is a selfish summoner spell, only benefiting yourself. Marksmen do the same - Flash + Heal, suited for a duo lane. \n\nAnd this isn't a problem of summoner spells.\nYou can certainly say: \"the meta dictates...\" and you'd be right. But the bottom line is that if a top laner can do more with a TP than with Ignite, why take Ignite in the first place? If selfish summoner spells aren't making a difference because the games can't be won from just one lane (and not because they're weak), there's only one option. You have to pick Flash/Ghost for utility and you have to pick a team summoner spell, appropriate for your lane.\nMaybe an overhaul of Summoner Spells is needed but even if there's 10 spells to rework, changing an underlying system that plays a big part in the balance of champions is not an easy task to accomplish.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2017-01-15T19:55:30.158+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given how the game has changed I think Fortify would have a good chance of seeing more play then before.
