Among the many major updates to champions or otherwise that needed to be addressed, Riot had already exclaimed that Galio was very close to the top of the list. So if anything stony and threatening is getting updated, it's him.\n\nA turret update/rework sounds nice though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ajimu Najimi","date":"2017-03-03T03:00:59.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fallenreaper88,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=clRihd44,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-03T00:52:06.472+0000)\n>\n> Honestly it looks way more like aatrox and he has a huge update in pbe i know theyve stated galio is next but they might of changed there minds because of the communities petetions to fix aatrox over galio\n\nI disagree heavily. These things take about half a year to develop, and Galio has been in development (publically at least) for over six months now. There's no way they'd scrap him and somehow develop a new model for Aatrox in a matter of two weeks for pretty much no reason.\n\nI wouldn't be shocked if Riot made Galio a Darkin who turned to stone, and now serves as the protector of Demacia. That would make him fit in the world of Runeterra while still fulfilling the Garegoyal themeatic. (It would also explain why he has similarities with Aatrox)","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-03-03T03:40:45.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I never said they scrapped him i just dont think its actually a teaser for galio cause aatrox has major work on pbe and the silohete looks like the current aatrox","replies":[{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2017-03-03T05:55:56.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox is not a major rework at all.
