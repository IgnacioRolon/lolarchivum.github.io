I would feel pretty bad about giving you a one-time gift, and you not be able to buy anything with it =\\ . \n\nI did notice you had enough IP to buy her that way though, and that would allow you to ask for an RP gift in the future when you need it. With that being said, let me know if you still want this one-time gift rp!\n\nP.S.
