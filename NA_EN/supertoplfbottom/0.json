Like the diamond 2 kindred that trolls the account to gold on a 38% winrate. Either a boosted account or straight up griefing every game. He doesn't say bad words tho so keep ruining another 150 games. \r\n\r\nOr the vlad before that just running it down mid then afk. Or the countless games before that of people who just don't fuckin know what they are doing at all. And it's not gold/low plat level not knowing what they do. It's literally never played league before. Every game has these people doesn't matter on which side they are on tho they are obviously mostly on your side.\r\n\r\nUnplayable garbage this fuckin soloQ. Such a horrid game quality. But knowing riot they will just reset dia+ so the only content creators left stop complaining and we can blame the shitty in game experience on \"oh well it's just low elo you just need to get better hehexd\". Is that why this season everyone keeps their rank from last season? Cuz IT IS fuckin impossible to climb with this shit. When 1/3 rd of your games is ruined by inters, LP \"bug\" abuser and other shit. Do the math yourself how many of your games you need to win to just go even and then look at the game what is left of being able to solo carry. Oh yeah nothing. Nothing is left cuz solocarry according to shitty low elo players is toxic. So now noone can carry anymore and just has to accept he loses many games and you have to grind hundreds of games to equal the bullshit out. \r\n\r\n\r\nMan am i glad riot keeps listening to shitty players. You can't even roam anymore to stop your NPCs from inting the lane cuz then your opponent gets free gold from plates. It's actually sad what a disgusting piece of trash this game has become where being a good player gets punished by catch up xp, turret plating and bounty gold. All while the game STILL SNOWBALLS THE FUCK OUT BECAUSE THE REASON IS NOT CHAMPIONS SOLO CARRYING THE FUCKIN GAME. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's like there is a fuckin radiated mutating wound and riot slaps some duct tape on it \"this'll help\". All while this fuckin game crumbles. \r\n\r\nPlease for the love of god hard reset the ladder, fire the interns you call \"live design\" and save this game from being destroyed.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2019-02-27T20:22:20.902+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realize that hard resetting the ladder would cause master level players to get pai up with/against bronze players, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-02-27T21:27:24.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"What else would it be at that point. Its already happening. I can't win more than two games before the outdated mmr system dredges up two people that shouldn't even be playing with me in my matches and makes it practically a loss from the get go.\nIf they ain't gonna fix the ladder, at least fix this outdated mmr system and replace it with something like Overwatches, where your current rank and tier points (LP in our case) would determine your mmr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boltonator","date":"2019-02-27T20:56:48.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baron Barian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ag7iO0Pc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-27T20:22:20.902+0000)\n>\n> You realize that hard resetting the ladder would cause master level players to get pai up with/against bronze players, right?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-02-27T21:04:43.081+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why the hell would resetting the ladder do anything except make everything you complain about worse?\n\nA ton of players would tilt out of their minds and just go on inting sprees, because their hard-earned rank means nothing. Matchmaking would be a trainwreck for multiple seasons. It would do nothing to fix your perceived issues with balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starmfangy","date":"2019-02-27T20:53:14.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Well people have to find fun somehow, and this game IS becoming worse at balancing anything at all...\n\nThe reason so many people troll is because its easy to ruin a game now. One item ahead even the extra 40 points of damage can mean you dying a lot to opponents.\n\n RIots decisions to add champions every week and ignore obvious solutions to balance made this game horrible and unfun to play, but trolling to get others mad is the next step to having fun in this game.","replies":[]}]}
