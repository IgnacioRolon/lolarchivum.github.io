One is healing, and one is a shield.\n\nSylas utilizes ultimates a lot better in the late game even if they don't synergize with his kit, because an ultimate on a 9 second cooldown is almost always going to be useful regardless of who it was stolen from. At that point Sylas can blow all the ults first, then go into the fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Thingamajig","date":"2019-06-05T15:32:20.676+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Worst Summoner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TFpkQPpg,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-05T15:07:25.641+0000)\n>\n> Sylas is semi-weak against healing reduction, but his damage mitigation comes in two parts.

So 6-9% play rate being almost exclusively mains in her case isn't actually hard to believe.\n\nThen again, the boards had it even worse. A good amount of patches ago, Shaco had a close to 60% win rate according to leagueofgraphs in D+, with a decent pick rate, similar to Riven's current 6-9%. Since he's my perma ban, of course I called it out on one thread where the OP asked for Shaco buffs (despite the bastard being a Shaco main with 80% win rate on Shaco in around 100+ games this season), and a hella lot of Shaco mains (I don't expect someone who's not a Shaco main to spew that type of thing) told me this: \"Only mains play him, so he deserves a high winrate\", when told that 8% isn't \"mains only\", they said that it's true, as he's popular and \"fun to play\" (didn't knew it's fun to play items, but who knows, maybe some have fun with it).\n\nTL:DR - For Riven, Riot stated that she has a huge amount of mains, so her having mostly mains in 6-9% pr is plausible. Without seeing Riot's data, we only have their word. But the boards would say that even if it's untrue, when they have no proof.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-06-04T15:43:03.681+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":39,"body":"They were massive nerfs.
