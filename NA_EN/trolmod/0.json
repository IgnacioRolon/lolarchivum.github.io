So the entire game from round one of minions blitz starts fishing and its immediately 5v1..... before we can level up once its 0-9 kills.....repeat over and over and over and over until the end of the game. Blitz has no place in ARAM..... the game was utterly pointless.\r\n\r\n10/10.... will leave all future ARAM games with blitz in it","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-26T08:53:27.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what is playing safe? or dodging?  those are serious dkills that aram teaches","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kevin711","date":"2017-07-12T23:40:38.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yep gotta learn to dodge and anticipate","replies":[]}]}
