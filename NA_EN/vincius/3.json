The thing is, right now, flask makes it a bit too safe for them early game, most of the time they can just farm taking a lot of damage and healing with flask + 3 potions until level 6 or more where they can't be stopped no more. Now I am not saying they CAN'T be shutdown, but flask makes it a bit too smooth for them, especially for Nasus and Kass with their respective lifesteal/shield. Flask gives 120 health per charge (renewable) and potions 150, that means someone can heal for 810 health before really taking damage (that's without other form of healing) and spam their skills because of mana regen. Now I know that if you get flask you aren't getting a Doran or something else, but the difference on the long term for lategame champions is so insignificant, it pretty much doesn't matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2015-03-04T17:27:05.331+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"early game bullies can chunk down a flask champ hard enough to cause them to miss out on a lot of EXP/gold. nasus requires ganks since he's basically a brick wall anyway, and kass is being reworked. veig is meant to be a safe ranged farmer and get obliterated if someone gets in his face.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-03-04T17:31:07.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope, even champions like Kassa or Talon that completely need Flask at start to survive still have a tough time laning the first few levels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-03-04T17:29:02.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a lot of lane bullies are strong because of their level 1-6 all ins.  if you  have flask it means you aren't itemized defensively against that and you have a good chance of being 100-0'd\n\nflask is only good against champions that chip away at you when you're trying to farm. if any of those champions have strong followup damage then you're going to die in lane with a flask.","replies":[]}]}
