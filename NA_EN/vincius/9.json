It is so addictive I have a hard time stepping away from LoL, but this game has too many issues, not that they are new, but they don't get fixed.\n\nFirst you have the toxic community, now I know every  game has its share, but due to the nature of the game, a team game where you can't leave before 20 minutes and where you might even get forced to keep playing after that if you team does not agree on a surrender, toxicity reaches a whole new level, sure you can ''ignore\" those players and they added an OP ''mute button'' but I get the feeling that Riot just do not wish to truly deal with toxic player, how often do I hear people saying how they don't give a damn cuz they won't get punished anyways, or that reporting people doesn't do shit, sure it does at some point but it takes way too much time, and when you've been level 30 for years, there is no reason why someone with 2000+ victories can call you ''piece of shit'' or say that ''his team is garbage'', first offense? I mean... come on!\n\nThen there is the problem of dc's and afk's. I dealt with those in the past and maybe I'm just having bad luck, but since preseason 5 began, the numbers of those I get is insane, pretty much at least a dc or 5+ min afk on one team or the other everygame. and then again, not only do people keep afking when their team do bad, Riot's server seems to have gotten worse. In my last 30 games, I could count on one hand the number of games that went smoothly. Riot's solution? Put people in a 5 games low priority queue, this is a real joke.\n\nFinally there is lag, too many games played where at least one player has some insane ping or starts moonwalking. I mean in a game where every fractions of seconds counts, things have to run smoothly.\n\nI still think League is a great game, and if anyone can live with those problems, I'm happy for them, but it is too frustrating for me right now. I hope that players who are in a similar situation while upvote and that players who are not will still be able to understand how these problems can affect the quality of gameplay and the overall experience with the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2014-12-11T00:30:39.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trouble does not end with dc, afk, toxicity, lag, or trolls. Oh no, they also wreck any champion they desire arbitrarily, leaving you without your favorite champ along with the ip & skin you invested on it. Without mentioning that time and dedication for days you also invested to be able to buy it, and suit it, with the correct runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightET","date":"2014-12-10T17:53:08.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey,\n\nI feel your pain. I quit LoL at the beginning of may for the same reasons, but I came back in September with a different mindset. \nI was taking this game way too seriously back then and I was, like you, getting so mad for those same reasons. Now I just focus on my play, I don't even argue with toxic players in game because it doesn't help. Just let it go. They will eventually shut up if nobody replies to them. And if they don't, who cares.\n\nActually, now that I don't argue/reply to toxic players, I win way more often because I'm more focused on the game and I keep encouraging my team mates that we can win even if we are behind.\n\nAs for the dcs/afks, well it happens to all of us. Sometimes they're with you or against you. \n\nThe community is the same pretty much in every game. Trolls/afk/feeders are everywhere.\n\nAs much as Riot tries to punish the bad players, I don't think it will ever change.\n\nLoL is a great game and maybe you need a break so you can come back in a few months :)","replies":[{"poster":"Vincius","date":"2014-12-11T07:51:05.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> As for the dcs/afks, well it happens to all of us.

Trolls/afk/feeders are everywhere.\n\nIdk, yeah sure they are everywhere, but I don,t know many games where you have to keep playing for 20 minutes or get punished. And honestly, muting someone in say, Diablo 3, is not the same as muting 20% of your team in a game where communication is a prioprity.\n\n> As much as Riot tries to punish the bad players, I don't think it will ever change.\n\nThe problem is, I don't feel like they are seriously trying, they want to keep a maximum of players playing so the cash keeps coming in and World Championship keeps being monstruous.\n\n> LoL is a great game and maybe you need a break so you can come back in a few months :)\n\nLoL is a great game when you have a nice team and you play on a nice smooth server, now I don't mind these problems FROM TIME TO TIME, but the lag and the numbers of dc's right now is unbearable for me, and players learned with time that Riot is not really interested in punishing players as long as both toxic player and good players keep playing, and that is why I'll be leaving LoL for a while before I fall in the first category. Maybe when the number of players start dropping and the % of toxic players rises even more they'll take the problem more seriously.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vincius","date":"2014-12-12T06:18:30.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get many of those!","replies":[]},{"poster":"D0nC","date":"2014-12-11T07:55:50.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feeding trolls, don't forget those.","replies":[]}]}
