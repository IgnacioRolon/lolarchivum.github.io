Obviously Riot doesn't truly want to ban them as it would lower the numbers of players, reduce incomes, etc.. So why not match trolls with trolls and nice players with nice players? I don't know how possible that would be, but since there are already a report and an honor system in place, I figured it shouldn't be too complicated. There should be different queues for different kind of players, for example, nice players (which are the most numerous imo) should be in a queue with other players having very little reports or high honors. The worst players should also have their own queue so they can troll togheter. Then there could be another queue for players in remission, players who have been naughty but have seen their number of reports drop dramatically or their honor rises over the last x games. Since there is already different queue for different game modes and since there are already both a report system and an honor system in place, I think it shouldn't be complicated for Riot to put in place a system which separates the goods, the bads and the ugly from each other, this way Riot keeps all his revenues and player base intact and TRULY punish bad players AND reward good players. This would also boost the honor system which is too lightly used right now and not enough rewarding compared to the report system. If you think this would be a good idea, UPVOTE this thread = P","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2015-01-23T18:49:59.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"prisoners island\" mentality has been shot down time and again. Toxicity is like a wheel, the more it spins the more rage, vitrol and trolling is created. The more toxicity that's around the faster the wheel spins. Your suggestion *ideally* separates the toxicity yes, but only causes the wheel to spin so much faster on the 'island' making it pretty much impossible for anyone to redeem themselves once they're in.\n\nThe thing you have to understand is that a lot of ragers and toxic people are not regularly toxic. They had a bad day, a loss streak or any number of things happen that made them a horrible teammate enemy that one day. Hell I've toted the green ribbon for quite awhile and I can't say I've been perfect. Should I be **condemned** to a separate que with other trolls because I had a bad day even if I'm positive and supportive every time else?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vincius","date":"2015-01-23T19:30:20.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not talking about having a bad day or occasional ragers or connection problems, I am talking about that very little amount of players that totally ruins this game. To get to the toxic pool, you'd have to be a consistently toxic player, being toxic over days, weeks, the kind that gets banned for a few day and keeps being toxic. I understand that the ''prisoners island'' you talk about is not very attractive, but let's face it, right now, nice players gets constantly abused, I've seen people stop playing because not everyone can deal with these player with ease, I've also seen new players reluctant to play because they feel like they wouldn't be able to deal with them. Honestly, between having your account parmabanned or being in a queue with other toxic players, what's the worst case? And I choose leaving those players between them over having nice players quit the game because the toxicity is too much for them to bear, because sure you can mute other player and report them, but once someone sensitive gets call ''piece of shit'' or gets told ''go kill yourself'', it's already too late, it's printed on his mind.","replies":[]}]}
