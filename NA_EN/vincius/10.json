I played something like 10 games today and unfortunately I realized that no matter how fun this game is when i get teamed with nice players it almost never happens. Almost all of my games had toxic players, calling me things ranging from noob to piece of s**t when I'd do the slightest mistake or, even worst, when I would do well but not the way they wanted. In 3 or 4 games players went afk, that's when I was lucky, because in a game I got a Teemo that played ''catch me if you can'' running around the map and laughing when killed. In another one, I had a Vayne who tried all game to get killed by the enemy's laser. On top of that, you have the fact that you have to deal with it for at least 20 minutes sometimes more when they take pleasure preventing a surrender. At the end of the day I realized I wasted my day playing a team game where people can do the worst things with pretty much no consequences and thus ruin the experience of a great numbers of players. I really do not understand how players can get trough thousands of games constantly trolling and still have their account, there is no way these people suddenly started acting like this after so many games. Anyways, League of Legend could be such an amazing game but Riot seems to care way about the number of players, the LCS and the money income than about making this game a nice and smooth experience. I really could love this game but I realized I'm gonna have to stay away from this game since I am not having much fun playing it anymore. I really hope more people speak their voices or start playing a bit less, because the only way Riot will change is philosophy is when players are gonna stop playing and spending money on their game. I'm kinda sad about all this but I think it's for the best. Good luck to all of you summoners!","replies":[]}
