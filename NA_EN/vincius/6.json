The only problem is, why does she Q in the direction she is facing? This has to be the most counter-intuitive thing ever, you have your cursor somewhere you press Q and u go in a complete direction, of course not always, like if your are already facing in the right direction or have cursor over enemy you'll hit at the right place, I'm aware of but still... I mean 99% of skills work the other way around, I wish someone had a good reason to explain this mechanic so I could say like ''HAAAAAAAAA! That's why!''. Any thought on that? Should they change it you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2014-12-09T19:42:42.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IIRC she was designed that way before they figured out how to program champs to jump towards cursor.  You can look at the pre-rework Nidalee vs the reworked Nidalee for an example here.\n\nThere is an advantage to it in my eyes - you can move in a direction with Broken Wings without your mouse cursor being in that direction, which allows you to quickly click to move in a different direction or cast Valor to dash there.\n\nI think for the most part Riven mains (myself included) prefer that she Q in the direction she faces.

You E->Q because the E puts you right up against it.  The final Q hop has a very short length so if you aren't right up against the wall you can sometimes miss the hop. Throwing the E in is an easy way to guarantee that you don't miss it by accident.  Really useful in situations where you're getting chased down and you can't afford to miss a hop.\n\nand maybe you're right regarding cursor and valor. i'm just always spam clicking when I Valor because using it stops her movement entirely so you have to input another action immediately anyways.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BRBGTGBOWFLEX","date":"2014-12-09T20:44:57.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, if you want a good reason for it.\n\n- Let's say you're running away from someone and being chased, you're both extremely low health, if they catch you, you die, shield/w/flash on cd, but ignite is up and they are gaining on you.

Why is it the only spell? Every gap closer, or jump or anything could be like that, but they only made that very skill do that (at my own knowledge anyways). Maybe there is no answer, but I have a hard time understanding why someone would go like ''hey, let's do something weird with Riven's Q instead of attacking where the player's cursor is, she could jump in the direction she is facing'', I just think it makes Riven weird to play at first, if I play her a lot I'll probably get used to it but for now, it just sucks plain and simple.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xLegendary Troll","date":"2014-12-09T20:14:26.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you highlight something with your curser and press Q, Riven will attempt to Q that target if they're within range of its hit box.
