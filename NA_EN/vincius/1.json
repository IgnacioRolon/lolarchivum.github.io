I know that the number of wins isn't everything, but it really helps organizing a good premade of 5 players or at least, letting you know if someone you invite might struggle because he has 100 wins and everyone have 1000+. Now we can still see the ranked ranking (which can be both a good and bad indicators) but not the amount of total wins anymore. It is great that they added the possibility to see which champion and what spot and role people played lately, but I think Riot should bring back the ability to know how many wins a player has.","replies":[]}
