I main top, I am also good as a jungler and a decent mid. Right now I am Silver II but I feel like I am currently placed slightly below where I should be, low gold would probably be a sweet spot for me.  I am looking for a semi serious team, people who play to win, but who do not rage, insult others or throw cheesy punchlines at their teammates. If I am the kind of player you are looking for add me ingame : Vincius.","replies":[]}
