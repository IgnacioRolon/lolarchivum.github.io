When you take a look at the original list of champions, most of them had like one hard escape like a flash, lots only had one soft escape like Ryze with his snare or Ashe with her slow/stun. Sure some assassins like Leblanc or Kassadin had high mobility but nowadays, they all do.\r\n\r\nAlistar Amumu Annie Anivia Ashe Blitzcrank Cho'Gath Corki Dr. Mundo Evelynn Fiddlesticks Gangplank Heimerdinger Janna Jax Karthus Kassadin Katarina Kayle Malphite Master Yi Morgana Nasus Nunu Rammus Ryze Shaco Singed Sion Sivir Soraka Taric Teemo Tristana Tryndamere Twisted Fate Twitch Veigar Warwick Zilean\r\n\r\nI also feel like the community knows that Riot is overly tolerant with toxic players and they just don't give a damn anymore, every single game I have 1 or 2 toxic players, not always super toxic but annoying at best totally trash in the worst case scenario. Truth is I still kinda like LoL but Idk, it's changed a lot and not for the best I feel.\r\n\r\nMaybe just another QQ thread Idk, maybe I'm in the wrong and game got better, more action packed, maybe I'm an old grumpy LoL player living in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Vincius","date":"2014-11-25T20:02:34.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're the original champions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tavish","date":"2014-11-25T19:27:27.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have always been high mobility champs.  Zed was released in Season 2, and Kat came out in 2009! I'm not sure what all the champions you listed in that paragraph have in common? They all have abilities ? (because that is the only correlation I can see)\n\nAnd there are champions being released with low mobility.  Everyone forgets Vel'Koz exists, one of the least mobile champions in the game currently. \n\nThere was also Nidalee in 2009, who had 2 kits.  This is also not new.  Plus Elise was released in 2012.","replies":[]}]}
