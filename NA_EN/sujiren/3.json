Testers aren't asked, let alone required to contribute, and often the feedback they give is ignored anyway. Well-documented bug reports posted by multiple players are left unanswered for months after a champion, rework or skin launches, even for years in some cases (e.g. the Mordekaiser rework), balance feedback is ignored because of the one time Riot overbuffed juggernauts, and design feedback isn't even considered, as whichever kit is released on the PBE is usually assumed to be the final product. Not only are players not expected to actually test on PBE, they're brought in under the assumption that they can give feedback for anything, yet are largely ignored even when they do try to contribute.

They do still punish players, just like on Live. Getting your PBE account banned once, Riot won't ever get it back to you again. But, is this actually of consequence to anyone? Not really.

The problem isn't that Riot doesn't fine-tune balance around PBE (that I agree is impossible), but that they ignore PBE feedback even when a champion turns out to be grossly out of balance, as is the case for Galio right now. The same goes for clearly abusive interactions, such as Cho'Gath and Gargoyle Stoneplate, to the point where Riot clearly doesn't take _any_ balance feedback, even the bare minimum that doesn't require massive amounts of play to be useful to them.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EooAQumE,comment-id=0004000000000001,timestamp=2017-10-26T21:40:19.034+0000)\n> \n> If Riot seriously had to enforce the rules and tie your penalties from PBE on your Live account, how many people do you believe would actually go there and test the content and play on 150 ping, only to risk getting punished?\n\nYou misunderstand me.

Purging the PBE of toxic or inactive accounts would be a first step, and enacting a stricter vetting process could have significantly better returns compared to the resources that would be put in. Riot is a major company now, they don't have the excuse of being a small indie company to justify not putting the necessary resources into their own product.

The whole of human society does not rely on the mere goodwill of people to not murder each other in order to function; that is why we have legal and judicial systems in place.

The only reason it has improved is precisely because Riot has finally begun implementing a more robust player behavior system that directs players to be more honorable. Never does any playerbase spontaneously become less toxic on its own, and it's both ridiculous and lazy to expect that to happen with no further effort required.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EooAQumE,comment-id=0004000000000001,timestamp=2017-10-26T21:40:19.034+0000)\n> \n> Don&#x27;t do something you wouldn&#x27;t do on your Live account, plain and simple.\n\nI know that, but what's stopping players from being toxic on the PBE, if there are no consequences to their actions?

Again, you're preaching to the choir here, and the issue is that many players don't think in that long-term logical sense. We wouldn't have any toxicity at all otherwise, anywhere or anytime. Going in with this terribly naïve mentality, i.e. that every player is this perfectly logical person, is bound to fail, and if you follow it just a little beyond its premises, it becomes clear that it simply does not apply to the current situation, and is completely useless in trying to resolve the issues underlining negative player behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-10-26T22:50:01.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have a PBE account.\nI've had one for 2-3 years as a matter of fact.\n\nI know Riot punishes people there because i make it a point to report people on any server i play, because i can't tolerate shit eaters in any shape or form. And i've gotten a few popups that players have been punished on PBE, just like i did on Live. So from my experience, Riot does punish players.

The fact that this apparently does not seem to happen on PBE which, by all rights, should have even stricter standards of behavior than Live, does show to me that Riot doesn't really put that many resources into moderating PBE players. As much as I'd like to take you up on your word and believe that your reports were effective, the number of feedback threads on the PBE complaining about the toxicity and lack of action taken against it says otherwise. Just the simple fact that there are enough toxic players on the PBE for it to get talked about, when the vetting process should be rigorous enough to only let in dedicated testers and just a few outliers, is already an indicator that there is a problem. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EooAQumE,comment-id=000400000000000100000000,timestamp=2017-10-26T22:50:01.640+0000)\n> \n> No PBE feedback is ever being ignored, in the same manner you wouldn&#x27;t see a Rioter answer every question on NA Boards. Rioters are busy people\n\nSo are we, yet we still choose to test in addition to our daily lives and jobs. Taking in feedback, by contrast, _is_ part of Riot's job. PBE is supposed to be an environment for concentrated bug-testing and feedback, so if Riot is too busy to acknowledge even the most basic feedback, then that is entirely on them, and they need to hire more people to work on this.\n\nThis also completely fails to acknowledge the many times players have given excellent feedback in large numbers and still gotten ignored. Remember the Mordekaiser update? Literally every single player who tested it gave overwhelmingly negative feedback, yet his kit is the one that changed the least out of the four juggernauts being reworked throughout PBE testing. This wasn't an issue of Riot being \"too busy\" to do anything, this was Riot deliberately ignoring player feedback and powering through with their own content as if PBE didn't exist. To this day, Mordekaiser has literally dozens of bugs, many of which have been documented since his update released on PBE, yet none of them are being addressed even now.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EooAQumE,comment-id=000400000000000100000000,timestamp=2017-10-26T22:50:01.640+0000)\n> \n> Giving feedback is not a way for us to demand changes to the game.\n\nExcept PBE players tend to do the former, and are treated as if they were doing the latter, as you are trying to do so now.

Do you really think we need to wait until a champion or item ends up with a 60+% or 40-% win rate for months on Live before any action gets taken? What's more, Riot has shown on multiple occasions that their own means of interpreting the data is... partial, to say the least, and when they do make the effort of sharing their interpretation with the rest of the playerbase (which only rarely happens), they are very quickly proven wrong and criticized for the flaws in their reasoning.\n\nThe problem with both you and, to some degree, Riot, is that you're viewing players as opponents, as people vying for power and control, when the truth is that players are both consumers and a potentially immense asset, in that if you give them the proper tools, they can output tremendously positive contributions, and all for free. As PBE testers, we ask for nothing more than for a serious chance at having our feedback get taken seriously, and even just as players on Live, posting on the Boards, many of us go here because we support Riot, and want to help them. Ignoring and dismissing the playerbase on the grounds that \"there aren't enough resources\", or that \"Riot's just too busy\", when Riot Games is literally a billion-dollar company, is complete bullshit, and railing against players giving feedback for supposedly wanting to dictate the course of the entire game is demonstrative of a structural attitude problem, rather than one of resources.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-10-27T10:26:14.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser isn't even an issue anymore.\nHe's slotted for an eventual VGU because his Juggernaut update didn't pan out right.

Being an ass, insulting people and demanding attention is the reason why i refuse to even comment on some of those threads because it's pointless to enter a discussion when the entire thread isn't even interested in one.

This is their top priority project. I'm sorry that they can't take your own priority list a look but the reality of the situation is that Riot is a big company and their own picture of our entire playerbase and balance changes is the big picture. Not something you look at from your own perspective. Since pre-season runes aren't on Live, this is the PBE feedback they're now taking into consideration when balancing them.\n\nWhen you look at Censer problem, you think that only nerfing it would fix the problem and that might be the case. But Riot's job is to take a look at Censer and every other champion that buys it/uses it and seeing if perhaps they aren't the problem or identifying something about their kits that was overtuned. Perhaps the item works as intended but the champions using it push it the the limits.\n\nYou (we as individual players) look at balance of League through a narrow lense while Riot looks at it through a wide lense. And this is always somehow ignored when we're talking about Riot \"taking their sweet ass time at nerfing shit and sitting on their hands counting money\". It's always Riot that's apparently lazy, too slow to react and not interested in actual fair balance while we are the exemplar members of our pristine community that can only be described as good players for bringing these problems to their attention...\n\nIf Riot needs to punish players in order to get us in line (as we've discussed earlier), we're definitely not the exemplar members of our community.

Part of the problem I think comes from the Reddit-style structure of the Boards, which encourages some posters to write empty, low-effort threads just for the sake of getting upvotes. I also think part of the problem comes from any video game feedback forum, in that some players go beyond giving feedback and instead vent their frustrations at their in-game losses. These, however, are structural problems, problems that Riot has made no effort to address, and should not discredit the players actually making an effort to try to help. Moreover, Riot's infrequent and unreliable communication schedule adds fuel to the fire, as it does add to the impression that the devs ignore players and only answer the easy questions, yet still want to call themselves good player communicators. Again, venting on game forums is pretty much the standard, as unfortunate as that is, so it really is up to Riot to improve on their communication, which they haven't really done in the past few years.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EooAQumE,comment-id=00040000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-27T10:26:14.521+0000)\n> \n> I find this argument worn out already.\n> What if Riot&#x27;s a billion dollar company? Does that somehow magically exempt them from still working as a regular company or do you believe that throwing enough money at a specific problem will magically make it disappear?\n\nThat's the thing, though: in many ways, Riot isn't working as a regular company, they're working as if they were still a startup. This is why their communications strategy has aged so badly, because their developers simply do not have the time to also take on the full-time job of communicating with the playerbase. This is a situation where hiring more people with the specific goal of communicating with players, something that Riot can clearly afford to do, would greatly benefit them. It is ridiculous to call a company's vast success and wealth \"a worn out argument\".\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EooAQumE,comment-id=00040000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-27T10:26:14.521+0000)\n> \n> Right now, the majority of their resources are tied to the pre-season and balance changes to the new runes + masteries.\n\nAnd this costs a billion dollars? Do you have any understanding of how a company works? Riot is a company with only one game still, and while much of their income undoubtedly goes towards servers, engineering, ongoing art and stuff, the company is sure as hell not putting all of their massive income directly into design, nor are they strapped for cash, so they can absolutely afford to hire an actual player relations team.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EooAQumE,comment-id=00040000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-27T10:26:14.521+0000)\n> \n> When you look at Censer problem, you think that only nerfing it would fix the problem and that might be the case.

Perhaps the item works as intended but the champions using it push it the the limits.\n\nThat is not how balancing works. If the commonality to multiple champions who have become OP is that they buy this one item, then statistically speaking it's the item that's OP. There are more subtleties to this, but ultimately there is a process to balancing that aims for efficiency. This is, again, not a billion-dollar problem.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EooAQumE,comment-id=00040000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-27T10:26:14.521+0000)\n> \n> You (we as individual players) look at balance of League through a narrow lense while Riot looks at it through a wide lense. \n\nI agree, player perception differs from that of the developers, as there are changes we want to see that the developers may want to address later. However, when there is a large consensus of homogeneous feedback, as is frequently the case, that is not something that can be chalked down to individual player perception.

Second, if your argument is that it's mainly for bug testing and minor balancing, that already contradicts the official stated goal of the PBE, where it invites players to give feedback of all kinds. There is a lack of clarity in what Riot truly expects PBE testers to provide, and a disconnect with the impression they give to new PBE testers and applicants.

However, this raises the question as to _why_ players are toxic, including on the PBE. People don't spontaneously become toxic, and while perhaps some of this toxicity is inherent to playing a competitive PvP multiplayer game, I do think there are many opportunities to curb this toxicity that are being missed. Something as relatively small as tying the Honor Initiative rewards on the PBE to Live accounts (which can be done, considering you give your Live account name anyway on the application) could help address this, as well as more checks and balances to filter out players who don't really contribute. I don't think any of this would be free for Riot, obviously, but I do think we're at this point where even the smallest amount of work done to improve the PBE could have massively higher returns than that same amount of work on Live, which is why I would also be okay with diverting at least a small amount of resources towards that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-10-28T22:25:30.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But i did explain in my first comments and even later. Why were Rioters sometimes being personally attacked and asked to defend their positions at Riot, instead of actually being criticised by the (sometimes) \"questionable\" work on the League's changes that didn't quite hit the mark?\n\nIf players were being shielded against other players from personally attacking each other in the same manner, why were Rioters exempt from this shielding? If we're extending this privilege to one part of the community, Rioters are the reason why this community even exists in the first place. So how could they and why were they outside of this circle? It certainly wasn't by choice.\n\nWhat the Wardens did now is a step in the right direction. Any form of harassment should not be tolerated here, towards anyone. Period. Quite a bit later than this needed to be done but i don't blame them at all. Previous Boards mods were quite lax and when the new mods came (about a year or so ago), things started to change for the better. At least in my opinion.\n\n>If your argument is that it's mainly for bug testing and minor balancing, that already contradicts the official stated goal of the PBE, where it invites players to give feedback of all kinds.\n\nIt doesn't and it isn't my opinion.\nA year or so ago, this was a Rioter's response to someone's question about PBE (maybe it was on Ask Riot. I don't know exactly so don't hold me to my word). This is also Blizzard's stance on their own Overwatch PTR. There's is value in PBE environments for this reason alone, the priority was never was on balancing the content that comes out. But the balancing is still being done regardless. There are lots of other ways you can send your feedback to Riot on PBE forums and that's what the PBE is for as well.\n\nBut make no mistake.\nThe PBE is never going to be restructured in such a way that it becomes as relevant or equally relevant to Live servers. Simply because PBE is not tied to your Live account in any way. That means you have to spend more time testing content for Riot while that time isn't being invested in your actual account, where it matters. This is why a lot of people won't play on PBE, only a select few people would.\n\nFor Riot's purposes, PBE right now is in an OK spot.\nIt does not need any major infrastructure changes. I never said Riot is never going to update the PBE to help the players out if this is a reasonable thing to do (rune bundles), which does not fall under any major restructuring.\n\nWhat did require reworking was the entire Store when players wanted all content there to be offered for free (for the purposes of easier testing). The way it worked was that every piece of content there HAD to have a price tag. So Riot did the next thing they could - they made every piece of content instead cost 1 RP. This solution was relatively easy to do and it did not require to code the entire store again.\n\nBut this also backfired because then people simply went on spending binges to buy all the content they never had on Live and the Store was often being overwhelmed and taken down for maintenance because of the massive backlog of purchases. So Riot reduced our daily allowance to 8000 RP and only made the current patch content available for 1 RP and everything later costed the same as it did on Live.\n\nThis would still allow players to test new content without problems and to buy something they wanted but would not allow buying out the entire store in one go.\n\n>But they've failed at that, is my point, as a huge number of PBE players are toxic.\n\nLet me be absolutely clear about this.\n#No player is ever inherently toxic by nature.\n\nEVERYONE can become toxic, given the right circumstances and frustration crossing their tolerance thresholds, without taking precautions to not lose your cool. Even i, you or even a Rioter aren't exempt from this. We are all people, we all get frustrated at some point. That's a fact. Here's an example: Riot Sanjuro VS Tyler1.\n\nIt's not Riot's systems that are shit at catching the negative behavior, it's the very nature of people that everyone can become toxic at any point that's the issue here. That's why there's always this impression that no matter how much Riot cleans house of the trolls and toxic people, there's a neverending torrent of them always ready to plague more games.\n\nThis is the exact reason why.\nRiot does not have the ability to predict toxic behavior and i, for one, would not like this system to even exist in the first place. People should never be punished for something they think about but never actually do. They should only be punished if this line is crossed and someone gets hurt in the process.\n\nThis unfortunately means you can only punish a troll if he is caught trolling a game. You should never punish a player if he ever thought about trolling a game but never actually did it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-10-28T21:53:50.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Yet you have written several pages' worth now of self-aggrandisement instead, which really puts into question how different you really are from any other toxic user who comes here to vent.
