Good luck with current ward trinket. You cant buy stealth wards. And the trinket dont even last long enough nor regenerate fast enough to have 1 ward up full time.

I'm newer to the game, so sorry if I'm mistaken, but didn't pink wards basically work the same as control wards in that you needed an item slot for them? Or could you put them in the trinket slot if you were full build?\n\nAlso, why don't you just have your support and maybe jungled buy a sweeper? If it's because they won't listen to you, then that's another problem entirely. \n\nMaybe they removed pink wards because you could basically have both wards and a sweeper without having to forfeit anything. Maybe they tried to make the game more team-oriented by making it so that, come late game, you're forced to share vision duties. I'm not saying it justifies what they did as I don't know enough about the game to say whether this change is good or bad.\n\nBesides, it's still an even playing field; the enemy team has to deal with this as well. You're not at a disadvantage or anything.\n\nOn a final note, may I ask what specific situation(s) drove you to make this post?","replies":[{"poster":"zepdrix","date":"2017-08-13T19:00:13.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kairoptra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2pURU60J,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-08-13T17:47:17.349+0000)\n>\n\n> I&#x27;m a little lost here.
