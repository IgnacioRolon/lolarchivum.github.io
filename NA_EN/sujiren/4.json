You can&#039;t go wrong picking this form when it has cc, healing, and destroys tanks / squishies alike and scaling really well into the lategame.\nShadow assasin form though is lacking, and it&#039;s not the damage. By picking shadow assasin your basically taking massive risk for no reason. Unlike Rhaast it won&#039;t do much damage to tanks and fighters and just rely on bursting those squishy targets which as game will go on will prove increasingly more difficult, and unlike Rhaast he offers no utility.\n\nTaking risks is part of the assasin playstyle, I don&#039;t want to remove that aspect, but I would like it to be more rewarding when Kayn player is actually sucessful. Just a simple change&mdash; if shadow assasin Kayn scores a kill, shadow step&#039;s cooldown is completely refreshed.  This would fit incredibly well with his mobile assasin theme, allowing him to score kills and get out, or get kills and keep chasing his targets during those  jungle skirmishes potentially allowing Kayn to snowball harder for choosing riskier form.

Kayn has to go through a crappy early game already, and his assasin form is vastly outclassed by his darkin form.
