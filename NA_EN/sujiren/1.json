As a big pre- and post-rework Urgot player, I do think he needs more reliability (or _something_) in his kit. One of the frustrating things that I've found (and perhaps this is just me, in which case I'd love to hear what anyone has to say!) is that it's hard to find a place in mid-to-late-game (in particular when I've been snowballing well but my team hasn't), because he's too slow to be an effective split-pusher (in theory you might be able to duel someone who tries to stop you, but if more than one comes, you're screwed) and team fights are super awkward if you can't single anyone out to use your spell rotation on, and once you're done with your spell rotation you either clumsily keep auto-attacking until your CDs are up again, or you clumsily try to waddle out until your CDs are up. I've done picks, I suppose, with Urgot. Anyway, I guess I wish there was _something_ to do in Urgot's down time (when W is on CD) or feel like I could contribute more meaningfully to a team fight, and I definitely don't think (nor want) the answer to be more damage/higher ratios.\n\nI don't know how much this is useful, but it's what came to mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2017-08-14T13:50:43.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are you building him?

It's honestly more of a defensive tool especially in a ton of all-in matchups\n2. You have Black Cleaver to speed you up during it\n3. Typically also get Frozen Mallet. The only time you don't is when you don't have to cuz people are gonna have to stand in your W for team comp reasons.\n4.

You also gain some aditional utility \n\nand there is another thing to consider, the slow itself is more valuable in the earlygame when your enemies are slower as it will allow you to fully utilize all your passive shots if you play it right.\n\nAnd the final benefit which comes from maxing Q first is that since your W gets stronger with levels due to base ad ratio you don't actually put all your eggs in one basket damage wise. \n\nThere are a lot of things to consider for which of the 2 to max first however whatever works best for you is probably what you should stick too until you are comfortable to change things up.\n\nSion, my main, scales similarly ability wise and while Q max seems like a good idea E max is generally better. for many of the same reasons and some different ones ofc. \n\n\nI will say this, ive tested both in practice tool extensively as well as played him (with extreme success) on normal games and in my experience maxing Q first yields the greatest benefits damage wise, mana consumption wise and utility wise. \n\nOh and one last tip, you might like to know\n\nwarlords bloodlust is his best keystone, not neccesarily for the sustain, but mostly for the speedboosts which you can extremely rapidly charge up with purge, allowing for you to Q at the start of a fight and get the speedboost to bypass your opponent if they get to close, thats when you purge, this way you can get an extra speedboost during purge to walk a circle around your opponent and use your E to get the final shotgunleg shots, if you maxed Q here it should be back up again for another nuke/slow  or as zoning to force people to take a longer walk to safety while you keep shooting them\n\nThis is how i got my first bloods ^^","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-08-14T22:05:11.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible he is simply viable in both playstyles right now.

Maybe having a different keystone as you said (Warlords) plays into that.\n\nI run Fervor and most likely *because* I am maxing W. Because every shot of his W will proc a stack of fervor and therefore increase his W damage over time and with the much higher ratio from maxing it it ends up doing a ton early on and I end up being able to duel people like Riven (also due to the increased shield). I currently have a 67% winrate with Urgot in ranked at Plat 1 and I mainly play him as a counterpick to Rivens (I think like 40%ish of my games are vs Riven) but I've definitely won lane almost every game and I max W every time.\n\nI've yet to have a lane matchup that just feels like I have a lower chance of winning or winning at all when I max W.

But as a tank you WANT the enemy to be focusing you.\n\nIt's ***ONLY 500 TRUE DAMAGE EXECUTE?*** Do you have a slightest idea how many times an adc would have to attack a 500HP tank in order to kill him? Even {{champion:122}} with full Fervor stacks and Black Cleaver doesn't deal 500 True damage at level 1 ulti.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2017-08-14T22:19:10.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said without tank items.\n\nAgainst a tank it's around 750-1k damage.\n\nWhich is a fair bit of damage but DEFINATLY isn't overwhelming.\n\nAlso at level 6... an adc or tank would only have like 900-1400 health or so\n\nWhich means a DODGEABLE ULT that has a trigger condition would only 200-350 damage.\n\nSo great job proving my point. Darius ult deals more damage than urgots ult and is easier to trigger.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2017-08-13T22:12:42.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Janna's W also feels unimpactful, let's buff her as well","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2017-08-14T13:46:59.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
