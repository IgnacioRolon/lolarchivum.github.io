Thats basically it, everything else is either some sort of spirits or girls. I gues there is also Vlad and Swain but they are terribly outdated and barely even considered  midlaners. Ad midlaners have so many badass human male characters, Yasuo, Zed, Talon, Kayn, Gangplank both lore wise and gameplay wise.\r\nIm a diehard human champion player and it upsets me that out of 130+ champion roster there is not a single mage that I could connect to and want to master/ main.","replies":[{"poster":"Candurill","date":"2017-07-24T13:34:04.179+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:112}} Viktor is male and human :)\n{{champion:4}} Twisted fate is male and human :P\n{{champion:90}} Malzahar is male AND human.

AD regularly uses their weapons so you can base the character's theme around it (i.e. shuriken > ninja). Mages just use magic which in the end is just color orbs and particle effects, so it is very hard to make a unique human theme for multiple ones. Hence why there is a tendency to make them spirits, only partially humanoid, etc to make the character more interesting and actually explain why they are a mage.
