Unfortunately we cannot see the full chat. Our Ashe insulted the enemy team. She said \"I hope your families die!\", she repeated it and she told us a few times that she will run it down because she wants us to get defeated. In Post-Game she also said she is happy now because she ruined a match for us \"bastards\" and she will do it again and again. I got banned for asking if she will get banned for that? This is definitely not fair.\n\nEdit: I didn't get banned once all the years I've been playing League. I own the King-Rammus skin which was a reward for Beta-testers I guess. The oldest eMail from Riot has been the information-eMail about the upcoming season 2 and the timestamp says: Thu 12/8/2011 11:39 PM\n\nUnfortunately I don't know when exactly my account has been created but I can proof it is atleast 8 years old. Not a single ban in 8 years of playing a game filled with toxic people and trolls. I cannot accept this punishment!","replies":[{"poster":"Fönikku","date":"2019-08-18T10:28:32.716+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Chancenverspielt: is \"i hope your family dies\" as hard as \"kys\"?\nChancenverspielt: i guess \"kys\" is a bit harder..\n\n\nYou do realize what you said is insta-filter detection for a ban? Even if it wasn't your intention to say it, repeating those words (with zero tolerance \"k.y.s\" especially) will trigger a suspention on ur account if not a perma. Also calling for reports is frowned upon, I advise you avoid it as much as u can.","replies":[{"poster":"Chancenverspielt","date":"2019-08-18T10:30:18.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't know that and I didn't ever say something like that to anyone.

Apart for that, I see only minor infractions, like arguing with the Ashe, telling the Kayn that he's toxic, telling them they'll be permabanned, and calling for reports. A first punishment for that kind of behavior would more likely be a chat restriction. If it is your first punishment, I'd suggest sending a ticket to player support, explaining that you were quoting and referring to someone else's words without directing them at anyone.\n\nIf you've had a 10-game and then a 25-game chat restriction before this, then the escalated punishment is correct and simply intended to send a clear message that you need to stop breaking the rules. If you've been punished before, I'd recommend not sending a ticket to player support lest they manually review your case and decide to increase the punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chancenverspielt","date":"2019-08-18T11:27:09.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does RIot work today?
