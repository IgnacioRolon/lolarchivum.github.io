I really want to try the PBE but it just doesnt want to work for me, I have enabled the PBE launcher on my firewall and i have no security blocking the download so i'm really confused at this point. Please help me :/","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T22:40:25.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the PBE servers reside in a different geolocation than the EUW servers you also access, this is likely caused by your route to the PBE servers.
