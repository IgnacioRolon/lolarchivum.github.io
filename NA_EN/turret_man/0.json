We were about to end and *POP* the server froze.\r\n\r\nWe've been stuck unable to reconnect for about 1 hour and 10 minutes. We've tried everything from driver updates, router resets, different IPs on the same accounts, different accounts on the same IPs. Nothing has worked.\r\n\r\nI did some digging and tried to ping to server and the location couldn't be found. This is absolutely obscure; any help on the matter would be helpful. There are currently 10 of us currently stuck unable to play more League.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-21T02:51:03.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's rather worrisome. I'm not currently seeing anything on the EUW status page mentioning server issues, but it does look like the ranked queues are scheduled to go down shortly (3:30 UTC). I wanna try running a quick traceroute to the EUW servers at 185.40.65.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) if you can. Hit me up with those results so I can take a look with my tech peeps to try and get this sorted out as quick as possible!","replies":[]},{"poster":"StarkAttack15251","date":"2017-11-21T02:37:23.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue, 5 man premade on a normal draft summoners rift  and the game crashes for all involved on my team simultaneously.\nBeen over 3 hours now since we were in the game, and we have logged in, logged out, and closed the client completely multiple times, but nothing has managed to reset the ghost game.\nAny advice as to how we can fix this issue?\nWe cannot find a way to get out of the game to start new games.","replies":[{"poster":"I AM WRATHH","date":"2017-11-21T02:45:37.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bug or patch timeout soo jst report it so they can fix it ASAP no other solutions maybe with the new patch might be fixed","replies":[]}]}]}
