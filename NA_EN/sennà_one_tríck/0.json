MMR aside I think the problem is your friends mentality-if he's quick to blame you for losses then chances are he does that to other people as well. If it was just one time and he apologized for it then that'd be one thing, but if he's been doing this allot recently then there's a problem with him.\n\nIn other words this is a bad mentality by him and he needs to grow up and start looking at himself rather than being so quick to blame others for his losses.","replies":[{"poster":"Sennà One Tríck","date":"2019-12-25T16:28:10.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.

Eventually it got to the point where I basically told him \"Look, I've been keeping you on my friends list in light of our past friendship, but I warn you if you keep acting this then I will be forced to end our friendship.\" That along with him getting a temp ban from the game was a wake-up call for him as he later apologized to me for his behavior and even thanked me for reporting him when I confirmed I did after he asked me about it and I've had no issues with him since then.\n\nSometimes all it takes is a warning from a friend (and possibly a temp ban) to be the wake-up call one needs. If you warn him and he still refuses to change his attitude then perhaps it's best to sever ties with him altogether, as if you ask me it's not worth the hassle of playing with someone like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sennà One Tríck","date":"2019-12-26T10:06:14.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm afraid that won't help sadly. A good few months ago, he was getting very tilted in game, flaming his support and me (the jungler) in chat. I don't think he actually realised how toxic he was being. I warned him multiple times that he needed to calm down or I and others would report him, but it never did anything. \n\nSure enough, soon after he decided to leave and play on his own (I assume he was tilted with me for having a poor game) and what do you know? Because he played consecutive games on tilt, he ended up tilting harder and flaming more in his next game and received a toxicity ban. Perma ban - he'd already been chat restricted twice, banned once, and this wasn't even his first account - his first account had received 7 or 8 temp bans  before it finally got perma'd. \n\nWhen he saw that one of the games he'd been banned for was the one in which I said I would report him, he fumed at me. Said it was my fault, yada yada, then stopped talking to me for two days. I think he blocked me on Instagram for the 2 days as well LOL, he was furious, even though he likely would've been banned anyway since our support that game was also fed up with being flamed and threatened reports as well.\n\nActually, he just recently got a 2 week ban for flaming again and I've had to lend him one of my accounts that he can use for the duration. He doesn't learn.\n\nI used to be pretty damn toxic myself actually, but I came to the conclusion that it's entirely pointless to flame people. Nowadays I rarely use chat unless it's for shotcalls and things like \"bot no flash\" \"kayn top care\" etc. I mute flamers, something I never used to do (I used to argue back with them all the time lol)\n\nHim on the other hand? He likes to blame other people when he dies. He plays yi jungle quite a bit, but I dont think he quite understands what priority is. Whenever I play jungle with him I always think out loud, giving him my thought process partly because it helps me decide what to do next and partly so he can tell what I'm doing and apply it to his own jungle gameplay. For instance, I'd say \"I'm thinking about ganking bot, but Jax might be bot for a countergank, so it's too risky\" or \"I think Udyr might gank mid, he just finished his raptors and you're pushed. I'm going to hover mid for a countergank.\" \"I'm going to contest this scuttle-crab. My bot and midlane both have priority so it should be free.\" \"I just saw Kha topside, I'm gonna solo this dragon.\"\n\nDespite that, he never really learned from listening to my thought process when playing jungle (I used to be a Warwick one-trick in jungle and he taught me a good thing or two about the role, I'd say I jungle at a high gold/low plat level) and every single time something goes wrong, teammates are to blame. He tries to 1v1 an enemy jungler like Jax that out-duels him and his midlane doesn't have priority, resulting in his death. \"Wtf mid why don't you move.\"\n\nThen when he ganks a losing lane and dies, he starts flaming the losing laner, who's likely tilted enough already from losing lane, saying stuff like \"ok I wont  come again, didnt know you fed him 3 kills\", \"wtf did you do to him?\" or even just \"stop feeding\"\n\ni mean, as a laner I'd be damn tilted if I was already losing my lane (especially top), my jungler comes for a gank while being level 6 to level 9, feeds my laner yet another kill then says he's not gonna come back. \n\nI mean, he's a decent guy when not getting tilted at league and pretty funny to play with when he's chill and not tilted, but when he is it becomes a problem. I might try and work with him to reduce the toxicity because I'm fully certain it's costing him some games. If you're losing a game, typing to your team and tilting them just solidifies the loss.. and if they encounter you in the next lobby they might decide to int you or afk as revenge.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"drymonkey","date":"2020-01-13T20:23:28.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i get this XD evrytime i have to go jungle when im playing with my friend group i will get fed …..
