Ashe came back from from the workshop ready to give noobs pentakills and  kill streaks. Even if you use heavy attack damage champions like yasuo or zed she doesn&#039;t even lose health.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-05-23T18:36:01.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So first, people wanted Ashe to be buffed/rework.\n\nNow they wanted her nerfed back.\n\nhttps://imgflip.com/s/meme/Captain-Picard-Facepalm.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-05-23T18:33:59.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think he means in the sense that if she has a bloodthirster, plus the the crazy AA speed steroid, along with the flurry active....the amount of health she lifesteals is unreal. with a full build she can lifesteal like 1,000hp in a matter of like 4 AA's or so. i see his point. it IS kind of insane when you think about it. b\\c her flurry counts as individual AA's, i believe, which means lifesteal applies to every one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zahz","date":"2015-05-18T19:48:13.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol ashe didnt receive anything that stopped her from losing health","replies":[]}]}
