Now, this isn't the fault of the boards. This is the fault of Firefox, and it's a feature designed by someone who has no comprehension of what a keyboard does. They should be castrated, but that's not what's giving me an aneurism at the moment. What's giving me an aneurism is that when I hit the forwards button, my entire, nine paragraph, carefully balanced post was gone.\r\n\r\nCompletely. Backing and reloading the page lost EVERYTHING I wrote. What even the hell guys? Reloading a page shouldn't throw everything a user's wrote out. The old forums didn't do that. Hell, my computer could CRASH and when my computer booted back up the forums would have my post saved and ready to use.\r\n\r\nWhat even the hell guys? Can we get some sort of autosaving drafts rolling or something?
