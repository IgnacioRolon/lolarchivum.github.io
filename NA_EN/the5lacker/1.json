What kind of lunatic threw this idea together? Who is obsessed with making it a Bloodthirster replacement? Where does the mana sustain or CDR for this item even come from?\n\nSo yeah. ER has kinda...flopped. The high cost, the uncooperative built path, the outrageously high combine cost, the fact that it's just a BT with a few tweaks, nobody cared about it. It doesn't fill the niche it was designed to fill. It has failed as an item.\n\nSo what do we do with a failed item? We fix it. We fix it until it works. And we start by taking apart the problem and addressing it. Essence Reaver builds out of BT. That's bad. Replace it with a Pickaxe. Drop the AD to 60. Drop the cost. More easily available. Good to go. Essence Reaver gains CDR and mana sustain out of the ether. That's bad. Add in a Forbidden Idol. Grant 10 Mp5. Stats don't come out of nowhere. More easy to assemble. Good to go.\n\n~~Essence Reaver~~\n~~- Pickaxe (875g) + Vampiric Scepter (800g) + Forbidden Idol (700g) + 475g = 2850g~~\n~~+ 60 Attack Damage~~\n~~+ 10 Mana Regeneration~~\n~~+ 10% Lifesteal~~\n~~+ 10% Cooldown Reduction~~\n~~- Unique Passive - Restores mana on-hit equal to half of the health restored from Lifesteal.~~\n\nEDIT: Been thinking, would be better to further its distance from the niche BT feels so it can be made more slot efficient, so re-reworking it.\n\n**Essence Reaver**\n- Vampiric Scepter (800g) + Forbidden Idol (700g) + Dagger (450g) + Dagger (450g) + 600g = 3000g\n+ 40 Attack Damage\n+ 40% Attack Speed\n+ 10 Mana Regeneration\n+ 10% Lifesteal\n+ 10% Cooldown Reduction\n- **Unique Passive** - Restores mana on-hit equal to 5% of the physical damage dealt.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2014-10-02T17:05:16.337+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about positioning it as a pick for the caster/carry instead of as a straight substitute for ANY carry? Give it an easier build path out of two strong mid-game items, and make it a late game powerhouse for carries who rely heavily on spells. Something like this:\n\n\n**Aether Blade**\n*Sapphire Crystal + Longsword + X Gold*\n\n+200 mana\n+15 AD\n10% CDR\n*Unique Passive: *Physical damage returns 2%-6% of physical damage as mana (half on AoE abilities).\n\n\n\n**Essence Reaver**\n*Aether Blade + Brutalizer + X Gold*\n\n+250 mana\n+60 AD\n+20% CDR\n+25 Armor Penetration\n\n**Unique Passive:** Physical damage returns 2%-10% of damage as mana (half on AoE abilities).\n\n\nWhat this gives us is a decent early game item for mana sustain, and a nice build-path for the caster carry (Aether Blade into Brutalizer is actually some really solid early game power, although you lose out on HP sustain). It works with assassins who need mana as well because the mana regen is based on physical damage dealt instead of just on auto-attacks, meaning that Talon and Pantheon and Kha'Zix might also be interested in it.\n\nLate game it gives a pretty solid chunk of AD, along with some wonderful damage boosters for the most caster-focused ADCs: the 20% CDR and high armor penetration are really appealing, especially since Lucidity Boots and offense masteries will allow you to net 40% with just this item, and a number of assassins and caster marksman would really value that.\n\nWhether or not they'd value it ENOUGH to give up the lifesteal and the 20 damage that another item could get them is a different story. That said, I think if you priced this competitively you'd actually have a really solid item choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-10-02T18:18:07.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea...splitting it in a Tier 1 and an upgrade would make a lot more sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lv99 Red Chocobo","date":"2014-10-09T19:47:15.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it still needs the life steal to help it along though. as good as it can be, extra lifesteal helps it be an early item to build.

They also can go very aggressive if they are even close to executing you, and their instant reaction times make defensive spellcasting and sustain very important. They are also super easy to trick and gank, but that's another story.\n\nIn your first example the player has 20 AD less, which can translate to 30 less damage for AD casters like Graves and Varus (the ones who want ER). That's really big when shoving a lane, stealing objectives, or trying to get that last bit of damage to secure a kill.\n\nYour example of Pantheon really doesn't work. You need to sit around for 5 minutes without going too low on HP, you must save all that mana only for spear shots (no low-damage jumps), you need to be incredibly conservative with casting to last 5 minutes, a large amount of spear damage is lost to CS'ing, *and* you're still losing trades so you're less likely to be able to hang around for 5 minutes.

When you are trying to shove a wave to the tower, you don't want to wait 9 seconds to get your second buckshot. You want to kill all the creeps, then pressure an objective. And since that's such an important part of the game, you can see why picking up FI is so bad for it.\n\nThe only thing FI has going for it is long-term waveclear, which provides very little benefit at levels 4-6 (when you get it).\n\nA brutalizer also provides better HP sustain if you have a Dblade, the ability to win trades in any scenario (1v1 or otherwise), better kill potential when roaming, and stronger harassment from individual spells. And remember that having high mana for repeated harass isn't useful if your HP is too low to in range anyways, which is what's likely to happen if you stick around losing trades for *5 whole minutes*. That spear shot is basically begging someone to use their gap-closer on you.\n\nThe middle-ground ER substitute that Djinn and many other have proposed is actually reasonable.

Players will build ER the way they build IE, BT, and PD -- namely, they will buy the most important item components first if they possibly can.

A damage spike is where a given instance of damage increases. In LoL, that is caused by ability ratios (AD, AP, mana, usually) or increased base damage when using an ability. For example, Varus's Q deals 15 / 70 / 125 / 180 / 235 (+ 160% AD), where the numbers with slashes are the base damage and the 160% AD is the AD ratio. So increasing the rank of the spell or increasing the AD ratio gives him a \"damage spike\".\n\nVarus's Q also costs mana and has a cooldown.

The current Essence Reaver falls flat because it doesn't provide its bonus in time, but the Essence Reaver you're suggesting is slot inefficient compared to any {{item:1038}} item, particularly {{item:3072}} (the mana regen won't carry well into the late game for marksmen, and having the mana restoration scale with lifesteal in general and in such a way is redundant). Seeing as they're competing for the same niche (sustain), the Essence Reaver you propose would still be underpicked.\n\nI think the idea here would be to have the item build from a path in a manner similar to {{item:3153}}, with an easy build path leading to an AD-oriented mana sustain item (Idol is a great item, but on most AD champions, even casters that benefit a lot from the CDR, it'd delay their damage output too much to be taken over other items at similar prices), which would then build up to a slot-efficient Essence Reaver that, on top of the mana sustain, would have an effect that would ensure late-game slot efficiency, enough for it to rival the Bloodthirster but with enough of a tradeoff to not be mandatory on every marksman.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2014-10-02T14:46:44.153+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"I've actually been considering shifting it to 40 AD + 40% AS over a flat AD, keep it from occupying the same niche as BT which would allow it to be made more slot efficient.\n\nI'd like to remind you the definition of a TRADE OFF, though.
