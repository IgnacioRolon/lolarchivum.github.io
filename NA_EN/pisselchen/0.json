The Game starte really slow.  At first the little running circle in the right bottom corner does not turn at all.  After about 20 seconds the percentages go up and I am almost always last to load.  It used to be vice versa.\r\n2. Graphic Issues:  The Performance is really bad.  I used to have above 60fps at normal.  Now it often drops below 10.  Playing with more than 3 players on the screen is nearly impossible.  Putting down graphic settings won't work or will result in a frozen client.  After that trying to log on is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease fix the problems.  Currently playing League is not possible with a mac.\r\n\r\nThank You\r\n\r\nClient Version: V 7.10-4442781.4442074\r\nComputer:\r\nMac Book Pro 2013\r\n2,8 GHz Intel Core i/\r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024MB","replies":[{"poster":"PrivaTePr1ck","date":"2017-05-22T04:29:58.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had this same issue since the release of 7.9 and riot doesn't seem to care to fix it :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Foc√πs","date":"2017-05-20T03:33:25.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem.

I used to always be first to load in now before every game after champion select the blue loading circle at the bottom freezes and the displays where champ splash arts typically are, are blank. eventually after significant time it will load. When loading to 100% it loads in sync with some other players. I already submitted a ticket. Very frustration to play when this happens. In game, I also am experiencing significant ping spikes and FPS drops while playing on the lowest quality and playing right next to my high-speed router.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-19T17:52:28.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These issues could be a combination of issues caused by an unstable connection struggling to communicate information between players in-game or even launching your client.
