She is already super strong if she still has a low win rate its because people don&#039;t utilize her mechanics enough, but buffing that already powerful w is unnecessary. I&#039;m just hoping this doesn&#039;t actually get implemented and they work on buffing other champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkaidan","date":"2016-05-22T06:46:00.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with Illaoi is that to be efficient there must be 5 melee champions straight jumping on you, and in this meta there are a lot of mobile/high range champions, which you can't hit with your ult (Lucian, Azir, Kindred, Ezreal...). She also relies 100% on her E, which is a skillshot, has a long animation and has quite a big cooldown untill maxed with 40% cdr (which is still around 8-9 seconds) and missing it could be crucial. Also, there's a known bug that reduces the damage of overlapped tentacles (100-50-25-12.5...) which doesn't rewards her for hitting 3-4-5 targets with her ultimate, and of course, shows only 1/4 of her potential damage, which is already insane since she can out duel pretty much everyone in the game ( I know giving her 100% of tantalces damage would be broken [3k damage with 3 tentacles every 2 seconds without E] but giving her at least a 50% damage for every additional tentacle would be \na good start.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-19T22:27:20.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf lol, illaoi is weak as shit right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-05-19T22:25:56.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf lol.","replies":[]}]}
