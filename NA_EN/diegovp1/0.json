Ive had this one before for a few games and fixed it by going to the folders out of game and changing the resolution in the note pad. I just started having this problem after an update today, so i thought it would be that the resolution had changed. i opened the game file in notepad and checked that the res was the same (i use 900 h 1440 w) but i changed it to a lower one either way. it didnt fix it. I have no clue what to do.\r\nPlease help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T23:43:30.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an ongoing issue that's currently up on our [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.  I don't have a full resolution to offer just yet, but a current workaround may be to press Alt+Enter while in-game.  Let me know if that works for you!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuju Style ON","date":"2017-01-12T20:15:44.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not working for me..
