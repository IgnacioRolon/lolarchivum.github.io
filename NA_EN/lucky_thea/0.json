Everything ran fine, very little lag and normal ping. Recently, I updated to High Sierra, in which it made every game I play lag and all the websites 10x slower. I decided to downgrade back to Sierra, but league is still as laggy and impossible to enjoy, including the client. Everything is incredibly slow. I've changed all the settings and at this point I don't know what to do. Help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-14T23:08:19.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes it sounds like something pretty hefty might be going on with your OS at this point =\\ . I'm not personally the best with Mac's, but I have heard from the techs that El Capitan or Sierra might be the best for League/more stable right now? You may need to reinstall your OS if it's running slow all around, since troubleshooting League won't help much if the entire system is slow =(.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky Thea","date":"2018-01-15T04:43:21.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, thank you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheManana","date":"2018-01-22T00:36:29.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its been 6 months since high Sierra, still this problem persists...you'd think riot would get on their shit by now","replies":[{"poster":"6 Gods Disciple","date":"2018-01-26T18:14:12.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOMMIE IM ON A MISSION!
