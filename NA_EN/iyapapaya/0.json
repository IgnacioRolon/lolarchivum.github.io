There's a number of things that can cause this (hardware issues such as faulty RAM, driver corruptions, corrupted game files, etc.), but recently we've been seeing this more often that not from players using AVG Antivirus.\n\nI'd try temporarily uninstalling AVG as a troubleshooting step to see if it stops.  I'd also double check that your [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104) are set up correctly.
