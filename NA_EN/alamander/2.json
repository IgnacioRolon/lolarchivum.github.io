I play a lot of karma in R5's because she is very efficient and Lulu is often priority picked or banned. In that sense she is okay as both a secondary and a flex pick. \n\nI mean more of \"I pick Karma because....\"\n\nThat's a sentence i struggle to finish. Her in game identity is not defined --> Other champions who are not 'battlemages' do the 'battlemage' role better (See Lulu, Orianna, even Kayle or Swain). \n\nShe isn't a poke mage, cannot hard initiate, has secondary follow up cc, along with peel that is equal or lesser than her utility mid counterparts. \n\nI just cannot see a realistic reason for keeping the passive where it is and not attaching it to her R. We're not talking about any groundbreaking passive here, just something to help establish why someone would pick karma over the 100+ other champions in league. Almost every other champion has this, Karma should be no different.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-10-18T21:03:22.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Indecently, Karma *had* an identity.\n\nBut Riot did away with that when they replaced her with Skarma.","replies":[{"poster":"Alamander","date":"2015-10-18T21:05:03.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ariel the Cruel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YpQQ1MYA,comment-id=00010001000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-18T21:03:22.575+0000)\n>\n> Indecently, Karma *had* an identity.\n> \n> But Riot did away with that when they replaced her with Skarma.\n\nI think they are only a tweek or two off of having a champion that is both unique and healthy :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-10-18T21:15:14.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am open to any passive changes that may make her worthy of picking over other champions :)\n\nMana regen addition might not do it alone.

The thing that's always frustrated me the most about her is her ultimate, Mantra. It's not that it's a bad idea, but since early game, it's so hard to get, you have to save it. You have to save it, even though your passive is supposed to help you get it more. But damn, it's hard to land those AAs to actually restore it, even when you stun your opponents. More than likely, they are either: Mobile enough to escape, have flash, or can counter-all-in you. And honestly, if she was not so dependent on her ultimate, I wouldn't complain. But considering the fact that she is literally one of the only champions in the game who cannot hardly do anything without her ultimate, it makes her pretty damn boring whilst waiting for it to come back up, thus making you feel obligated to save it for whenever you might specifically need it, thus making you literally play a minima of waiting... waiting for the ideal opportunity to go in... waiting, and waiting, and waiting...","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-10-18T21:05:32.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least she keeps busy while she waits!\n\nQ-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q. . . . . . . . . . .","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2015-10-18T21:48:19.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point exactly!

I think the whole 2k shield thing might need to stay dead. Plus the mantra Q at low health would probably one shot things a bit too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bianca Colt","date":"2015-10-19T03:02:00.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking of this idea ( with Passive and Ultimate skills being merged ):\n\n**Passive] Conversion\n**Every time Karma takes damage, 10% of that damage is converted into AP.

It's great for peeling and kiting. Her damage is actually pretty high throughout the entire game as well. \n\nI think that her 3 mantra'd skills are in a pretty healthy spot atm, which is why i went the route of Passive vs Mantra.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ramza Paradise","date":"2015-10-19T02:50:27.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"how about this:\n\nthe lower health karma has, the more damage she does, maybe even more AP\n\nwould fit pretty well with her theme, yeah???","replies":[]}]}
