The choice would be whatever champion had the most votes. Every time a champion receives a Victorious skin, they are removed from the list so they do not get duplicates. \r\n\r\nA lot of people say something like: &quot;Oh, get ready for Victorious Teemo/Urgot/Yorick&quot;, but I feel like the people that  legitimately want a Victorious skin outnumbers those who are trolling. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s true, you can&#039;t please everyone, and no matter who gets it, someone will be upset. However, going based off of a champion that had an impact in one split is ridiculous, and I see that countless people agree with this. I understand it takes time to make a skin, and they would like it out by the end of the season, but there could always be a change, and since we&#039;ll be getting the skin in the end regardless, I feel a longer wait would be completely okay. Additionally, you&#039;d have the numbers of the people who chose certain champions, and you&#039;d be able to see that you&#039;re upsetting a hell of a lot less people than choosing a champion that has been reduced to rubble over the conclusion of the season.","replies":[{"poster":"Cup of Cocoa","date":"2017-10-08T03:24:18.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd have to disagree, because people would just choose their favorite champion instead of a champion that is actually relevant. Riot should be choosing champions that actually have an impact year round instead of just the spring split, because even though Graves was powerful at that time, beyond that point you rarely if ever see a Graves. I understand they probably do it that way since by choosing a champion during Spring, they can have it ready for Fall, but I honestly would rather get the Victorious skin late as long as it's an actual relevant champion than get a champion that isn't as relevant on time.\n\nGranted, I can live with a Victorious Graves, but I feel like a different champion would have been better.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-10-08T03:38:07.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But considering it takes a few months to make a skin normally its hard for the design team to have the skin out by the end of the season if they take the summer split into the choosing process.

There's a thing called \"Patience\". Riot isn't understanding that. \n\nThink of it like this: the first time Riot would do that - wait until the end of a season to pick and start working - it would obviously take longer. It wouldn't be by the end of the year, so it would be around a year and a half before we get the skin. But AFTER that, it'll be the same thing. Waiting until the end of the year and having it done by the middle of next year. What will be the time difference? Only a year. What's the time difference now? Only a year.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-08T03:28:51.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right so basically the top votes would sit somewhere in \n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} (in no order)","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-10-08T03:36:06.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No its be ahri for sure then yas and riven.
