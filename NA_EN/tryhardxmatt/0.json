I believe Longzhu Gaming is going to win Worlds 2017. I believe that SKT has been in a declining state and &quot;unless&quot; they win by overwhelming margins in the games leading up to the finals. So unless SKT step it up Longzhu will crush the finals because they crushed their brackets and the LCK summer split. Now I am a big fan of the LCK, but I am bot saying that every other team is out of the tournament. RNG could possibly beat SKT in the semi finals or any other team could get lucky. That is my personal opinion of what will happen in the tournament please tell me who you think will win Worlds 2017","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-10-16T22:15:52.323+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to see another SKT championship, been a fan since I first watched Worlds in Season 3.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't be surprised or too disappointed if LZ stays on top and takes it all.\n\nIf I'm rooting for any upset, it'd be the China special, RNG and WE beating the Koreans in Semis and going to Finals.","replies":[{"poster":"TryHardxMatt","date":"2017-10-16T22:20:27.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I just don't know if SKT can win another finals against Longzhu.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zed genius","date":"2017-10-16T22:02:42.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"but longzhu won't make it to finals, don't forget they will be facing C9 in the semis","replies":[{"poster":"TryHardxMatt","date":"2017-10-16T22:08:16.013+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2017-10-16T23:46:30.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surprised FNC and C9 are getting more votes than RNG.
