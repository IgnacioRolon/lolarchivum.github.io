As a low-level player I am still learning my few champions and how to preform in different roles. However throughout the entire game, two players constantly yelled at the rest of the team, attempting to make every call their own. Eventually, this yelling developed an abusive undertone.\r\n\r\nThe players would say things such as, \"only two of us are doing anything,\" or, \"everyone  on this team is worthless.\"\r\n\r\nEven when they were saying this, our team as a whole was doing admirably. We took objectives, warded, cs'ed, and fought together. The two players were extremely intense, all for the purpose of winning.\r\n\r\nSo I ask myself, and anyone who has read this far: which do you think is more important in League of Legends; winning or having fun?\r\n\r\nThat being said, if you prefer to win, but do not abuse your teammates I would like to congratulate you. I do not mean to offend that type of person when bringing up this story.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-04-25T07:33:16.899+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is definitely a difficult thing to balance. You mention being a low-level player, so once you hit Level 30, a lot of those players self-select into Ranked play, which should ease it up a little bit if you stick to Normal Games or Team Builder.\n\nIn general, I think the #1 goal is always have fun, but not at anyone else's expense. Obviously, they have fun by winning at all costs, but by berating their teammates, that's not so great :(","replies":[{"poster":"Limakoko808","date":"2014-04-25T08:04:15.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said Phreak.\n\nNow please do patch previews again, i miss them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Water of Eden","date":"2014-04-25T18:13:45.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with what Phreak said.

But the reasoning is different. I feel I can carry best from mid, so I always try for mid in ranked games. But when I don't get mid, and have an adc who can't carry even after I get them fed (supp is my 2nd best role), it's very frustrating.\n\n**TL;DR** TB should be added to ranked because players should be able to bring their best (do pros play more than one role? no), which they can't always do, esp. if they're last pick.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Manchette","date":"2014-04-25T22:36:04.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I greatly appreciate the time you took to comment about this, and thank you for giving me motivation to keep playing.

Not that it isn't an important or valid question, don't get me wrong. It's still a widely controversial issue, but I think what you're getting at is a little closer to a matter of sportsmanship and ethics (how one should behave).\n\nThe key issue you're bringing up is \"Having Fun vs Winning\" but the actions of the two players you mention run counterproductive to both sides of the argument. Not only did their mindless insults, hostile tone, and flaming make the game less enjoyable for their team, but it did nothing to bring them closer to winning. If anything, flaming your team can cause them to perform worse which actually lowers your chances of winning. If they were playing to win, even as opposed to having fun, they would be giving you pointers or letting you know how you could've done something better or giving you tips so that you'll perform better than you currently are and increase chances are winning. It's a strictly serious and rational approach (playing to win as opposed to focusing on enjoying yourself, which are arguably the same). If you were, let's say, wanting to try ADC Janna (which works omg so fun @.@) and they were trying to force you into a more traditional ADC, that would be a more accurate case of winning versus having fun.\n\nI hate that you had that run in verbal abuse so early into the game, and that it's so pervasive within competitive environments to begin with. :/ But like Phreak said, it dies down a little bit once you hit 30 when a lot of it shifts to Ranked play.

If you aren't playing professionally, semi-professionally, or are being paid to stream and win, then the most important thing, as with any game, is having fun.

I've had matches where, as a team, we lost significantly, but it didn't bother us because we worked well as a team and everyone had fun. \n\nI would recommend trying to get or make some friends within League, that way you could play with them consistently and it would greatly reduce such instances when you're playing with someone you already know.

It's why we play the games right? Unfortunately, LOL is one of those games that can get really intense, and, lets face it- everyone would rather win than lose.  In solo que, you're going to have to learn to ignore the people who rage and get too into winning that they abuse their team.  Just focus on improving yourself in games where people rage/troll. If you pull of a good play or outfarm the enemy, you'll feel good about the game even if it's a loss. \n\nBest advice I can give is-play with friends.  Whether you know them personally or met them playing league, the more people on your team you get along with, the more fun you'll have and the more cooperation and team-plays you'll have.  Thus you increase your fun and chances of winning. Get a few people together and be creative.  Make a dunk squad or some crazy team and just have fun.\n\nWhatever you do though, if you have a team of 2-4 people, don't abuse that 1 or 2 other people that you didn't que up with.  Make the game fun for them too.  \n\nhaving fun -> play more -> play better -> win more","replies":[]},{"poster":"bzhen0915","date":"2014-04-25T12:01:05.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People play ranked because they are solely addicted to going ip the ladder and claiming to be better than someone else.\nTherefore a lot of players rage CONSISTENTLY at every single mistake.\n\nI ur interested at having fun, stick to normals, it is much more relaxing and fun, and less (not none) raging.
