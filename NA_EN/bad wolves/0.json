Like that is ridiculous you lose and cant do anything about it. I get the remake was implemented to help with that.... but what if they leave mid game? or 5min into the game? then you cant remake... or do anything. You simply just lose. I was so fed as cait and still lost. You should not lose lp when it isn't your fault. Come on riot...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T02:26:31.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel you that remake isn't quite perfect yet, but if nothing happened on losing a ranked game then ***way*** more people would be quitting mid game.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2017-10-04T05:42:08.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"understood, but what if the system flagged certain individuals that had/have a history of poor behavior that often results in them leaving. And once said individual is flagged, then if the games that they leave will have LP loss mitigated/anulled as said player has already shown to be disturbing numerous games.\n\nWhile this won't fix every game with leavers, it will at least help to assuage the issues for many without incurring the dangers that would be present should you just pardon every game with a leaver.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-10-04T15:24:31.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaverbuster puts them in low priority queue because that's an actual punishment for leaving games.\n\nWhat you describe does nothing to the player creating the issue and even validates it in a way, \"It's OK for me to play with a bad connection because the system will make up for a dc to the rest of my team\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}
