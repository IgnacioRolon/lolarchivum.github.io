This year they got 18 games per team, and 0 series ezexperience Which is important considering any hopes of moving forward kn an international stage by newer teams (for example teams like H2K, UOL, team 8 and others) who have really only played a couple series matches. It hinders player focus and endurance.\r\n\r\nThen you look at the regions riot is not controlling. LPL has played 36 regular season matches all brst of 2 games. They doubled LCS regular season matches. Korea is sitting on 24-36 game ranges for their season ( minimum of 24 games played via 2-0 series and max 36 with all 2-1 series) SEA is similar with between 18 and 24 games played or so. The up and coming Japanese region iz all series play too if I am not mistaken same with Brazil oceania turkey/russia and such, but they play fewer series head to head. \r\n\r\nSo the problem is really that with no regulatory guidelines as to how seasons are being run across different competitive regions, different teams and different regions are really starting to show clear guidelines as to who is generally showing up. Even strong single game winning teams from NA/EU who make it through group stages rarely make it past quarter finals. there are a pocket full of teams who generally cap out from those regions at semi finals usually (TSM, C9, OLD FNATIC,  because the new one is untested in international play for now, old gambit, as their last 3 splits have left themsub optimal with this last split giving them hope) and obviosuly there are the IEM tournaments where historically gambit fanatic and tsm really have crushed well, and tsm taking over the IEM katawice championship was cool. But with the MSI coming up, as well as all stars which was said at the beginning of the split was not gstting replaced with the MSI but added to, its really going to show a strong difference in the fortiude of league play.\r\n\r\nRealistically every region should have the same number of teams, matches, and tournament structure to standardize competitive play across the board. Whether it default all regions to a 10  team 18 game split or force each team to play BO3  series throughout.  But to make international play fair, regions need to have the same definition of what a split is.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-02T13:15:31.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Captain Obvious, this has been brought up numerous times on the forums (Sorry, but this topic is just overplayed and I have found it doesn't matter what we say).  The problem is the fact that Riot seems to want people to watch all leagues so they schedule them in such a way that limits the number of games they can have.\n\nI don't see the reason why they need to schedule NA LCS and EU LCS on different days. I just don't. I can understand different time periods (time zones being what they are), but no other sport, event, etc (that has different regional play) does this. Limiting each region because of the company behind them.\n\nI do enjoy that each team competes against two teams a week. Keep that, but make it a Bo3. Make LCS (both NA/EU) start Thursday. They can keep the timing format, because region time zones. Each team will play 2 Bo3 series. Now you may say; This will limit practice each team has, this may burn out the players, etc. The teams only need to be present for their two Bo3s. Then they can go on their way, Its still only 2 days a week they have to focus on games. They still know who they face. And even if every Bo3 goes to 3 games, that is 54 games a season (this will not likely happen). *--This concept was brought up on Summoning Insight with Thoorin/Monte.--*","replies":[]}]}
