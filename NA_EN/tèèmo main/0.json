I come back later and it shows an error (in the background i see it is at 99%). I retry and.... no dice. So i look up on the internet various ways around this and try a few things such as deleting the folder with my saved item sets. Still no dice...... I uninstall LoL and obliterate any trace of it on my pc, then re-download and install. Still no dice... I run as administrator.... still no dice. I tell the patcher to repair itself and the game..... Still no dice. So now i humbly submit my logs to you in the distant hope that you can get back to me with a solution. If not.... back to WoW.\nP.S. I followed the forum post you guys stuck to the front of the support page. no dice. turned off firewall, don't have any other anti virus software.\n\nI realized that the error occurs early in the percentage but the bar keeps proceeding towards 99% in the background so if i come back a while later it'll be at 99%. It does not go further than 99% once it gets there. Sat and watched it for 10 minutes to see exactly where it goofs up and i find it's at 34% (at least the time watched it).\n\nEdit: Uninstalled the game. Reinstalled. It hitched at 81 or 82%.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-01T15:33:01.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the details here, it sounds like you're having a poor connection problem, so the patcher isn't able to finish downloading necessary updates.
