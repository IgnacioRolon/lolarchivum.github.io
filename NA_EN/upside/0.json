The key frags and capsules aren't actually the point of the honor system, its just incentive to not be nicer in game. If you promise honor exclusive rewards It'll reduce the overall saltiness of players so the game is more fun and less rage inducing. The actual reward of the honor system is a reformed community, its just fueled with key frags and capsule drops.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Greenfire202","date":"2017-08-15T15:20:32.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then what is the drop rate of key fragments?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Upside","date":"2017-08-12T00:14:58.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good to know, ty for info","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"silver sucks","date":"2017-09-14T09:26:05.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Upside,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=OMkE3Euo,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-08-11T21:07:58.173+0000)\n>\n> I just got my honor lvl 4 but I did not get a single capsule.
