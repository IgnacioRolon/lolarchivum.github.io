Most likely what happened was you use the N word in an acceptable context and your friend you were talking to was fine with it. However the MF was salty that you called them out for acting like a child, so they reported you for harassing them. The IFS reviewed your chat, and noticed the zero-tolerance phrases and thus it decided to slap a ban onto your account for using hate speech.\n\nThey don't usually jump straight to a ban unless the player uses hate speech, such as a derogatory term for people of one race or another. You did this, so I would be willing to bet that this is why you got banned. Even if it wasn't why you got reported in the first place. At the very most you might have received a chat restriction or maybe even no punishment if you hadn't said the N word that game.\n\nMy first piece of advice on this is to just not say stuff that could be interpreted as racist or derogatory if taken out of context, that way if somebody reports you for something else the IFS won't trigger on you and take a shit on your account like it did here.\n\n---\n\nKeep this in mind too; after receiving a 14-day ban you are skating on very thin ice. Even just general negativity like the other stuff you said could put you at risk for receiving the next tier of punishment which happens to be a permanent ban. Be careful amigo, and consider carefully if it is worth losing your account to call people out for being the idiots that they are.\n\n---\n\nIf I may offer some more advice, I know that it sucks to get idiots like that MF in your games. It's a huge pain in the ass, and they absolutely deserve the shit they catch for it. But it's not worth it to do it yourself and put yourself at risk for getting punished. You're better off ignoring them and reporting them for Riot to deal with. Their behavior will catch up to them eventually.\n\nLastly, I know how frustrating it can be to get idiots and vindictive fools on your team. I actually wrote a whole post on how to lead these sorts of people in a game, and how to communicate with them without getting into arguments and without risking being reported.
