Except it's a skillshot that can actually be dodged. \n\nFor such a \"high skillcap\" champion, why is Vayne's kit so failproof? \n\nHer W is a true damage passive that procs on AA.\nHer E is a knockback that at best, stuns you, and at worse, pushes you away from Vayne, which is ideally what she wants anyway 90% of the time. \nHer R is just a steroid that also gives her invisibility/movement speed. \nHer Q is a repositionning tool, which does give her a decent amount of skill expression. \n\nSome may argue that Vayne's \"short range\"  requires the player to have good positionning, but honestly that's true of the majority of adcs. That's one of the defining trait of being a good adc player : having good positionning. \n\nAnyway, this isn't a rant about Vayne but moreso a suggestion meant to give her a bit more counterplay in cases where even when you do bridge the gap between you and Vayne, she can still just reliably push you away and roll to gain more distance.\n\nFinally, just in case people accuse me of never having played Vayne before for suggesting such criminal changes, Vayne stands as my second most played champion at 144k mastery. I'm not suggesting this change because I hate Vayne, but because I want her skillcap ceilling to be higher than what it currently is.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-07-24T21:14:58.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"vaynes e should be like {{champion:432}} q\n\nif it doesnt connect the champion to a wall, it only applies a short duration soft slow. if it does connect to a wall, the knockback and stun are applied.\n\nin return the damage on connecting someone to a wall could be buffed, and champions could be knocked into each other to stun and damage both targets like {{champion:64}} ult.\n\nthis way it would be less of a free disengage button, and put more emphasis on position based skilled use of the ability.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-07-24T21:56:06.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NPEXUfF8,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-07-24T21:14:58.840+0000)\n>\n> vaynes e should be like {{champion:432}} q\n> \n> if it doesnt connect the champion to a wall, it only applies a short duration soft slow. if it does connect to a wall, the knockback and stun are applied.\n> \n> in return the damage on connecting someone to a wall could be buffed, and champions could be knocked into each other to stun and damage both targets like {{champion:64}} ult.\n> \n> this way it would be less of a free disengage button, and put more emphasis on position based skilled use of the ability.\n\nI don't even know why Vayne got such a powerfull Tool, ontop of 550 Range, Invisiblity and a Dash.\nLucian only has a Dash and his Range got severly nerfed, so he needs to get close to do what he does.
