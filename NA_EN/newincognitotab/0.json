Not so long ago i faced somebody in the enemy team who said easy or ez game. Now if it was one time i would had let it go but this person said it 5 min min befor the game even ended and more than 1 time to. And when the game ended she spam it  more. Okay the game was indeed ez for them cause it was  a aram game and the enemy poked us out not mutch we could do that game. like you said if you lost in  a short amount of time its fine ofc they call it ez. But if you spam it its becomes more than just saying ez game. If you keep saying it over and over again it starts to sound more like haha you lost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2019-01-16T03:00:15.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"its like extremely mildly unsportsmanlike.\n\nthe people who are upset by it are the people who need to have it said to them.  toughen up and learn to be a man","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khabith","date":"2019-01-15T16:43:28.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"In my opinion its friendly banter, and its been part of me all of my video game life, it would make me sad to see it go away, but thats just me","replies":[]}]}
