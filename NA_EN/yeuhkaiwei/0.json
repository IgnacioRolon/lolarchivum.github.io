Here are mine =3\r\nIn order to make thing a little less one sided, adding more ban picks could help even it out. Each team at present only gets 3 picks, and in some instances its a situation where if, lets say, neither team bans Sona, in many games I&#039;ve played both teams take Sona. That isn&#039;t because they want to, but in many instances because they feel the other team will pick Sona and want to fight fire with fire. If each team has say, 5 ban picks, it would allow more diversity in who is played, as well as make more OP choices a bit rarer.\r\nI&#039;ve also seen a lot of people suggesting pay to play. I think a one time payment could work, but i disagree with some of the, pay for a day similar to an IP/XP boost. I think many people would be more than happy to hand over some RP or IP to keep U.R.F. I know I would pay a few thousand RP for it. I feel it allows people who can&#039;t manage mana and cool downs to have a bit more fun playing against other people, and it really is just a fun hectic time for everyone who wants it. Even if you can&#039;t keep it in match making at least keep it in Custom, and maybe allow Custom VS Ai in URF for those who don&#039;t have friends. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.\r\nI also made a poll to see if anyone thinks anything I said would work, I know sometimes I tend to get a bit non-nonsensical and wanted to know if I was making sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Kagemyth","date":"2015-04-05T16:09:53.873+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont mean to be a downer but the game mode is just for fun and really would lose its appeal if it was always here. and as a for fun game mode you shouldn't really go in being super competitive (not to say that thats you) just enjoy the chaos.","replies":[{"poster":"YeuhKaiWei","date":"2015-04-05T16:13:00.584+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not competitive, I really enjoy the chaos and would have more fun playing this every day then Normal. \nI can't speak for anyone else, and I know its just for fun, which is why I think it should stay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diananmen Square","date":"2015-04-05T19:15:51.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it wouldn't be that bad if it was a choice to play it that isn't just calling for you like \"Psst, Come play urf, it's here.. written in yellow, come just a match.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-04-05T21:01:58.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem with URF is the tremendous amount of dodging going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Digivolve","date":"2015-04-05T23:13:46.425+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meeks011,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=mEAaP0Ib,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-04-05T21:01:58.488+0000)\n>\n> My problem with URF is the tremendous amount of dodging going on.\n\nyea fuck jax.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Conus25","date":"2015-04-06T02:16:42.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow really, I've only had 1-2 dodges in like 20 urf games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Levyathyn","date":"2015-04-05T19:43:39.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the bans. There's always cases of ten champions that most people who play URF could pick off the top of their head to ban, and free up diversity a bit. I know _exactly_ what you mean, as well, with feeling like you have to pick the same. I often feel that way about Katarina or Zed if the enemy team specifically doesn't ban them. And with the added diversity, you could be sure an enemy team who didn't ban a specific OP champion with that much room to probably had intent to pick that champion--or at least more sure than with 3 and 3 bans would get you.","replies":[{"poster":"YeuhKaiWei","date":"2015-04-05T19:56:35.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!!!!
