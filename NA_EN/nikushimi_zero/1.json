{"poster":"Nikushimi Zero","date":"2015-06-01T07:19:05.222+0000","title":"Ilidon, the First Demon","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":">**Health:** 550-2200 \r\n**Health Regen:** 7-20\r\n**Resource:** Fury\r\n**Armor:** 25-90 \r\n**Magic Resist:** 32.1-53.4\r\n**Attack Damage:** 61-117 \r\n**Attack Speed:** 0.67-0.98\r\n**Melee:** 150 \r\n**Movement Speed:** 345\r\n**Primary Role:** Fighter **Secondary Role:** Tank/Assassin\r\n\r\n>***Once his Ultimate is unlocked and a rank in it is obtained he begins to passive gain fury every 1.5s. Ilidon&#039;s basic attacks generate 2 fury. Even in his ultimate Form and against structures. This is much like how {{champion:102}} &#039;s fury works.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>**Background:**\r\nThey say that we don&#039;t exist. That we are just legends. Fairy tales told to children who misbehave. The stories about us of course are false. Forever cursed to remain in a realm of death and destruction. To fight among ourselves for power. We squabble and fight to see who will be in charge and who stands where. In a land of little resources where everything is precious and nothing is to be wasted shapes us into what we are. The curse of very powerful and very angry beings. They created this place for us. They created this....Hell.\r\n\r\n>These creatures that no thrived within this realm were diverse. Some grotesque and others beautiful, but petty. There were many kinds of us here. Each place has a defined culture and society that thrives for what it is, and they constantly fight for the resources. I grow weary of this place. I grow angry. I grow calm. My emotions a mix and rage within me. They care nothing but to remain here and squabble among themselves, and I say so be it. Let them rot and fester here. My mind wanders to a distant time and place.\r\n\r\n>*Within another place and another time there was a revolt. This caused great casualties on both sides of the conflict, and even after the conflict ended in a peace talk there was still resentment. The peace was brokered between two beings. A human man, and a divine woman. They had fallen in love and pleaded the case before both sides to cease the fighting and that there could be peace. So, one was created.*\r\n\r\n>*Then, the darkness came. A change so sudden it threw the world into Chaos. The side of the divine daughter saw it unfit of the union between her and the man. So, they cursed the man and when he woke from his sleep he had changed. Frightened and beleaguered with fear and uncertainty he fled. The side of the man thought it an abomination for the union and so turned on the daughter of the divine. She fled, but was struck fatally. She fled and found the man. In his changed state. She smiled and assured him that she would never hate him, nor would she never not love him. There he held her as they spent her last moments together. The sadness flowed from him into her and put her into a stasis almost like death. A pendant that bore itself into his chest over his heart an remained there protected by strong magic. Enraged the man descended from his hiding place and wrecked havoc upon his people and that of the divines. He was cursed and they would pay. However, he had yet to learn of his abilities and fell short after a small rampage. The divines created a world all for him, and those they would curse the same way.*\r\n\r\n>This story I remember, as it was mine to be told. I stood and peered from my high seat atop my citadel and sighed. A giant battle going on below. Spreading my wings I took flight and hovered above the battle field. My voice booming across the land, \"You want my throne!? Then take it! I abstain and shall leave you to it! To my most trusted generals I say this. Leave this place and find your own way, or stay if this is your path. The choice, is yours.\" And with that I flew to the highest part of my citadel and inside found the magic circle. It was time.\r\n\r\n>As I landed I felt the presence of others. My generals. They were after me. I taught them of themselves and they swore loyalty to me. They were good in their human selves and requested upon me my blood and so with it they became like me in their own way. Self consciously I touched my beloved crystal heart pendant lodged into my flesh and smiled. They had a name for us. My kind. The mortals called us \"Demons\", and I was the first. With that, we stepped through the portal. The citadel top floor exploded from the mass of magic used to create the portal I had spent thousands of years on. The world I stepped into was not the one we came from. No, this was a new one. A bright beginning for \"Demon\" kind. Within the Fyrone Flats of the world called Runeterra. We would build a life here and from out new found kingdom we would make our way in this world. Hopefully one of peace, but I would not hesitate to use force if the inhabitants proved hostile.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>***The images used go to their respective owners. I found them all via google images. I am only using them as reference for my character.***\r\n\r\n>**Appearance:**\r\nhttps://faterunner.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/2507379722_bd596a6680.jpg?w=336&h=415\r\nhttp://fc08.deviantart.net/fs15/f/2007/044/5/6/Elf_FIGHTER_by_liciniosouza.jpg\r\nhttp://www.wall321.com/thumbnails/detail/20120303/fantasy%20demons%20ergo%20proxy%20artwork%201920x1200%20wallpaper_www.wall321.com_65.jpg\r\nIf the pictures all showed properly then this will be easier to follow as I explain. The top picture shows what he normally looks like with the wings and body type. The second photo shows his hair, and the way his weapon is as his weapon crackles with redish black energy much like that lightning and he has the ears of the second photo as well. The third and final photo is him in his ultimate phase. His \"Demonic\" phase. His hair color turned into a dark red with one silver streak and one blonde streak. This is not depicted in any of the pictures though.\r\n\r\n>**Age:** Stuck at the look of early 20&#039;s but has been alive for thousands of years.\r\n**Height:** 5&#039; 10\"\r\n**Weight:** 130-150lbs. No one has really weighed him. He usually hovers and or flies, but it is estimated within this range.\r\n\r\n>**Weapon:**\r\nhttp://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l45/Kupoin/DemonicBlade.jpg\r\nThis weapon was made from him and acts as a living extension. Along with the powers residing inside him there are powers residing inside his sword.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>**Passive:** *Blood of the First Demon-*\r\nIlidon is the first of the demons, and from him came all pure demons born of his blood. This blood grants him several bonuses. The first of which is increased magic resist. The second is a shield that negates the next spell which hits him. This includes summoner spells. The third and last is he gains a blood lust for an amount of minions/champions killed.\r\n\r\n>**Magic Resist:** 5/10/15/20\r\n**Magic Shield:** Every 30s he gains a spell shield which blocks and negates the next spell which hits him. What qualifies as \"Spells\" are anything requiring an element or magic. Abilities that are weapon based (Irelia&#039;s Q, Yi&#039;s Q, Darius skills, or any \"Physical\" contact do not count as a \"spell\" when hitting him. This means Varus and Miss Fortune can hit him as well as similar based champions). The cooldown for this shield starts once it dissipates from being hit by a spell.\r\n**Blood Lust:** Every 3rd minion or champion kill or combined give him \"Blood Lust\" which grants his next attack an automatic critical hit and heals him for 10/15/20/25% of the damage done on the critical.\r\n\r\n>***Note: If you have questions about this or suggestions to make this better please feel free to converse with me.***\r\n***Fun Fact: Fact about his passive. As well as his blood giving him the shield and magic resist it is also based upon his beloved&#039;s Crystal Heart Pendant embedded inside his chest protecting him.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>Q **Rending Blade:**\r\nIlidon quick draws his blade and dashes forward damaging enemies in his path and silencing Champions.\r\n\r\n>**Damage:** 50/90/130/170/230 (+50% AD) Physical Damage\r\n**Silence Duration:** 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2s\r\n**Range:** 500 unit range dash.\r\n**Cooldown:** 25/23/21/17/15s\r\n**Cost:** None.\r\n\r\n>**Demon Phase:** Can be activated a second time for 50/60/70% of its damage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>W **Demonic Wave:**\r\nQuickdraws and slices quickly twice before him sending out a wave of energy with each slice. These slices make an + in the air and damages enemies along its path. The vertical slash slices into the ground leaving behind corrupted land. Enemies passing over this area slowed.\r\n\r\n>**Damage:** 40/60/80/100/120 (+70% AD) Physical Damage\r\n**Slow and Slow Duration:** 10/15/20/25/30% for 3s. The corrupted earth lasts for 1/1.5/2/2.5/3s.\r\n**Range/Radius:** The wave goes out for 650 units with a width of 200.\r\n**Cooldown:** 20/18/16/14/12s\r\n**Cost:** None\r\n\r\n>**Demon Phase:** Damage is increased by 10/20/30. The corrupted land explodes after 1.5s damaging enemies against for the same damage within 250 range of the corrupted earth.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>E **Be Free and Be Bound!:**\r\nIlidon trained to fight hordes of enemies. The majority of which were magic users. Ilidon quick draws his sword and stabs the ground enveloping himself in his wings giving himself a shield. Removing stuns from him if he is stunned. From his sword and across the ground goes a spiderweb like cracks for a ways. Enemies upon these marks are damaged, stunned, and silenced. Then are damaged while remaining stunned. Ilidon is locked down during this and cannot move.\r\n\r\n>**Damage:** 30/50/70/90/110 (+50% AD) Physical Damage upon initial contact and the 10/20/30/40/50 magic damage every 0.5s for the duration while stunned.\r\n**Stun and Silence:** Enemies are stunned for 2s. They are silenced for 0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5s afterwards. Enemies who walk over his webs while in place come under this effect as well.\r\n**Lock down and Shield:** Ilidon removes stuns if he is in one and is locked down for 2s which is the duration of this ability. His shield grants him 10/20/30/40/50% of his health as a shield and 30/35/40/45/50% damage reduction from spells. The shield lasts for 5s or until it is dissipated. While this shield is active any spells that cause stun or silence do not work. Physical attacks that cause them do. If he gets silenced or displaced the stun on current enemies are lifted.\r\n**Range/Radius/Look:** The webs extend out for 600 yards in a splitting web cone like pattern. There are 5 cracks. They are jagged and also random in placement. Meaning these five may interlock and crisscross with each other or they can spread out evenly. The cracks extend outwards giving warning and a way to avoid them.\r\n**Cooldown:** 30/27/25/23/21s\r\n**Cost:** None\r\n\r\n>**Demon Phase:** The shield blocks spells instead of reduce. Allies within 400 units of him gain a shield that blocks the next incoming spell that hits them.\r\n\r\n>***Note: This ability can be negating by silences, displacements, and stuns if they are made by physical attacks and NOT spells. Also, he can cancel this anytime by activating this ability again. This ability goes on cooldown AFTER the duration ends.***\r\n***Note 2: During the final stages of creation I changed a few things to this ability. If something seems \"off\" or doesn&#039;t seem right about this ability. Like it doesn&#039;t make sense let me know. It might be an old way of wording the ability and something I forgot to take out. I DID proof read, but I might have missed something.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>R **Demon Phase:**\r\nIlidon embraces his demonic side and becomes his demon self. In this phase he gains increased movement, attack speed, and lifesteal. During this phase he looks like the picture I claimed was his demon form. Along with that his beloved who I haven&#039;t named till now, Rhea, has her arms around his neck slightly hovering over him. Enemies within 300 range of him are damaged during his transformation.\r\n\r\n>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a0/78/6a/a0786ace66d77c2c8325c88cadbb0fcc.jpg\r\nThis is Rhea. His beloved.\r\n\r\n>**Damage:** 150/200/250 (+100% AD)\r\n**Movement Speed:** 5/10/15%\r\n**Attack Speed:** 5/7/10%\r\n**Lifesteal:** 5/7/10%\r\n**Cooldown:** 140/130/120\r\n**Cost/Duration:** Must have 100 Fury to activate. 5 fury per second.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>**Playing Ilidon:**\r\nIlidon is an Anti-Magic champion. He excels in fighting against mages and other magic users. Due to his past with magic and curses. More of a Bot or Mid lane champion due to this he should stick to the top lane and leave mid to the mages of his team unless they want to shut down the spell casters of the enemy.\r\n\r\n>His early game should be working on gaining attack speed, and then damage. Focusing on Magic Resistance as well. These three main things are his primary goals.\r\n\r\n>Working with him in lanes would definitely be {{champion:86}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:266}} . These champions best work with him. Garen&#039;s own silences and power excel at helping out Ilidon against casters and other enemies. Amumu&#039;s stuns and crowd control help to allow Ilidon to better land his abilities against the enemies. Ekko works just like Amumu with crowd control except that Ekko helps build with his damage on top of Ilidons as well as working with Ekko&#039;s stuns and slows with Ilidons own. Aatrox works well with Ilidon for the main fact of a certain combo. Ilidon&#039;s \"Be Bound!\" into Aatrox&#039;s Dive. This is deadly and definitely worth using.\r\n\r\n>Working against Ilidon would be {{champion:31}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:51}} . These champions work best against Ilidon. Cho&#039;Gath&#039;s Displacements and silences are not \"Spells\". They are all physically based. Though his scream is technically not it is also produced physically and NOT a \"spell\" it is natural. Therefore it works wonders on Ilidon and cannot be blocked by his shields. His displacement works best to get him out of his E and free his comrades. Mundo&#039;s insane health and tankiness is what primarily makes him a contender against Ilidon. I&#039;m not too sure about Mundo&#039;s abilities, but the main reason I say he would make it hard on Ilidon is due to his large amounts of health. Varus pretty much makes Ilidon a pincushion. Able to assault him far from the reach of Ilidons clutches with his Q. Allowing him to whittle him down and stay out of Ilidons way. Caitlyn is pretty much like Varus in the way to counter Ilidon.\r\n\r\n>**Essential Items:**\r\n{{item:3065}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3172}} {{item:3156}} \r\n**Offensive Items:**\r\n{{item:3072}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3035}} \r\n**Defensive items:**\r\n{{item:3112}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3512}} \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>**Random info and stuff:**\r\n**Upon selection:**\r\n\"The First shall help you.\"\r\n\"You call upon the powers of my kind?\"\r\n\r\n>**Attacking:**\r\n\"Die mortals!\"\r\n\"Be calm dearest....\" Rare. This is Rhea soothing him as he fights so he doesn&#039;t lose control.\r\n\"You can&#039;t overcome me!\"\r\n\r\n>**Moving:**\r\n\"Ugh, you mortals. Why do you walk? Grow wings already.\"\r\n\"Yes, yes. Click, click, click.\"\r\n\"There? Are you sure you want me to go there? Well alright.\"\r\n\"The enemy is the OTHER way,\" When moving away from enemies, and over 50% health.\r\n\"Damn those mortals are good....\" when below 50% health and moving away from enemies.\r\n\"Ok, ok.

Got it.\"\r\n\"You know, it&#039;s hard being this good.\"\r\n\r\n>**Quotes:**\r\n\"You look like one of us, but you&#039;re not....Hrm, interesting,\" Comment about how Aatrox looks.\r\n\"You remind me of my dearest in a way,\" To Kayle, Karma, Ahri, and Jinx. Kayle for her majesty, Karma for her serenity, Ahri for her playfulness, Jinx for her strong will and fun style. All of them for their beauty.\r\n\"Yi, you wield your sword well. It is an honor,\" To Yi.\r\n\"Your magic shall be ground into dust!....but I do admire your convictions. Unlike other magic users I&#039;ve come across....\" To all good aligned magic users should they oppose him on the enemy team.\r\n\"Your magic shall be ground into dust!\" To non good magic users on the enemy team.\r\n\"I shall tolerate your magic. At least it is used for good.\" To magic users on his side for good alignment.\r\n\"I shall tolerate your magic, but one wrong move....\" To non good magic users on his team.\r\n\r\n>**Dying:**\r\nHe fades into a black mist and red lightning.\r\n\r\n>**Recalling:**\r\nFlies away with red lightning surround him.\r\n\r\n>**Personality:**\r\nKind, caring, wise, cocky, angry, determined, loving, and very mixed. He is a kind soul cursed to darkness and the darkness consumes him. Only his beloved and his own will power and strength keep him from becoming the cursed demon inside him. Even in demon form he is in control thanks to the power of Rhea who, when faced with a dilemma when he kept going on rampages, came to him and calmed him. Helping him get his curse under control. His generals, while demons themselves from his blood also have control from their own strength and his teachings. They are safe.\r\n\r\n>**Friends:**\r\n{{champion:245}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:110}} \r\n**Enemies:**\r\nHe doesn&#039;t have many if any enemies. Everyone else is just wary of him due his appearance and origins.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere you have him! Ilidon, the First Demon. Let me know what you think below!
