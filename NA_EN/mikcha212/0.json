Game is still up as my friend is in the game. I'm clearly connected to the internet as I'm posting this. Not sure what's causing this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-26T23:42:21.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with solid internet, you can still have issues routing to the game server just as you mentioned.  I'm not sure what troubleshooting you've done so far, but I recommend starting with the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to both strengthen your connection to our services as well as potentially reroute getting there (configuring dns).  Test it in a custom and let me know if it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Penanggalan","date":"2017-07-27T05:01:40.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the only thing all you rioters say!! Ever since you guys updated to the new client soo many dc's, can't reconnect and sometimes the game just doesn't exist anymore. You guys should actually look into connection issues from your server INSTEAD OF TELLING US TO GO OVER \"CONNECTION ISSUES\" EVERY SINGLE TIME.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-27T15:39:01.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're always keeping an eye out for server instability.  League is always online and yesterday was patch day, which is when a lot of players might discover instabilities with their network.  Like anything, even your connection can go through some wear and tear or changes between updates to your hardware/OS.  Suggesting the connection guide helps rule out possibilities.  Telling you to do something otherwise or pulling suggestions out of my ass would only delay solving the issue and getting you back in game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mikcha212","date":"2017-07-27T00:04:20.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. It's doing better now. This sort of thing happens often (about 15 times a game) where i mini dc for about 2 seconds during which i can see everyone else moving fluidly but my inputs are ignored. I figure it's just my upload to riot being lost, but the download of everyone else's inputs is fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mikcha212","date":"2017-07-26T23:03:21.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/72f10f147ac10cbaf02ceabee7f73118.png","replies":[]}]}
