Funny thing is, My friends wanted me to get it but I refused initially because well, I was never a fan of playing with a keyboard, and my PC really isn't the best in the world. League also didn't look fun to me at all at first.\r\n\r\nHowever, a week ago, I got very bored. So I decided to play League. And now I'm addicted :D \r\n\r\nThank you Riot for this awesome game you have created for me and the rest of the community!","replies":[{"poster":"arcinex","date":"2015-04-15T15:06:15.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give it a few more weeks.","replies":[{"poster":"General Grodd","date":"2015-04-15T15:20:03.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh.

And your duo partner\n2)Don't let the trolls or flamers get to you. On the flip side, if you get trolls in your game, chances are the enemy will eventually get trolls on theirs.\n3)The easiest way to level up is go in bot games. A 20 minute games give a load of exp vs a pvp game, especially on FWotD\n4)Welcome to the League of Legends. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2015-04-15T15:13:58.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you like it, remember to have fun with the game, even when you're losing.\n\nAs I'm sure many will mention, you will be running into negative/toxic players eventually that will ruin your game experience if you allow them to. My best advice is to play with your friends as often as you can and keep in mind you can walk away from the game for a day or two if you feel burned out or demoralized by a particularly bad game.\n\nOtherwise, good luck have fun!","replies":[]}]}
