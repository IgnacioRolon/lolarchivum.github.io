I am trying to get my team to reach the CS by Spring of 2017 and was wondering how exactly we could get into the CS Qualifiers with the new re-introduction of ranked 5s. I know it used to be like the top Challenger teams and such but i was wondering is that still the case? If you could get back to me at your earliest convenience and help shed some light on this or just point me in the right direction of where to look it would be very appreciated. Thank you\r\n\r\nUseTheForceLuke","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2016-06-30T01:17:08.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mye nailed it!

The new misfits bunny looks absolutely adorable, just have to have it alongside my TDK/Dignitas ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2016-06-30T02:35:26.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, that's not in the cards.
