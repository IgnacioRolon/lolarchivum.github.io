Stats are stats, entirely numbers. If Champ X abuses Raw AP, it's a pretty good indicator that it's the champs AP ratio that's out of line, not the item itself. But I guarantee you, if you nerfed the item instead, Champion X will still be the one abusing it, because he's the one who has the best ratios. \n\nAnd really, the amount of AP in the game possible is kinda arbitrary. You could double the AP and halve the ratios, for the same effect. Either way, changes in total AP doesn't really favor one mage over the next. So the only way Total AP could be a problem is if mages as a whole, were being oppressive and crowding out other options. (But then we would have a meta of a lot more mages)","replies":[{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2017-05-26T03:20:46.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats inherently the issue.\n\nAP is only AP, literally the only build variance we see are niche champions like Azir who need a secondary/tertiary stat.\n\nOtherwise, all an AP champion can do is stack AP, BECAUSE THE ITEMS DONT GIVE THEM A CHOICE.\n\nIt's not like AD where you have armour penetration, lifesteal, bruiser, crit.\nThat doesn't exist for AP.\n\nYou either stack AP, mana, or both.\nThere's literally no other stat you can stack\n\nI'm not saying AP items need more/less AP, im saying they need VARIANCE, so that you aren't just buying Luden's Echo because it has the next most AP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-05-26T02:40:04.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"reminds me of when cinderhulk first came out.
