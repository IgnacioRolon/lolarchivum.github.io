His big fault is that he's slow even with runes(he can't shorten his animations). Hit him with mobility champions. Also early his cooldowns are pretty sizeable. So if he's top I'd suggest Quinn or Urgot. Darius' passive is op against his healing (you don't even have to expend mana to make him bleed). Also if you can stay at a distance from his ult then do it. There's no reason to be in his face unless your kit forces you to and a lot of champions who are that close are tanky. \n\nI haven't played with or against him mid much so I can't help you there.\n\nIf all else fails, pick him yourself and figure out the weaknesses that way. He is fun to play, easy to learn,  and relatively cheap.","replies":[{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2015-05-13T15:31:08.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If all else fails, pick him yourself and figure out the weaknesses that way.

Kat should not be trying to kill Cho in lane after level 6. It can't happen. But Cho also cannot touch Katarina for the entirety of laning phase. Katarina does not use mana so she is free to chip away at his health with her Q, dodge his knockup (every time) with her E and get free Q procs with her W because his silence is pretty useless once his knockup is on cooldown. \n\nShove him into tower and roam.","replies":[{"poster":"R110","date":"2015-05-13T13:31:33.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aren't teamfights hell as Katarina vs a team with a Cho'Gath?","replies":[{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-05-13T13:43:17.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a game the other day as Cho against a Katarina and took some major notes on the matchup.

A good cho will never burn everything for a kat to just rek his team, all he has to do is sit on silence and then bang she's out of the fight when she goes in. As for lane phase landing w isn't hard, unless she's not even touching the minion wave for fear of you. If you land w then q after she burns shunpo ur jungler has easy ganks. I just can't see a kat beating a cho if the cho is good, lane phase,late game, or otherwise. If we're talking about mids that beat cho then malzahar is a good example. His e provides a lot of pressure and he can clear waves just as fast.

I had a game as cho mid the other day, and early on they abused me to pieces as vel'koz (tons of poke, and even though I heavily out farmed him, his base damage kept him relevant enough to be a huge pain in the butt). the thing that made his poke stick though was a Morellonomicon. That thing is a nightmare for Cho, because it cripples his sustain if you poke him low enough. Late game, their Yi and Kalista got fed, and both are mobile and bursty enough that even though I was super farmed (I had over 20 CS on everyone in the game until right at the end, and still by 13 at that point), they could just dance around my CC and burst me down, which kept me from being able to stack at all. That said, once I got a couple minutes of breathing room and got my stacks back up, they had a much harder time dealing with me in the next fight.\n\nBasically, to beat Cho'gath, you need to get him behind and keep your heel on his head to keep him down or else he'll make a comeback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Axests","date":"2015-05-13T15:30:33.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found that garen does well vs him top lane boys\nedit: as for mid (god only knows why) malzahar does well vs him in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2015-05-13T15:14:39.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who are you playing vs. Cho?\n\nCho's laning is really powerful but you can outcarry him and maybe even outlane him with the right picks.\n\n{{champion:105}} Unexpected choice but Fizz dodging Cho's rapture can 100-0 cho with ignite at level 5 onward.
