They mention, in canon, that the Holy Grail can pull a Servant from ANY period of time. Past or future. In fact, that's one of the first things mentioned, so it's more of a case of foreshadowing. Plus, the connection between GARcher and Shirou was hinted at early on: They used the exact same manner of spells and fighting style (Tracing to create/empower weapons, a bow and preference for dual-wielding). There's also the fact that they kind of look somewhat similar if you look closely enough.\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nAlso on the Servants meeting requirements:\n\nHeracles (Fate/stay night's Berserker) can be summoned as _EVERY_ class aside from Caster.

In Fate/stay Night saber was mentioned to be an ultimate all around-er. Achilles on the other hand while being proficient in the sword excelled mostly in the spear. On the other hand, Quite literally the only time Achilles is ever seen to really interact with horses though is in the humiliation of hectors corpse through the chariot drag. which does not, a horse rider make.\n\nServant's legends are taken into account. The desecration of Hector's corpse is one of the more well-known things about Achilles, hence him being a Rider. Kind of like how F/SN's Rider is Medusa, because her blood made Pegasus.\n\n\nAlso, nononono, you see the Saber _CLASS_ is the most well-rounded in terms of Stats. IE: It's the best all-arounder. A Berserker like, say Heracles, would kick the shit out the average Saber because his Strength and Endurance is stupidly high (A+ STR, A END). What's funnier is he's actually at his weakest because he can't use his Noble Phantasm due to Mad Enhancement (which is good, because that thing is broken as fuck).\n\nFor an example of what kind of broken monster the Berserker class is when it can use their Noble Phantasms properly: See the Fourth Holy Grail War, Fate/Zero, and the Berserker there (hint: He's a Knight of the Round table, and the Lancer to King Arthur). \n\nDue to his Rank A+ _Eternal Arms Mastership_ skill and the Noble Phantasm _Knight of Honor_, he can use any weapon as though he had trained with it his entire life, even if it's totally alien to the person he was in life. Because he recognizes a fighter jet as a weapon, he can first turn it into his Noble Phantasm and then fly it far better than any human pilot. His second Noble Phantasm, _For Someone's Glory_ lets him distort and alter his appearance, giving him the ability to disguise himself to be anyone, including other servants like when he convincingly disguises himself as Iskander. If not for Mad Enhancement, he could have spent the entire War pretending to be other Servants sowing chaos among the other Masters. Strength? A. Agility? A+. Endurance? A. Using his third Noble Phantasm _Arondight_ and getting a stat boost on top of all that? Come on, man, quit hogging all the badass!\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Jericho","date":"2015-05-18T18:55:07.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".........\n\nWell... glad to see that I'm not the only one who enjoys doing extensive research on the Fate series. lol.\n\nYou are correct in every point on Fate/Zero's Berserker (I DO know who he is, but I don't want to spoil anything on anyone who doesn't).

Or am I mistaken there?\n\n_God Hand_ is the Noble Phantasm that gives Heracles 12 lives. _Nine Lives_ is the Noble Phantasm he can't use due to Mad Enhancement. Here's the description:\n\n\"Nine Lives: The Shooting Hundred Heads (One Hundred Arrow Strikes in Fate/unlimited codes) is the most trusted of all of Heracles' Noble Phantasms, but it is not utilized during Fate/stay night because he lacks the motor skills to use it while in the Berserker class. It originally had the form of the bow and arrows used to simultaneously exterminate the one hundred heads of the Hydra, an immortal nine-headed serpent, that would grow back no matter how many times they were cut down. Upon slaying the Hydra, he became able to utilize techniques that emulate the ability of the Noble Phantasm with other weapons, transforming it into an all-purpose Noble Phantasm capable of adapting and changing how it appears depending on the target and circumstances of its use.\n\nNo matter if it is delivered with a bow, large sword, shield, spear, or axe, the technique still boasts power on the level of Noble Phantasms. In essence, it is “a high speed attack consisting of nine consecutive strikes, as swift as if the attacks are overlapping.” It changes form depending on the target, such as the Anti-Unit Nine Lives Blade Works with a series of slashes and the anti-phantasm beast skill that discharges nine dragon-like homing lasers at the enemy. The skill can be called a style of its own that has a nature similar to Cú Chulainn's Gae Bolg: Barbed Spear that Pierces with Death, a technique that is part of Gae Bolg, as Heracles' technique shares name with the original Noble Phantasm. The ability would be best suited for the Saber class even though the Archer class is the most suitable to Heracles.\"","replies":[{"poster":"BlackSunNocturne","date":"2015-05-22T02:41:04.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=animeboy2428,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=egKrYqbl,comment-id=00010000000000000003000000010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-21T22:59:02.434+0000)\n>\n> Okay!

In Fate/stay Night saber was mentioned to be an ultimate all around-er. Achilles on the other hand while being proficient in the sword excelled mostly in the spear. On the other hand, Quite literally the only time Achilles is ever seen to really interact with horses though is in the humiliation of hectors corpse through the chariot drag. which does not, a horse rider make.","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Jericho","date":"2015-05-15T14:46:36.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the wiki said Chiron because he was the one fighting for the Black Faction.

They show archer also having the 1 of a kind pendant, shirou replicates the same swords, archer's unexplained obsession with shirou, and lots of dialogue that kind of hinted at it if you were looking for it.  I thought it was a nice way to say hero's aren't just something of the past, there will be ones in the future too and the summoning isn't bound by time. \n\nI think it's kind of funny people have their minds blown when mainstream media (movies, tv shows, books) use these concepts, but when it's an anime everyone thinks it's a cheesy overused concept.  It's all about the presentation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-05-13T20:12:09.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh, it's just too edgy for its own good.

In this case everything   this has to offer has already been done time and again, and since they cater to teenagers(shonen iirc), they have to have something a bit more thoroughly built out to keep the viewers hooked. If it wasn't for the stellar animation quality this would be another average popcorn animu. But that is(as everything mentioned here) my own personal opinion.
