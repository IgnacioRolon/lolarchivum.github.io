Given how hard it is to land a skillshot like that at the range Kog'maw prefers to be at, it doesn't even feel like it's worth bothering to try and land it. Especially since landing it only gives you a damage benefit instead of protecting you from a target like your E does. Kog'maw's Q has never seemed like it was leveled for any reason other than the passive AS it provided.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-02-17T17:56:31.380+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's an idea.

With the new Warlord's, as well as the large Corki nerfs and minor Lucian nerf, he will still be quite dominant AS AN ADC. I want to emphasize that because his mid lane has been in a pretty bad spot ever since the rework and we were promised it wouldn't be since there are plenty of AP Kog fans and it's not like AP Kog is some lame new gimmick based on one item. He had a rich and distinct playstyle of his own and a kit with plenty of AP scalings to back it up. He should not be a second class citizen and the Q as well as base AS changes only make that style weaker. I think this may be a much better and more consistent [nerf idea](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/nhwfYPM4-koggles-nerf-idea) (creating a more logical power curve).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2016-02-17T14:44:00.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wasn't he decent prior to the shifting of the passive to W?

[AP Kog was really hurt by the rework](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/RcMpy4qi-why-kog-mid-isnt-a-thing-anymore) and nerfing base AS hurts him too since Q is usually maxed 2nd in AP builds. While I wish the AS wasn't moved from Q to W in the first place and these changes seem inconsistent with a hypercarry (weakening late game, making early stronger), I think he'll still be good as an ADC with .625 just because the early game is much better still. Although, I play Kog to be a hyperscaler not a lane bully or mid game champ. so I'd rather be pathetic early and stronger late.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eeyore","date":"2016-02-17T21:03:50.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you think it would play out moving the percentile damage from W to a debuff applied by Q?

It went from his only reliable damage on AP to a worse version of his E, which made me take W second even on AP Kog.
