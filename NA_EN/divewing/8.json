I have extensive experience in the game, and my lack of desire to play ranked doesn't mean I'm somehow bad at the game, just because my nearly 6k games aren't in a particular mode.\n\nLee sin is broken, by having a breadth of capabilities without detracting from the depth of his core strengths. This is why he's such a problem in blind pick as well when you remove the draft process. It's not because the players are bad. It's because the ease with which the player can handle most given situations, when playing lee sin, is far greater than other champions. Randomly pick one of the 133 other champions to play against lee sin, he's more likely to have a solid answer for an important part of their kit, than another random champion. \n\nCompared to most of the champion pool, lee sin gives equally skilled players an advantage, simply by design of his kit, as being a jack of all trades, but still a master of some.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-01-13T01:30:39.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will never use the Rank argument to stop discussion or as an insult, I will and have only used it as credibility for someone's arguement. It's called ethos, and in an argument, it's hard to believe the idea from someone who falls into the category listed above. (Besides, aren't you Gold?)\n\nTo the rest of your argument, it doesn't make sense. Lee Sin is an early game duelist, of course he's going to beat a majority of other picks in a 1v1 situation. But League is not a 1v1 game, it's a team game. It's the reason why Lee falls of late game, people start to group up. It becomes so much more difficult, because that frontline isn't going to simply give you access to their backline carries.\n\nLeague is not a 1v1 game, and different champions have different strengths throughout the game. Lee's dominance is in early game, and as such, he is going to be best early. Take a full build Jax vs a Full build Lee Sin, and it's pretty obvious who is going to win. That's just an example, but Lee get's outclassed late game by plenty of people IF he's not ahead. If he's ahead, of course he's going to be beating people who are behind.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-01-13T04:14:29.749+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, back in season 4. I put in about a week to get to gold, working against a new router which would DC about once every 2 hrs, full time school and a full time job, because i was playing a decent amount of elise at the time and wanted the free skin. So yes, I've been in gold, but I never attempted to get a higher rank.\n\nI agree, he is a early game duelist. However, as you said, he will beat people if he's ahead, yet at the earliest point in the game, his default position is ahead of most other champions. \nHis goal isn't to get ahead, his goal is to stay ahead from ~3:30 forwards. \nWhich i'd personally prefer to see go, for the same reason i have an issue which i have with a few other champions. The design makes it so that most of the initiative is given to lee sin by default. It's no longer your game to win, it becomes his game to lose. \n\nI'm not a fan of riot giving champions the initiative on a silver platter, rather than determining it based on factors of how the player farmed and how they played the first couple of minutes. \n\nThis is an issue that hearthstone fails to address and is similar in league. Early game needs to be higher risk for less reward, because there is a natural advantage which comes with having your power spike in the early game as opposed to the mid or late game. What i mean, is that a champion who is reliably going to be twice as strong in the early game, is naturally at an advantage over a champion who **will ** be twice as strong come the mid-late game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-01-12T16:18:08.126+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guess you could say they turn a blind eye when it comes to favoritism.","replies":[{"poster":"FPSKILLERBOB","date":"2017-01-12T19:28:13.583+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"They never listen to us...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-01-13T14:45:29.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Gary-Ba-Dum-Tss-Drum-Meme-Reaction-Gif-On-Spongebob-SquarePants_408x408.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-01-12T18:52:35.384+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":10,"body":"Except Azir became an unsiegable, untouchable hypercarry with too much map sway while being a lane bully.
