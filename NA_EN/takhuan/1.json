After 3 seasons I just don't get it...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I just lost a game handedly playing with the standard 8ad 14% attackspeed 9 armor and 12 magic resist. Died instantly to an alistar and miss fortune which makes me questioned the whole &quot;you need defense&quot; argument. \r\n\r\nIt used to make more sense when you didnt have the 13 armor that seals gave you for dueling but now you get more health and armor... If an annie that won mid lane decides to nuke you, 12 magic resist will be nothing to stop that.\r\n\r\nAn adc needs to put out damage and needs to be able to scale into the late game. I have had more luck and will continue to play with scaling ad runes for 45 damage at level 18 and 8-12 damage at level 1.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2015-10-25T18:05:57.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are finding more success with that type of rune page then use it. The entire point of having extra defensive stats in the laning phase is so that you don't get chunked out constantly in the laning phase and be forced to back constantly. That's why ADCs just stick with flat armor yellows. The little extra AD you can get from yellows and blues is so low that you must make sure you outplay and outtrade  your opponent if you want it to be worth it since late game that small boost is going to be pitiful and not worth it unless you can get ahead early.\n\nWhen you start facing people who knows how to trade effectively you will find how important that few extra armor are in the laning phase as opposed to some pitiful amount of AD","replies":[{"poster":"Takhuan","date":"2015-10-25T18:21:30.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently sitting between gold 5 and gold 4. You can afford to play more passive you don't have to worry about cs as much as exp and if you go back you can get a pickaxe and potions instead of being hard pressed to get a bfs at an important point in the game.\n\nI know that pro players go with the flat defensive runes, even the koreans do it but I just can't see it being more than the current meta which focuses on winning lane rather than making yourself hard to shut down all together.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Takhuan","date":"2015-10-25T17:56:32.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scaling Ad is just so effective when you think about it though. If you are behind you can sit on a pickaxe and get a zeal so you can kite easier and attack and have a chance for critical strike without loosing the ability to last hit off of tower. Then when you get IE you can deal even more damage with your crits because you would have scaled 200 damage just with IE by level 11.\n\nIf you go defensive runes you have no stats to give you an edge if you loose the lane.\n\nDefensive stats don't give you any tools to get out of a bad situation, make you harder to shut down or anything like that and they don't do much at all to take advantage of a good situation. Defensive stats are a largely team dependent factor because your team will need to be dealing damage if you are in a situation where you are taking damage and have to run. Soloq is anything but reliable in that regard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-10-25T17:30:37.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always use scaling magic resist glyphs on adc's. +27mr at level 18, instead of +12 flat mr. Also.....runes arent supposed to help you all throughout the game (for the most part). Theyre supposed to give you some added bonuses to the early game. And whether you have magic resist or not it wont help much at all against burst dmg like annie's or leblanc's for example.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Its All Skillzz","date":"2015-10-25T17:25:27.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i dont even bother anymore. swaped my ap ezreal runes to 9 hybrid pen marks 3 ap quints 9 mana per level yellow and 9 scaling cdr blues. ran 30-0-0 masterys. just  stay back an spam spells to discourage all ins. best defense is a good offense.\n\nThe idea of a squishy is to do damage and be blown up when caught. so the idea is to not get caught lol. trust me 9 armor/12 mr wasnt going to save you from that flash alister knock back combo you was dead either way.\n\nhowever if you play a melee esp top it is probably a good idea to rune some defense but on a ranged champion i wouldnt bother.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-10-25T17:19:33.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is: Defensive Stats are more efficient the lower the number value.
