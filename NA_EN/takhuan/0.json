He just needs some love. Just a little. Cause I find myself in this perfect situation. I play annie mind you... my timings and positioning are often for tibbers ult but when I go in with braum he obviously does no damage but I really need that knockup ult really bad and there is this perfect situation where I could have ulted to turn a team fight around and it never came. It was 5 seconds too early since the last time I ulted... And it basically cost my team the game.\n\nThis is important because the time between ults was roughly the time between late game team fights over objectives and defense.\n\nI never have problems like that with annie and tibbers. And she gets kills and shuts down snowballing enemies better than this guy who just dies while trying to help is allies get kills.","replies":[{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-02-05T08:24:11.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I never have problems like that with annie and tibbers. \n\nBecause Annie's ult CD is very short for how good the ability is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-02-05T06:50:12.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe you and yo team should comunicate with each other more regarding ult timers so you dont do dumb shit","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDr√°co","date":"2015-02-05T06:17:51.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please god no supports in general need sweeping nerfs.
