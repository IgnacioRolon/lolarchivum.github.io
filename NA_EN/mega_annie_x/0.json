So CC hurts certain champions more than others, and choosing champions with CC against champions hurt MORE by CC is beneficial.\n\nYou'll find that's called 'counterpicking' and using said CC is called 'counterplaying.' Yi is built around this concept, it's hardly new.

I agree with ignite and warding but CC is counterplay equally to literally every champion in the game.\n\nSome champions are countered by CC more than others. CCing, say, a Garen won't accomplish much, because he'll probably reduce the duration and he has high defenses anyway, but Pyke literally can't gain bonus health, and his defense/sustain relies on getting out of fights to regenerate. If you CC him, he can't do that, and then all that grey health doesn't do anything.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2019-01-31T02:27:40.994+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"Honestly, Pyke is such cancer that I put him up there with {{champion:84}} and {{champion:157}}.
