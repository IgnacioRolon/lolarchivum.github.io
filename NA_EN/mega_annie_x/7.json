These things are made for a reason (Yasuo windwall+passive, Ryze shield + ms when overloading, Vayne max hp true damage, Rivens mobility, the list goes on). Once you start taking away parts of a champion, you actually make it harder to balance them and remove what makes them unique. Ryze is balanced with his shield + ms in mind, you take that away and you have to buff him in other areas (which, speaking as a Ryze main, you really don't want :P). Perhaps his numbers could be tuned sure, but thats all he needs. He is a very high skill-cap champion and it takes hours of practice for the Ryze player to get to the point where he becomes difficult to deal with for the enemy team, but thats the reward for spending hours learning him and taking the risk every game that you could easily fuck something up by just missing a Q (not something a champion, say, Kayle has. ((who is arguably stupid broken))). \n\nI'm not saying Ryze should be OP when you've played 200 games with him, all things have to come with a balance cap, but thankfully thats what Rito has done. He becomes a problem late game because he scales with mana and can easily get over 1000 ap. He has no CD's because anyone sensible playing Ryze will take scaling CDR runes (and runes need a big overhaul anyway) and build 30% CDR very early (Ionian boots + Morello. He also has his resets which are staple for a combo-based champion). CDR is an overly accessible stat also, but we all know Items are a difficult thing to deal with for Riot.  Early game however, the only thing he has is his root (which is a staple in Ryzes kit, he literally wouldn't work without it) and his shield+ms. He needs these things to survive, otherwise he wouldn't be a fun champ to play, and you end up with yet another dead champion.\n\nIf you're struggling to deal with Ryze, don't get mad because he ran away with 100 health.
