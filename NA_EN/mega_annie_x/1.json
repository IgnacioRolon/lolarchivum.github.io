It was laughable how much damage and hard cc it did. After that, it was pure &quot;no skill shot heatseeking hard cc.&quot; all game.\r\n\r\nNo wonder this asshole is banned a lot. \r\n\r\nThe difference between a passive and aggressive rakan is night and day. He needs no gear at all to hit you like a falling skyscraper.\r\n\r\nImagine is leona could just decide to right click you and ALWAYS hit her cc. That is what laning against rakan feels like.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-02T21:02:21.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You could actually learn his range and how not to get mortared dead center by him. Leona is worse.\n\nBut yes, he will probably get small nerfs.","replies":[]}]}
