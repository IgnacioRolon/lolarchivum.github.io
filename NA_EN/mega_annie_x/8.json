Hopefully constructive.\n\nThe biggest issue is the sheer amount of true damage and over the top powerful champions.  Damage as a whole needs to be reevaluated at the moment, and towers should be buffed a bit.  Playing from behind is just unfun now, feels almost futile.  \nFights shouldn't be decided instantly, it really waters down the experience for most players.  CC and Burst are just astronomical right now, \nand while mobility is fantastic and really does make the game more fun...immobile champs suffer since they may just not be viable because of the mobility that they will be against.\nAbilities like Fizz's Troll Pole and Jax's....everything are impossibly frustrating to deal with and should be looked at.  Things that create an unenjoyable game state for the majority of players (I can't speak for everyone obviously, including about my mention of both Fizz and Jax) should be reviewed and if need be, reworked.  \nI know it's a lot to think about and to go over, but to increase the quality of the game, it would be well worth it, at least in my opinion.\n\nAlso, bring back an effective way to deal with the sheer amount of toxicity in the community...the trolls, feeders...there needs to be meaningful punishment.  The option to just make another account if their troll account gets banned and their main account stays safe creates a further unhealthy state of game.  That is one of the biggest issues that still exists, and people abuse it further and further.  \nIn a team based game, my biggest hurdle shouldn't be my own team.\n   \nThis is all just my opinion.  If you read it all, thank you for hearing me out.  I'm not trying to rip on Riot or anyone or anything...but these are just things that seem to be brought up fairly often (or get brought up to me in conversation whilst I talk to some of the other players I know).\n\nThank you.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-06-30T03:33:23.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Except this thread hasn't added anything besides in a roundabout way just say what every other post like this says every day.

No. I can almost guarantee that a vast majority of the views and upvotes in the smaller thread ALSO viewed the bigger one.

People should confine the complaints to one \"megathread\" instead of echoing throughout multiple threads with the illusion there are more people involved than reality. It would also not cause the front page of the boards to have more diversity especially when I can see more than one thread that is titled \"Am I the only one that thinks X\" in some shape or form NEXT TO EACH OTHER on the front page. No you aren't. It's a rhetorical question only aimed at farming upvotes.\n\nColleges do this all the time by \"bending\" the truth on their numbers of enrolled students.
