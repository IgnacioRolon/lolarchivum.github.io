The 3 second silence wrecks those champs. We need MORE silences, not less.\r\n\r\nThey must be attached to champs that have no mobility though. Basically a wall of, \"You done fucked up\" if you get near them. If a mage gets that close, they deserve to die. Close range long silences are the only counter to these troll hyper mobile carries","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-03-03T20:26:48.331+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wake me when both cho and garen get their ancient, skill-free, zero-decision kits reworked.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-03-03T20:38:43.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Vf4w10Vj,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-03-03T20:26:48.331+0000)\n>\n> Wake me when both cho and garen get their ancient, skill-free, zero-decision kits reworked.\n\nDo I eat/Q this one, or this one..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-03-03T19:57:24.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, sure, they're the only two if you only count silences for some arbitrary reason.
