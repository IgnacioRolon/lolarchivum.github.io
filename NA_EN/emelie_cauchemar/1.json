Mind you, the .20% nerf is a joke in itself due to the nature of her kit.\n\nEX: \n\n1. She receives a   bonus to damage with a **delay** in attacking.\n\n2. She has attack resets. \n\n3. She utilizes burst.\n\nAll of these things completely invalidate the AS nerf. With how her kit functions a decent Camille may lose 1 to 5 autos out of the entire jungle clear. 5 sounds like a lot, but it&#039;s really not. Especially when you consider the fact she really doesn&#039;t spend a lot of time clearing her jungle to begin with. \n\n\nCamille&#039;s BIGGEST problem is her E.  Just so people can understand how disgusting her E is.  From the middle of bot lane at tier 2 turret, Camille can use E and kill you at your red buff.  With that knowledge, think of how much pressure she exerts on both mid and top just by existing . . . the answer is A LOT.  With where the minions crash in mid lane . . . Camille can literally do red buff, walk up  from the wall of red buff, push E onto the wall of mid lane and crash into your mid laner where the casters are in the wave.  Your mid laner essentially has to give an entire wave of cs away + give level 2 advantage just because Camille exists. \n\nHer E&#039;s distance needs to seriously scale with level to give people a chance to breath.  It isnot hard to remove 200 range off the first part of E and 100-200 range off of the second part and give it back to her in scaling increments. I understand the range is designed to be very forgiving so she can collapse on people in the middle of lane. However, it was also designed with top lane in mind ((where you removed her from essentially.)) Removing this range will force her to position like most other junglers have to, actually be mindful of wards, and also give laners some breathing room for the first wave or two of minions.  This also means that Camille will be forced to look for legitimate opportunities beyond, &quot;Well, it appears X mid laner stepped in to the lane, guess I&#039;m just going to 100-0 him from my red buff now.&quot; \n\nMost other junglers _generally_ have to wait for a certain period of time, a particular cc to be used, a movement ability, some form of commitment to an exchange, timers for wards to disappear, clear pinks.  Camille does not.  And this is all because of her E range. \n\nAdditionally. Due to warrior + triforce and E max . . . she&#039;s covering roughly 1200-1600 range through walls every . . . 6-7 seconds?  With that I highly recommend jacking the CD up of her E. I feel this is incredibly fair.  20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12.  This makes it so laners can breath, and also so that if Camille performs terribly she can not just out scale her mess up by having an hilariously low E CD to throw her body at people. However, if the Camille does do well she&#039;s going to have 40% cdr in no time and the changes will mean virtually nothing to her. \n\n\nAll in all, I personally feel this balancing team is wasting every ones time and I&#039;m getting pretty tired of it.  I get the AS nerf is supposed to &quot;punish inefficiency/ slow clear.&quot; But there are so many A-reset assets these days it hardly means anything, and the issue is not how fast she clears the jungle, but how disgusting her gank potentials are.  This will make it so she still has the same power budget ((hilarious burst.)) But it will make it so laners can play around her, and also force more effort out of her when it comes to ganks. \n\nThat&#039;s all I&#039;m going to say on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"xDelightifyx","date":"2018-11-28T06:32:44.866+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, always rember, that Irelia got nerfed by 5MS, everything is fine ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Emelie Cauchemar","date":"2018-11-28T06:37:10.427+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xDelightifyx,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kv5WmJwA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-28T06:32:44.866+0000)\n>\n> Dude, always rember, that Irelia got nerfed by 5MS, everything is fine ;)\n\nAnd buffed Kha'zix while he was extremely dominant already. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PepijndM","date":"2018-11-28T20:22:42.860+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Camille needs -3 AD?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DM For Rat Facts","date":"2018-11-28T06:09:07.566+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find the issue with Camille is that her E is TOO far ranged. her E can land 2/3 width of mid.

You have about half a second to think about where to go right here and now. You go to the right Camille will just extend out and still catch you. If you flash last second behind Camille to run to the river, she can very easily just flash right back on to you. Malz still has his flash too.  On top of that you're level 1 with just Q. This means that if Camille touches you a single time you have nowhere to go due to red buff. \n\nI'm pretty confident that a d5 Camille isn't going to be TEEHEE XD outplayed here, even if she isn't the greatest around.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-11-28T06:39:25.189+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Her E shouldn't be allowed to go over terrain unless there's a target there.

But, just for an example of what I'm saying about it. It isn't meant to shame, but if you go to that clip I linked on this post.  That person's jungle efficiency is next to 0. But, guess what? He was relevant the entire game, despite me dominating his jungle.  You're welcome to OP.GG him and check his CS that game.  Despite how hard I pummeled him in that game, despite how much I took from him . . . he still managed to continuously murder my team + stay at a pretty even pace with me.\n\nThen look at his ranked game after with Camille. He goes something stupid like 12/2. Not a good jungle pather. Not efficient at all. Doesn't even really farm. Not even really all that good with Camille. Still goes 12/2 in diamond. This player honestly completely proves my point that the AS nerf truly means nothing.  At the end of the day, you can just as easily get that level 2 gank off, and then buy a single dagger and hold on to it. After that, you're essentially the same champion again.  IT sounds kind of goofy, but when you think about it you're essentially just buying an earlier component to triforce and you can even debate on going the hecarim route and out right buying triforce before warrior to adjust for the change.  \n\n\nThis isn't to shame the player at all.

Her E range is pretty okay if you ask me, since it requires a champion to be there in order to leap that big distance. The reason why it works with her flash is because of how the game works, a hitbox is created when she dashes and it stuns them if a player collides with it.  You could fix it saying if you flashed then don't stun but then that would ruin the integrity of the champ because there are a ton and I mean a ton of champs who can do flash plays much better than Camille can. Her stun is not even long so it isn't like you're stuck there for a good 2 seconds. \n\nI've vsed Camille's up to diamond 2 and all I can say is that this champion has never dominated or carried a game alone with her e. She is not an easy champ to master and definitely an easy one to counter if you know her kit well. That e dash is so easy to juke, you would laugh if I compiled you all the games I made Camille waste her dash and let her dash into my turret instead {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nI can see by your match history, you vsed a Camille 2 days ago and won against her. Her kit used to be much more powerful with the old runes + when conqueror didn't exist. But now that true damage is accessible to everyone, she relies on that e to actually do some damage. Nerfing that e range would completely break her as you'd have to be super close in order to hit them (which gives a much bigger risk to actually missing). It may sound weird but the closer she is, the easier it is to dodge that e. \n\nThe attackspeed nerf is pretty noticeable if you don't take some runes that give you attackspeed but first we need to fix dark harvest. \n\nI've stopped playing this game now, since every time I play a game, I see everyone picking dark harvest. Even our supports... Legit wtf is this bs \n\nI may be a little biased over her e since I mostly only play Camille, but I can tell you that it isn't really that bad since the stun and damage is nothing. Damage was already nerfed and doesn't really deal much damage in the lower levels, if you somehow die to a Camille while trying to take your red, it's your fault for not warding your bushes/checking it before starting.  There's so much you can do with basically any champ to counter her at lower levels because she's really weak until level 3 in terms of damage. \n\nI'd worry more about Zed with those shop items.

Then, the longer the game goes the easier it will be for her to gapclose onto you. \nAlso, her power budget might be a bit to high, considering the strength of all of her abilities: Passive gives a perfect shield for 1v1 since very little champions have meaningful mixed damage early on and are limited to one damage type. Q is a really strong ability because it scales up to a full true damage low cooldown auto attack with inbuilt triforce timer. W gives ranged poke and some kind of sustain (good thing they removed the minion battery from this). E is a long range gap close skillshot that rewards you with bonus attack speed for hitting a champion and the only danger of this ability is that you throw yourself into the enemy and her R is a guaranteed lockdown on an enemy they can not escape by any mean (assuming there is no TK in the game) while also giving her % current hp magic damage.
