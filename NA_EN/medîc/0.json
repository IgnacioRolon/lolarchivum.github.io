It was fast as hell, being a Sona main, I know her E isn&#039;t that fast, but she could actually get out of Azir&#039;s Q fast. When I checked it, it said 30% + 4 due to AP scaling, at level 1. I remember her E being a time ago 15% movement speed buff to herself and I checked the patch to see if she had got a buff, and she&#039;s not even in the list. Did this slip through, cause the 30/32/34/36/38% (+8%/100 AP) was in the PBE and didn&#039;t make it live. I adore Sona but...when did THIS happen? Found it today after I did the patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-18T18:55:59.484+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":6,"body":"That's not intended, thank you for the notification.
