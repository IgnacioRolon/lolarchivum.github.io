The blue wheel-thingy just keeps on spinning. (alternatively it also sometimes stops spinning after 15 plus minutes and displays \"An Error has occurred while logging in, please try again later.\" Isn't 6 hours late enough? xD)\n\nWhen I close the Alpha client and open the legacy client, login works just fine there.\n\nJust now it even finished fully repairing the Alpha client, but the issue still persists.\n\n\nThe first time I tried it was like 6 hours ago and the issue is still there now.\nI hope someone can help me with this.","replies":[{"poster":"IEatLouis","date":"2016-09-05T17:36:48.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick Update to all the people watching who maybe also have this Issue:\n\nI've been in contact with the people from support for the past week and I've sent them a whole bunch of logs and stuff already.\n\nAt the moment they're analyzing all those and I'm expecting to hear from them again tomorrow or maybe the day after.","replies":[{"poster":"Shockwave656","date":"2016-09-09T11:28:10.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IEatLouis,realm=EUW,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=Uep2WBVR,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-09-05T17:36:48.735+0000)\n>\n> Quick Update to all the people watching who maybe also have this Issue:\n> \n> I&#x27;ve been in contact with the people from support for the past week and I&#x27;ve sent them a whole bunch of logs and stuff already.\n> \n> At the moment they&#x27;re analyzing all those and I&#x27;m expecting to hear from them again tomorrow or maybe the day after.\n\nThats a good news.

We've been trying to reproduce your bug report and we're finding that this particular error is incredibly rare and may be tied to account/computer.  On our side we've been unable to really pin down what exactly is going on without diving a bit deeper into the issue itself.\n\nIn order to triage further, would it be possible to submit a support ticket to player support (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and include all relevant information that you can?\n\nFor example: your summoner name, and if possible include the link to this post so we can tie it back to this specific issue.  \n\nI've spoken with the support team and we're going to attempt to go through appropriate channels to try and deep dive {{champion:111}}  into this issue.
