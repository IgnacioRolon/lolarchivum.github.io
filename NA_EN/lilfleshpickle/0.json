The black screen persists throughout the entire game. I can hear in-game sounds and still alt-tab out, but the black screen is still  there. I've tried reinstalling League and of course, restarting my PC. Is there anything else I can do or is this a bug? Any help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nSpecs: \r\n\r\ni7-6700HQ\r\n\r\nGTX 970M\r\n\r\n1TB HDD, 128GB SSD\r\n\r\n16GB RAM\r\n\r\nWindows 10","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T21:44:03.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time those black screens after the loading screen can be a sign that you might need to update some of your drivers.
