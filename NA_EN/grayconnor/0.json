Insulting players is against the rules. Cussing actually isnt against the rules, so dont be afraid to swear. Idc about your opinion about that, and Im not gonna get into my opinion either. But its important to know what is and isnt against the rules, so there you go. Definitely go read them, or else you may lose your account out of ignorance, which is the dumbest way to go when all the information is available lol.\n\nAlso, think of it like this; each account has a hidden toxicity meter attached to it. You can break the rules and fill that meter up to 80%, not get punished. Another player can break the rules in the exact same way, and get punished because their meter was already at 80% and that offense filled it the rest of the way.
