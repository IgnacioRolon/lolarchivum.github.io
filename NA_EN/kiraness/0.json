I turned vertical sync off in game with uncapped fps and I disabled it in 3d setting in NVidia control panel and I still got this problem. as soon as the game starts I have the fps incapped for like half a second then it comes back to 60.\r\nwhen I installed windows and the NVidia drivers updated and I played league without direct x so i had it stuck in 60. because I thought that directx could be the reason I tried to install it but I couldn't. so I rolled back to a previous version of the NVidia driver so that I can install directx and I worked. but again I still had the problem.\r\nI know that it is not important to have it go greater than 60 but I believe that it is not normal and sometimes I have drops of fps to 6 or 10 in game in the middle of teamfights and sometimes without teamfights and I thought that this could be related to the fact that it is stuck on 60.\r\nis it because I installed directx after installing the game ? is it because the game is maybe running with intel instead of NVidia even if it works with NVidia ( I see it in the NVidia activities ).\r\nThank for all what you can do to help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T02:38:44.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you reset your PC, it's possible that you automatically enabled the *Game DVR* (part of the Game Bar) feature through windows updates.
