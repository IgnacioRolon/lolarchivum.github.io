I cant even remember last time Taric got one. He is an awesome champion and defiantly deserves a new skin. Like maybe a pool party skin or something cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Marcia","date":"2015-08-14T14:57:05.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric isn't going to get a new skin until after his visual update is taken care of because his model is so old and out-dated. I think a pool party skin would be neat on Taric though!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-14T21:08:39.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup! That's correct. He's currently in the process of a pretty big update. Once he gets his new look for his base - we'll be able to give him a new look in terms of skins!","replies":[{"poster":"Garlyle Wilds","date":"2015-08-14T21:27:20.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of Taric skins and getting a reworked base, I *desperately* hope the fuzzy pink leg warmers on Fifth Age are staying.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
