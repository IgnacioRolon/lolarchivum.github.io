The # korean team got KO'd by the last place chinese team. What many dont realize is that many of the players from the top teams in korea last year swapped and are playing in the chinese pro league. the chinese pro league is what was the korean league last year but with EDG and OMG and SHC. Chinese league is insanely strong.\r\n\r\n2) Diana is not a viable mid pick, her mana costs are insane for a melee based champions whos entire kit revolves around landing a mid range odd skillshot, but she just can compete in lane. Maybe riot can do the smart thing and give her some proper mana cost reductions (diana E costs l1/3 her mana bar and all it does is pull/slow hue hue hue) and we can get a bit more diversity in mid.\r\n\r\n3) WE mid crapped all over the best koreans teams mid, then in turn Bergsen crapped on him. Bergson is that good.\r\n\r\n4) EU league is really weak got crushed even the top EU team.\r\n\r\n5) Na region is okay, NA best team tsm can beat the worst chinese league team consistently, but yet they can lose to the worst NA team at times.\r\n\r\n6) Sion TOP is a monster pick specially in the pro scene, he can handle 2v1 no problem and he gets huge tanky, he might not carry games but he will get tanky enough and not get stopped in lane to give you a good shot, the only game WE gave TSM a run was the game they used SION top.\r\n\r\n7) Once again all the derpy kids who called RIP LUCIEN gutted had no clue, this includes the pros who constantly over react to nerfs also, just like they claimed zed was gutted and not viable. Lucien is as strong as ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-03-15T23:40:53.334+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Screw Diana mid, some Asian teams have been taking out the Cho'Gath mid.

As soon as she's in a 'good' spot, she will become as opressive as she was befor the nerfs\n3) Bergsen is good, but not that good, they just left Lissandra open for him alll 3 games(even though he didn't pick her in game one, but they also had problems in game one till WE started to throw), it more shows that liss is that broken(88.9% winrate in na-lcs) \n4) eu is a bit weak, but despite beeing first in standings, i definitly wouldn't call SK the best eu team\n5)yes, na  is ok, currently probably a bit better than eu, but the chinse top teams are far ahead of them\n6) sion top is a good counter to rumble as he can't interupt nor dodge the Q adter eatinf a E, while laking the dps to threaten Sion early on. Thx to his good laneing, he can often scale into tanky beast midgame, but he drops hard(as most tanks) in the late. You could see how tsm easily could ignore him in the later fights, and after the %pen items were finished, he also died damn fast for a kinda fed fulltank. you also saw that his ult is prettymuch a glorified reksai ult, only good to get from a to be, but rarely hitting anyone\n7)lucian isn still viable, but only as last pick. he still has massive problems vs graves in lane, and i wouldn't count him to the top adc, more a comfort or couterpick.\n8) if you plan to play a fulldive comb, secure sivir rather than picking J4 after enemie already picked their jungle and ban janna, or you can aswell go afk from the start. There is no way you can fulldive a janna, especially not with a sivir ult on top, which btew would actually be incredible helpfull for diveing in your team...\n9) point n click hard cc is the way to go, tsm got atleast two pint and click hard CCs in each of hteir games vs WE","replies":[{"poster":"Aranii","date":"2015-03-16T00:56:58.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Don Pavoni,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VgEzZu6O,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-15T22:21:55.311+0000)\n\n> 3) Bergsen is good, but not that good, they just left Lissandra open for him alll 3 games(even though he didn't pick her in game one, but they also had problems in game one till WE started to throw), it more shows that liss is that broken(88.9% winrate in na-lcs) \n\nDid you see his games as Zed and LB in other games in the tournament?

Sion is very strong as a tank yes, but so is Maokai who Dyrus also showed up big on in the final game. Overall yes he does stand out, but not excessively so.\n2. Lucian isn't very strong, he is average. He wasn't gutted, but hes not a priority pick! Hes a generalist with a decent kit, but he doesn't really outclass anyone in anything anymore. He can't match Graves' burst, can't match Kalista's mobility, etc. He may even have been picked in the final match but Turtle didn't carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-03-15T23:34:36.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imma let you finish Vegas Dad, but TSAYM","replies":[]},{"poster":"TannhÃ¤user Gate","date":"2015-03-15T23:33:10.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> the chinese pro league is what was the korean league last year but with EDG and OMG and SHC.
