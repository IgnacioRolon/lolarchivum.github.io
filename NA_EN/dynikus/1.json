Or they just made up nonsense to fill in the gaps and rationalise their way around things. Stereotypes are almost entirely made up by bullshit. \n\nGirls are far less present in video game competition scene simply because they not only have no social culture surrounding it owing to traditional gender roles that discourages them from participating, but also because the gaming culture have been actively pushing them out like the good ol' treehouse business. Stereotypes see nothing of this, it just links the already shallow observation to be the cause itself and goes \"why girls not in game competition? Must because they aren't made to be\" or simply tread into the realm of fiction and fill in the blank by going \"well that's because girls are just naturally and forever bad at games\" and ringing to some pseudoscience if they are bothered enough (but not enough to actually be bothered with reality). By ignoring context entirely, stereotypes are a highly reductionist worldview that is both invalid and high dishonest and thus pointless.\n\nOutside of its pointlessness, many stereotypes are weapons created as political vehicles and have little to no basis in reality. Eastern Asian's stereotypes for instance, have gone from \"hypermusculine\" to \"hyperfeminine\" in a handful of decades and currently exists in this limbo where they simultaneously and somehow only have the worst aspects of both. The \"Jewish nose\" has so little basis in reality that not even 1 quarter of the Jewish population has the said nose nor is it even a unique trait of them. The concept of race has no scientific basis as evident by the fact there is a higher genetic variance WITHIN the so called \"races\" than in-between, and it gets even stupider if you look at how the classification metric have arbitrarily changed from its initial already arbitrary inception over the centuries. The higher crime rates of say, black people in US is often chalked up to their \"nature\" by stereotypes while utterly ignoring historical, social and economical reasons, as well as the very simple fact that a heavy bias exists in the US culture and by extension, the police force where they dedicate a significantly higher amount of resource targeting black criminals which ofc leads to more black criminals arrested but it doesn't mean that blacks are that more likely to be criminals (this is also why despite white and black people smoking weed in roughly the same rate, black people are statistically 3 times more likely to be arrested for it). Etc etc etc.\n\nThen worst of all, stereotypes place the burden of \"prove me wrong\" onto individuals subjected to stereotypes (which as we've already explored, don't bother a single bit with context and is also often created for political purposes with little to 0 basis in reality), effectively charging someone as guilty until proven innocence in social terms. A person has to go out of their way to prove that stereotypes don't apply to them or else they would be seen as nothing but a caricature and not an actual person. Now questions arise, WHY SHOULD someone break a stereotype, THAT YOU CREATED, for your amusement? Why should anyone be required to impress you first before anything? Why should individuals be representatives of those who have the slimmest to no connection with them, and not be representatives of just themselves? And why should the whatever subject chosen as a part of the stereotype, which as discussed often entirely arbitrary, be avoided in the first place, just because you said so? Etc etc.\n\nWhy can't girls just have a team and play in the pro scene, but no instead they have to go somewhere with it to \"prove their worth\"? Does anyone question all the countless all male team failing to make out anything of worth in every single video game competition, and charge them to prove their worth as make gamers? So why is this on the girl gamers?\n\n#If you haven't noticed, the problem with stereotypes is precisely because it's a product of smearing and DOUBLE STANDARD.\n\nThere is no rational reason whatsoever, to even bother with stereotypes.","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-02-12T19:12:08.484+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Questions: And I want straight answers only. \n\nHas a female team/player ever been \"good\" / \"Professional level\" at LoL?\n\nHas a female/team been successful?\n\nWith that how many have tried?

(You can guess)\n\nThat's a loaded question and you know it.\n\nIt's like if you were in the early 1800s in the US and ask \"And I want straight answers only. Has a black person ever been a congressman in USA? Was there a black candidate that was successful? With how many had tried?\" in some random attempt to justify some random highly racist stereotype that existed in that time, despite knowing the answer to all of them was that black people in USA literally didn't even have human rights and were kept as slaves so ofc the figures approach null but it proves absolutely nothing beyond the fuckery of the system and social climate of that time.\n\nThis is the same, or at least similar, for this case too. The straight answer is that \"you're ignoring context\", which I have ALREADY answered and explained in detail in the post you're supposedly replying to. And it's not even like there are absolutely 0 female professional or high elo gamers, I mean hit the twitch stream or do a simple good research or something ffs; just that girls are highly underrepresented in the gaming scene, which is explained via the social expectation and other rooted problems in the gaming social circles that prevent it from occurring. But I guess you can just go \"I wand a straight answer\" and toss out a loaded question and pretend that's it.

If you have evidence that supports otherwise to the answers I'm giving you please share it. \n\nNo\nNo\n10-15\n\nNow...\nActual stereotypes are based solely on the context of what is at hand. A stop light has a stereotype that it WILL have a red light. \nThey generalize things into categories for organization. \n\nAgain Stoplights will have a red/yellow/green light. Nothing prevents them from having a blue orange and purple light, but this is the standard. Imagine if it wasn't. \n\nI would LOVE to see more female pros. One prevention is the existence of gaming homes, which are the go to method to train teams. Can you imagine having a home of males and females? lol. Lawsuits galore. \n\nSo at this point there are possibly some female gamers out there good enough to take on pros, but as it stands with gaming houses alone. It's not possible unless it's ALL female. So no I don't think people are discriminating due to this stereotype, it's more for the legal factors. \n\nEhh... politics suck. Not going to go into this over something non related to female gamers. \n\nNow  that we have established that NO females have been successful in league. We can confidently say that \"All females that have tried to play league have failed.\" Any female from this point forward must PROVE otherwise in order to NOT be consumed by this stereotype and PROVE to everyone that this statement is NO LONGER true. Since ATM it still is.\n\nThat is the only way\n\nLets use a positive and negative example. \n\"Korea wins worlds.\" A sterotype that existed for Koreans and oh boy was it true. Teams like SKT/SSG etc. crushed everyone even the 3rd place Korean teams smashed the competition.\nI HATED this stereotype, but just because I didn't like does not mean it doesn't exist. \nIt was not until China proved them wrong that this stereotype was broken. Even NA shut them down. China had to PROVE this stereotype wrong before it was classified as wrong.\n\nNA sucks internationally. While C9 almost changed this stereotype. Until NA wins worlds or has a more dominate performance. It's still correct. Do I like it? No, but again this does not make it wrong. The Groups one is proven wrong as C9 has made it out twice now. \n\nSo yes, you must PROVE any stereotype wrong. For our basic example. I'm sure you assume based on the stereotype that all lights have a Red light. If I show you that is not the case I have PROVEN it wrong. It's just how logic works here.\n\nYes, people question western teams (all male) all the time. The only reason no one says \"all male teams suck\" is because they are losing to ALL MALE TEAMS. If all Korean teams were all Female and smashing everyone. I'm 99% sure it would be \"Man male teams suck.\"\n\nThere is no double standard. Female teams suck. (Period) Until PROVEN otherwise. And don't misinterpret that I don't like female gamers. I'll be the first person to jump on the bandwagon of an all female team and buy a t-shirt, but the stereotype exist because it's true. It will cease to exist when a female team proves it false. \n\nJust to reiterate one thing. Stereotypes exist for organizational and standardization aspects. People, like with all things, use them maliciously. Stereotypes are not the problem the people abusing them are. Your black example is perfect, people used that stereotype maliciously based on oppressed evidence (black people not being allowed) as a reason to vote for them over another. \n\nThat's just not whats going on here. Most players want the female team to succeed and break the stereotype. No one is oppressing females from joining on the basis \"females suck.\" \n\nThis particular stereotypes does one thing, state a fact. Nothing more.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-02-12T20:40:34.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AIQ,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=Nsx0WJHb,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-12T20:07:54.731+0000)\n>\n> Actual stereotypes are based solely on the context of what is at hand.

Nothing prevents them from having a blue orange and purple light, but this is the standard. Imagine if it wasn't. \n\nNo, it's called a standardisation. The general design of the modern traffic light is almost unchanged from the very first one designed nearly 200 years ago; and traffic light was based on the lights used by rail engineers prior to even that time (if you're clueless, engineers have a LONG history of using colour codes to communicate messages in very concise and fast manner).\n\nAnd I mentioned that \"modern traffic light is ALMOST unchanged from the very first one designed\" because the colour code also evolves over time. I don't need to \"imagine\", because the original and the earlier iterations of the traffic lights do NOT use red(stop)/yellow(caution)/green(go) scheme, and instead it was schemes like red(stop)/green(caution)/white(go) and went through several redesigns over many years by other designers in different implementations before the first implementation of red/yellow/green which also was not widely adopted until even more recent years.\n\nThat being said, traffic light have red light is NOT a stereotype, it is a standard. A stereotype is an oversimplified outlook based on observation. There is no traffic light found in the wild that was observed before the creation of modern traffic lights, traffic lights are DESIGNED to carry red light specifically because the colour has long been used to signal urgency and danger and widely used in sign communication due to the colour's property of being able to travel the longest distance without scatter. Unless you are a child who has 0 concept of the world, having a \"stereotype\" of traffic light is utterly incorrect.\n\n......\n\nThis little example is emblematic of your understanding, or rather lack of understanding, of stereotypes. \n\nBut what's more, that's not even the argument.\n\nThe argument is that stereotypes exist as an expression and enforcement of double standards.\n\nYou refuse to understand why female gamers are barely present in video game competitive scene and laser focus on the \"female\" section instead of the \"why\". You then based on your highly corrupted worldview and challenge female gamers to perform better than male gamers WHILE in an environment and culture that actively puts them down and rejects them, and only upon completing this loaded bullshit trial would you give them the slimmest of your care. That is a very clear case of double standard, and essence of the issue with stereotypes.\n\nAnd THAT is the reason to why I argue against the usage of stereotypes, especially in a social setting.\n\n......\n\nAlso, people like to pretend positive stereotypes are a good thing. They aren't. Because all of them come with a \"kick\" which is the actual main dish of the said stereotype (like how say, Asians supposed are \"good at study, but lack \"\"true learning\"\" and only good at memorisation\" and some utter nonsense). Remember, the point and intended usage of social stereotype is first and foremost, a weapon.\n","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-02-12T21:17:26.412+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol are you so pathetic that you can only refute the traffic light? The example? \n\nFirst off lets reiterate what a stereotype is. \nStereotype: A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing. \n\nThe \"widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea\" of a traffic light IS each light is red/yellow/green. \nIf you can find 10 people out of 1000 and ask them what are is your view on what a traffic lights colors are and they don't say Red/Yellow/Green. Next you need to find me a unicorn. \n\nGuess what you base those standardization are based on? STEREOTYPES! \nWe will make this traffic light red/yellow/Green because \"widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea\" of a Traffic light is that they are these colors. No one is sitting in their factory saying. We should make the standard purple now because we want to break he stereotype that all lights are these colors.\n\nI don't know what the original colors where for lights nor why they changed. Regardless that's not the point. \nyou organized your clothes on the \"widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea\" that shirts go on your torso. (granted you organize your clothes unlike my brother) These generalizations and standardization come from these ideas manifested by stereotypes of what is the standard. \n\n> You refuse to understand why female gamers are barely present in video game competitive scene and laser focus on the \"female\" section instead of the \"why\".\n\nUmm.... I gave you a solid reason. Gaming houses. You cannot put a bunch of young girls and boys in a house to live. It will be a disaster. (Yes that's a stereotype that could be disproven, but I'm sure even you agree with.) Therefore the team must be all female. \n\nWho puts them down? Me? Brah, I want a good all female team so bad. I'd be that crazy guy with their logo plastered on my face.   I want them to succeed. But TSM/Echo Fox/ C9 and anyone else with a gaming house won touch them with a ten foot pole. Since the repercussion would be huge. Or they'd have to provide housing for the females outside of the home, then what's the point of taking on that expense unless she was okay with them taking it from her check. This is just one issue. \n\nSide note: You are a hypocrite since you are using the stereotype that stereotypes are malicious. \n\nLet's sum this up. \n\n1. I want them to succeed. \n2. They are \"held down\" due to legal issues such as gaming homes. \n3. An all female team fixes issues in number 2, but the problem is a lot of the high caliber female players don't play things like jungle. \n4. Stereotypes are essential for human language, standardization, and generalization. \nEdit 4.5 People are the problem not stereotypes. Same thing with guns. Guns don't kill people, people use them to kill people.  \n5. Everyone thinking traffic lights are red/yellow/green is a stereotype ( A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing. ), as this is not always the case I have a blue one in my garage.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-02-12T22:16:05.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AIQ,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=Nsx0WJHb,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-12T21:17:26.412+0000)\n>\n> Guns don't kill people, people use them to kill people.  \n\nAnd this is the usual tired drivel of gun fans when people questions whether guns should be widely available to the public.\n\nThe problem isn't guns, nor people.

He needed to because it was his job that thing he'd get payed for.  Faker needs to win not because he needs to uphold his reputation, it's because it's his job and he'll get fired. The perk of \"I'm the best\" / \"I'm a successfully trans\" are additions. (With perks/pressure) but just that. People handle immense amounts of pressure all the time, with the bonus of benefiting millions that fall into their sub-type. (I'm sure you can think of some) \nSo I brush off that \"boo hoo I couldn't handle it\" yes. I have no need to brush off  \"a rule or principle which is unfairly applied in different ways to different people or groups\" since a rule like \"as a trans you must succeed or suffer\" does not exist in the LCS.   \nEither way again this has little to do with the core subject.

Or rather, stereotype itself is a product of the lack of understanding.\n\nHence why stereotype is pointless, which was outlined in higher detail in my very first post.\n\nAnd other element, the major one, is that social stereotype are instruments used to enforce double standard.\n\n> Gaming houses. You cannot put a bunch of young girls and boys in a house to live. It will be a disaster. (Yes that's a stereotype that could be disproven, but I'm sure even you agree with.) Therefore the team must be all female. \n\nI do not agree. It's a perceived notion of disaster, presumably on the basis of certain culture's tendency to divide and run into conflicts merely for the sake of it, such as on the basis of gender. \n\nThe reality is that there ARE mixed gender team working just fine. Made in Thailand that compete in CSGO is 1 example, or Renegade when they still had Remilia, etc.\n\nThe issue is more about a severe lack of female players in the gaming scene in the first place, which as explained multiple times is a result of social and culture influences, both in and out of gaming community, that discourage or even bully them out of playing, let alone trying to play to compete; and not specific to do with anything male or female related.\n\nThere is a reason why Remilia quit Renegade. She couldn't stand the kind of pressure being put on her as League's first female and transgender professional player in a high stake scene. Simply put, the kind of \"impress me before anything\" rationale is the major reason why female gamers couldn't be bothered with competitive gaming for real. Any nail that sticks out is immediately hammered with extreme laser focus and unrealistically high standard/benchmark and expectation, because you desperately want them to prove you wrong on the stereotype that girls are bad at games which was a false reality born from the ignorance towards the social and cultural reasons why girls are not that into as well as have been pushed out of competitive subjects (especially games) in the first place.\n\nIt's an utter vicious cycle. A hand that feeds itself in a never-ending cycle of being hostile towards non-male gamers without understanding why, which in turn enforces the said hostility. And then you wonder why no girls bother to join the club; well, I wouldn't too, if the instant I walk into a club people expect me to fucking dance like Michael Jackson and sing like Pavarotti as a bare minimum of acknowledgement.\n\nIf you truly want girl gamers to actually go pro and succeed like you say you do. Then just let them play however they want without subjecting them to some ridiculous double standard to \"prove you wrong\" ffs.","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-02-12T22:33:58.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Standardization: the process of making something conform to a **standard**.\nStandard: adjective; **used or ACCEPTED as normal or average**\nStereotype: a widely held ~~  but fixed and oversimplified  ~~   **normal or average** image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.\n\nCome on bro, I don't care about your feelings. You will not con-volute facts because you feel stereotypes are bad. As in your example, they made that the standard based on practical changes. Then it was a widely accepted stereotype. The negative connotation with the word doesn't make it inaccurate. \n\n\nConflicts...i think that's the least of their worries, but I can see where you couldn't detect the primary issue of a bunch of hormone driven sexually active single guys and girls in a house would cause. I'll give you a million dollars if you can fine 10 legal attorney that will support a coed gaming home. Like bro have you been to college, or at least heard about it? It's crazy at the dorms.\n\nFor your examples, The CSGO team had no gaming house, based on my google search. \nRemillia was a male. Just because he is transgender does not disregard his biological origin. He can't say that he was a female because he got breast implants. Also, they still did not have a gaming house. Again this is a legal issue not a \"we just want to keep ladies out\" thing.\n\nCouldn't take the pressure? Sounds like a personal problem. I don't see faker crying about the pressure of being the best. Maybe he does IDK, but he hasn't quit. \n\nVicious cycle? Well until 15+ females successfully become pros and remain such right. Then it's the norm and the stereotype dies. No? Especially if they win worlds or something. \n\nJust like when I root for NA teams. I can root for female teams despite know they have to prove they are good. I'm not a pro. The stereotype for me is that I can't compete with pros, that's true until I prove other wise. It's no different for them. Why should it be? Because they are female?

I'm sure many \"for fun\" teams are created daily, which definitely weren't form on the basis of meritocracy, and they obviously do not perform well, so what of it if this one happen to be all girl players?\n\nEven if they meant to aim high and end up failing, so what? Why should a girl team be tasked with representing not only themselves, but all the other teams with girls in it? And why are they held in a higher standard to receive the lowest of acknowledgement? Can't they just play the game and if they lose, it's just the team is not good enough and that's that (I guess nothing like a good meritocracy with guilt by association, oh wait!)?

Dead last but performing roughly on par is OK, but still not very good. If that's too high of a bar then they need to find better players or they need to practice a lot harder. \n\nWhat glimpse we have from the player's profiles we've found *is* worrying.

We don't know the *peak* ranking of these players, but the highest any of them *finished* last year was Diamond 4, so we can already assume they're skirting the bottom of the requirements. Several of the team members look like they'll be playing roles they rarely play normally. Their Mid looks like she lacks a deep champion pool, maining Kat, but still has more ranked Jungle experience than their Jungler. If what I see on op.gg is correct and I was coach, I'd draft their Mid as Jungle, have their Support play Mid, and have their Jungler play Support, because that'd give the team some roles they're more experienced with.\n\n------\n\nNow, there is a possibility that these players aren't playing all their games on the accounts we've found. These accounts tend to play a lot of Normals, and generally aren't the crazy active I'd expect for players prepping for a pro tournament. Most of the accounts have a pretty big gap in the last few days, which could be explained by alt accounts that they're practicing on.

And it also isn't done by either Oxford, Cambridge, nor Harvard, but by Leeds Beckett University and the University of Missouri last time I checked.\n\nThe research as far as I know, makes ZERO mention, statement, or reaching conclusion of any sort that involves inherent and \"biological\" explanations. It only notes the career disparity observed between the 2 sexes, and makes no attempt looking into their causality due to being out of the scope of their research subject, being whether or not higher national gender equality index results in higher female participants in STEM. The causation could be biological, sociological, and anything in-between, and it's NOT within the scope of the study.\n\nThe study actual conclusion however, finds that women participates in and graduates from STEM in higher percentages in nations with lower national gender equality index because the said nations are usually poorer, making the higher paying and more secure career prospects of STEM more attractive than they would in some welfare states where social security is high regardless.\n\nAnd by being more \"gender equal\", it's measured on the basis of work, health, time, money, knowledge, and power (something like that) as basis for whether the 2 sexes have \"equal power to shape the society\". Because they gotta quantise and measure it somehow. However, what it can not measure, is the degree of social conditioning and the influence of traditional views. A nation can entirely have men and women sport the same accessibility to all work options, same level of health and accessibility to medical attention, same amount of time in work, with the same wage prospects with no gendered pay gap, same level of access to education, and holding the same political and social power, or at least roughly equal in most of those regards (remember, it doesn't have to have the full mark to be #1, it just needs to have a higher mark than others), and still be rife with traditional views influencing people's career path and personal choices. Having higher securities, accessibility, options, etc doesn't mean social stigma, expectations, and pressure would cease to exist. If anything \"gender equality index\" measures the gender equality of government and policy makers given it's what the index is directly measuring, and less about measuring the given society and its culture.\n\nIn the end of the day, none of this proves anything \"biological\". You invented this part from a study that's only tangentially related but was about something else that was only interested in discerning SPECIFICALLY why nations with lower gender equality index (that doesn't measure cultural equality as explained) has higher women pursuing STEM subjects than the otherwise.\n\nThe study I raised does a far better job at showcasing the cultural aspect in action over the supposed biological factors. Because it's what the study was interested in researching, unlike this study which was about something else.\n\n.........\n\nLastly, you're using a fundamentalist talking point of what a religious person is supposed to be with your \"there's really not a lot of true believers left [...] yes you can say that Europe and USA are christian and say that this is 1 billion christians but how many of them are really believers\".\n\nNo, if someone identifies as a religious person and a part of a given religion group, for all its worth, that's all it needs to say someone is religious. No one needs to pass a test in religion to be acknowledged as being religious.\n\nThe real hypocrisy is denying someone's religion because you think they aren't religious enough, not someone identified as religious being counted as so.\n\nYou might have a bit more ground if you were to question the reliability of the total number of Muslims instead, given afaik some Middle Eastern government for whatever reason has a tendency to default newborns as Muslims on their identity paper and stuff to that nature, so you might make the argument and claim that offsets the population count of Muslims to some extent. But still in the end of the day, it still wouldn't change the fact a majority of the people in this world are directly religious, and more if we're also including ones being culturally religious (isn't directly religious, but have ideals influenced by it) which is kinda everywhere.\n\nAnd, I only bring the religions into this not only because the influences of the largest religions can be found in a good majority of all human population but also because the largest religions all have gendered worldview as per the relics of previous eras (the same reason why I bring up the term \"traditional view\"), and would inevitably either overly or covertly raise their children with those cultural and social biases either in the conscious or subconscious mind.\n\n.........\n\nFinally, if Sweden has any \"crazy ideologies\" and for some reason undesirable to live in, it would be because it's a culturally deeply and insanely racist nation on par to even the more socially troubled developing nations despite being one of the most developed, that continues to deny it and make up nonsense trying to justify it. Sweden is only \"\"pc\"\" in their self-promotion propaganda.\n\n\"\"\"PC\"\"\" is also just a dumb word anyway. It's only a word used today because many people have no idea how oppressive the governments and how heavy the social stigma/consequences for every trivial things were even in the freest of states just a couple years prior. These people are just nostalgic for a supposed better time period that never really existed, or at least obviously nowhere near the level of \"cool\" they think it was.\n\nIf I would rather anything, I'd rather live in a time of today where say, transgenders are finally recognised (which has ample both scientific and simple social decency reason for their acknowledgement, just that people selectively ignore and diss sensibility, evidences and studies when it's on the topic and outcome they don't like; business as usual), and not in a time and place where even Monty Python can somehow ended up getting banned for nearly 30 years and well into the late 2000s, or in 1940s where even children's cartoon were insanely racist, or in the 80s and 90s where people die to HIV like flies like some fucking plague because governments convinced themselves that HIV only affect gay people (which is completely false) and utterly refused to treat the state-emergency epidemic for a decade.","replies":[{"poster":"HàrrowR","date":"2019-02-15T23:35:14.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=Nsx0WJHb,comment-id=00000000000000000002000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-14T16:28:52.075+0000)\n>\n> No, that study does not prove male and female \"biologically\" have different interests which leads to different hobbies. \n> \n\nWhy dont you just watch the damn documentary before making a 2000 page essay.\nIts funny how you see what you want to see, the point of the documentary is that in a free and egalitarian country with tons of government backed incentives for woman to go into STEM they mostly opt out of it and choose HR, teaching or a career in medicine, how you managed to turn this around into a cultural thing beats me.\n\nI really couldnt be bothered to read all of your comments, \"If I would rather anything, I'd rather live in a time of today where say, transgenders are finally recognised (which has ample both scientific and simple social decency reason for their acknowledgement\" but this caught my eye.\n\nWhy do people get so obsessed about transgeder issues when they make up maybe a 0.01% of the population is beyond me, the only reason SJWS like you focus on it so much is cause its linked to gender and sexual orientation, you know, the BASIS OF EVERYTHING in your universe.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, you'd be better off arguing for better ways to help and treat people with disabilities, there's blind,deaf,mute,handicaped people in the world and your side of the aisle is busy fighting for gender neutral bathrooms, just piss where you want there's fucking people in a wheelchair that can't go to places cause the damn building doesn't have a proper ramp .","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-02-16T11:17:57.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read about the study you mentioned and made a full assessment of the situation and raised counterarguments.

All it does is showing it exists, and that it can be influenced based on circumstantial outlooks, and never went into explaining the beginning of the universe (in this case, why the difference exists) and focused on how it changes based on different circumstance.\n\nYou see the drift?\n\nUltimately, that bit with the \"biological\" was a tangent made by yourself on a research that is only loosely connected due to the mere subject matter involving male and female career choices. And really, as you can see with that analogy, just as it is dumb to say male and female dietary difference is mostly or entirely innate given we know for a fact it's mostly socially driven, it's equally dumb to say career choices between male and female is ultimately intrinsic to one's biological sex.\n\n........\n\nWhen you defend it and say \"tons of government backed incentives\" in the richer, more egalitarian nations... No, there isn't. The only real incentive in that setting is if they want to be the \"STEM grill\" and be worshiped by the mass media, and if they want to use the benefits of affirmative action that reduces systematic sexism but has the perverse effect of strengthening the social sexism because that's just how reactionary politics work.\n\nOf course the \"\"\"\"incentive\"\"\"\" outlined above is absolutely dwarfed in comparison to the one in a poor nations where the incentive is for a chance at a better and more secured life in a shitty ass cut-throat environment. \n\nSo why are you even wondering why girls, or people in general, in poorer nations have higher incentives to go into STEMs than girls in the richer, economically well-off nations?\n\nIf I were to make any personal conclusion out of this: It's not that egalitarian nations are actually that much more gender equal in the grand scheme of things ESPECIALLY socially, or that women just has a \"biological\" thing towards non-STEM whatever. It's ultimately just that because more economically free nations have much more security in any and all career options, girls just couldn't be bothered with challenging the industries traditionally dominated by another sex (any industry traditionally dominated by a single sex is bound to be extremely sexist as a part of their industry culture) due to the lack of necessary incentive requiring them to try and swim up the waterfall; meanwhile those who live in poor nations with most career options lacking any forms of security and prospect, has this incentive to be there in spite of the possibly of being discriminated on the basis of sex, for instance.\n\n........\n\nNot to mention, if you look at any other \"government backed incentives\" in other industry for a change of pace, you'd quickly realise how bad the argument of bridging it to talk the supposed \"biological\" factor is in the first place. Let's take a look at another hot topic: Teaching.\n\nFor many parts of the 'west' (or at least within the American-sphere), there is a big shortage of young teachers in that the amount of young individuals pursuing the career of teaching is now at a historic low. And out of this already sort of alarming situation, the amount of young and male would-be teacher-in-practice is even lower, and almost completely absent in areas of primary schools.\n\nAre there government back incentives trying to attract men into the teaching field? Well, there are. There are male-only scholarships and even affirmative action quotas to put a benchmark for male teachers (and funny that you don't hear girls complain about that). The talk is especially real around Australia where I reside, I'd imagine it's about the same in US too given Australia is super Americanised and together shares a few of its social problems.\n\nSo why is the number of male teachers still so low? Could it be because men are just \"biologically\" different than women and innately not interested in teaching? Or is it more likely because of the kind of social conditioning we bring the children up with as well as the kind of culture within the teaching industry that is hostile to and thus pushes out men from the position and interest in pursuing it? \n\nI'm sure you know the answer already. And yes, it's the same for STEM.\n\n........\n\nWhat's more, equating legal and certain degree of social egalitarianism to complete and absolute social and cultural equality is just not paying attention. \n\nSince when there exists even a single nation in this world where both sexes are socially and culturally viewed as entirely equal? Tell me about it, because it'd be interested to hear about a nation where men and women are BOTH socially encouraged to seek help when in trouble and to rely on others, to solve problems preferably on your own as much as possible; to outwardly express their emotions, to bottle it up or to dismiss emotions; be expected to be pretty at all times, to be useful above all else; to aim to be high achievers, to aim to be helpful and cooperative supporter; to be the breadwinner of the household, to be the child carer of the household; to be aggressive and thrill seeking, to be reserved and cooperative; to be proud of being sexually active and sleep with many people, and to be chaste and be not as sexually active or at least don't tell people about it; etc etc. Tell me about a nation with a culture where both men and women are raised with absolutely no gendered bias/worldview whatsoever?\n\nLast time I checked, men can't even hold hands in public without being seen as gay while girls can do all sorts of intimate actions with each other barring sex and be doing just \"girls things\". The hell are you on about claiming that \"free and egalitarian country\" are actually \"free and egalitarian\" literally? Gendered beliefs and outlook definitely don't exist in the egalitarian countries, amirite? As I had said, the measures for the 'gender egalitarian index' are often overly materialistic and ultimately is just a measure of government policies and at the very most just the beliefs of the policy makers, rather than the actual prevalent culture in which the nation exists in and lived by the general public. And it's just dumb to assume the \"egalitarian nations\" actually just means literally the nation is entirely egalitarian not only in policies but also even the fundamental beliefs and worldview of its culture and most to all of its inhabitants. \n\nIt takes a special kind of ignorance to utterly believe in the absence of social factors and jump straight into \"innate\" explanations before anything else.\n\n........\n\nAlso, you spent half of your post whining about the trans bit I brought up as a part of a COMPARISON to illustrate a point, while ignoring the said point entirely. That's missing the point entirely.\n\nI only brought it up because you were whinging about \"\"\"pc\"\"\" (which let's not play the fool, trans right is usually classified by reactionary individuals and fellas like you to be a part of the \"\"\"pc\"\"\"), and moaning about how bad it is. And the comparison I made is to draw a parallel between today where you whine about trans rights like the worst thing ever, in comparison to the \"\"\"less pc\"\"\" times when countless people literally died because the government refuses to treat people in an actual state-emergency epidemic because of some actually stupid agenda. Sorry and no offence, but I'd rather \"\"\"pc\"\"\" times than not. \n\nBut it doesn't matter, you just saw \"trans\" and then went off the tangent again. I did sort of anticipate this, actually; call it a masterful bait on my part, but I did put it out in that comparison specifically to see if you'd rather blast off the orbit with the first item of the comparison and ignore the actual comparison itself entirely. Well, it pays off. How does it feel, that you realise you're actually the one moaning about something that don't matter at all because you miss the actual argument entirely?\n\nAnd no, respecting trans right doesn't mean ignoring others in need such as the disabled. I always love (sarcastically) people who treat things as 0 sum game of 1 or the other. No, all it is about is caring 1 ADDITIONAL group that is socially disadvantaged. And it doesn't matter in number, if there are only 0.001% who are physically handicapped, they would still be cared for just as much; the same goes for trans. At least disabled people \"\"\"only\"\"\" (and I use it loosely) suffer from lost of dignity if they don't get a bathroom they can use and things like job discrimination, meanwhile trans also deal with that as well as being the victim of trans hate crimes of being assaulted or even killed. That thing you spewed ultimately stems from the central belief that trans is \"lesser\" and is of less or even no importance to care, which is the problem itself.\n\n........\n\nLast but not least, you have yet to actually counter-argue the research I brought up earlier that definitively shows existence of social condition influencing one's psyche and decision making which directly contradict and disproves your claim of \"biological\" factors.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HàrrowR","date":"2019-02-14T01:00:40.342+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=Nsx0WJHb,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-02-12T18:00:29.901+0000)\n>\n> The fact some people have to break stereotypes is unfair in and of itself.\n> \n> You can make up stereotypes for basically any and everything and then have the audacity to demand the targets of those \"\"stereotypes\"\" to exert extra effort over complete nothing just to show you that they're an actual human and not a caricature that you MADE FOR YOURSELF.\n> \n> If I get insulted by some rando on the street, I am in no obligation to prove that their insult is incorrect nor would anyone say that I am assumed lesser just because I don't bother with the insult.
