The price was up for about 20 minutes, during which, some players bought the Blood Moon Capsules with BE.\n\nTo ensure fairness, the technician team reverted all the Blood Moon Capsules purchased with BE, including skins, related skins, gemstones, and (I&#039;m not sure what &quot;crystal fragments&quot; are) were removed from accounts.\n\nIn the future, some mreasures will be implemented to prevent similar incidents from happening.\n\nBest regards!\"","replies":[]}
