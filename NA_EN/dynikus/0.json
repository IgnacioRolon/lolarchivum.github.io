It makes sense and it still works. So we gotta spread the knowledge so people stop hating on Boob plate, cause there isn't a reason to.\nI can't repeat this to everyone who is hating this design a lot, but I don't like pointless design as much as the next person, especially if it was a pointlessly sexy design (Glaring at you Kai'sa, they WILL rework her is some way cause a lot of things about her are inconsistent). But I am really not seeing sexuality being a focus with this Kayle design  that everyone is stuck on. The design is MUCH more focused on just how much POWER this angel radiates. I think a lot of people have just become really sensitive to this topic due to riots past missteps, like Kai'sa's near complete failure of a design, i think that was a catalyst that is really coloring people's judgments right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Glaricion","date":"2019-02-20T22:40:34.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that Kayle's case speaks for herself, almost genderless Samus-esque design at first, rework's armour is so 'clingy' as for people to see it as a bodysuit w/ a potential 'belly button' on it.

But the old design wasn't almost genderless or like Samus, she had boobplate then too and that is quite telling of the gender. So actually in terms of function the new breastplate if we use this videos logic is much better than 2 separate dome style boob plate\n\n> [Here's another one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZJGvLF8tEU)\n> \n> Opposite view, might want to skip a bit.\n> Professional armourer, but he made an error about \"only 2 historical examples of female armour\" so who knows.\n\n> Then again, Shad compared the access to the waist to vital organs consistently flanked by the arms (depending on the stance)\n\nNot from the front tho, if attacking the front, Shad is correct do compare the waist dip to the boob plate dip.

The new armor has one solid ovate dome, so this is boob plate that is stated to be more effective if we combine Shad's and ur new video","replies":[{"poster":"Glaricion","date":"2019-02-21T04:05:34.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">But the old design wasn't almost genderless or like Samus, she had boobplate then too and that is quite telling of the gender. \n\nDepends on the angle.\nAt [this angle](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/league-of-legends/1/15/Kayle_lol.jpg?width=640) there is a definite separation of the breast area.

Could be a shield/cushion/deflection effect rather than a 'magnet' one and be more useful (would think there'd be more domes on male armour in that case rather than the case being [rare, and a bit flat when done](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OVR-LJaKk7SikGvGbCivM-ofpvU=/0x0:3000x2000/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2000):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3933644/cuirass.jpg)), but would need a Mythbusters episode to confirm, and would still hate the aesthetic of it (not as unsightly as the male equivalent though).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gay7Deer","date":"2019-02-21T00:02:35.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"edit: i just wana say thanks for being reasonable!
