Not that low that we only see 24/7 farming jungle champs again but at least lower than it is right now so the jungler needs to worry about beeing efficient in ganks and farming. \r\nIf a gank is succesful it still is rewarded (with kill or the enemy needs to use summoners or needs to back etc.) but if this isnt the case the jungler should be punished for that (for example by loosing farm to enemy jungler etc.) so he/she needs to worry more about if the gank is really worth it or not and it just doesnt feel like that right now imo.\r\n\r\nIm also curious how other players feel about that and tell me if you would agree/disagree and why.\r\n\r\nPS: Only giving MY OWN opinion on the state of junglers right now so pls dont get offended\r\nPPS: English is not my first language so... forgive the grammar mistakes","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-04-16T23:54:22.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really confused.

Your jungler should be taking advantage of that to get the rest of the team ahead.\n\nIf they aren't, that's a skill issue your jungler needs to work out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheWoollyMammoth","date":"2018-04-16T23:40:16.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lower gold value and increasing respawn rate of jungle camps will completely screw counter jungling. its like lowering experience per camp and then cranking up the spawn rate. Completely dicks any aggressive counter jungle play. \n\nMake camps do increased damage and keep the respawn time the same while lowering the general damage in the game. Better yet, Make them deal more damage, take less, and keep the spawn times the same. Then cut the catch up experience in half. Or put it on only major buffs and epic monsters. \n\nIncrease the value of the camps to junglers alone, and the time it takes to clear them. If stealing red buff and wraiths (THEY WILL ALWAYS BE WRAITHS TO ME!!)  from the enemy jungler puts them more noticeably behind. They will put more value into guarding the camps, and will be more hesitant to leave them to gank. If they gank and I steal it. It will hurt them deeply in levels until the next buff comes up. \n\nThis runs the risk of a snowball problem. BUT its better then invading doing absolutely nothing to actually set the jungler behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WidestSet7","date":"2018-04-16T19:57:55.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I play jungle a lot and there is that balance of you need to farm and gank right and if you don't you lose gold.

Also jungling is hugely effected by the champ. A jungler like lee sin is gonna be able to clear early game way faster than an ekko. And some champs like kayn are forced to gank so you cant focus on farm as much.\n\nKayn actually should be balancing this more than any champ. With his E and very very good aoe JG clear that he has, he can counter JG super safely and quickly, which is what happens often in higher play. But he also needs to be ganking early as well for those passive souls (are they souls he collects for his 2 forms? Idk ðŸ¤” ). And Riot even buffed the amount he gets early. So balancing ganks and farming is super important on Kayn.\nAs for the whole faster respawn argument I see a lot, I'll say this: Do you like Shyvana meta? Because I guarantee you no matter how small the amount is lowered, it'll be a big buff to champs like Shyvana. Because suddenly they'll have a lot more gold and XP than before. You'll be farming your lane perfectly fine then a Shyvana that's outfarmed you comes in 2 levels higher and wrecks you.\nAlthough I do acknowledge your idea of lowering the gold. But be careful on how much, because it still has to be worth putting time into it. Otherwise gank-heavy junglers or tank junglers will become the meta as gankers can make up the gold in kills, and Tanks just simply don't need a lot of gold to do their job. \nBalancing the jungle seems like such an impossible task, I don't envy Riot's position.\n\nI like that you're trying to offer solutions instead of just pointing out the problem though, good on you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xShiNjiNx","date":"2018-04-16T19:57:52.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something I just recently suggested in my post as well was this lol","replies":[]}]}
