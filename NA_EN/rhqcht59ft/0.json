They tried to do that. You end up with boring lore like Trundle the Ice Troll just so he can have a faction during the Freljord lore stretch. The old Trundle (as best as I can remember it) was a paragon to his people, a race that suffered from a curse that made them hideous. All suffered this fate for generations except Trundle with his extraordinary regenerative properties. He volunteers to have a witch doctor concentrate the entire village curse into himself, and carries the burden alone; his flesh constantly rotting off and rebuilding anew, only to rot away again. I think he enters the League of Legends in hopes to learn how to remove the curse entirely.\n\nFar better than \"I'm an ice troll and I'm going to follow this evil lady because she promises me a shiny club to bash my foes in.\" They took a true \"champion\" of a character and made him a goon. \n\nI liked the old formula for making champion lore.\n\nXXX was a ------- who was known for -------.

I always say it's been a hectic few weeks as we're a busy bunch of folks. And that's the part that can be confusing, and annoying, due to the expectations we have not met. Frankly, Saturday nights are currently the time I'm most able to sit down and put together a semi-cogent response on here. My apologies for that.\n\nTo help with clarity, and for a common place to start from, I'll reiterate what I've said elsewhere on the board when it comes to a misunderstanding of what Narrative is. \n\nAt Riot we work from a matrixed concept of Disciplines and Product Teams. Disciplines are made up of people of a distinctive craft. Product Teams are made up of people from various disciplines (crafts) who work together to make something. This thing may be to make something for purely external means or to go to the players. Product team does not mean \"thing to sell.\" It can be something that players pay for or not. It can be something made to go to players, or not.\n\nWith that in mind, this is what Narrative is: We are a distinct discipline made up of people who are focused on the development of characters and stories through ideation and writing. We help ensure thematic cohesion on various products, develop archetypes and personalities, and we help solve creative problems using character, story, and world building. We also write stories because we pretty much love to. You haven't seen enough of them. Yet. There are numerous reasons for this that we are working to solve. In this case, \"we\" means Riot.\n\nWe employ our craft on various Product Teams. For example, on League of Legends, we have Narrative Writers who work on Champion Team, Champion Update, Events, Promo and beyond. On Champion Team, the Narrative Writers spend a lot of time being part of the creative teamwork, in conjunction with a lot of other disciplines, in making new, exciting Champions that are thought out down to a molecular level when it comes to their identity. \n\nAs you cited Ekko, I'll talk to him in particular.\n\nFrom a Narrative standpoint, FauxSchizzle was the principal Narrative writer working on the Ekko Champion team with a large number of people from different disciplines (Art, Game Design etc.). He helped with concepting the character's personality with the team, including writing story sketches (think of them as concept story, you'll likely be seeing an example of this pretty soon) that helped everyone get a clear picture of who the Champion is.\n\nTaking a Champion from ideation, through production, to release is a very taxing, involved job due to wanting to make the best Champion possible each and every time. That's the same for artists, designers and writers of various specializations. \n\nFaux was also the principal writer on Seconds (Ekko's animation) and Chronobreak (his comic).  On all of his work, from concepting to launch, Faux received support from various members of Narrative in the form of edits, feedback and writers room sessions. No matter what the team is, we support each other in our work, because that's what makes us Narrative and Rioters.\n\nEkko was one of three champions that Faux has been working on.\n\nThe reason I'm outlining this is to clarify and dispute one assertion: Lore team isn't doing anything. \n\nFirstly, Narrative isn't a \"lore team,\" as the above explanation may help clarify. What we have been doing is working on a variety of Product Teams that make a multitude of things for players. We are more than busy in doing so, hence we have been pushing very hard to hire more superb writers to join us. \n\nThe short character intros are developed by Narrative as part of the work done for Champion Team, or Champion Update.\n\nThey are Narrative's direct responsibility on those teams, and I will say that we have heard you and others very clearly on your displeasure with the shorter introductions to the Champion. The fact is, they have always been intended as a quick overview for folks who don't want to hit a wall of text in the client, particularly in a format that was very inflexible for us. The plan was to release short intros and then have longer stories on the website.\n\nThen, when initially trying to implement this, we discovered a technical issue made it impossible to do so. We didn't think it would take long to fix. \n\nWe were wrong.\n\nThankfully, it seems we have finally got a solution in place and you'll be seeing the fruits of that development within the next month when we'll be releasing some stuff (stuff = things I can't spoil) that will take advantage of the new tech capability.\n\nWhile we have been waiting to sort these issues out, it's given us the time to look at our content goals. Much of that desire to question our direction for the specific intros/bios/stories (as they have been in various iterations), has been due to the consternation expressed on these boards. We led an effort to try and drive on short stories to go along with those character intros. When we saw the vocal assertion that something like the old bio format would still be welcome even with those stories, we took another look at what we were doing.\n\nWe anted something that gave the meat of certain details of the old bios, while still feeling current and not creating a sense of that Champion's life being static.\n\nAnt in Oz pitched a format that makes a lot of sense and it's currently going through fine tuning. To give you an idea though, it's the current introductory paragraph, followed by a background or bio section with some details and story hooks to stimulate understanding and conversation, followed by a quick story that shows the Champion being who they are. They are certainly more in-depth than the current intros and I'm confident of their quality.\n\nWe've formed an impromptu team of Narrative folks doing some extra hours to start formalizing a process, discussing character pitches and then getting them written. We're prioritizing them based on the needs of Product Teams as well as how broken they are. For example, Singed is one that I've personally put an outline together for. I won't talk about the others due to spoilers.\n\nI understand the overall frustration completely. We're working on moving things in a much more satisfactory direction than has been the case in the last couple of years, but this will never be a case of Narrative deciding to do things on its own, we always work within Product Teams and the priorities are made by Riot as a whole and then within those teams.\n\nWe take our specific responsibility very seriously though. As a discipline we need to do better, and I think folks we've brought on like FauxSchizzle are helping us do that. We try to put as much story as we can into everything we do as we are storytellers by trade and by passion. Story isn't the main product of every team we work on, however.\n\nSo while I understand that it is, at times, difficult to pick out Narrative's work from within things made by teams (if we're doing it right, you won't be able to for much of the time), please don't mistake that for us not doing anything.\n\nThat simply is not true.\n\nI get a bit protective of Narrative as it's my day-to-day responsibility to ensure we are meeting the needs of Riot's many teams, so I have to rein in my urge to leap to their defense each time we are said to be doing nothing. I stop myself because though the details might not always be accurate, the overall sense of being let down, of not having enough prepared and in place after the reset blog announcement, is utterly valid.\n\nThe difference comes from perspective. I know precisely how hard the members of Narrative work. I know how many hours Faux and numerous others (including those not on Narrative) put in to make Ekko as a Champion, Seconds as an animation, and Chronobreak as a comic, the best they could be. It's no small effort.\n\nI know until the content that you desire is available to you, it's difficult to see what it is that we're actually doing. I hope this post at least gives you a little insight into how things are.\n\nSorry for the long post, I hope I kept it at least mainly coherent, but I'm a bit knackered.\n\nThese posts bother me constantly and are in the back of my mind every day.  It's not because of the sometimes unfortunate tone, it's because of the underlying truth. We need to not just tell you how we're trying to get better at putting things in your hand, we need to put them in your hand.\n\nI'm very excited for the next month or so.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-06-21T06:17:08.997+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":40,"body":"Let's hope you aren't making ANOTHER broken promise now.\n\nLike you said, you have ONE MONTH to put something forward.

Anyway...\nTo give you some idea on our thinking, as I've seen this topic brought up a number of times, there's a danger that we have to think about with characters regarding making the world feel small: If Ekko is from the streets of Zaun, does that automatically mean he is close to Vi? If so, it makes it feel like Zaun has one neighborhood.  It makes Zaun feel small. Instinctively, having Champions all know each other and have direct ties with each other seems like a great thing because then you constantly have bigger stories. The problem being, if they're constantly bigger stories they're actually not that big. \n\nIt's the Syndrome of The Incredibles, ermm, syndrome. If everyone is special, no one is.\n\nOf course, some Champions are very strongly tied to each other—Garen and Lux never seeing each other would be crazy. However, we are very careful with those relationships because as soon as you start making everyone know each other, the world becomes incredibly small.\n\nLet me use the example of a movie. I don't mean to throw shade here (OK, there's an expression I can't pull off), but one of the things that bugged me about Amazing Spider-Man 2 (one of the things) was that by the end of the film, its entire universe of story, all of the main character's conflicts, were born from one source and from one place. You could tell every conflict from one office building because that's where Peter Parker got his powers, where his (spoilers) deceased girlfriend worked, where his childhood friend turned nemesis was centered, and where all of his rogues gallery got their powers from. It made Spider-Man's world atomically small.\n\nWe want Champions to interact because they are ideally suited for conflict with each other. They are given the time and space to develop their own stories and motivations, and then when they cross paths, those conflicts should highlight their similarities and differences very clearly. \n\nThose times should feel really special. If every story we tell contains a lot of Champions because they are all so inextricably linked it would be crazy not to, then the grandeur of those stories is diminished in the blink of an eye.\n\nHaving a lot of Champions who know each other to begin with makes the world smaller. It also takes away the opportunity to tell the stories of them meeting in a way that feels special.\n\nThat doesn't mean we don't want them to interact. In some ways, Kat and Garen makes no sense at all. And those reaons are why, in my opinion, it makes them perfect for each other. Their Romeo and Juliet element (without all of the naive kids who haven't a clue what they're doing stuff), adds huge stakes to any relationship they have. Those stakes can spiral out to their friends, family and their entire countries. It's a relationship that could provide a new perspective for Demacia and Noxus on each other, or it could spark the end of all things.\n\nThose are the kinds of conflicts we want to focus on. \n\nJust because Champions, such as Ekko, Jinx and Vi, aren't living in each other's pockets, doesn't mean they'll never cross paths. In fact, Vi's past and how that would effect her view of Ekko, and vice versa, is hugely fertile ground that I'd love to get into. But we want to do it because of character motivation and the opportunity for story. It's all there without them having to have run around together.\n\nWe can have those conflicts because of who each Champion is without putting them all together and making the world feel smaller at the same time.\n\nWe can have our cake and eat it.\n\nGreat, now I'm hungry.\n\nAnyway, I hope that makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2015-06-21T18:25:29.836+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=khkWEbWQ,comment-id=005b0000000000050000,timestamp=2015-06-21T17:23:20.279+0000)\n>\n> Jinx and Vi aren't in their 30s, but they're also not part of Ekko's group or age. \n> Firstly, Zaun isn't a small place.

If everyone is special, no one is.\n> \n> Of course, some Champions are very strongly tied to each other—Garen and Lux never seeing each other would be crazy. However, we are very careful with those relationships because as soon as you start making everyone know each other, the world becomes incredibly small.\n> \n> Let me use the example of a movie. I don't mean to throw shade here (OK, there's an expression I can't pull off), but one of the things that bugged me about Amazing Spider-Man 2 (one of the things) was that by the end of the film, its entire universe of story, all of the main character's conflicts, were born from one source and from one place. You could tell every conflict from one office building because that's where Peter Parker got his powers, where his (spoilers) deceased girlfriend worked, where his childhood friend turned nemesis was centered, and where all of his rogues gallery got their powers from. It made Spider-Man's world atomically small.\n> \n> We want Champions to interact because they are ideally suited for conflict with each other. They are given the time and space to develop their own stories and motivations, and then when they cross paths, those conflicts should highlight their similarities and differences very clearly. \n> \n> Those times should feel really special. If every story we tell contains a lot of Champions because they are all so inextricably linked it would be crazy not to, then the grandeur of those stories is diminished in the blink of an eye.\n> \n> Having a lot of Champions who know each other to begin with makes the world smaller. It also takes away the opportunity to tell the stories of them meeting in a way that feels special.\n> \n> That doesn't mean we don't want them to interact. In some ways, Kat and Garen makes no sense at all. And those reaons are why, in my opinion, it makes them perfect for each other. Their Romeo and Juliet element (without all of the naive kids who haven't a clue what they're doing stuff), adds huge stakes to any relationship they have. Those stakes can spiral out to their friends, family and their entire countries. It's a relationship that could provide a new perspective for Demacia and Noxus on each other, or it could spark the end of all things.\n> \n> Those are the kinds of conflicts we want to focus on. \n> \n> Just because Champions, such as Ekko, Jinx and Vi, aren't living in each other's pockets, doesn't mean they'll never cross paths. In fact, Vi's past and how that would effect her view of Ekko, and vice versa, is hugely fertile ground that I'd love to get into. But we want to do it because of character motivation and the opportunity for story. It's all there without them having to have run around together.\n> \n> We can have those conflicts because of who each Champion is without putting them all together and making the world feel smaller at the same time.\n> \n> We can have our cake and eat it.\n> \n> Great, now I'm hungry.\n> \n> Anyway, I hope that makes sense.\n\nHonestly, no, it doesn't make sense. \n\nThe world of the elite and powerful *is* small - and that's what most of the champs in LoL are - elite and powerful figures. The Demacian roster of champs is basically the court elite - they should be constantly interacting. Interactions, even non-direct, used to be done nicely - I thought Rengar's presence in Gnar's story was really nice. Of course not everyone needs to be incredibly interactive with other champs, but you've pushed the pendulum so far in the other direction that the world feels bad. **You go out of your way to avoid any interaction at all to the point of emphasizing the generic.** This push to isolate characters hurts their stories, it doesn't help them. I don't care if Bard exists or not. Why should I? You have given me no way to connect directly with him because the lore/video is so ~mysterious~ for the sake of being mysterious. You have given me no way to connect indirectly with him because the lore/video contains absolutely nothing linking him to Runeterra. None of this has to be so blatant as having characters directly interact but the presence of other characters in the world *has* to be acknowledged for Runeterra to actually feel like a world instead of an anthology. We don't want lore to be an anthology, we want a world. **We don't get lore with any kind of regularity to wait for you to feel like ~the time is right~ for an Ekko-Jinx interaction.

That would probably take *years*.** There is no reason for us to think that you would ever follow through on such an approach.\n\nI agree with you completely on your assessment of Demacian champions. That's exactly how those relationships are built. We will have some Champions who interact with each other regularly in a situation that is personal to them. It's the same with the Du Couteaus. It's just we won't have that for all of our Champions from the moment they exist. For some, their relationships with other champions will grow and they will interact when it makes for the best stories.\n\nAlso, we will broaden our supporting cast of non-Champion characters to develop relationships with.\n\nRengar's involvement with Gnar occurred because it made sense (writing first person on Gnar is tricky as hell, plus Rengar's self-important view of his prowess makes a good foil for the little/monstrously huge fella). We'll have those interactions when we feel it's the strongest option.\n\nWe don't create those interactions in the belief that they inherently make the character we are introducing stronger. They actually distract from the character more often than not, but this is all through the lens of the Champion's launch.\n\nUntil we give content that shows that these Champions do interact, I see how wanting to have them do so when you first see them is very powerful. Frankly, I agree that some players are worried that if it doesn't happen there, it won't happen at all.\n\nFor example, Batman didn't need Superman to be the character he is. Batman and Superman stories can be really cool because of who they are as individual characters.\n\nRight now, much of the content we have been providing is the opening chapter of one character's personal story. Having other Champions can, at times, detract from getting a good handle on who that character is.\n\nYou state that we have avoided some of those interactions to drive towards the generic. In fact we do that to drive towards the individual character. The strength of that character will decide if that experience is good enough. If the character is not strong enough, putting him or her next to a stronger character won't solve that problem at all.\n\nAgain that is all in the specific arena of the initial launch of a character. \n\nWe absolutely need to show the differences and strengths of the characters by having them bounce off each other. We haven't done enough of that yet to show how special that needs to be to have a truly vibrant world. That we have close-knit characters in certain places and situations because it strengthens that part of our world, but also Champions that affect their immediate vicinity in ways unique to them.\n\nIt's our responsibility to deliver on that promise and we haven't done a good enough job yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-06-21T22:49:37.739+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":">Right now, much of the content we have been providing is the opening chapter of one character's personal story.\n\nSo what happens if a characters story somehow gets finished?

We want to start with Iron Man.\n\nBoth things need to be done, but those interactions are not necessarily best achieved when you first meet a character.

It allows more depth with one character viewing another, instead of just a blank slate (Bard/Ekko) saying the character is \"mysterious\" \"street rat\".

It's that you went forward with something WITHOUT proper planning.

You never said what is/isn't canon any longer. Why should I care about Morgana/Kayle? Are they even sisters anymore? You released a whole \"story\" for Bard.

I think next month's release both better be good, and as a corollary to being good, it had better become a standard for what you're going to do every 1-3 months. \n\nIf you have the time to read this and respond, I'd greatly appreciate it:\n\nI made a very long post to Ruunan and received no response a long time ago.\n\nFor your convenience, I will summarize the gist of my post instead of just repeating it here for you.\n\nMy post was on the subject of \"world-character\". \n\nThe fact that Runeterra as a setting is supposed to be \"good enough\" on its own without the Institute of War and the League is fine and dandy, and a reset to the lore without these ideas is not inherently bad, I agree.\n\nBut you guys have left a gaping vacuum where a cohesive \"world-character\" should be in your storytelling.\n\nA \"world-character\" refers to the theme of the setting as manifested in how ALL the characters interact with one another, justifying interaction between the characters.\n\nLeague had a complicated, and perhaps overbearing world-character with the Institute of War managing everything, which is why I can understand replacing it. Replacing it: not leaving it blank.\n\nYou have left it blank for too long, and now the fanbase has lost confidence that you'll ever restore it.\n\nCan you assure me that next month, before July ends, you will begin to fill in the lost sense of world-character that has been missing?\n\nI really liked some of the world-character that the Institute provided, and I feel like I'm representative of a significant part of the fanbase who wants to know that unrelated characters can actually coexist in the new lore.\n\nSay hypothetically, Jinx and... oh I don't know, Lux, characters who have absolutely nothing in common, could approach each other in the modern lore and have a reason to do so. Without the Institute and the League, right now, they simply don't. A good world-character would allow these two to interact despite their initial locations in the world not allowing for it.\n\n...Sometimes I'd like to get hired by you guys just to see what the hell is going on. -_- Want to hire me, Riot? I'm a writer. I can help. I'd love to figure out what is happening with the narrative over there. Legitimately, Mister Jaredan. I really like the game, but the lore has grown thin and sickly. \n\nGive me a salary, Riot. Seriously. I'll send you my resumé in a heartbeat. \n\nI care about your lore in a way few do, I think. It hurts me physically in a way that honestly has driven me away from playing the game as often as I used to, because the story is so non-existent. \n\nI erased a significant amount of this post just now because I began to ramble, a bit angrily, so I will just ask again in closing: does your proposed release address this lack of \"world-character\"?\n\nIt really needs to do that to give the fans any hope that the overall narrative of League of Legends will mean something again.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-06-21T18:04:07.644+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":12,"body":"Hey Voodoo,\n\nThanks for your thoughtful post. I'll try my best to answer your question.\n\nThough I'm afraid we might have to agree to disagree a bit.\n\nI'd say we don't need one unifying reason for Champions to interact with each other in the story world. Without one reason, you assert there are no reasons. Instead I think there are many reasons. Each of them driven by the characters themselves and the events they cause.  Each story can have its own reason for why people who don't usually interact suddenly have to. Honestly, it's almost limitless.\n\nWe don't need or want one unifying reason that people interact with each other.\n\nWe want the reasons that characters meet, fight, love (my new novel) to speak very directly to who they are. \n\nFor example: Jinx, a whirling storm of dangerous anarchy, contrasts rather well with Lux. Them having nothing in common with each other is a great reason to put them together. They contrast and highlight. What could Lux learn from Jinx? I can think of a few things. What could Jinx learn from Lux? Ok, that's a bit scary.\n\nIf we feel that's a story worth telling (and the more I think about it, the more I rather like the idea), there are so many ways we could make that happen that would speak to who both characters are. To strengthen the expression of them as characters and, thereby, the story being told.\n\nThe idea of a world-character is a fine one. There are certainly powerful unifying elements that we are going to use that are in that vein—but they'll never permanently override our desire to have conflicts generated by the wants and needs of Valoran's people.\n\nI've seen a number of folks who have said very assertively that without the IoW there's no reason for Champions to interact. That's simply not accurate. There just isn't a blanket reason. At the moment. There might be some at some times (RUNE WAAAAR!?), but it won't always be motivated in the same manner.\n\nThe unifying factor is always this: is it a good story? Does it strengthen the idea of who those characters are? Does it give the opportunity for us to see a new side of them? Does it give two (or more) of them the opportunity to grow? Does it give them the opportunity to fail?\n\nThe release(s) I'm speaking of won't address your point that there should be one primary construct to put Champs together because it won't employ that construct. It will respond to your point, however.\n\nAnd, of course, you are welcome to send in your CV, there's an open position on our website [here](http://www.riotgames.com/careers/25957).\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to post.

That's pretty stupid!\n\nThis has been a problem since the initial retconning of the lore. I quote directly from the original post in which Runaan discussed the retcon in which she says:\n\n>We believe in a philosophy in which story should spring from the characters naturally, not from a very arbitrary plot built around them. _Character_ drives plot. \n\nWhile this is true to a certain extent, it doesn't work at all the way that they imagine it does. They think that simply making characters and putting them into a world drives the plot forward. You have some Bard thingie in the mountains blowing a flute and saving people, (I honestly have _no_ idea who or what Bard is and what he has to do with the stars. I literally have no idea based on what little information that has been given to us.) you have a boy who created a short time-rewinding machine in Zaun, you have the queen of the Graboids (see Tremors) in the deserts of Shurima, but no overarching story that connects all of these entities anymore. The Institute of War did that, but then they took it out of existence, past, present, and future.  \n\n\"Character drives plot\" the way I understand it is most exemplified by the writings of George R.R. Martin and HBO's _The Wire._ Both of these stories have **_deep_**  investigation of each character and their motivations and the history of the land that they live in. Westeros is a land that has been plagued by war and constant contest over the Iron Throne. Rebellions have risen, royalty has been killed, betrayal has taken place, and grudges are held by every party involved, even those associated with the winners. Baltimore is a city with a long history of drug violence, ineffective police methods, thieving stevedores, corrupt politicians, misguided educational philosophies, and immoral newspaper journalists. \n\nIn both of these stories, the decisions of one can affect all. You don't get that in League of Legends lore. If Viktor sends his Battlecast army to attack Piltover, why should Rammus and Ashe give a fuck? If Swain defeats Jarvan IV on the fields of battle, what does it matter to Ekko and Lissandra? \n\n****THE WIRE AND GAME OF THRONES SPOILERS AHEAD****\n\nThe difference is that when Robb Stark declares himself King in the North, all the characters care. Danerys cares because the kingdom she wants to retake is at war with itself. The Lannisters care because they want to retain control of the throne. The Manderlys care because they have always been treated well by the North and have always had great respect for the Starks. The only party that \"doesn't care\" is the Night's Watch because they are mandated to be impartial, and they they _still_ care because Jon Snow is Robb Stark's half brother so when he finds out he's stabbed to death at his uncle's wedding (which is yet another event that changes all of Westeros and the rules of hospitality that was rooted in the decision of Robb to marry someone he wasn't promised to) it matters to him.\n\nWhen Omar goes to exact his revenge on the Barksdale crew for killing his lover, he kills the one person in the crew who the Baltimore Police had criminal evidence on, thus making them unable to try to press him and take them up the ladder. The Barksdale crew cares because they're losing muscle. The East Side cares because if the Barksdale crew has less muscle, they have more leverage to proposition them to get on their drug package.\n\nOr when Ziggy kills George Gleekas. Ziggy goes in for a confession so as far as homicide is concerned the case is open and closed but they neglect to tell the Major Crimes unit which means that the Greeks to clean up the shop where he was killed of all evidence, flushing drugs down the drain, burning paperwork, all before they can raid the place for evidence. Because Ziggy goes to jail, the Greeks use that as leverage on his father Frank Sobotka who was going to cooperate with the police to take down the Greeks in exchange for a nicer prison for Ziggy except that Nicholas Sobotka, out of love for his cousin, begs Frank to go to the Greeks to help get Ziggy out of jail. But, because FBI Special Agent Fitz is working with the Major Crimes unit, he reports to his superiors when he has a new witness. But his superiors tell the Greeks that Frank is going to rat on them because the Greeks are an FBI asset that they don't want in jail ultimately leading to the murder of Frank Sobotka.\n\n**Spoilers Over**\n\nI conclude with a reiteration of my main argument: The problem is that simply putting characters in a world is not enough to further a plot. _Not only_ must you give deep consideration to the characters personality, history, motivations, relations, and location of a character for a character to drive plot, but you must also have an overarching reason for characters to care about what happens to each other. If Ahri disappeared from the face of Runeterra who in the world (literally) would care? If Garen disappeared, who would care outside of Demacia and Noxus?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2015-05-16T19:45:23.507+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":2,"body":"Regretably, Narrative won't even respond to thought-provoking, well thought-out threads, let alone ones that directly attack what they're doing.\n\nThe issue is this: Narrative believes release videos count as lore.
