You could also highlight the PROJECT skins where the male champions had full masks while Leona had a half mask and Fiora's completely opened on recall.\n\nFrom a visual design standpoint, when we are not looking at narrative or audio but just the small in-game model of a champion, covering the face often leaves the character feeling asexual and often assumed to be male (unless we exaggerate the body or show a lot of skin which often just looks bad on a masked character). But perhaps we could go the Dark Souls route and make a character that is assumed male until you hear the VO or read the lore? Although LoL is so heavily focused on gameplay that many players never read the lore or hear VO so we try not to rely on that in general. There would need to be a specific purpose for such a design decision. It's an interesting conversation that's well worth having.\n\nFrom a product standpoint, Riot is fully focused on player experience and we know that our players do enjoy feminine beauty (as well as male beauty!) so we keep that in mind when designing skins or champions. I think there are times when it is appropriate and times when it isn't, but in a fantasy game I personally don't see anything wrong with a variety that includes a lot of beautiful characters. When you cover a characters face you also lose a lot of identity, which I think is why PROJECT and Blood Moon sometimes kept the visibility of the face beneath the mask. Players want to see the faces of female champions, and unless we have a good reason not to show them, we generally do.\n\nGreat observation, I would love to talk further about it if anyone has opinions to share.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-03-22T23:35:33.111+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone who is \"into social issues (tm),\" I would personally love to see more champs like Jayce, Varus, Zyra, Katarina, Syndra, Janna, etc. \n\nWhen it comes to real life issues, I'll fight to the death.

There's really not been any champions that people can actually relate to. There's been a lot of this with Kindred, Bard, Tahm and Sol. Even Illaoi feeds into this somewhat, while she is a human character she's still utilising power that feels otherworldly. Jhin is just an unrelatable character, he's not a character who you can really project yourself onto. That more or less leaves Ekko as the only recent champion who you could really relate or project onto. Before this you'd have to go all the way back to Braum, who's release was around 2 years ago.\n\n>However I think the reason you haven't seen a sexy female champ for a while is that in the earlier roster we made a whole pile of them, and they're still there, so when it comes to adding something new it's not often something we look at and think 'yes, this is what's missing from LoL'.\n\nI'd argue that really doesn't mean you should stop making them entirely.

While I generally don't shy away from social topics, I am aware that starting this discussion without need can get quite messy so it's generally a good idea to avoid it.\nBut if we go down that route, I recently conducted a poll in a female-dominated League community regarding which male champion they found the most attractive. Almost all of the unmasked human ones were mentioned, with Talon (different skins reveal different portions of his face so people get the full picture I guess), Xin and Jayce being the top three. No masked ones were voted for.\nSo I guess that unmasking increases the chance of a champion being perceived romantically. This is why a user further down was outraged about Kayle becoming waifu-fied through her skins and some people find the overly sexual, but masked Jhin confusing.\n\nEDIT: So I have been quite shy about asking this, but is it a conscious design choice? \"I made this shadow-assassin-ninja (and the 20 like him) so don't you dare get a crush on him\" despite the strong waifu factor going on with the female champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-03-23T05:34:12.960+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not everything that Riot has done or will do will turn out the way we want it to, but you can be sure that behind every decision was a huge amount of thought and consideration. As an artist I would say that every design choice is conscious and deliberate, because guaranteed you're going to have a heap of Rioters coming to you asking you why you made the decisions you did and you'll need to have a good reason.\n\nSpeaking specifically for the skins team, we are aware that our audience is predominantly male and we are aware that our female champions are by and large more beloved than the males. For example small things like Fiora's hairstyle becomes hugely contentious. When we were working on PROJECT Fiora Riot Zeronis really impressed upon us the importance of revealing Fiora's face on the recall insisting that it is very important for our Fiora players. We trusted him and I feel like he was correct. When I was still doing fan art I designed a skin for 'Eclipse Leona' that garnered some traction within the community but overwhelmingly responses I got were 'It looks good except I can't see her beautiful face!'. How much we serve this preference and when is something we always discuss because we believe it is an important issue. My instinct is to embrace it and instead ensure that there's plenty of attractive male characters too, because when you create beautiful characters it's not surprising that people want to enjoy their beauty.\n\nIn regards to design in general I think masks are super-in right now as a cool way of creating mystery and menace. And in LoL we have really been launching a lot of mysterious champions recently and menacing characters regularly. Zed? makes him nightmarish. Jhin? makes him impossible to empathise with. Bard? total mystery don't even know what's under there. It's not because of a 'waifu' factor, just a useful narrative tool to reinforce a desired feel for a champion.\n\nI also make a habit of asking players who they think the most attractive male champions are and I've found that the top champs are Darius, Jayce, TF and Ezreal and when I ask why it's always to do with the face and the expression, so I agree that when it comes to romantic association it is definitely all about the face!","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2016-03-23T14:39:13.360+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't really understand what you're trying to say here.\n\nFemale champions CAN'T have masks because you don't want them to be mysterious or menacing?

I think you guys managed to strike the balance between sexy and respectable and include a variety of designs as well. \n\nWhat bugs me is the attitude towards male champions has changed not at all or very little. As I see it, a mask offers a tradeoff and a choice:\n\nNo mask: The character is relatable, feels more believable and complete, may be perceived romantically.\n\nMask: One aspect of the character is greatly accentuated and the complexity of their face and expressions is replaced by a simple set of shapes. This erases or decreases the \"No mask\" qualities. Adds mystery and ambiguity in their place.\n\nNow while for some male champions this choice makes sense, others, especially the early designs, seem to lose rather than win from it. I find it strange that Riot tried to create characters with some psychological depth and a lot of story like Zed and Shen but never once showed their faces, not even in illustrations of their early lives to accompany the flavor text (whereas this happened with Lissandra). (Though I rather disagree with the red eyed white haired Zed fanarts, the hot albino bishounen role is already reserved {{champion:8}}) \n\nFurther examples in my opinion are {{champion:38}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:11}} \n\nIf we are to make yet more social comments, in general denying the male characters a face and relatability is yet another aspect of them being portrayed as emotionless automata rather than real people, which has its implications. Some people are already tired of the overuse of that, since plenty complained about the lack of personality in reworked Pantheon lore. Again this is all for Riot to decide. \n\nIf you would like my opinion in the attractiveness poll, my husbandos are {{champion:91}} {{champion:90}}  and {{champion:8}} (the number of people on these boards who are gay for the last one is uncanny, he seems to attract people regardless of orientation, probably because of the heavy scent of 90s nostalgia coming from him).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2016-03-23T13:02:08.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=u7bP1XGx,comment-id=000f00020000,timestamp=2016-03-23T05:34:12.960+0000)\n>\n> In regards to design in general I think masks are super-in right now as a cool way of creating mystery and menace.

It's not because of a 'waifu' factor, just a useful narrative tool to reinforce ***a desired feel for a champion.***\n\n\"A desired feel for a champion\"\n\nDoes this imply that Zed will never have an Unmasked skin (or, a skin where he is coincidentally without a mask, like a Pentakill skin for example, or Arclight) because it would take away from the \"desired feel?\" Even though skins are generally regarded as fun alternate realities that should be allowed to occasionally break the \"desired feel\" of a champion? Even though a Pentakill/Rockstar Zed wouldn't actually detract very much from his dark nature, even if he had no mask.\n\nI think a case can be made for romantic association being POSSIBLE for characters like Zed, but the lack of Unmasked skins (or skins that coincidentally have them unmasked while having another theme) prevent that from being possible. Don't you agree it's kind of unfair to Zed, Talon, Jhin, and Shen to say that, when the champions you mentioned (Darius, Jayce, TF, Ez) are unmasked to begin with?\n\nSorry if I come across as crass. I've always dreamt of a Pentakill skin for Zed where he's unmasked and has an awesome emo rocker look to him, and you kind of dashed my hopes of there ever being any kind of skin where he is even just unmasked.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-03-24T03:58:36.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah for sure. I was talking specifically about Champion design. On skins we are given a lot of liberty to push champions in whatever ways we feel will heighten a thematic. Even when designing Jhin we asked the question of what is underneath the mask because there was **hypothetical** talk of revealing his face in a future skin. But then again how much of those champion's identity becomes tied to the mask? When you see Bards mask you recognise Bard, but would you have the same recognition and association if you saw what was behind it? And what if Zed/Jhin/Kassadin don't look how you imagined? Is that disappointing for players?\n\nI think there would need to be a compelling reason to do it for a skin, and then we would need to talk to Champion team and Foundations to get the okay to show the champion's face and the information about what that champion looks like. The other teams have a lot of plans for the future and we need to make sure skins aren't treading on those plans - co-operation is super important! But if we have all that then we could show a champion's face in a skin and totally would.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-03-24T04:32:36.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aren't skins for alternate fantasies and not necessarily canon? \n\nAs such, couldn't you have an unmasked skin with whatever floats your boat, and just declare it non-canon (or even just not say it *is* canon) if it doesn't jive with champion/foundations vision of the 'true' face of the champion?\n\nI don't feel like theres any huge issue with having one facial style in one skin and a somewhat different style in another (vlad has a variety of faces amongst his skins off the top of my head), so people could still have their visions of the unmasked champion be potentially true even with some unmasked skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-03-24T05:17:22.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Unmasked Kayle very much _is_ Kayle and if there was just one skin where we showed Zed's face it's not unrealistic to imagine that this will become the assumed face of Zed. Also while we think of skins as Alternate Fantasies for our champions they are more often than not worlds in which that champion has a different role, profession or history but their personality and physiognomy remain intact. Not always the case but more often than not because we've learned that that is very important to many players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2016-03-23T01:44:26.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend has the opposite problem.
