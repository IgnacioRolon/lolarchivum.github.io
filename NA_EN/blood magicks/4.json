Never mind that his old green and gold look didn't remotely fit with Noxus, especially as it was further updated and expanded on.\n\nNew Swain actually resembles a tactician in both gameplay (placement of his W, aiming his E, knowing when and where to use Q and R to maximum effect) and look (practical Noxian military attire) while maintaining his ult **in a healthy form**(period of health drain that comes to an end, and can be played around by knowing when to back off and wait it out or outnumber since he can only drain up to three enemies).\n\nSwain, Galio, Akali, Irelia, and even old Aatrox were all fundamentally unhealthy for the game because they were reliant entirely on \"half enough stats to do this thing\" with minimal room for outplay on the part of the enemy team. Yes some of them are balance headaches _ even now_, but that's because of a gap in player ability.
