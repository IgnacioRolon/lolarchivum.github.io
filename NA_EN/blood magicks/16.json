Ahri would probably see benefit in having access to his house for the background of her snapchat/tumblr selfies and to throw parties, but at best would most likely be using him. Also House Noxus and House Ionia have never really got along, they just aren't fetch.\n\nBut that's just me! I love these comics Gutter Rat has been producing, and the Academy characters are for players to tell whatever stories they want with. I really hope we can do some more in the future. School is something most people can relate to, although this time I'd play up the conflict side more. They were supposed to be like Ikki Tousen or Rival Schools: Project Justice.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2017-06-25T16:34:27.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think most artists pair them because they're the pretty ones who also engage in succubus-like activities.
