Firstly Akali in comparison to her other counterparts Shen and Kennen is relatively bland. Shen wields a Spirit Blade, Kennen was born with Boundless Energy and speed and Akali is just....a ninja. This has been on my mind for years and Daniel Z Klein said it best months ago in what he would do if he was to rework her and the first thing he said was to think up a way to show where she draws her power from. With the name 'Fist of Shadow' you would assume she would be more then just a regular green ninja girl but Akali technically doesnt really have a power. Her mini Scythes have always been a standard part of who she is but maybe they can be expressed better or changed into different weapons altogether. Somthing like Shadow Blades/Shadow Scythes either handed down through her clan over the years for the next Fist of Shadow or weapons found similar to Zeds forbidden technique that shows where she draws her power from in her new kit with the idea of say duality behind them. That leads to my next idea...\n\nOver the years theres always been tons of speculation of Akali and whats her connection to Zed and his order. With Kayn coming out recently as a student of Zed an idea that could help fit her thematically in her VGU is that Akali was a former student of Zed and one of his most prized students and had her shadow blades/scythes passed down to her by him and maybe went rogue on Zeds order or maybe even was working undercover in Zeds order purposely. Something that ties it all together between all of them since we know what happened between Zed and Shen. I think something like this could really open up about her general power, where her intentions going forward and previously lie and could give some great dialogue between her, Zed, Shen, Kayn and Kennen. \n\nThese are just some rough thoughts though but just some stuff on my mind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evil Yasuo","date":"2017-10-19T00:04:48.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Whren,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ocwApv6b,comment-id=00060000000000010000,timestamp=2017-10-18T23:36:33.206+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, the champs (and champ update) team folks have been killing it -- my contribution is via the Worldbuilding team, so we&#x27;d have conversations about how the update or new champs will relate to what&#x27;s established for Runeterra, and how we can sync designs up :) Like in Swain&#x27;s case, we talked about options to make Swain jive with the new Noxian look instead of the weird green robe he had on before, and then they went off and came up with the amazeballs in the teaser.
