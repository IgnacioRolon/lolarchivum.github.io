The writing cute and funny but absolutely flat. At most you can discern {{champion:8}} is someone who would rather joke around than talk about himself, which is hardly what a VO should do.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a shame, really. The actor sounds great, some of the laughs are awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2017-07-02T23:19:01.276+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'd actually argue the contrary.  Vlad's puns tell us quite a bit about his character.  He's clever,  quick-witted, and a little bit playful, indicating that maybe he's not taking all of this quite so seriously.  It also speaks to the depths of his obsession, like in his Judgement, it's not that he's \"just\" a blood mage, he's completely obsessed with it, hemomancy is like a compulsion to him.  The way he dresses and speaks revolve around it, and he will not shut up about blood.  Being more willing to joke around than talk about himself is also interesting, if you think about it.  Is Vlad ashamed to admit some of the things he's done?  The Judgement implies a little guilt about his first two kills, and an inability to stop.\n\nOf course, that could all be me reading too deeply into it, and I'd like to see his bank of lines expanded once the Noxus Update rolls around.  I agree with you in that I'd really love for them to keep his current VA.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2017-07-03T07:53:16.949+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"While that is amazing it's entire foundation is reliant on you.

There's this very real phenomena with older League characters, especially those with niche fanbases and no current lore updates, where fans basically had to cobble together their own lores based on the brief biography, a Judgement if you were lucky, and maybe a minute's worth of lines.  That sometimes results in a bit of a disconnect when Riot updates those champs (Leona/Viktor say hello), and I've always found that interesting.\n\nI personally like to see Vlad as an addict.  It's not that he wants to use hemomancy, he literally has to.  It was actually confirmed in an old Red post, though I'm unsure if this is still canon, that Vlad doesn't heal from using blood, he heals off of the _sheer thrill of it_.  Of course, that's probably just to explain \"how does Vlad heal off Malphite/Blitzcrank\", but it painted Vlad to me as someone who's obsessed with his powers, and needs to use them to survive.  Being in the League, when that was canon, gave him a chance to do all the blood sucking and hemomancy he wanted without being arrested as a serial killer.  They all come right back anyway.\n\nAnd of course, nothing I said above is canon.  I don't have much to work with to support those points, which is why I do agree with Blood Magicks on what I think their main point was, Vlad really could use some more lines or lore that better illustrate his personality and motivations.  Hopefully we'll get that.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-07-03T15:19:58.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it's true that people have to cobble together things from a champion's voice over, some voice overs give more than others, even if both are about as old as each other. Take Vlad when compared to Irelia for example. Vlad's voice over tells everything that you previously mentioned but what does Irelia's voice over tell us other than that she's a soldier/fighter? \n\nSo while I agree that, while our views about their personalities might be based on very little, that some champs are more clearly likely to retain some element what we currently can theorize of their personality than others.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChunLii","date":"2017-07-02T23:35:22.306+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Judgment isn't canon because it's based on the old lore Institute of War.
