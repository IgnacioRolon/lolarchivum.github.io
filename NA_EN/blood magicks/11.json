Champion Update is not the only team at Riot with Illustrators though and aren't the only team capable of updating old splash art. Champion update did help on some of the recent base splashes but those were also worked on by many rioters from many teams. \n\nAlso some rioters work on splash art on there own time as passion projects. Those still get released occasionally outside of the champion update initiative. Since it's on there own time they work on whatever they want which is usually a champion/skin they are passionate about. Traditional Trundle for one was worked on by Mitch Malloy (a artist on our promo team) as part of a passion project for him, we just released it with our Trundle splash update.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-06-03T18:52:33.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell Mitch that we all could see his passion on the Trad Trundle splash art @_@","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2016-06-03T18:30:07.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info again, a good explanation.\n\n>Traditional Trundle for one was worked on by Mitch Malloy (a artist on our promo team) as part of a passion project for him\n\nIt makes so much sense now!\n\nGuess all we can do us hope a Riot-associated artist has a similar passion for our boy Vladdy!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-06-02T23:05:12.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's referring to skin splashes though....","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2016-06-02T23:09:08.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blade Mistress Morgana\nTundra Hunter Warwick\nGlacial Olaf","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-06-02T23:46:20.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said that they do work on a few random ones,though these are not the priorities,they merely finish the ones that they've started back when they didn't organize the process.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-06-02T22:41:08.039+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, those awesome new splashes where models look NOTHING like them :(","replies":[{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2016-06-02T22:46:38.696+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think Socrates got into Reav3s account with the hypocrisy and backwards thinking\n\nIt's just a joke.
