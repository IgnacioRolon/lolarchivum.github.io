The funny thing is that the jungle changes were relatively minor as far as I was concerned.  It's true that I can now finish my first red buff and usually have enough health to consider chasing down the rift scuttler or even to peek in a lane just to remind the enemy laner to be cautious, but ganks pre-6 are still nothing to write home about.\n\nThe other part didn't massively change either.  Sej was always one of the better tanks if you built her as full tank.  But that was only if you built her full tank and didn't try to get any damage items.  You'd end up with 200+ armor and MR and almost 4000 health, but your auto attack damage was a joke and your main damage was DOT and required that the enemy stand near you for several seconds.\n\nThose haven't changed.  You do have all the CC, but its avoidable for any team paying attention.  The Q gap close isn't long range, the E only works if you've already done damage and the ult has a fairly long cooldown.  Honestly using Amumu's Q to gap close and following up with his ult is far better CC, and he's got his own DOT and inate tankiness.\n\nSadly, I do fear a nerf will be coming.  Too many people are now complaining that Sejuani is too powerful even though she's not a damage dealer.  She can tie up a team's damage dealers, but the impression I'm getting from people's posts is that somehow Sejuani's in their games are going 20/1.  fi that's happening I have to ask what they were doing.  The trick with any tank is to avoid the tank and concentrate on the enemy damage dealers.

You can stop a split push by simply placing a champion under a turret while the rest of a team teamfights. after all if a m8 is there than it's a 5v4. Stopping splitpush is incredibly easy if you know what you're doing. push up the lane before you push mid. Or if you see them splitting send someone with decent dmg and cc to protect the turret. In SoloQ especially teamfight coordination is another beast entirely. In general they all just throw their abilities at once. They don't save the stun for that kat ult.

Split pushing comps generally have sturdy high-CC champs that excel at defending 4v5 to stall, and can chase/poke at anyone who tries to recall or outright win a 4v4 when you foolishly send someone to ~~stop~~ feed Jax.\n\nStopping splitpush is easy but it requires a lot more coordination than many matched teams have, because the counter to it is to assess your situation and do whatever is most valuable. \nOptions include:\n - Rotating on and crushing the splitpusher if they're of the A-type variety\n - Rotating lanes and taking a different turret, potentially catching out the 4-man and destroying them when they're not under the safety of their turret\n - Leaving entirely and doing some other objective. Dragon's up and enemy Trynd is in top without Teleport? Free Dragon.\n - Put enough pressure elsewhere to draw away the splitpusher, e.g. forced Baron fight, provided they're not already at your inhib turret\n - Get at least one pick (with a hook or something) and base race?\n - Surrendering because the splitpusher is a 20-5 Udyr","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-03-17T19:02:05.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=atleastaneight,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uaNaUYME,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-17T16:09:05.431+0000)\n>\n> She really isn't, tank junglers just prey on the inability of soloqueue teams to coordinate.\n\n{{champion:23}} jungle preys on the inability of soloqueue teams to not feed anyone with an above average amount of damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-18T00:42:21.550+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If a Pickrate is high (20%), and a winrate is high (55+%) the champion is PROBABLY overpowered.\n\nWe all knew Sejuani was gonna be nerfed after cinderhulk came out.

Sejuani is categorically overpowered. I don't think she is broken or oppressive (which a lot of people mistakenly use in synonymy with OP) but you are quite literally a lunatic (or horribly lacking in vocabulary) to not understand that she is OP. \n> \n> The things that bring me to this conclusion are that her win rate has been consistently *increasing* every day since the last patch, he pick rate has *also* been increasing steadily since last patch, which shows she is not just a niche pick played by a few masters, but that she wins more even as roughly 2.5 times her normal players pick her now (meaning that her win rate is increasing even with poor/inexperienced players utilizing her), and her ban rate has also steadily increased. This means statistically speaking she is OP, people recognize she is OP, and people ban her because she is OP.\n> \n> Regardless of whether it is because she is particularly suited to solo queue, doesn't have a meaningful weakness anymore, or is just strong against meta champions, she is still quite strong and you are foolish to deny it.\n\nshe isn't OP.\n\nShe has been strong yes, but the small 5 to 8% player base that mains her have perfected her well enough to show for it.\n\nAnd to cue on the fact that people say they realize how strong she is, let me clue you in on the next thing people haven't caught on yet.\n\nIts to master how to properly counter-jungle, and any tank main will tell you that a jungler that knows how counter-jungle you and seek to find and kill you puts them in a world of hurt and constant pressure because you aren't given time to farm up for your items that your tank is reliant on.\n\nEveryone and their mothers have forgot how to *properly *counter jungle thus the masses think the tanks are OP because they don't know how to deal with it.\n\nCinderhulk didn't make tank junglers OP, the fact people started playing tank junglers to try it out is what the started the forums trend.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-03-17T20:54:32.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh, I know how counterjungling hurts tanks (I've mained tank junglers since the middle of last season) but right now, Sejuani's early weakness where you could exploit her early game and counter jungle her is non existent. She clears fast and healthy, and the fact that she actually has a lot of damage early on means counterjungling is not nearly as effective against her as people keep claiming. It hurts her, yes, but less so than most other junglers, and less than it currently should. It isn't that strange that she is OP right now, she was strong before the buffs, and since this last patch was a blanket buff, there are always going to be champs that need more individual tuning to balance.\n\nThe other reason I say she is overpowered is that other tanks who got buffed last patch have not seen anywhere near the popularity or win rate spike that she has, and they are all counterjungleable too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Marinaras Trench","date":"2015-03-17T22:33:50.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sej isnt op, just very strong :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ser Garland","date":"2015-03-17T16:42:57.689+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"If sejuani is in a good place, does that mean Jarvan can have his passive armour back?
