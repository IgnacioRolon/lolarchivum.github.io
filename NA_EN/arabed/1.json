Claiming I shouldn't be rushing QSS on Garen because I have a \"cleanse\" built in when we were against a Veigar and I needed some more MR.

I reported him for a negative attitude because he was bickering with his adc the entire game.\n\nI then got queued up with him again in my next game. He began to verbally abuse me as soon as he saw my name telling my teammates I was a troll and that we would lose. I told him that he should let the previous game go and move on, its a new game.

You could just be having a bad game or the other person happens to out-skill you.  That doesn't necessarily show your skill or experience with the game/champion.)  Be a positive player and keep your teams hopes up.  If you are the person that's saying \"GG Team too heavy\" or anything related to that, you are lowering your team's morale and making that game feel utterly hopeless.  What you should do is keep your team's spirits high by complementing people whenever you make a good play (even if its a small thing such as warding, and warding especially in lower elo/rank) and also make sure to reassure your team after something bad happens.  Something as simple as \"It's ok guys, we can still do this.\" can help make you and your team more energized and positive, leading to a possible comeback.\n\nAs an extra thing to remember, no one is perfect, not even the pro teams.  There is ALWAYS something you could have done better.  If you come across a bad play that you and your team made, don't yell and flame at them.  Instead you could offer a suggestion in a POLITE way such as \"Doing x wasn't a bad idea, but maybe next time you could try y and see if it works better.  Just offering a suggestion.\"  However, an even better thing to do is to just worry about improving yourself (still doesn't mean putting down your team in the process, but focus on improving yourself more than your allies) since after that game, more than likely you won't play with them again.\n\nIf there's anything to take away from this ramble (aka here comes the TL;DR)\nBe Positive\nDon't give up\nAlways strive to improve (on yourself mostly)","replies":[{"poster":"ChenMingYang1","date":"2015-04-07T02:11:27.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GloaBlade,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9qymAv3u,comment-id=002a,timestamp=2015-04-06T22:40:39.961+0000)\n>\n> I've seen some people explain this on YouTube, and I have to agree with these statements.\n> \"Don't play a game to win; play a game to improve.\"  This is important so even if you do lose the game, make sure you take something out of it to better yourself and make you win more games in the future.\n\n\nGbay99 :D","replies":[{"poster":"Duchess of Deer","date":"2015-04-07T10:49:40.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"i hate gbay with a passion \n\nthat man makes it seem climbing is easy when in fact gold and below its a shit fest","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Digitality","date":"2015-04-07T18:30:06.724+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always come in expecting to win.

I did everything I could but even killing 3 of their players solo in the last fight wasn't enough to win. I killed a 6 item ap jungle nidalee a 5 item graves and a support lulu alone under the bot inhib tower as Shaco while my team lost 2v4 under mid inhib tower to malphite top and dunno what they had mid.\n\nThat was a depressing game. I had more damage done to enemy champs than all the other players in the team combined and the only positive score at 10 5 11 or something like that... /:\nAnd I fed my team at least 10 kills during the early mid game. They were just that bad that for example I gank bot we get 1 kill on me 1 on adc and the enemy both use all their sums. 1 min later they return to lane and 2v2 kill our adc + support with at least 1 sum up each. They also had more gold....\nI split pushed and even got an inhib while we only lost 1 inner tower at one time but it was all in vain.
