The worst part about Hecarim though is he isn&#039;t even strong in the jungle, they place caps on all his abilties related to minions ( with massive CD&#039;s) making his clear times slow and his sustain just plain awful. Lets not forgot his ganks, nothing special....outclassed by every other champion...\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s sit down with riot for a minute...\r\n&quot;We are going to make a champion that is outclaseed by every other champion league of legends and is not viable in any position. To do this we made it so he had a horrific early game and a poor duelist, this is so he has no lane presence and can ONLY just barely be played in the jungle.&quot;\r\n\r\nHey he may have an ok late game, but it&#039;s nothing to ride home about. He still get&#039;s outclassed by most champions in lol..\r\n\r\nWhy do you think he isn&#039;t used in competitive play?
