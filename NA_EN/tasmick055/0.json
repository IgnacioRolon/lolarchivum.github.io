I'm not able to play with any of my friends and I'm forced to play solo, I can't talk to them either which sucks. I've looked at many others discussions that have the same problem and they're fixes but nothing has worked for me and I am starting to give up and quit playing because id rather just keep playing alone and not being able to see the chat. The chat doesn't even look like it's actually attempting to reconnect it just there saying it's trying when it's not -_-.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T01:21:45.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This might be happening if your network can't get a solid connection to our chat servers.
