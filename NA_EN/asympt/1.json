I won't be able to see where this ping is spiking until I can see the full traceroute. \n\nIf I could get you to run Win MTR again with 104.160.131.1 as the host, and this time take a screenshot or copy/paste the full log with each server line the ping goes through. That way I'll be able to look at this more in depth.","replies":[{"poster":"Asympt","date":"2017-03-20T22:06:10.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird, in my original post I linked to the results of the trace but they didn't show up for some reason...
