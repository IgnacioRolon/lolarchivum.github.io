Here's the original: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/sfQEH4ok-in-game-ping-has-increased-in-game-from-27ms-to-constant-117ms-since-yesterday-isp-or-riot-issue\n\nI live in Ontario, Canada, around an hour outside of Toronto.\n\nI played a ranked game 4 days ago and noticed my in game ping was at a **constant 117ms**, whereas it usually sat at around 27ms. **Restarting client, computer, and router all had no effect.** Furthermore, **no other network traffic was affected.** Ping tests to various websites (google etc) resulted in their usual latency of 15-30ms. \n\nI have also ran the Hextech Repair Tool, tried a wired connection, flushed DNS / Renewed IP, basically I've done everything to ensure it was not an issue on my end.\n\nThis issue persists to this day, 4 days later - I'd like to emphasize this is not an issue with my home network, but something clearly farther down the line.\n\nHere are the results from a tracert test ran using WinMTR, [HERE](http://pastebin.com/f9kFRw6L)\n\nAny information would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-20T01:23:30.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked over the traceroute you sent, and I noticed that in the very first line you have a \"worst ping\" of 51. This could be a sign that something is up with your router or modem, as you typically want to see a 0 or 1 in that first line. \n\nIf you already have a high ping before your connection leaves your home network, we should go through our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to check for any instabilities there first.\n\nHit me up if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Asympt","date":"2017-03-20T01:54:15.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry but that does not help me whatsoever, I think its clear that this is NOT a local network thing as I have stated multiple times. In my previous thread I was given the exact same advice by Porocules, and I gave him the exact same explanation. That test was done on my laptop over a 2.4ghz wifi connection far from my router as I did not think my local network made any difference, so naturally a couple packets will be delayed because of interference.\n\nNo other network traffic is affected. \n\nMy ping is not spiking but is at a CONSTANT 115MS+, which is VERY different from lag spikes experienced due to weak local network connections.\n\nI have said that I've done a lot of trouble shooting on my end, including following your connection guide, and it doesn't resolve my problem.\n\nIt has been 5 days and the only 2 response I've received from Riot have been the exact same and neither actually address the issue.\n\n\"Oh your car is on fire? Well I see that your air pressure in your tire is kinda low, have you tried fixing that?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ya≈õuo Main","date":"2017-03-20T22:10:47.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing, except I got it just now.

I hadnt changed anything and it made no sense. Im thinking I just solved it because my computer is bluetooth capable and I am connected over wifi. I believe I was getting a bad wifi signal because my computer trying to establish a bluetooth connection to my phone. Once I turned off the bluetooth on my computer my ping dropped to normal instantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oser","date":"2017-11-11T23:59:18.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem does anyone know the fix.. my internet is always good execpt when i get ingame in LoL please help","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Need Serotonin","date":"2017-04-11T18:16:41.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same exact thing happened to me, I had a normal stable 30 ping and all of a sudden my ping just went up to 90 and its such a huge difference to the game play.

My internet connection is strong as ever and I didn't have this problem up until a week or two ago (Maybe more since I don't play League consistently) but last match I broke my record by going up to 400 ms most frequently. Random spikes of anything over 300 ms is what I'm accustomed to at this point meanwhile other games I play connect just fine, what the hell Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Asympt","date":"2017-03-19T14:36:11.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has your base ping increased at all?

After that spike, it slowly drops to anything between 200 - 300 and then goes back to normal, below 115 definitely.

Mine is a constant increase to 115ms, whereas yours is ping spiking. If you're on a wifi network try a wired connection, see what background processes your computer is running, etc. Most of the time when I get a lag spike it's because an application somewhere on the network decided to download an update (Steam, Windows, phone on wifi)","replies":[{"poster":"JSlendyBonham","date":"2017-03-20T00:21:17.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, I'll have to turn off whatever's running in the background... Chrome isn't that problematic because I get the same results with or without it running. Thank you! I'll be on the lookout for what may be causing your lag.
