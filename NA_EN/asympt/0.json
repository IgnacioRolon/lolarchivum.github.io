Although we ended up winning, I decided to avoid playing another game. Today I played an ARAM to see if the issue was resolved, but **my latency still remained at a constant 115ms+**\n\nI ran a tracert (attached above) and was curious whether the increase in latency was due to an issue on Riot's end, or if it was an issue with my ISP (Nexicom). Also, is this issue likely to be resolved soon? It is very frustrating to play with an extra ~90ms of latency.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n-edit- fixed imgur link","replies":[{"poster":"xRiley","date":"2017-03-17T01:36:21.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The exact same thing is happening to me as well, I also live about an hour away from Toronto, constant 90ms up from the usual 45ms for the past 3-4 days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T23:26:02.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't look like there's been any issues with our servers, but there may some hiccups between your network and our game servers.   It looks like you pinged to the right server, but I recommend using [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)to traceroute instead.  It paints a better picture of what's going on, but be sure to run it for a few minutes.  Let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"Asympt","date":"2017-03-17T00:44:24.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!

I can see two problems here, the last ping before reaching riot direct spikes a bit.  It may not be has impacting though as your router, which already starts off pretty high before ever leaving your home network.  You usually want your router to be like 0 or 1, but it's coming up as 51.  In this case, I suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your local network.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Asympt","date":"2017-03-17T20:16:29.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, unfortunately that doesn't help me with my issue too much. \n\nWhere are you seeing the 51ms ping to my router? The only 51 I see is the \"Worst\" section of the first address, which isn't even the address of my router. The 51 was an uncommon spike (you can see the average is closer to 14) due to interference on my home wifi network- When I did that test, I did it on my laptop over my 2.4gHz wireless network far from my router. Usually I have a ping of 1-3ms but because of the location of my router it occasionally spikes due to interference. When I play LoL I'm in a different part of my house on a 5gHz connection and have a much more stable connection. If you'd like I could rerun the test from my 5gHz network, but I figured because the issue was clearly farther down the line it wouldn't make a difference.\n\nThe issue at hand is the fact that my in game ping has increased from 27ms to a STEADY 115ms, and I'm not sure what the cause of that was. I wanted to know if it was an issue on Riot's end (and if it was, bring your attention to it) or an issue with my ISP, or if there was any way of knowing if / when this would be resolved.\n\nAny information you could provide me regarding a possible timeframe for this getting resolved or what is responsible for the increase would be appreciated.\n\n(Here is the typical ping to my router over my 2.4gHz home network, again not sure where the 51ms is coming from: http://imgur.com/20a9Ztc )","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Asympt","date":"2017-03-16T22:31:05.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updating to say that the issue still isn't resolved, and I have since attempted using the Hextech Repair Tool with no effect.
