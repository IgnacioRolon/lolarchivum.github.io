This ISP *also* provides VDSL/wired internet. \n\nThe problem is that Lag Report sees both networks as the same thing, when in fact they are two different networks by the same ISP.\n\nBy the nature of 4G/LTE-A, mobile networks are going to have a lot more packet loss and higher ping and are generally the only kind of network that causes any jitter. \n\nThese results are being used in the average with wired/lower latency internet connections by the same ISP. This causes *false* statistics for ISP's that also provides mobile networking.","replies":[{"poster":"Viscarious","date":"2018-02-06T21:36:32.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi JBrianJ,\n\nThanks for bringing this to our attention. Can you provide me with the name of the ISP whose different networks are getting lumped together?\n\nWe're using a database of IP Address ranges to identify different ISPs. If the different networks aren't distinguished from each other in the database, then they'll get lumped together.  We can look for this ISP in our DB and see if there's a way to separate these two networks so the metrics aren't getting mixed together.\n\nThanks!","replies":[]}]}
