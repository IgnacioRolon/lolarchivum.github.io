Graves stole everything in my jungle so I was extremely behind .. I even said that it&#039;s just because I need exp so I can&#039;t gank a lvl6 Syndra when I&#039;m a lvl4 Vi. My Sivir just wrote : &quot; Vi. Wtf ? &quot; when she got grabbed through the wall and I tried to help her by jumping in ..  so riot.. can you really tell me what the purpose of banning me is now ? I&#039;ve started playing this season and I gotta admit I need to get a better attitude and just mute people when they are toxic but my teammate  Victor flamed me over  the whole 26 minutes and said : Graves &gt; Vi , Vi is afk , Vi just go afk, report vi. and things like that .. obviously these things trigger me and I shouldn&#039;t react to these people but you need to understand that I just defended myself..\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenixdust","date":"2018-10-17T10:52:30.146+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":11,"body":"You used the chat, and didnt say ONLY NICE THINGS.

While OP didn't harass anyone with threatening to report them (He just asked like once), he did use the word a few times. I almost always see the word, \"report\" being used several times when people complain about bans here and on Discord servers alike. I have reason to believe that \"report\" and possibly \"muted\" are trigger words for the automated system. \n\nNothing wrong with saying them, but I think an accumulation of words like these + long chat logs are almost certainly going to trip the automated system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kareshi","date":"2018-10-19T03:24:45.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol its because you were typing too many lines of text< being a nuisance ( riots view)\nalso its okay tho , whats your discord tag","replies":[]},{"poster":"Honeydew Zekling","date":"2018-10-17T17:17:43.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be worth asking riot to un-permaban you. While the chat log you showed isn't too toxic, I can see why it would count as a strike/ban.

People can be toxic as hell in games, but that doesn't mean we need to defend ourselves through toxicity.\n\nEven if you feel the bubbling rage, I like trying to be oozing with positivity. \"Ah, Graves totally rekt me\" \"Won't be able to gank right away guys, sorry :(\" \"This graves is countering me so hard.

I actually perfer it now because I think it's hilarious when a player(s) who are quick to harass other/ want to pick a fight doesn't get the response they thought. \n\nCan't count how many time I've been \"attacked\" for \"being bad\" and if I agree/ apologize for a bad game/ say something like \"your right my damg is low right now since I'm behind\" they usually won't come at me anymore. (This also calm players that arnt toxic  but just don't realize how they sound). Plus other players in the game now probably like me better and usually if I do continue to receive harassment my other teammates will step up. When a bully finds he's alone in opion then that shuts them down too. If not it's 4 bans against 1...
