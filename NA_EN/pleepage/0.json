Finding a champion to main is the first step. \n\nCarrying low elo is all about lane, you have to get a solo lane. Mid or top and play a champion with early kill pressure, that can snowball their lead and hopefully scale into late game \n\n#Super early kill pressure:\n\n {{champion:106}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:76}}. Mastering these champions can ensure kills by lvl 3 every single game in your elo. \n\nThey also have the potential to snowball their lead and scale into late game. {{champion:92}} is the absolute best of these champions\n\n#Next up we have lvl 6 kill pressure. \n\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:131}} \n\nThese champions can win lane but its delayed, generally they will scale harder into the late game.\n\nThe lvls 1-5 kills are difficult to get with these champs, but the lvl 6 kill is almost guaranteed as long as you don't get counterpicked. \n\n\nWhen you are playing in low elo. Mute your team and ignore them, tell your jungler not to gank and just focus on lane. Crush ur lane so hard that u demoralize the enemy team and completely shutdown your enemy laner.\n\nYou cant just assume you will be able to carry teamfights off mechanics and decision making if you aren't fed. Low elo players are braindead and you cant rely on them for anything teamwork related. Your tank won't engage fights, ppl will get caught out, ppl will fight 4 vs 5, never group etc etc. \n\nLane is the only thing you can control, master it and enter teamfights so strong that you can win them singlehandedly.","replies":[]}
