Master Yi&#039;s Alpha Strike, Fizz&#039;s Trickster, and Spider form Elise Rappel can dodge it as far as I know. Elise for sure since I was playing her vs Karth before. Is Xayah intended to still get hit while in her ult?","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-02-09T20:47:33.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Lockin up this necro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ethan Allen","date":"2017-08-24T03:01:56.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
