Sometimes it happened right at the start, sometimes midway through, and a couple times at the end.\r\n\r\nI'm far from the only one who's had this issue, and there have been a lot of suggestions on different sites to try and fix it, but none of it has worked for me. I've cleaned my computer repeatedly. I've lowered the graphics to minimum, back to maximum, and am currently somewhere in the middle. I've updated all drivers. I've run repairs and reinstalled the game multiple times, most recently about a month ago. And nothing has prevented the crashes from coming back, or even changed their frequency.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows a fix for this, please share it. I still very much enjoy League and love maining support, but the more times this crash happens the less I want to risk another match.","replies":[{"poster":"ZhonLord","date":"2016-09-09T20:44:35.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crash happened again.  Forced computer shutdown, randomly in the middle of the game.\n\nThis time I've checked my graphics updates, clean-reinstalled League, and downloaded/installed .net framework 3.5. I've also done a factory defaults for my graphics, though it didn't appear to do anything.  We'll see if this continues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T20:44:03.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full computer crashes or system lockups are often a sign there's something going wrong with either your hardware or drivers.

I've also run the League repair again, defragmented my hard drive, and cleaned up a lot of TEMP files.
