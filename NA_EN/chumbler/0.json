First, again? Who's said that before? Second, I've played I've played it on the PBE too. The Q last-hitting feels fine to me, and I've gotten quite a few situations where I can poke someone while farming with it (which helps improve him over the live Veigar's problem with last-hitting vs poking). I don't really find myself getting into awkward positions to last-hit the ranged minions very often, and it's pretty much never more exposed than it is on live. I think it's just better, in pretty much any given situation. I never find myself wanting the old Q.\n\nIf you want an \"on-paper\" problem, then here's my suggestion. On-paper, the E change looks absolutely devastating. In practice, it's not nearly so damning as everyone claims. \n\n>And his E range is meaningless. Trust me. And please don't talk about mana or cooldown changes, they are even more meaningless.\n\nE range is helpful. Even 50 range goes a long way towards mitigating the . I don't know why you're bringing up mana and cooldowns given that I didn't even mention them, but if you want to discuss them so much, then I think that the mana buffs are pretty minor but the cooldown buffs can potentially be quite helpful, especially given the increased damage the W will be doing from increased stacking. \"Meaningless\" isn't one of the words I'd use to describe them.\n\nI like this rework. It may need some small buffs, but that can be done. I know people overestimate the E nerf and they underestimate everything he's getting. People always underestimate range changes.
