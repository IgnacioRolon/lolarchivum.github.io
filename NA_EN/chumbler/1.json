Especially when said balance decisions are just dumpstering a champion without actually doing anything to resolve the scripting issue.\n\nOn the plus side, maybe if scripters start using Lee Sin Riot will actually delete him.

If other people can do just a minor amount of cc, the fed, raw dps champs, can easily come in and clean house.\n\nThe problem is that snowballing is a mid-late game feature which is meant to share your feed with your team. You become unstoppable, and make sure you win every fight, so your team can then take objectives. The problem is in the application of snowballing, where you see people become unstoppable with no counterplay. A level 6 ultimate that can be used 3 times in one minute is stupidly strong. Even if you deny the full ultimate, it hemorrhages damage making it impossible to keep her pinned for long.\n\nI honestly wish that players would think before they complain. You are comparing a champion (lee sin) who's only good at forcing a snowball on either himself or others in the early/mid game. To a champion meant to nuke people at all stages of the game post level 6. Their purposes are completely different and they should be treated as such.\n\nAnother player mentioned a 70% ban rate in Korea. A lot of people in the NA server think Ezreal sucks, but he is one of the safest and easiest marksmen to win bot lane with, and the Koreans can prove that one. Look at Korean stats before you complain. If they are winning 60% of the time or more with just one champion, it needs to be looked at to see if it is op, or the players have found some mechanic that makes it op.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matthevv","date":"2014-11-09T19:29:15.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The difference being the difficulty for playing as and against these champions.

Also you seem to have missed that the comment about Lee Sin was that he *on his own* dictated the jungle for an entire season (arguably more) and has no real weaknesses, and next season's jungle is looking like a giant buff to him, while Kat has clear weaknesses, does literally one thing for a team, and has come back into play only because everyone else got nerfed. Yet only one of the two gets the nerf bat.
