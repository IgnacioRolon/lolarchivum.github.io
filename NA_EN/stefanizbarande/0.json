Any possible fixes/solutions/advices? ( im sure my pc can run it as i said i used to play on 120 whole season 6 and start of season 7.. ) - I checked are the drivers up to date.. and few days ago i started playing other games like tf2, planetside2, infestation : newz.. theyr working perfectly fine thought newz is not good optimized but im getting more fps in those games then in league and they are more playable...","replies":[{"poster":"StefanizBarande","date":"2017-04-04T15:16:10.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im done with sending you all the nessesary files about finding out why is it happening, i think minions on Summoner rift have to do something with it.
