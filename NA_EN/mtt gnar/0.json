I didn't even do anything to anyone. Ya'll need to stop making me think I'm some kind of moron when I really am not. And no, I didn't know that muting wouldn't affect friends, so don't remind me, I already know now (thank you to Deep Terror Nami for explaining, I humbly apologize)\n\nEDIT 2: Love how people are judging me for playing bot games instead of PvP and Ranked like the \"normal players\" do. Nice job guys. Nice community. I expected this community to not be so salty towards me, but of course I got the short end of the stick.\n\nLuckily I haven&#039;t done any PVP games (yet, mainly cuz I still don&#039;t feel ready), but I am not happy with how players treat their team. \n\nTo be honest, if I had a toxic player, I would just mute them until the game is over. I wouldn&#039;t speak to them, because it would make me toxic as well if I was toxic back.\n\nWord to those who are being toxic back to a toxic player: DON&#039;T. It will get you suspended.\n\nNow, let&#039;s take a look at the int. feeders. Int. feeding just because someone banned your champion, for example. Yeah, don&#039;t do that. Int. feeding is a huge no-no. If I have an int. feeder in my team, they&#039;ll sure as hell regret it.\n\nWord to int. feeders: STOP IT. Just don&#039;t do it.\n\nNow the AFKers. AFKing because your team is losing or whatever will make your team lose even more.\n\nWord to AFKers: No. Just don&#039;t do that.

Bot games won't really teach you anything, he's just trolling himself since he's just going to be playing at the same skill level until level 25 (not a good idea to be level 25 still playing at a newbie level. \nI haven't played a bot game since level 5 and if I didn't start normals at level  5,  I'd still think tower diving or just going under the tower to kill someone at low hps = instant death. Never would've bought Diana either. Going against smurfs or having one on your team can also make you see some strong techniques or tricks which you wouldn't see or learn from bots. Or even basic things like CSing and harassing your opponent in Lane. \nOr just the importance of warding (I was bored and decided to check his op.gg and noticed he had 0 wards placed in all his normals) \n\nTL;DR\n\nI think the OP is just putting himself at an far below average skill level by doing what he's doing.

The best advice i could give is to play Solo pvp games as you get matched with people your level/mmr so that way there&#x27;s no unfair advantage, of course she&#x27;s going to play a few bot games to get used to the map, csing, killing, flashing over walls, spawn times, and champs. Watching youtube videos of basic tips is also very helpful as well and once you put them to play in bot games and are comfortable with them you can start practicing them in normal games :) This post is very true about the toxicity in this game it&#x27;s pretty terrible no matter what level or rank you are, there are always toxic people no avoiding it you just have to ignore them and learn from your mistakes. Usually people are toxic for a reason such as feeding or people inting but there&#x27;s always room to improve and once you do you&#x27;ll start to find less people are toxic towards you, and if they are then you can always mute them and then unmute them when it gets around mid game and then if they&#x27;re still toxic then mute them again FOREVERRR :P But good luck in your games play more pvp By yourself as they match you up with people your level!\n\nExtremely rude? Is that your opinion or a fact? How would I know what she needs to improve on when she has no match history. What does \"Solo pvp games\" even mean? Normals and ranked? Normals is random players so she could very well play against a premade team of 4 platinums and get stomped. The placements will likely be the same. She is afraid to see how good she is which is why she won't play ranked or normals. You can't teach people how to be competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"MomoMurderx","date":"2017-07-15T12:59:38.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TwoChikfilaSauce,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=R7XtzxAu,comment-id=00030000000000000000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2017-07-15T03:52:41.962+0000)\n>\n> Extremely rude?

When she gets up to level 30 of course she wouldn't be ready to do placements so why would she? but playing from an earlier level in normals gets you matched up with people with YOUR mmr not so much as Random like all level 30 and ranked people, there are more people in NA servers so she'd definitely get matched up with people around her level, she needs to play at a earlier level to understand the game, play styles for champions and also building a champion pool is best, wouldn't you think if she has no match history that she's a newer player? She isn't afraid to see how good she is, she explained in her post that she's afraid of the toxic people, she played ONE normal game with a level 30 player and got matched up with people their level, if she played normals by her self she'll definitely find it alot more easier to learn rather than getting stomped on, i do think your posts are rude because you're just shit talking her instead of being nice and telling her advice and what to do?

Oh, so when I started a new account and I'm a Gold I player on other accounts I guess she won't get matched with me because Riot can deduce that information, huh? Smurfs don't exist, right? Oh I see, so when I was Bronze 4 on this account and getting matched with Platinum players in normals that was because their MMR and my MMR were similar? Do you even play this game dude? If she has no match history what it tells me is she doesn't play this game and I have no idea why she's on this forum complaining about toxicity when she doesn't even play the game. Of course she is afraid to see how good she is which is why she sits in bot games with friends instead of going to the deep end of the pool and playing normal matches. What to do? You can't offer advice to a person who doesn't play anything but bot games and has no match history. I'm not a mind reader, bro.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MTT Gnar","date":"2017-07-15T13:01:07.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MomoMurderx,realm=OCE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=R7XtzxAu,comment-id=0003000000000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2017-07-14T22:47:13.950+0000)\n>\n> She is a new player it&#x27;s not very nice being extremely rude, especially since You are better so wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to tell her things that she could improve on? rather than shit all over her?
