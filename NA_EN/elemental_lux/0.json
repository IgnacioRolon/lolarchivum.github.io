Why not have an option to purchase the \"needed funds\" like the Nintendo Eshop and some other online systems do. Just round to the nearest dollar in your favor and if its  more than $10, factor in the bonus RP.\n\nWriting this while I have 57 RP and there's no way to spend it + buying RP and getting any currently existing skin will leave me with some random number remaining.\n\nThat said, I do like to see Riot being open minded about various user's unique situations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elemental Lux","date":"2016-11-27T00:12:54.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Dirrty","date":"2016-12-11T12:12:34.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elemental Lux,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=44AGo1HE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-27T00:12:54.362+0000)\n>\n> Thank you very much for your time.\n\nHey dude, did they gave you those 13rp?
