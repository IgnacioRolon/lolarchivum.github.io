What was Annie's weakness? Because some of the simplest champs have practically no weaknesses. Did you know Amumu has typically been the highest winrate jungler for years, yet he's one of the oldest champs? \"Having no weaknesses\" doesn't just depend on the abilities of the champ. It also depends on their cooldowns, mana costs (or lack of), range, and damage. \n\nThresh has many weaknesses. His hook opens him up to retaliation, since he drags himself to the enemy instead of dragging them to him. Conversely, Blitz's hook is weaker against initiators, since you don't want to drag an amumu into your team. He has practically no burst damage. His range is bad. He has no sustain. It's interesting to note that being a ranged initiator makes relic shield suck pretty badly on him, compared to the typical melee champs you see bot lane. Why? Because he can't execute minions, so he relies on E to get last hits. If you use the passive portion of E to lasthit minions, you won't be using it to harass the enemy. On the other hand, coin / spellthief don't offer the survivability he needs, so he's in a place where there really isn't a great support item for him. \n\nEkko's strong weaknesses are: his incredibly crappy damage scaling on his basic abilities, his requirement to land melee attacks (which opens him up for retaliation) to do most of his damage, his lack of reliable CC (his W has a 3 second delay, his Q can easily be walked out of), and his subpar burst compared to other assassins.\n\nLeBlanc's strong weaknesses are her lack of AoE (she has to use her escape to waveclear, which leaves her open to ganks / harass), her lack of CC (she just has a delayed root, many mages have stuns or silences, viktor has both for example), her complete lack of sustain, and the fact that she's practically useless if she doesn't do well early. I don't really consider Leblanc's kit overloaded, anyway. She's fairly simple to use / play.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-05-31T14:58:44.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Thresh has many weaknesses.

He is also able to freely use his other abilities during this time.\n\n> He has practically no burst damage. His range is bad. He has no sustain. \n\nNot having burst isn't a weakness, his AA is ranged along with a hook to bring him to people or bringing them to his team. Not having sustain is not a weakness, majority of champions do not have any sustain, and thresh is capable of dealing a of damage.\n\n> It's interesting to note that being a ranged initiator makes relic shield suck pretty badly on him.\n\nAlso not a strong weakness, never had a problem, or seen a problem of people using the relic shield on him.\n\n\n> Ekko's strong weaknesses are: his incredibly crappy damage scaling on his basic abilities, his requirement to land melee attacks (which opens him up for retaliation) to do most of his damage, his lack of reliable CC (his W has a 3 second delay, his Q can easily be walked out of), and his subpar burst compared to other assassins.\n\nPassive: At 3 stacks the target takes **「 15 + (12 × Ekko's level) 」(+ 70% AP)** bonus magic damage and is Slow icon slowed by 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% for 2 / 2.5 / 3 seconds.\n\nQ:  Combined Damage: 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 / 280 (+ 80% AP) 」 (If you land it back and forth, which is easy given all the slows)\n\nW:  Shield Strength: 150 / 195 / 240 / 285 / 330 (+ 80% AP)\n\nE:  Bonus Magic Damage: 50 / 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 (+ 20% AP)\n\nR: Magic Damage: 200 / 350 / 500 (+ 130% AP) Heal: 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 20 / 25 / 30%「 (+ 1% per 30 AP) 」of damage taken).\n\nNot to mention the high as hell base stats, but if you want to call these bad damage scalings then you might need to go look at some other champions.\n\n> his requirement to land melee attacks\n\nAgain not a strong weakness, He has several ways of poking you down without going near you throughout the laning phase and doesn't seem gated by mana in the slightest.\n\n>  his lack of reliable CC (his W has a 3 second delay\n\nEnemies do not gain vision of the target area until the last 0.5 seconds.

She's fairly simple to use / play.\n\nNope nope nope. \n\nYou are under the impression strong weakness means something that might inconvenient someone, as an Assassin Le Blanc is overloaded as shit, with massive damage that can be dealt in a split second, escapes out the ass, and being able to say \"lolmana?\" She is overloaded as an assassin, just as Thresh is overloaded as a support, and just as Ekko seems to have his black hand in every damn kit in the game. A strong weakness is something that can be solved simply by altering your playstyle slightly and removing it entirely, no sustain is not a strong weakness, it is an inconvenience that majority of champions resolve easily.","replies":[{"poster":"XLC","date":"2015-05-31T16:27:06.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Enemies do not gain vision of the target area until the last 0.5 seconds.

I wish people wouldn't pretend the game has to be either 125 overloaded kits or 125 braindead kits - there are so, so many champions who are in between the two extremes of difficulty. No, I don't think anyone wants a game where everyone is Annie, but that shouldn't mean everyone has to be Ekko either and up until very recently it didn't. Riot didn't just go from making incredibly simple champions to incredibly complex ones over night - over the last few years we've gotten some amazingly crafted champions with lots of room for skill expression without being overloaded and that's the sort of thing I think we should go back to. \n\nI watched LCS last night and in a particular game there was Gnar, Azir, Kalista, Rek'Sai and Bard. Literally the 5 most recently released champions in one match and every one of them is among the very strongest of their roles in competitive play. I don't want champs to be needlessly simple - nobody needs another Annie. But I wish every newly released kit wouldn't include everything a champ could possibly want in their respective roles.

Her ult is 150, 225, 300 +70% AP. Her shockwave can be flashed out of relatively easily. Ekko's ult is 200, 350, 500 + 130% AP. It also heals him and makes him invulnerable during activation and it's a lot quicker than Orianna's ult. I know, assassin vs mage so yes damage blah blah.

His numbers are a bit overtuned across the board, but a few small taps should fix it up.\n\n1.  His mana cost on his abilities are near non-existant if not talking about Q.   Ekko has a decently hard time going OoM because of this.  This means more timewinders to dodge (his only real high costing ability) and more dashing around for him.  His ult doesn't even cost mana for some reason.  No clue why, but it doesn't.\n\n2.  His W should scale per rank on stun duration (Seriously, the only broken thing about it is he has access to his full duration stun at rank 1.  1 point wonder much?  No other hard CC that last so long and isn't an ult STARTS at that length.).  1.25 - 1.5 - 1.75 - 2 - 2.25.  Fixed.  This will also mean he has to use that shield in a fight against an enemy if he stuns them, rather than having it expire before the enemy even is un-stunned.\n\n\n\nChange this first.  Change his hidden power, not his real power, then lets get a feel for how he is.   Already next patch one of his biggest items is getting a pretty sizable nerfs (Luden's Echo got a small AP ratio nerf and stacks at half value from spell-cast.

Yes it's a 2.25 second area stun. After a THREE SECOND DELAY.\n\nAnd on his ult: Four second delay before it catches up to him. If he's right next to you, you have four seconds to move a couple of steps to the side before he can ult you. You outpredict him, he can slap you around a bit with a foam bat before having to use his ult to get away(instead of dealing damage) because he has the survivability of wet tissue paper.\n\nIf you get hit by Ekko's stun or ult, you're going to have a bad time. It's like if Cho'Gath had a 3 second delay on Rupture before anyone got knocked up. If he can't hit any of his MASSIVE DELAYS on his abilities, he deals almost no damage unless you're at very low health.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JZPorkins","date":"2015-05-30T15:55:54.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"from what i recall it's missing health and not maximum health.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegitBacon66","date":"2015-05-30T13:11:21.727+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only when the target is below 30% HP","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkhub","date":"2015-05-30T09:45:03.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Poor kids QQ all the damn time, he dies easily so he needs somethink\nfor replace stop with those pathetic QQ threads. ..nerf this nerf That.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2015-05-30T19:40:53.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The ignorance...
