When I come back I haven't disconnected and started walking back to base though, all of my button presses made during this period are done(if I'm I press R as Sejuani then the R will fling out the moment when I get control of my champion again) and I play as normal until the next one.\r\n\r\n I can get these from 2 to 6 times a game(usually 2 to 4) and I am also having these problems with OverWatch.","replies":[{"poster":"eXoPwns","date":"2017-10-21T05:35:16.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens to me constantly, except it causes me to dodge games by not reconnecting and letting me lock in a champ.

While it could be a routing issue I'm not sure it would disconnect you entirely but instead just give you higher ping.  \n\nStart off with the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide as this may be local issue that can be resolved through that.
