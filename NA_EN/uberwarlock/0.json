Help needed:not given the option to reconnect to a live game","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uberwarlock on NA. I was playing a ranked game when suddenly my ping spiked to 500 and I got the \"attempting to reconnect message\". It was taking a while so I pulled up the escape menu and left the game. I wanted to then click the reconnect to game in progress option in the middle of the the lol client. But it wasn't there. I restarted my client multiple times and I restarted my computer. But the client behaves as if I am not in a game. even though i was given no indication that my game in progess ended and op.gg's live game feature shows that i am currently in a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-13T22:50:45.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh this is a really rare bug when the game completely crashes server side. Since the game crashed, you won't be able to rejoin since it's no longer in progress. Seeing as this was an error on the game itself and you didn't intentionally quit, you shouldn't get any penalties for that match and you'll be able to requeue for a new one.","replies":[]}]}
