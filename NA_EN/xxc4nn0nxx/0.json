Any Idea why there is so much botting happening in ARAM mode?  I get on maybe once or twice a week to play a good ARAM game, maybe once or twice we would get a bot with the 8-9 live players.  Now, it seems to be completely the other way around, 8-9 of the players are bots ( and you don&#039;t have to look that awful hard to determine they are bots ).  \r\nI really like ARAM game mode and would like it to continue, but right now it seems that I can&#039;t.  Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2017-02-08T23:53:53.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit 30, get your ARAM MMR up...Bots are gone then.\nBots are always gonna be an issue.\nThey do ban them in waves so whoever is making/using them can't figure out what triggers the system.","replies":[{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2017-02-08T23:57:30.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SrbLud,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lEMGqrKA,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-08T23:53:53.473+0000)\n>\n> Hit 30, get your ARAM MMR up...Bots are gone then.\n> Bots are always gonna be an issue.\n> They do ban them in waves so whoever is making/using them can&#x27;t figure out what triggers the system.\n\nevery time i hear about a ban wave i just thing of a giant tidal wave of spinning ban hammers >.<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skihl","date":"2017-09-30T05:55:33.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am a level 30 and i experience allot of bots just played a game where my team was 4 bots and me.

Specific to ARAM. Sometimes you have 0 bots, sometimes you have 9. Sometimes your team is all bots, sometimes the enemy team is. I dunno, but looking at it like a \"lottery\" of sorts makes it a little easier to stomach all the botting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-08T23:48:37.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never seen a bot in ARAM. \nIs it a new account, or suffering from extremely low ELO?
