But the ult nerf.... really? He cannot even stand a chance against assassins since they can retaliate faster after he pushes them off of him. And it&#039;s because the slow doesn&#039;t last long enough anymore. He can&#039;t even stop runners with his ult anymore, since they just get away and you have just wasted your ult :(","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Palpat√≠ne","date":"2016-04-06T23:38:55.099+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel it was too early to nerf or buff him.

If you use your Q(or ult post six) to trade, you are a free kill.\n\nHe has a huge ass dead zone because you cant instantly activate Q to stay alive.\n\nHe is a niche pick that requires teamwork.\n\nZed went unnerfed an entire split and sol didnt last one patch?\n\nI seriously can't believe it.\n\nNow go loom at Tarics rework and go wtf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"draakar","date":"2016-04-06T23:43:05.882+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"By nerfing him they've stopped most people from trying to learn him.
