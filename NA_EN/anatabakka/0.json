It's only an ingame bug that happened with my point of view. It doesn't seem to be like this in the replay. \n\nIn my point of view rammus left the fog of war with an incredible speed, much greater than the one shown in the replay. They go very fast when they leave fog of war then always slow down. I'm saying that this is a bug because it happened numerously times, and i'm sick of it. It may be because of my pc.\n\nAlso: There's another vfx bug that happens a lot. Many times enemy players move backward while looking forward (like lucian), it happened with all champs.\n\nAlso2: When i recall and then i cancel it by moving, i'm seen recalling while moving, even tho i'm not, and in the replay i'm moving normally, happened most of the times with Warring Kingdoms Katarina","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-26T23:37:44.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never noticed this before to be honest with you!

It's really strange. I can't post a video of it because my game will run very slow, and since replay doesn't show exactly what happens on my side.\n\nBtw: Wouldn't be cool to have an option on the replay feature to see things the same way a player sees? Not like in spectator mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-27T05:13:19.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read the full post and it did seem like firewall wasn't completely free with lol (don't know if that has something to do with vfx). \n\nSo i placed all of those to \"All Connections\", this won't get me hacked trough lol, right?\n\nWill reply again if i see it didn't work out.
