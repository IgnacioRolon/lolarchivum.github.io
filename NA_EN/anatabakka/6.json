Illaoi's E reflection formulas","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all when i say damage reduction i mean damage reduction of the vessel (vessel and spirit can have different armor/mr values). This is what i found:\n\n1. If your reflected damage (based on E's ratio) is higher than \"spirit's current hp*****damage reduction\" you will reflect damage based on \"spirit's current hp*****damage reduction\".\n2. Otherwise you will reflect damage based on your E's ratio.\n\nTLDR: Reflected damage in excess of the Spirit's current health (including resistances) is not redirected.\n\nPS: I placed it in the bug reports but it got deleted by riot รง.รง, and they told me to post it in the support section. Maybe it's because i forgot the \"This is what i found\" part. Anyway can you tell me? After this i may repost it in the bug section","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-15T21:46:52.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Illaoi main, I feel a bit ashamed to say I'm not actually sure what the *intended* result is. I feel like it should be redirecting any excessive damage as well, but I haven't had a hard answer from anyone just yet. Feel free to repost this back in Report a Bug if you think it's not working correctly!","replies":[]}]}
