Player support doesn't have context or visibility on server operations or the language used, and I'm not going to try and make an incorrect guess.  I recommend using Ask Riot to field your question to the proper team, or discuss this on the [gameplay ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)boards.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-10-14T18:15:29.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can't ask riot lol. i press \"ask riot\" it tells me i have to login, then it does its things and brings me to https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/ i then go to ask riot again, and it tells me i have to login again.

It seems odd seeing as French is the official language of Canada and Haiti while Spanish is the official language of Mexico and several other countries ( full list here http://download.travlang.com/Ergane/northam.htm ).
