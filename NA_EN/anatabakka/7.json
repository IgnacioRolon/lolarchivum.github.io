After i left the game this little client showed up. I could still press the \"Play button\" but everything else not. \r\n\r\nIn the end (NOT SHOWN IN THE VIDEO) i had to end the program by going in task manager. After i ended it, it restarted by itself. And brough me back to my account (WITHOUT CONNECTING) and the client had the default 1024x576 resolution. I had to switch it back to my 1280x720 one.\r\n\r\nShould i send you my logs?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-31T03:04:25.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's check your client options really quickly if you can, and look for the one called \"close client during game\". Sometimes this can happen if that option is turned on, since the client is trying to reopen but hits this weird error. Uncheck that option, and you should be good to go but definitely hit me back if this doesn't help.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-31T03:22:37.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It never happened with the option checked.  it actually happened with that option unchecked xD. I had uncheked it because i didn't want to wait much time after continously leaving practice mode.\n\nEDIT: I found the jerk. Basically my desktop screen is set to 1920x1080 resolution. In game i usually use 1280x768. Today i found out i see better with 1280x720, but it does take some time for my screen to adjust (it slowly tries to center it). \n\nWell the problem is with the 1280x720 resolution in **full screen ** (i get that little client every time with these settings), if i use it borderless everything is ok.","replies":[]}]}]}
