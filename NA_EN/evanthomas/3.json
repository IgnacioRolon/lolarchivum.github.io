For one, you flat out could not miss cs under tower, and for two, Shen's pushing power without tiamat or bamis was actually stupid. It had a lot of bonus damage on top of the max %hp damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Hentai Homie","date":"2017-04-06T04:14:04.212+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen is also one of the few top champions that has to have his wave pushed to under tower. Do you want him to be too weak to fight in a neutral lane position, have no range to harass people farming under their tower, and not be able to cs under his own tower? His pushing power compared to other top laners is pretty poor. He only gets good pushing power when he gets sunfire or a tiamat. Also have to take into account that when he does get to the tower, he has nothing to kill it with. He gets no steroid or Qing towers, no damage from items on tower, and has no abilities to melt towers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pelyt","date":"2017-04-06T01:29:52.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand some changes to try to make the use of Shen's ult more in line with non ranked usage (defensive ult rather than agressive teleport), but these changes feel like a nerf to both play styles.  At rank 1 Shen's ult will now potentially do 30 extra shields (about half of a level 1 adc basic attack) if you wait until they are almost dead before you cast it.  Currently (especially at rank 1), I find I have to cast my shield before people are taking damage (or right as it starts) for them to even have a chance to survive long enough for my teleport to work.  In this scenario it means 75 less total shields will be provided (250 -> 175 according to the article linked above not sure how accurate that is).\n\nI am curious if there were any alternate considerations to reward the types of play that you want.  For example:\n\n* Refund ult cooldown if the person shielded has either recently taken or proceeds to take 'X' amount of damage in the next few seconds after ult is cast. (or as a matter of framing ... perhaps increase the ult cooldown if the person is above a health percentage or does not take damage after the ult)\n* Change the shield to something like a % damage reduction so the person is likely to survive some burst (perhaps even just damage reduction during the channel followed by a weak shield after it is completed)\n* Scale the channel duration of the teleport based on how low the person is (that is if someone is really low on health maybe the channel takes half the normal time) so you have a chance to show up and help\n\nI really like the concept of Shen and have been practicing to try to get decent at him, but he feels so weak compared to other champs that seeing a nerf to him seems a bit silly.  Another alternative that I can see would be in itemization for AP tanks so that Shen could actually invest in some AP items that actually have useful tank stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-04-04T22:55:23.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you guys happy with ult CD change as not gonna lie its massive","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvanThomas","date":"2017-04-04T22:43:40.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I missed that on the tooltip.

The other nerfs to the champs will be hard enough for Shen jungle. \n\nHi Meddler and other Riot employes. \nI'm a Shen jungle main that writes to you in hope you read the post and take another thought about the impact of the changes to shen jungle. \nI understand that you can't reply to all post, or maybe even read all but I would appriciate if you would or even gave some more context about your thought on Shen jungle.\nThe decreased base damage on q will have a large impact on shens jungle clear. At level 1-3 he will loose 10 dmg per hit with q and from level 4-6 the damage will de decreased with 30 dmg per hit. These numbers are including the extra damage that shens q will do the monsters. \nIn the jungle Shen's main clear is from his Q so what may seem like low numbers have a big impact on his early and midgame. \nThese levels are the pre full jungle item and the time when shen get's punished the most by meta junglers that already pre change have a stronger waveclear and in many cases greater gank possibilties. \n\nThe need to balance shen top is understandable from a competative perspective. And the change to his ult, most noticable the extended cooldown will hit Shen jungle as well. \nI would not call Shen jungle oppresive in the current meta but rather a niche pick with pretty bad matchups versus several meta picks. Lee Sin and Kha Zix are two examples. \nMy hope is simply not destroy Shen jungle waveclear is it already was one of his weaknesses against the current meta junglers. \nHe will feel of all the others changes to the champion and it would be a loss if they all combined hit shen jungle so hard that it would be completly unviable. \nEspecially since shen jungle was not the problem to begin with. \nNeither champion.gg or op.gg even have enough data count him as a jungle option in ranked. \n\nMy suggested solution is to change the damage to monsters to keep it at the current numbers. He will still feel the other nerfs but at least will be able to survive in the jungle. \n\nThank you for reading.\n// Fibien","replies":[]}]}
