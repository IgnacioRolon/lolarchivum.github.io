You've probably had previous punishments and thats how it goes. You shouldnt give up on the idea that you maybe are being stubborn about how you deal with the situation you're in. I mean, LoL has standards in their chat use. Just learn what they are. It's self preservation dude. Dont take it as some moral life lesson. Theyre just a fucking corporation. A business operating under capitalism. They are doing whats best for their business. Its not \"giving in\" to just follow the rules. Its kind of smart and requires a strong mind to learn how to not get emotional over anonymous strangers and their ability to play a video game. Try to look at it from that perspective. \n\nIts just a game.... and you fucking love it... its league.. but youre getting banned because you just flat out refuse to follow the rules on some moral ground about social issues and how you should be allowed to speak however you want. And then you just cant stand how other people talk to you. Youre playing yourself man. Youre allowing all of this to ruin your enjoyment of the game.
