What happens from there is they either drop from champ select (which is fine), flame if they don&#039;t get the role they really want, or they play the role horribly with the wrong kind of champion and ruin the game. I wonder if Riot can implement a point based system where you have to play so many normal matches in each role before you can qualify to play ranked. They already have the level 30 requirement which as we all know helps, but not much. In my opinion if you&#039;re going to take the next step to playing in the ranked system where most people actually care about winning and losing their matches, then I think that you should be able to play all roles with a reasonable amount of skill. I&#039;m not saying you should have to master each role, but playing ranked knowing that at some point you will have to fill you should be able to play all roles, otherwise you&#039;re doing a disservice to yourself and your team. This humble suggestion would I believe rectify this problem, and make ranked a more equitable and enjoyable experience for all summoners who want to take their game to the next level.","replies":[]}
