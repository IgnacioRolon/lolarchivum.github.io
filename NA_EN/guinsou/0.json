Discuss!","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It keeps bothering me, how a second IE is the new meta build for Jhin when from what I can see ER just offers more for 200G less. \r\nI feel like I'm missing something. \r\n\r\nGoing for a second IE you're getting 10AD more than you would with ER and that's it, while\r\nby grabbing an ER you do get 10AD less but imo the 20% CDR and the decent mana regen \r\nwhen running low more than makes up for that. On top of which you spend 200G less.\r\nThe only upside I see in getting the second IE is the fact  that you will be sitting on a B.F.Sword\r\nuntil you finish the item. Although, caulfield's isn't bad either. Not to mention the waste of\r\nvalue from the IE passive.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing your opinion on the matter.","replies":[]}
