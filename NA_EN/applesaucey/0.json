U clearly don't understand why you were punished, your continuing your toxic language here.\n\nReally? why not. Last I checked we had freedom of speech. This was the internet where 5 years ago no one would have batted an eye at this, including riot. And this argument doesn't change the fact you have the tools to protect your delicate sensibilities without dishing out unjust punishment upon another person.","replies":[{"poster":"MadMad Sickness","date":"2017-11-12T07:47:13.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Applesaucey,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Rq1VZEIA,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-11-12T07:22:02.104+0000)\n>\n> Really? why not.

It doesn't protect you anywhere else and especially not in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Applesaucey","date":"2017-11-12T07:52:14.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Last I checked freedom of speech was a core value of the internet.

They have an entire cyber division dedicated just for weeding out those things.  It's not perfect, but it's there.  \n\nEven the dark web is monitored somewhat (whether it's successfully done so is besides the point, it's a cat and mouse game).\n\nAnyway \"the law\" is everywhere, you will always be restricted one way or the other.  And most of those restrictions are to prevent anarchy and also to protect other people's safety (such as protecting from terrorism, for example).","replies":[{"poster":"Applesaucey","date":"2017-11-12T08:17:48.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Things that pose potential IRL threats are policed.... sometimes. it is incredibly hit and miss.
