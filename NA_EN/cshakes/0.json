Tristana is only the beginning quite honestly.\n\nI agree with you that you should be redefining what the Yordles look like, that what is old and unneeded should be discarded if it can be made to clarify what we are meaning to see and helping establish worldbuilding and create a baseline for designs for a unique race of League of Legends.\n\nI don't think old Tristana ever resembled a Yordle even post the Megling retcon, but I don't think the redesign for Tristana was enough. It's a good start, but I don't feel she's a Yordle, despite sexual dimorphism being the reason on why she looks different. What immediately stands out to me are how drastically different she is in comparison to the Yordles and how many similarities she has with Fizz, a being of no established race. \n\nWhat immediately caught my eye about Tristana's redesign is how differently proportioned and physically different she is in comparison to any of the male Yordles. Aside from only having fur on her ears (and I suppose her head), she has blue, smooth skin and a very feminine body shape, hips included, compared to any of the squat male Yordles. Her eyes are also much larger than most of the male Yordles, save for perhaps Ziggs, and the entire facial structure of Tristana feels very similar to that of an Asura from Guild Wars.\n\nSexual dimorphism seen in nature, such as cardinals, doesn't make it confusing as to what species it is: They are both birds, though one is red and one is more of dull peach color. Spiders the same, one may be larger than the other, but you won't mistake a spider to be a fish.\n\nThis is my current problem with Tristana: she looks more similar to Fizz in every sense than she does look to be a Yordle. They're blue smooth skin, giant cartoony eyes, short but lithe, curvilinear distinctly humanoid bodytype with big, almost drooping ears (or ear-like appendages).\n\nAny of the male Yordles have squat, squished body features, various fur patterns and are much more animalistic in their appearance.\n\nI think Tristana's design could have been pushed further, to completely eradicate any remnants of \"Megling\" because she is, by far and large, not a Megling anymore and nothing should evoke it. \n\nMy problem with all of the female yordles has been that I don't immediately associate them with the Yordle race, I have to remind  myself that they are the same species when the truth of the matter is that Tristana was not originally designed to look like a Yordle, was not designed to be a Yordle, and was designed to be a different race hence the blue skin and white hair that both she and Poppy have.\n\nI almost feel like some hints of fur on her body, or even having a Calico cat pattern on her skin, something that removed the last traces of the Megling race that has not been relevant for more than 5 years would have helped differentiating Tristana from her old shackles and helped the Yordle unification much more.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-01-16T23:55:05.934+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently you're only judging her against 1 formalized and 1 semi-formalized male yordles.

I hope you didn't take offense to what I said, because I am, like many other players, in the dark about a lot of matters, especially about the Yordles. I am actually really happy you're clarifying questions players do have about the Trist update. \n\nBut I do have two more questions I wish to ask, for the sake of clarification. \n\nThe first is me being completely honest, the truth of the matter is that I wasn't sure if all of the male Yordles were going to be updated along with Trist and Poppy. What I mean by this is not Teemo, he's as old a model as they are and desperately needs an update, but does this mean that Heimerdinger and Ziggs would be receiving a VU in the future as well, or are they to be the baseline for the other male Yordles to follow?\n\nThe second question is a character design inquiry, does this guarantee that Poppy will have a different body type/silhouette than Tristana? She may not have boots, but will she have the same lithe body type that Tristana has but with a shield and hammer, or will Poppy be the beefy, stocky Yordle whose hammer can shatter the heavens?","replies":[{"poster":"John Berserk","date":"2015-01-17T03:14:52.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimerdinger has already received a VU with the new yordle designs in mind. \n\nhttp://wac.7725.edgecastcdn.net/807725/website/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Q6.jpg\n\nI think Ziggs will receive some anatomy updates, but will otherwise end up looking the same in terms of design.\n\nPoppy will likely be more muscled than Trist, seeing as she's up on the frontlines swinging a giant hammer.","replies":[{"poster":"Kobila2000","date":"2015-01-26T17:24:44.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, well, Leona swings a giant sword and a shield as big as herself and her arms are still as strong as a pair twigs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talamare","date":"2015-01-17T08:51:00.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronStylus,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uplTyxNG,comment-id=000400050000,timestamp=2015-01-16T23:55:05.934+0000)\n>\n> Currently you're only judging her against 1 formalized and 1 semi-formalized male yordles.

If you're going to compare Trist's anatomy to one of them, it should probably be Gnar, as his anatomy is most similar, just smaller (but I accredit that to him being a relatively young yordle, where I see Trist being a young adult).\n\nYou cannot say Trist doesn't look like a yordle while comparing her to old designs, when the point of her redesign is to give a coherent look to all yordles (and the reason they're doing THAT is because, before, they DIDN'T have a coherent design).\n\nBasically, you're looking at this backwards.

It was stated that Ziggs and Lulu were the base for yordle aesthetics, the foundation. That does not mean either fit contemporary yordle standards. When Gnar was released, Riot explained they were closer to their vision of how a yordle should look, and apparently they concluded yordles should be larger in body, ears, and eyes.\n\nGnar has a fairly small body when compared to other yordles, even older Bandle City champions, with the exception of Rumble, but he is explicitly described as a child. In addition, Gnar is a primitive yordle, so his design likely plays a significant factor in deciding the appearance of modern yordles. For example, his eyes are massive, but the pupil dominates them. Tristana also has big eyes, and while they aren't quite so dilated as Gnar's, you can barely see her sclera. Gnar has ears nearly the same size as his head, while Tristana's are only slightly smaller than her skull.\n\nOverall, Riot is moving away from \"tiny, baby smurfs\" for ladies and \"walking hamsters\" for men; no more heads with limbs attached.
