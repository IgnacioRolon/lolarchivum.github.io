Champions like Urgot and Malzahar are examples of champions we continue to ideate on, but just haven’t come up with that knock-out idea yet.\n \n- We definitely look at champions without many skins or that haven't gotten anything in a while. This is something that’s on our minds at all times--Rumble FINALLY got a skin this year, but we took our time to make sure it was the right one. And we've got Skarner on our radar, we just want to make sure we get them something they deserve.\n \n- Complexity of a champion can impact our ability to make something we feel is awesome too. Champions like Kha'Zix and Zac are awesome, but they're a little more complex to make skins for so it takes us some extra time to sort out some of the issues. Zyra/Rumble were in this category as well. We're really happy with the way Graveyard Zyra and Super Galaxy Rumble came out, but they encountered a bunch of road bumps along the way. They were totally worth overcoming, but we need to make sure we leave room to conquer those challenges effectively.\n \n- Popularity does factor in, but it’s not the only factor. There are a lot of variables that go into our champion selection, including time from the last skin the champ has received (as mentioned above!), number of skins the champ has so far, upcoming relevant holidays and events, and many more! We also have to balance this with what some of the other teams are working on too—occasionally, we’ll be ideating on a champ internally that’s getting a VU soon, so we’ll coordinate with the other team to maximize our efforts.\n \nPopularity is just one thing that helps us understand what you guys as players are finding most relevant to League at the time. Sometimes, we’ll come up with an incredible idea that trumps this as well. Again bringing up Rumble here—he was way towards the bottom of most played champions. When we feel like we've got a killer idea we want to get it to players that play that champion, even if they aren't popular at the time.\n \n \nAs a Malzahar main I know what it's like to wait a while for a skin; it’s tough. We want to try to minimize this as much as possible, but unfortunately sometimes it doesn't work out. Main thing I'd like to get across is that just because a skin hasn't come out doesn't mean we've given up! We're usually working through the issues we encounter to try to get some awesome stuff out to people who play that champion as quickly as possible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solash","date":"2014-06-24T00:46:46.578+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever had a feeling of \"We HAVE to make this\" by looking at skin ideas from fanart/suggestions such as:\n\nhttp://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/040/e/0/skin_sketches_by_vegacolors-d6j1m9f.jpg\n\nand\n\nhttp://img2.leaguecraft.com/fan-art/asset/fanart_760px_2343.jpg ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaphypoo","date":"2014-06-23T20:14:52.722+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cursor skin or skins.

Then we pick our favorite elements and do a batch of variants. We continue to narrow the designs until we are pleased. Even after the concept phase is over and the skin if modeled in 3d we make small tweaks. Its quite an organic process and we usually end up doing a lot of revisions per skin.\n\n\n3:   I can't really answer this question adequately since I don't know any numbers related to that. \n\n\n4:   This does happen occasionally and not without good reason. \n\n\n5:   We generally do not like to work that way because we always want to provide the best possible product for the player. It would be a disservice to all our players if we pulled punches on a really cool idea that makes sense for a skin because there might be overlap with something slotted for release far off into the future.\n\n\n6:   What are you trying to do here, get me beat up! Every team here at riot faces vastly different challenges and has different problems to solve, so comparing who has it easier is pretty much impossible, but what I can say is that we have a very rigorous interview process so everyone definitely brings their A game! What I can say is that I personally love skins team so much because of the possibilities to create off the wall alternate fantasies like Arcade, Snowdown, Heartseeker, and Pool-party! \n\n\n7:   I'd love to answer this one but unfortunately I'm not a numbers guy. I just draw pretty pictures!\n\n\n8:   We have experimented with this technique and it is definitely useful for generating a wealth of ideas in a crunch! Whether multiple artists ideate or only one, each skin is tweaked by multiple team members through either verbal feedback or paint-overs. That intensive feedback loop is one of my favorite aspects of working with such a talented team!
