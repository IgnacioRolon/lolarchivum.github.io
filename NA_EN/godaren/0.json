It never got old to me every game felt fresh and different and exciting. But now every game is stale and usually one sided most games are 20 minute surrenders and many games are over in less then that. This week alone I had a 17 minute win a 15 minute loss and a 18 minute loss. People go afk at the drop of a hat now because they know if they fall behind there is no coming back. I don&#039;t really want to quit playing but I just feel like this game is not the same game I fell in love with. I have put in thousands of games and countless hours without a second though. Anyway I I just wanted to hear someones else&#039;s take on the game right now compared to in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2016-01-08T02:40:36.783+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honesty this patch is just a complete mess.

Every new champ like kindred kench and ekko are miles better then old champions leaving you literally 0 reason to play old champions. And then you have to ban them every patch until riot finally nerfs them like they did with Garen and Darius. Meanwhile champions like Yorick or Galio I will go years without seeing them in game and Riot doesn't even have the decency to give them a small buff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Little Stick Man","date":"2016-01-07T23:22:51.705+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"play smite","replies":[{"poster":"Godaren","date":"2016-01-07T23:31:23.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kongquest,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h5iZzodU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-07T23:22:51.705+0000)\n>\n> play smite\n\nI'll give that a try tonight","replies":[{"poster":"Blitzidious","date":"2016-01-08T17:35:44.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or Heroes of the Storm!

I feel like everyone does more damage now and dies faster, and that fits in with the dreadful snowballing pace. Every time I die now I get frustrated by some cheap gimmick that always seems to new to this patch or indirectly buffed. \nDon't get me wrong, I've been calling things OP for 2 years, but I've never felt like this before. I feel like every time I die there's just nothing I can do in the moment to counter it. For instance, playing against Annie, where it's almost impossible for her to not 1 hit a squishy or multiperson stun. \nOr even worse, playing against a garen or darius, who do the most damage in the game yet have 5k HP and can't be peeled at all.\nThis season just seems like its full of gimmicks that leave me saying \"oh come on.\" or \"seriously what am i supposed to do about the 45% CDR fizz that just jumped over my front line and 1 hit me.\"\nI used to be able to blame myself for dying or even blame a teammate when they're feeding, but now it's like, well you were against darius or oh were against soraka no wonder vayne has infinite health despite half our team applying greivous wounds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlunterMonk","date":"2016-01-08T16:51:32.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are thousands of games besides League.
