If you guys are worried about rune costs you can simply make runes free.  Everyone HATES what the game has become, ever since Runes Reforged came out almost all my close friends quit, a lot of my fav streamers have quit, quite a few of the most famous league players from around the world have said they don't enjoy this game like they used to and some have openly stated they hate the current league but only play and stream for the money.  They HATE Runes Reforged WE HATE Runes Reforged, why do you guys keep trying to fix something that can only be fixed with a revert?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"King Braum","date":"2019-01-04T13:24:20.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"alright, thank you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zetres","date":"2019-01-08T01:16:17.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for posting these breakdowns, I really enjoy reading them.

But, not every Rioter works on every project and developers for all sorts of teams are here on the boards, and some aren't. However, not every Rioter views every single board, and not every comment that could be replied to, unfortunately. Gameplay balance devs most likely are not going to be reading the Live Incident Breakdown thread, but they're far more likely to read your comments or threads within gameplay or general discussion. \n\nRiot support also sends you to a variety of places: The KB articles, boards, sometimes even reddit threads. The entire point is to either fix your problem asap, or shed light on a way to fix it. Game balance questions, we can answer what they know, but anything that may be unknown (Why is scaling on Shaco's Q this or that), or something around balance (too much damage, when nerfing champions as a whole?), is 100% not in support's wheelhouse to solve. Aside from us sending your response to the balance team, we can also send you where they lurk, and hope that they may also directly choose to engage on your question or concern.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nuubmaster69","date":"2019-01-04T17:34:19.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"why some of my friends get a normal ping and i got a fair ping which is not good but when i check it using the cdm thingy my ping for gaming was okay. is that the cause of your server? or my connection?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2019-01-04T23:12:49.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Barry4llen,realm=NA,application-id=6WpmgL9O,discussion-id=PBwVEGNQ,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-01-04T17:34:19.605+0000)\n>\n> why some of my friends get a normal ping and i got a fair ping which is not good but when i check it using the cdm thingy my ping for gaming was okay. is that the cause of your server? or my connection?\n\nWell, there's this really cool tool we launched a year or two ago here: https://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/ (Might wanna check it out).\n\nShort answer, is data going from your computer to a ping server is probably a different route than the data your computer will send to our servers and back again. Depending on time of day (morning, evening, late night, afternoon), type of Internet (Wifi vs. Wired, Dial-up, broadband, satellite, etc), balance issues (usually depends on type of day and traffic congestion), your ping can vary throughout the day from morning to afternoon to evening. You might want to contact support, they'll probably have you run trace routes to our servers when it's unusual vs. when it's normal and see what's up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2019-01-03T23:38:45.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate these posts even if they don't relate to balance at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2019-01-03T23:36:39.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info o7 Holidays were well enjoyed, hope you two had a good time as well!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SGT Reckless","date":"2019-01-04T03:40:44.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the update and the work you do!","replies":[]},{"poster":"HetTienXai","date":"2019-01-10T08:11:59.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This fucking game is getting more trash tbh.

Or try playing against it with oracle, you are dead before you get in the range - see these are just some of the issues of balancing that exist related to all the champions that are banned in 99% of matches, you know they are banned for a reason.\n\nRunes are ok the way they are now, they just need some feeling related to progression.

Premades can still trigger others into saying 1 curse word, and spam report them for the lols, players can still afk by just doing random stuff but not helping the team( doing 0 enemy champ dmg), and people still feed by playing recklessly (ill throw a bunch of spells and feed afterwards hopefully i don't kill the enemy champ) and all in hopes of either annoying someone or making your team lose.\n\nBeef up the damn banning system, cleanse the community and start giving a crap about the state of your game, thats the most important advice.\nI know this won't reach anyone important, but its nice to vent and make other players aware of the state the game is in.\n\nEDIT( Maybe Riot actually abuses the fact when players get banned they must buy their Champion Skins and other stuff all over again, maybe that is why this game is still as toxic, interesting right? ) Gotta make a living somehow heh..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raistlin","date":"2019-01-09T21:24:20.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is League of Legends still the game with the most toxicity on the internet?\n\nWhen will someone take its title of the undisputed champion of the most toxic players in one game?\n\nIm not even joking {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gilgayu","date":"2019-01-04T00:57:01.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last month I had a game of noxus blitz where the estimated queue time is 20:00.\nI still got in game after around 1:47 though\n\nI made a post of this in report a bug, but I don't think anyone saw it...","replies":[{"poster":"Couch Commando","date":"2019-01-08T21:54:02.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm,  that's odd.
