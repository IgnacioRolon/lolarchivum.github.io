(Moved to Mondays for easier updates)_\n\nWorlds has some interesting teams moving to knockout stage, TFT set 2 is on PBE and...oh yeah, we had a 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY announcement for League (and a bunch of other games, nbd). \n\n**Follow-Ups:**\n\n* **Mac voice still not working properly** Bug grouped with other Mac bugs\n\n**Ongoing**\n\n* **Transfer service goes down(9/21 - 10/9)** Player Support notifies the NOC that players are getting errors when attempting to transfer between Europe and Oceania (Not 100% failure rate, but not 0% either). This has been fixed as of 10/9! \n\n* **TFT Match History intermittent(9/26 - 10/9)** TFT match history goes live on all regions, and reports start to filter in over the next day that TFT matches aren’t always showing up in match history. This has been fixed as of 10/9! \n\n**Server Stuff: **\n\n* **RP fulfillment issues causing players to not get RP(10/4, ~7 hours)** An alert pops stating a few players redeemed codes, but didn’t get RP. Investigation by payments team found a rounding error with decimals (pesky little things it seems). Players get their RP and the code causing the error is fixed server side. \n\n* **NA is unavailable due to extended HW maintenance(10/7, ~54 minutes)** NA is unavailable for longer than planned from a hardware maintenance. Final QA takes longer than expected, which caused the platform to open for players later than our original plans. \n\n* **Players are unable to checkout with PayOn(10/7, ~2 hours)** Automated alerting notices that PayOn processing is having problems. Payments team uncover that the problem isn’t on Riot’s side. PayOn processing is disabled until PayOn resolves their issue, which they do quickly after being notified. \n\n* **Misconfig leads to players unable to login(10/8, ~4 hours)** Player Support notifies the NOC that there’s a spike of players unable to login. NOC investigates login queue and discovers part of the system is having problems. Network engineers divert traffic away from an affected node, which enables players to log in again. Once the login queue is gone, engineers begin to fix the affected node and then transitions traffic back onto it again. \n\n* **Honor goes down(10/8, ~93 minutes)** Automated alerts notices that Honor rewards are down to 0. Investigation shows a changelist step was done out of order (pushed early) causing the problem. A correct config is pushed out, resuming rewards correctly. \n\n* **Free to play champion rotation not updated(10/15, ~104 minutes)** Automated alerts notify the NOC that champion rotation isn’t pushed properly. NOC manually sets config changes to enable free to play champions for this patch, and gets the automated config updated to work properly with the next patch.\n\n**Game Stuff: **\n\n* **Games in progress killed by accident(10/7, ~4 hours)** The NOC notices various views aren’t updating with data, and rioter reports filter in that players are stuck attempting to reconnect in a TFT match. Investigation leads to a series of config updates taking place, which also incorrectly targeted NA servers instead of PBE servers. The config updates are paused, and all affected players have to endure a ghost game until they can queue up again. \n\n* **TFT traits not displaying or triggering in-game(10/9, ~34 hours)** Player reports filter in that players aren’t getting TFT synergies with proper numbers of units. TFT team identifies that preemptive code changes shipped for future patches caused the issue, and a fix rolls out via a micropatch once being approved by QA. \n\n_Morgageddon_","replies":[{"poster":"Gio Sad Honey","date":"2019-10-23T18:56:16.769+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the love of God fix this Mac bug.

First off if i could have you or someone that knows what is happening help me in any way that would be great. The problem im having is one thats gone on for months. That being, nearly every game i play my game crashes or freezes at 1;30. I have to sign out and come back in. You can understand that you basically lose the game if you start 3 levels behind. And i do. Sometimes i am dced for long enough that the game goes into remake. I buy items, i go to lane, but as soon as my game freezes it remakes. Not only is this a gameplay problem but its gamebreaking. That being i dont get to play if it happens. Please fix this or help me fix this issue. I know its plagued multiple people as well. This kinda ties into issue two. Even though this happened last year as well before my game starting this freezing issue. This one being that i am permanently stuck at honor 3 checkpoint ONE. I honor regularly after games and get honored regularly as well. The reason why this ties in is that I am assuming that me being the remakee is making me go to the system as a \"leaver\" which i am not. This could be the issue im having with gaining other honor. I also know that last year people were reporting the same thing with honor not going up no matter what. This sucks very much for me since i get to be skipped due to a system error. Please make let me know how to \"honor UP\" I havent had to restart because of chat restrictions or anything either. Full year of playing. Honor 3 checkpoint 1 for nearly the whole season. Ranked up to honor 3 as fast as normal players. Stoppped and havent moved in literal months. Now Honestly both issues suck a lot for me.
