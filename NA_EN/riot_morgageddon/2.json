Players can then craft skins, but the Client will think they don&rsquo;t have the new skin until the Player relogs. Until this can be fixed, players may need to relog to see skins they crafted that aren&rsquo;t currently available in the store (legacy/limited skins). \r\n\r\n**Game Stuff: **\r\n\r\n_**Wrong season borders showing in profile (1/8, ongoing)**_ Well, last season ended and we pushed out the banners for last season, but it&rsquo;s not the correct banner and can even show the wrong division as well. To fix it, we&rsquo;ll wait for the next full patch to deploy with 9.2.\r\n\r\n**Player Support Trend:**\r\n\r\nLooks like there&rsquo;s a slightly higher number than normal of log-in issues.

You guys claumed that you wanted less ganks because early level gankers we too prominent. Getting rid of xp in the jungle does the exact opposite it makes ganking essential if a player is not playing a good early level ganker that player can no longer scale and carry the game like before. If you are to keep this change to the jungle you need to seveerly decrease the time it takes for camps to respawn because this makes every farm jungler or jungler that can only gank with lvl 6 useless. I dont understand why every time a new season comes jungle gets another nerf. 2 years from now it feels like jungle is going to be a walking support because the camps are so useless to take.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron Redwolfe","date":"2019-01-30T06:18:11.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you fix your program breaking down?
