We followed through on our promise to roll back [positional ranking](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/03/dev-state-of-ranked/), a high elo ranked reset is coming, and the love/hate train is focused on Riven. Q Q Q your way out of danger, stay awhile and listen, we’ve only got a few issues this last week.\r\n\r\n**Follow-Ups:**\r\n\r\n* Mac voice still not working properly\r\n* Checking in on the issue from time to time for periodic updates\r\n\r\n**Server Stuff:** \r\n\r\n**Third Party failure leads to login issues on NA (3/5, ~46 hours)** A small number of players report login issues. Further investigation by PS shows a small, but increasing number of players who still couldn’t log in. Riot resources disable a third party tool, which allows the blocked players to log in. \r\n\r\n**Store API delays RP fulfillment (3/8, ~34 minutes)** A delay in the store process causes RP fulfillment to be delayed. Investigation and fixing of an HTML error page fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n**Game Stuff: **\r\n\r\n**Spike in Team builder errors cause Play button to grey out (3/12, ~33 minutes)** Automated alerting notifies the NOC that Team Builder errors are spiking. Game starts dip low, and PS reports play button is graying out for various players. A reboot of the team builder service fixes the problem and players are able to play normally again.\r\n\r\n**Player Support Issues:**\r\n\r\nWe’re seeing a minor spike in Client tickets (issues that pop up after you log in). Check to see if a full client repair and these [extra steps](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681668) might fix it. If not, please contact PS! \r\n\r\nMorgageddon &amp; Couch Commando","replies":[{"poster":"Irelicant","date":"2019-03-20T21:32:19.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yall had to create ANOTHER purple jarvin skin and waste dunkmaster on IVERN. come on riot its like you dont care what fans want{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"col2o","date":"2019-03-19T22:21:44.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"where are transfers? theyve been down for 7 days now..","replies":[{"poster":"Areq666","date":"2019-03-24T07:59:14.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":". also wanting to know, just recently moved to the United States, and want to get back into league.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2019-03-26T23:01:19.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Areq666,realm=EUNE,application-id=6WpmgL9O,discussion-id=eLMu6ERw,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2019-03-24T07:59:14.702+0000)\n>\n> . also wanting to know, just recently moved to the United States, and want to get back into league.\n\nWe'll add a brief summary of what's currently going on with Account Transfers on the 28th, and add it onto the Follow-Ups section so we can keep track of it. \n\nWe usually try to avoid talking about ongoing bugs just because so many things can change and we don't want to set incorrect expectations.

If a full repair or a fresh install isn't helping, then I would reach out to [Player Support ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) to see if there is anything they can find on their end.
