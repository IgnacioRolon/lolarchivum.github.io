Investigation shows the wrong ID was added for Project Skins, causing borders to fail. A redeploy with the correct config fixed the problem.\r\n\r\n* **Players unable to log into Chat (5/17, ~27 minutes)** A server change is implemented, and PS notifies the NOC players are being disconnected from chat. After checking the changelist, steps could have impacted the chat system. The server changes were rolled back, fixing the chat issues. Investigation into the change steps and why it caused the system to fail are ongoing. \r\n\r\n* **Game servers freezing (5/20, ~73 minutes)** A few game servers start to have reconnect spikes, which coincide with increased game crashing reports. NOC resets the affected servers, and players are able to correctly rejoin the problematic servers. \r\n\r\n* **Game servers freezing (5/21, ~ 2 hours)** A few game servers start to have reconnect spikes, which coincide with increased game crashing reports. NOC resets the affected servers, and players are able to correctly rejoin the problematic servers. \r\n\r\n* **Players unable to log into LoL (5/22, ~ 71 minutes)** NA starts to see increased numbers of NA logins failing, far above normal levels. A quick analysis of the symptoms point to a recent change. Rolling back the change bring login problems back to optimum levels.
