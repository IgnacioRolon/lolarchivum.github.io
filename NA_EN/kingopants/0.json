Alternatively you could also make it so a single cast warps you somewhere and if you recast it it will reverse the direction of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThis could be used to tp people out if you are clutch enough, call your jungler to an objective or tp back someone who needed to base during a siege.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-12T03:50:50.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Way too strong.
