I just played a game where I was doing fine top, bot lane was doing good as well and put jg had a nice lead on the enemy jg. Unfortunately our mid laner was losing his lane, no big deal though all he had to do was sit under turret and farm and we would be fine, he then says in chat “I’m so sick of junglers not camping me 24/7 so I’m just gonna run it down because you don’t deserve to win”. He then goes and feeds the mid lane wukong 7 kills and then runs around the jungle stealing camps allowing the wu to snowball and roam for free and there is nothing we can do. We played well and did everything right but one guy decided to ruin the game. Something needs to change because I am so sick of this.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2019-09-26T05:39:34.007+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, not a lot you can change.\nThis isn’t like a real sports team where you have interchangeable players, albeit that would be a cool game mode.\n\nThe only thing anyone can realistically do is prevent it from happening again.\nThere’s nothing riot or anyone can do when the game starts.","replies":[{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-09-26T05:46:59.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mV6eivZu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-09-26T05:39:34.007+0000)\n>\n> I mean, not a lot you can change.\n> This isn’t like a real sports team where you have interchangeable players, albeit that would be a cool game mode.\n> \n> The only thing anyone can realistically do is prevent it from happening again.\n> There’s nothing riot or anyone can do when the game starts.\n\nWell the could make it so one person can determine the outcome of a game like that.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2019-09-26T05:49:03.458+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Soul Dealer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mV6eivZu,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-09-26T05:46:59.704+0000)\n>\n> Well the could make it so one person can determine the outcome of a game like that.\n\nHow?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-09-26T05:51:53.495+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"And statistically speaking that person is more likely to be on the enemy team.\n\nIf you're sick of playing a multiplayer game, **stop playing it**.
