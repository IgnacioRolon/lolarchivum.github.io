His bite doesn't do enough damage whatsoever to one shot anything at any point in the game regardless of build. 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 50% AP) (+ 5% bonus health) that is how much damage his bite does to you.

So that's 800*6 which is 4800 HP now we get the 5% of that is 240 so... you add that to the base of 220 and Nunu is getting what? 460 damage? then you add whatever bonus HP and AP he gets from runes and he'll reach about 500-520 damage at most... tell me what ADC or any champion whatsoever is going to have that little HP? literally nunu's bite will never be able to one shot anyone, ever, at any point in the game. Once again, let me ask this... how is Nunu one shotting you with his bite if he is going full tank? he cannot. There is no argument you can make at all since all you are doing is exaggerating to such ridiculous degree in the vain hopes that somehow someone believes in your blatant lies","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-13T20:47:47.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is magic damage with far lower bases and ratios than his ult.
