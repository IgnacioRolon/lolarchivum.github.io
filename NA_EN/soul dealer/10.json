Make his passive do less damage when many enemies are hit by it so that his 1v1 power is not reduced but he can not 1v1 in a wave of minions and just deal full dmg and because of the minions targeting him, shielding himself, making the 1v1 impossible (something like garen E).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-06-01T09:58:11.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, it's a typical sucky rework that just looks \"good\" to the masses","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mid Nidalee","date":"2019-05-31T20:46:59.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Current Mordekaiser is very rewarding to learn, but most people have just played a couple of games and inted a bunch.

Riot has really failed us here.\n\nW:\nThis ability almost doesn't feel like an ability currently, the values are so weak. It feels like the W belongs on the passive and the passive belongs on the W.\n\nOverall he feels like every other juggernaut/fighter in the game now, but with a niche ult, instead of the **unique drain mage** he was. Riot has been shoeing champions into a classification like juggernaut/marksman/enchanter and removing the uniqueness of their play style for quite some time now..\n\nOverall, he looks cool; but pretty disappointed with the game play.
