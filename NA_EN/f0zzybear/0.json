We may have an idea that we consider a 1350 RP, and then decide to push it to 975 RP or 1820 RP.

I can only imagine how constraining that might be for the artists/concept people, good on you guys for delivering quality work most people love.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-10T18:31:36.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a case by case basis! :) It depends on what the thematic needs.\n\nA good example of what we changed recently was Super Galaxy Kindred.
