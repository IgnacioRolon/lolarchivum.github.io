{"poster":"EmpressOfBeauty","date":"2018-12-22T20:07:18.789+0000","title":"The imbalance between magic and armor penetration items","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"<Removed by Moderation>\n\nThere isn&#039;t enough magic penetration for all of the magic resistance abilities in the game and it is much harder to counter it as opposed to armor penetration. Excluding {{item:3124}} {{item:3091}} which the Guinsoo&#039;s is armor and magic penetration, and Wits End is generally never built on most magic users, the only real choices you have for cutting down magic resistance is {{item:3165}} {{item:3020}} , and {{item:3135}} . The fact magic penetration comes in the form of boots means that magic users give up a crucial offensive stat which could had come in the form of protection ({{item:3111}} {{item:3047}} ), or cdr {{item:3158}}, movement enhancers {{item:3117}} {{item:3009}}. Other physical champions can get access to these while not losing out on armor penetration while also noting {{item:3111}} gives more protection to the cc most magic users have. \n\nIf {{item:3916}} built into something else and had more variety similar to {{item:3035}}, there would be more options for magic users to combat magic resistance. It doesn&#039;t help that Oblivion Orb only gives 15 magic penetration when {{item:1033}} provides 25 magic resistance at 450 gold. \n\nMagic penetration to armor penetration is a joke. Magic users get ONE flat magic penetration item outside of the mandatory boots, and then Void Staff which is percentage based. \n\nArmor penetration doesn&#039;t have a boots component. But it does have THREE flat armor penetrating items: {{item:3142}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3814}}, two choices for percentage armor penetration {{item:3033}} {{item:3036}}, and a shredding percentage armor item {{item:3071}}. The difference is major considering how much you can stack both Armor AND Magic Resistance. How can a magic user expect to overcome an enemy with 130+ magic resistance with an enemy who built {{item:3139}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3163}}. And that doesn&#039;t count how much base magic resistance you get through leveling. Now it is true you get more armor than magic resistance by levels, but it isn&#039;t anywhere near the difference needed to fix the imbalance. \n\nAs for champions who can reduce an enemy&#039;s resistances, we have for magic resistances to be resisted only {{champion:42}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:10}} and {{champion:48}}.\n\nThen for shredding through armor there are {{champion:122}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:107}}...\n\nSo for an example, say you have 2 tanks. One stacks full armor and the other full magic resist. This is just an example not the actual build.\n{{champion:54}} : {{item:3068}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3047}} \n{{champion:57}} : {{item:3001}} {{item:3194}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3111}} \n\nNow you have a physical damage champion to tackle on the armored tank and a magic user to take on the magically infused defensive tank.\n{{champion:21}} : {{item:3142}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3006}} \n{{champion:61}} : {{item:3040}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3020}} \n\nNow I am not saying these are correct builds but I am giving the example of how a magic user would have to counter the Maokai vs Miss Fortune. I guess you could argue that Liandry&#039;s Torment is another tank busting item but at the same time it is not magic penetration. Someone could take a combo like {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3111}} and not be a tank. Most burst mages would not opt to build Liandry&#039;s Torment.  I also know that a full attack speed and crit would work better for tanks but I used Miss Fortune for her kit. I am just comparing the difference in builds. \n\nNot to mention Miss Fortune in this situation doesn&#039;t NEED her boots. Orianna does for the magic penetration and movement. Miss Fortune has a Strut movement bonus and Youmuu&#039;s passive and active, so if she wanted to add {{item:3124}} for even more armor penetration, she isn&#039;t being hurt much and she would blow through Malphite.\n\nI think Oblivion Orb should get a second building component just like Last Whisper.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-12-22T20:29:02.524+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"ITT: OP fails to realize champs have about twie as much base MR as base armor, that lethality is gated by level, and that {{item:3916}} {{item:3020}} is not a valid comparison to completed items.

Mercury Treads and Mercurial Schimitar eliminate the need for hard cc. Does Nidalee have hard cc? Does Orianna? Not really she doesn't even have a stun. And as I said, {{item:3151}} isn't so useful for a burst mage or a mage who can't utilize it well in their build because they need more useful items. It also isn't useful vs enemies who AREN'T tanks that take MR. Liandry's burns health, not resistance.\n\n{{champion:18}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3163}} {{item:3111}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2018-12-22T20:35:16.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If a Trist builds like that, the assassin murders her and moves in.\n\nBecause it CAN happen, doesn't mean it actually works.\n\n{{champion:99}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3147}} \nHappens too, doesn't make the arguement that Lux passive is OP.","replies":[{"poster":"EmpressOfBeauty","date":"2018-12-22T20:37:18.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cats Are Food,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jnTY15kO,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-12-22T20:35:16.048+0000)\n>\n> If a Trist builds like that, the assassin murders her and moves in.\n> \n> Because it CAN happen, doesn&#x27;t mean it actually works.\n> \n> {{champion:99}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3147}} \n> Happens too, doesn&#x27;t make the arguement that Lux passive is OP.\n\nYou do realize Lux's passive scales with AP and she needs to use an ability to use it? Without abilities she does no damage and doesn't scale with damage. With your logic any ranged champion can do that. An assassin like LeBlanc can't damage Trist with all that magic resistance.
