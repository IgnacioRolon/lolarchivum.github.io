It makes it like it's disconnected from the tv and will not connect back without a force restart. Also Im constantly given 20 min ban queues after every game making it impossible to enjoy the game anymore. I would hate to leave a game that Ive spent so much money on. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Hopefully you can give me a solution or fix the problem. Also I'm sorry I posted in the wrong section before. I've never had to do this before.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2015-10-20T02:18:23.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BunnyLord, it sucks to hear that you're having difficulty with your computer when you're playing League. It sounds like when you run into this issue, the screen shuts off and doesn't turn back on without a hard shut down first. When this occurs, do you notice any odd stuff going on with your screen? For instance, green lines, fading to black, is there a \"No signal\" prompt?\n\nYou might see different things depending on whether you're using a desktop or notebook PC. Generally you don't see a \"No signal\" prompt with notebooks because it's not a separate monitor and will not behave the same way as separate monitors. Just from what you've described, it sounds like a possible issue with your graphics hardware. \n\nThis would explain why the screen would just cut out when you're in game. There's a few questions I have to nail down the root cause:\n\n* Are you playing on a desktop or notebook PC?\n* Did this happen after installing a new patch, program, or driver update?\n* When you do not crash out entirely, have you noticed your game's performance becoming worse and worse the longer you play? (eg. Your fps decreases, the game gets sluggish, the fans in your computer spin really quickly)\n* Have you noticed any similar performance issues with any other games? If so, which ones?\n\nIf this occurred after a patch or driver update, it's possible that this is a software-based issue. As such, you might want to check your video drivers, update your OS, or change in-game settings (the latter also applies with hardware issues):\n\n* [Steps to update your video drivers](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting#wq1)\n* Steps to update [Windows](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq4) / [Mac](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#mq2)\n* [Steps to change you in-game settings](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting#wq2)\n\nIn some cases, you might actually want to roll back drivers or updates if those are the things responsible for the technical problem. Otherwise, if you're seeing performance degradation over time or this happens with other titles, it could be signs of overheating or other hardware issues:\n\n* [Steps to manage heat when playing](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting#wq7)\n* [Steps to change you in-game settings](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting#wq2) (it's the same link I provided earlier in my post)\n\nI hope that helps. If you're still having issues with your computer after performing those steps, feel free to contact my colleagues by submitting a ticket to the [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new). Make sure to tell them what you've already tried and provide logs they request.","replies":[{"poster":"ChiId","date":"2015-10-20T21:09:30.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
