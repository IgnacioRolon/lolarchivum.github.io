What if a friend comes over and writes it in your chat while you re not looking?\r\n\r\nDisclaimers: 1) I agree with most of the decisions that riot makes, i also agree for the reason of my ban, but considering i wasn't toxic before, i think it was a bit too early, apart from that I've always had good experiences with riot employees in the past, and this time was the first time i felt a bit.. confused\r\n                      2) I'm not really salty that I got banned, I'm just kinda irritated because of what made me get banned, and cuz of the response that i got from a rioter when i asked him about further detail to my ban.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've played league for 5 years now, and I've never gotten a single ban, suspension or even chat restriction, all of my accounts were always clean. I tried to be as positive as possible and didn't say anything negative cuz 1) i don't wanna lose all the content that I've worked for over the years 2) negativity is useless, makes you lose more games\r\n\r\nYea, riot is very sensitive to words like kys, which is understandable, so i dont say it. I still say it to my friends as a joke, cuz ik they can take it as a joke.\r\n\r\nI was in a lobby with my friend for duoq, and we had a conversation. We got into champion select, and i forgot to switch to private chat for the rest of our convo, so i slipped in a little \"pls kys xd\".\r\n\r\nI then had a normal game, and at the end of the game i got banned. Reason: \"pls kys xd\", and thats literally it. The rest of the chat log was just normal in game chat. Y'know, harmful messages like \"good job\" or, \"lol, i had no enrgy for w\", and even worse \"careful, {{champion:79}}  might dive you\". I mean, ok, maybe i did get a little salty that our {{champion:89}}  kept on going in 1v5 and then flamed me for still being alive, but i went back to not being tilted after a minute.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, i explained my situation to a rioter by sending a ticket to riot support. He told me that \"The reason you received a 2 week suspension before a Chat Restriction is that we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to racism/homophobia/xenophobia/wishing harm upon others. These can highly impact a player which is why they can jump over to a harsher punishment.\" I mean hey, fair enough. But, i still dont agree that i should get suspended on the spot for saying it once. Yea, they can't really tell that it was meant to be directed at my friend, who i knew wouldnt get offended, and that i accidentally wrote it in public chat and not private, but still.. maybe you should ease up a bit. Suspending someone for saying the word just once? So what, if a friend of mine comes over to my house and tries to have a little laugh and says kys under my account, will i just get instantly banned because i was toxic in 1 second out of 4000 hour playtime?\r\n\r\nHe then further said that he d like me to understand that riot doesnt consider one players' action to justify anothers'. Yea. I totally agree with that, in fact, to clarify that i wasn't defending my ban over other toxic players who say kys 50 times per game, i even wrote that in my initial ticket that i sent. So i dont know why he's telling me that im trying to defend myself in that way. He then proceeded to give me advice on tilting less in game. Like? what? That wasn't even the reason for my ban. Im not a delusional toxic player who insists that he s not toxic. Its just that im not. I dont call people by insults after they've taken my bot lane wave and left it in a complete mess for the enemy to freeze. Yea, sure i might get a bit tilted, but i dont call them anything bad.\r\n\r\nTelling someone who's tried their best staying positive in-game for the past 5 years to reform is just absurd. It's as if you've got a maths proffessor who's been studying maths for god knows how long, and he miscalculated something and gave it out to his students, and as soon as he's done that 1 mistake, you proceed to suspend him from the uni, and tell him to maybe go back to elementary school to learn some basic maths. Like, it's just ridiculous, and i actually find it rather insulting.\r\n\r\nNow, i really dont care if the account gets suspended, its the lowest ranked account that i have, so this post really isnt about how much i value my account , but rather about how much you can say before you get banned. I don't feel like losing my main (which has content worth about 200k rp, which is 1,4kâ‚¬) account because of 1 mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-04-27T08:23:08.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking up a necro here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-09-16T12:04:11.000+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"U may be clear all life.\nShooting a friend may lead u jail, regardless.\n\nRiot put rules.\nOne of them is the no no words and acronyms.\n\n\nWhat kind of friend doesnt join discord?\n\nWhat kind of cleverness is required to break rules on purpose?","replies":[{"poster":"Mc Truck","date":"2018-09-16T12:37:18.319+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shukr4n,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2adEup9Y,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-16T12:04:11.000+0000)\n>\n> U may be clear all life.\n> Shooting a friend may lead u jail, regardless.\n\nNot if it's a water pistol.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-09-16T12:55:44.537+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shukr4n didn't specify what kind of gun one would shoot a friend with in their analogy - nor did they even mention a gun, for that matter.

We may not like those rules, but we have to follow them or we get punished. As you mentioned, it's business and not a nursery.\n\nBut why does it look like a nursery, swim like a nursery and quack like a nursery? Considering that Rito is not the only successful videogame business in the world, we can look at the others and notice that they don't abuse their power over players. \n\nRiot is going way overboard and it doesn't look like it has something to do with money. It looks like something that Kathleen Kennedy would do - they are pushing some weird-ass agenda, are not even subtle about it. And people(yes, they violated the rules, but they didn't become subhuman because of it) are suffering more than they have to.","replies":[{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-09-17T04:46:00.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why?\nPegi 13\nMoreover it s a videogame on internet so even grown up players become kids.\nInternet make everything separated grom reality so abusers finds fun and.not regret being unknown and being toxic.\n\nAgonysm adds that more saltiness.\n\nAs long as their business goes ans their deciaion follows it, riot so what he please to keep community alive and money come.","replies":[{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-09-17T05:31:32.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i assume so.\n\nItbs a private business.

Seems to be a similar situation to anyone with a recent 14-day, but of a more significant implications.\n\nThe situations are both meant to be a final chance. Riot is saying (as the department of motor vehicles said to my uncle) \"this is your final warning; you are on a strict probation. Any more infractions will incur severe penalties, with lasting repercussions.\"\n\n>  because of his victimless crime. Does it feel right to you?\n\nI find it interesting that you say it is victimless. I can think of another \"victimless\" crime that is punished harshly as well (at least in the US): drunk driving. If you drive home drunk, and make it home without causing any damage or injury, you could argue that it is victimless, as \"nothing bad happened\". No one got hurt, nothing was destroyed by the action. Should you still be punished? Is it fair? I say yes.\n\nMy reason for using this example is because in both situations you are committing an act that has the *potential* to cause harm. Putting the offender's account at risk is meant to help them see that a change is needed. The behavior is unacceptable, and must change. Riot's only real recourse is to take action on an account. The penalty needs to be severe enough to dissuade the behavior in the future. The only severe enough penalty is a permanent ban.\n\nI agree that it is a hard lesson to learn, but life is full of hard lessons.","replies":[{"poster":"Mc Truck","date":"2018-09-16T16:46:10.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Modi,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2adEup9Y,comment-id=00000001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-09-16T16:31:49.060+0000)\n>\n> My uncle was at risk (at on...\n> ...arn, but life is full of hard lessons.\n\nYes, I can see this point. \n\nUp until we realise that the risk from drunk driving is real(supported by tens of thousands confirmed deaths every year) and the risk from saying \"kys\" in mmo chat is imaginary(supported by riot saying \"this is not okay\").\n\nEspecially considering the fact that it was said to a friend and caught by by a bloody zero tolerance bot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-09-16T16:40:22.801+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get why your case is especially infuriating.\n\nHowever, *anyone* typing kys in game contributes to a negative environment.

I think Riot handles it the best way possible, though, by being essentially zero tolerance (it's not actually zero, or you'd be perma'd). I don't think it's wrong to joke around with friends, and if you decide that \"kys\" is something you can safely joke about (I still don't recommend that, btw, for *many* reasons), you still have to respect the environment around you. \n\nLeague games are a public space.
