Is there anything I can do to get ahead in lane or tips to be better at this?\r\n\r\nI know I can roam better but I&#039;m mostly talking about keeping these guys from snowballing and murdering me.\r\nThank you for your time and advice.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-04-04T08:19:21.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"a jungler shut down is extremely effective.  any jungle with good engage and burst really sucks to go against.  also swain, if you can pick swain into vlad its auto win on laning phase.  but good vlad will always be relevent late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-04-04T06:45:14.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't really say. \n\nI mean I main Vladimir and I'm honestly very confident playing him into any mid laner.

Cho Gath is actually one of my easiest match ups.. \n3: Stay under tower if you don't want them to snow ball, if they try to dive/attack you under it they will most likely die.. Swains the type of person who WANTS people to dive him.\n\nIf you don't want to learn Swain though, just farm under tower and ping \"SOMETIMES\" for a jungler to help.. The last thing you want to do is annoy your jungler and get no ganks if you're doing bad.\n\nBut I'm a previous Cho Gath main and the champions you're playing against him aren't the best choices.. Annie can't burst Cho Gath down like other champions, he's the kinda guy who can go full AP and be a tanky monster either way. Same for Diana.. Once you dash onto Cho Gath she's basically dead unless she's fed. Kassaddin isn't strong enough to kill Cho Gath, and well.. Kayle's ult is actually pretty useful for Cho Gath but I still find she'd lose either way over 1 small mistake (Risky).\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is Swain is your best bet against these monsters and for any other Mid Laner/Top laner.\n\nJust a Swain Main pointing this out..","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadowofsaints","date":"2017-04-05T08:47:14.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thank you so much for the feedback. Ive played the old swain back in like season 3-4 im pretty familiar with his kit and build path. Ill try to add him to my pool incase that ever pops up either top or mid. Because of cho'gath's kit with the knock up an silence combo really frustrates me because I constantly get dominated by it with no end in sight but a loss game. For vladamir I've been able to hold up against with someone like talon but seeing they nerfed talon swain will replace him.","replies":[]}]}
