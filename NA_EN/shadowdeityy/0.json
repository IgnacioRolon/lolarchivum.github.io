I'll join a game and everything will be just fine. Before the minions even spawn I'll get the \"attempting to reconnect\" it'll sit there for a while with that little blue bar and I'll be back but at base. Happens constantly throughout the game. Sometimes it'll happen when I'm trying to farm to team fights. This morning, (around 4 am) it was working fine. But as the day progresses it started happening. I'm too afraid of thIs happening during a ranked game and I just want this fixed. I know it's not my Internet because my brother plays the same game, same time with no issues. Someone please help me. I have a msi gaming laptop with Windows 8, i7, 16gb ram.\n  Help me!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T16:48:11.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that while you're able to establish a connection to the game server, something is blocking your network from maintaining it which is super super important for an always online match.
