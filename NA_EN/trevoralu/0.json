Along with being so important to pro play, there is literally no other mid lane champs that have Victorious skins which I think makes it more fitting. I saw some stuff saying with Swain and Galio should receive them, but honestly they don&#039;t have the impact Orianna has; especially with their reworks, and not being strictly mid lane champs.\n\nEdit: Also, to all he people being like \"Ugh there goes my motivation to reach gold\" or \"Demoting to silver now, this sucks,\" can yall sit tf down? Just because it isn't for a champion you play, or for your role, it doesn't mean you gotta be all negative. I know some of it is joking but most people are just saying stuff to negative and it's annoying.","replies":[]}
