I have no intuition of where I should be and how to make an impact, besides &quot;gank if the enemy is pushed&quot; or &quot;farm camps if nobody is pushed&quot;, which probably isn&#039;t even correct half the time (I always see streamers call for a tower dive if they&#039;re top lane or simply see junglers making dive plays, but I rarely recognize these situations in game).\r\n\r\nWhen exactly should I be farming the jungle? At what times should I gank? Where should I place wards? What&#039;s generally the route that people take nowadays? What trinket should I get? When should I make my first back? What _items_ should I get my first back? Is Chilling Smite just 100% the best Smite? If I get some early kills, should I just always be ganking to try to snowball the game? And etc., anything else that I&#039;m not thinking about right now.\r\n\r\nAnyways, can anyone offer some general jungling tips or link a good guide? Mostly I get outdated guides (like when there were Sight Wards) or champion specific jungle guides when I search up something.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!","replies":[]}
