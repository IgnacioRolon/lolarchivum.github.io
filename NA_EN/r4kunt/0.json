Any game i play, ranked or norms, will not start. everything is perfectly fine through bans and picks, and the loading screen displays everything as it should, but after it loads everyone in to 100%, the game just freezes. i am not able to alt+tab out or anything, i have to restart my computer each time. I have uninstalled and reinstalled twice, to no avail. this has now caused me to be in 20 minute queue timers, and three ranked losses in a row.\n\nany help or ideas would be welcome, as my LoL is currently about useless!\n\n\n*** okay so i have just played a game with sona, so maybe my problem is with leona? i am ging to try a game with leo now to see if its just her chromas that are weird, will update in about an hour or so\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T18:48:40.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be happening as a result of a recent windows update, bad game files, or something else entirely.
