Banned for saying \"gg %%%gots,\"\"%%%got champs,\"\"XD\" and \"your aids.\" Don't know why they put the \"your aids\" part in when someone else said it before me and I was just defending my friend (the Garen if anyone takes a look). I never knew you could get banned for this behavior, I thought I was only at risk at getting muted. A ban is a little much as a mute or even of a warning would have instantly solved the problem. I got a ban when there were other options, and on top of that there is an option to block out and bad words if they would be in your chat. I just started to get back into playing this game more after getting board of playing R6 Siege so much, But this ban took the hype away and play this 10/10 game. I don't think I will want to play after this. I am not asking for an un-ban and I am not trying to make people feel bad for me, not using the walk away tactic either. Just putting what is on my mind, mainly because im just board even though I have 100 games on steam, as I am typing this I am waiting for my friend to download a game he just bought so we can play. I don't know what else to say past this point, the past few sentences were pretty useless but I put them anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-22T21:38:23.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Homphobic slurs are not appropriate at all, and is something that some players have coined as 'zero tolerance.'  Just don't do it.  The general rule of thumb for the profanity filter is that it's a means to prevent further harassment, not an exception to allow it.  I know this is a damper on the hype, but it's important to promote positive sportsmanship in this competitive environment and words like that, negatively targeting others, just have no place here.  \n\n**If someone is being a jerk, /mute and report are always the best option.  If you retaliate back with negativity, you're only contributing to the issue and will go down with the ship regardless of who started it.**  \n\nThe good news is that this suspension is only temporary, and now you know!  Though you are at the top of the escalation path per the [Instant Feedback System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-), all is not lost.  Should you decide to play again, stay consistent towards contributing positive experience and even mute chat entirely if you have to.\n\nYou're also not alone, we all make mistakes sometimes and we learn from it.

This probably means that you've been toxic before.
