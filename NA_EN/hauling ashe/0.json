It waits for a bit and then I get this alert box message: \"Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.\"\n\nI've tried reconnecting multiple times, reconnecting to my internet, restarting the LoL client. The first time, I tried reconnecting at least 15 times, and had to wait for a good 25 minutes before I could queue for another game because apparently my team didn't remake. Now this same issue has occurred and I have no idea what to do.\n\nI'm playing on the legacy client and have never had this problem before. There is nothing to indicate a bad network connection because I'm able to use the client chat and I'm obviously writing on the boards via the same connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Vel Existor","date":"2016-11-18T18:35:52.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just launch it with --no-sandbox parameter. it helped me to solve \"nothing appearing, then black screen\" issue\n\nI.e. create shortcut of it and open properties, at the end add that parameter so it will look like\n\n\"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\LeagueClient.exe\" --no-sandbox","replies":[{"poster":"Hauling Ashe","date":"2016-11-18T19:14:18.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't work.
