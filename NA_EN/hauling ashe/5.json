I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m just managing to get matched with more mature players or what. The game has just been more fun in recent weeks.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is the occasion that I do get a troll or just a frustrating team, or maybe a friend simply wants me to join them in a casual game. So I go to ARAM. It&#039;s always just been a for-fun mode to me. No worries about farm, rotations, or getting repeatedly ganked in the bot lane while my jungler is AFK farming. No, none of that in ARAM. Just go all in and kill things.\r\n\r\nBut lately, in conjunction with normal 5v5 SR games just seeming so much calmer than they have been in the past, I&#039;ve noticed that ARAM is no longer something good for de-tilting. In fact, I&#039;ve noticed some of the WORST behavior in ARAM. Most games involve one or two player from both teams spamming curses, insults, &quot;KYS&quot;, and racist remarks to each other in all chat the entire match.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if I&#039;m the only one noticing this. I realize a lot of people are like me and go to ARAM to de-tilt, but for some people that seems to mean saying all the things you can&#039;t say normally. Is ARAM not monitored as closely for player behavior as other game modes? The last few times I&#039;ve played an ARAM game, it has just been filled with nastiness and hostility.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2016-12-30T07:44:46.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly play ARAM now, but I used to play SR a lot too. I get criticized for my builds way more often in ARAM than I did in SR, not sure why either.. as I feel my build strategies are not perfect, but definitely improved a lot since I started. But it's usually some guy troll diving 1v5 who criticizes my build so I can't take it too seriously.\n\nAlso there's A LOT of bots in ARAM, so people tend to get really angry and start assuming people doing badly in ARAM are always bots, which fuels their anger even more.","replies":[{"poster":"Hauling Ashe","date":"2016-12-30T07:48:42.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never (knowingly) encountered ARAM bots. So that's interesting. I mostly see them in co-op or 3v3s.\n\nWeird that people criticize your builds in ARAM. I just build whatever I think might kill the enemy the fastest, conventional or cheese.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2016-12-30T07:52:20.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play supports and most of my champions on this account are support, so I get it often in ARAM. I think the builds are a little more varied between different support champs so it can be harder to build them in ARAM, and then a lot of supports build differently in ARAM than they normally would, also depending on team comp. \n\nI was getting a lot of support items on Janna as well as a small bit of AP, and the guy wanted me to go full AP. We had no other supports so I thought going full support+AP would be good.\n\nI see bots late at night/early morning the most. It's pretty obvious for me at least cause I watch their pattern of:\nWalk under turret, let enemy hit you a few times(or die), then walk back to allied turret, do it all over again. \n\nThis is really bad in ARAM cause if there are any human players the bots are dead in seconds. The other day I had a game where only 4/10 of the players were humans. Each of the 3 bots on each team were moving in sync with each other and turret diving at the exact same times. But if the human players stayed at spawn, the bots would never move beyond turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Hauling Ashe","date":"2016-12-30T07:54:01.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not very knowledgeable on Janna yet, but would building AD + Lich Bane/*maybe* Trinity Force on her be better in ARAM?","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2016-12-30T08:00:18.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a strategy used for SR, it would probably work in ARAM, but if there are already plenty of AP champs and no supports/healers I'd rather go CDR/Support/AP items on her\n\nEdit: I also prefer ARAM for one of the reasons you mentioned, how you can get screwed in certain lanes if the other team is pushing you and your team does nothing, this can't happen as easily in ARAM except for the guys who solo dive and make it a 4v5. I prefer the constant 5v5 team fight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"THE KILLER GUY","date":"2016-12-30T12:10:56.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've learned to always enter ARAMs with a mindset that I KNOW it's going to be a lower-quality game in terms of player behavior. Thing is, ARAM is so condensed  compared to SR that there is very little outside of that little chat box that a player can actually do to ruin a game. Your best bets are either muting the player or memeing the whole game. I've found that people in ARAM typically don't want to be seen as toxic; they just want to joke around and have fun the same as you. So take what they say with a grain of salt. If they see you doing that, they will usually try to be your buddy. If it gets worse and more uncomfortable for you, I'd suggest you just mute them and move on. The games are usually short anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-30T04:07:36.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if thats litterally everything they say, theres mute!","replies":[{"poster":"Hauling Ashe","date":"2016-12-30T04:17:32.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not the point.
