I really love the bot lane characters as well.\n\nThat being said, being an ADC main is like pulling teeth. You don't feel in control of your destiny in the slightest. Either your team feeds you or your team pushes you to feed. There is no balanced bot lane duel, where I can use my skill to outlast an early game lane bully and scale with my hypercarry. No, I am but a toddler at the mercy of my estranged parents, the support and the jungler.\n\nIt doesn't matter if I can outplay the Draven. My support will go in and get shanked by Blitz and feed kills. It doesn't matter if I try to play safe and farm up to make up for my mistakes or my support's mistakes. My jungler is busy camping the top lane and is too busy to care that Tristana and Lux are whittling away at our hp and our turret and will have it down at the 10 minute mark.\n\nMy stats look so ugly or so impressive, it is rarely anything in the middle - feast or famine. I am an Ashe and Caitlyn main and I know those champions inside and out. I don't go 0/5/0 at 15 minutes. Except in this season, apparently.\n\nSee, unlike the solo lanes, I am not just reliant on my own skills and map awareness and the occasional gank from my friendly neighborhood jungler. I am reliant on my support not being an autofilled troll or the weak link with the Bronze 6 MMR. I am reliant on the jungler deciding if bot a is real or imaginary lane.\n\nSometimes I do play poorly, and when I do, the blame is on me. But I know I don't play that badly. I'm not the greatest but I'm not a habitual feeder. Except my stats would indicate otherwise this season.\n\nLast game I had a Rakan who was hitting my minions, diving a Jhin/Lux kill lane, and when Jhin ulted me, Rakan (with full health, by the way) walked out of lane and into the tri brush **even after I had managed to dodge the first three shots** and let me die on the fourth.\n\nI don't understand what I'm expected to do. I love being the glass cannon character. I enjoy having to think ahead and it often pushes me to play at my very best, knowing I can be deleted by almost any champion if I'm not in the zone. But lately it all seems irrelevant. Nothing I do matters. If I get a quadra kill, it's because I had a decent jungler who fed me early and the other team didn't. If I go 2/9 it's because no amount of farming and playing safe in anticipation of a late game spike can help me catch up with the enemy ADC who got fed off my inting support.\n\nThis is not me complaining about the players I get on my teams. I know everyone has to deal with their share of trolls and boosted players. This is me lamenting that my proficiency as an ADC player has little to no effect on how well I do in my matches. **I have no way to gauge my skill because nothing I accomplish is in my control.**\n\nI know there are going to by high-and-mighty gold ranked players telling me to \"git gud scurb\", but that advice never helped anyone and I honestly don't believe my skill is the problem. I feel like I can't carry as an ADC. All I can do is make myself as carryable as possible. This isn't some \"ADC in 2k18\" meme. I'm just feeling exhausted and helpless in this role.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2018-02-03T01:30:49.432+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another Ashe player, the dream. Yeah it feels bad as fuck this year. Normally support is fairly in control but you can do something but this season just feels bad. I really would accept a nerf to ADC damage if they just made the role slightly more self reliant because in soloQ playing ADC is the biggest gamble.

However, it's only one ADC at a time. One is always doing massive damage and the other is always getting flamed by their team because they're 2 items behind and can't contribute at all. And while everyone makes mistakes and has bad games, I don't believe most ADC mains die 7 times in lane because they are just that bad.\n\nIf the cards are stacked against you, recovering from a poor laning phase is just impossible right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NekoniClaws","date":"2018-02-03T11:34:39.533+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"ADCs are the support's dog.

My wings feel clipped. And I can't stand the chump I get stuck laning with. Watching a support fail to go for obvious plays over and over... drives me absolutely insane. \n\nAnd yes, I'm a sup main.

The boards have been complaining about top laners having no agency over the game (which is true to some degree) but adc's, in my opinion, have the least agency of any role. They are completely reliant on their teammates for CC (since they have very little defense in their items and kits unlike their mid lane cousins), to make plays, and ward (since it is usually very easy to kill a lone adc). Tons of microplay but very little macro.\n\nIn my opinion, adc's need more defense in some form (cc, mobility, raw stats, items, etc.) and have their raw damage brought down in exchange. That way they can spend more time in fights to actually deal sustained damage instead of burst or be bursted.\n\nEdit:\n>  No, I am but a toddler at the mercy of my estranged parents, the support and the jungler.\n\nForgot to say, that gave me a really good laugh!","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-02-03T20:22:38.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it more goes hand in hand.

ADC's are just as hopeless as top laners in determining the outcome of games, but for different reasons. Adc's can't really use their skill to win lane, and have to hope others get them fed, and they can use their skill to win as long as that happens, but if no one helps them, they'll just lose by default. Top laners can use their skill to win lane and get themselves ahead, but fall short because even with that gold the enemy ADC will likely just melt them if they're fed. Both roles can't really roam and help others either, so you just gotta cross your fingers and hope the rest of your teammates do decently.\n\nAll while jg, mid, and sup can assert their will on the game early on, and dictate the pace, especially in this FF@15 meta. I have no clue what Riot could do to fix this problem. I find myself winning so many games as ADC while just AA'ing away while my team melts through the enemy, and losing games where I deal practically no damage while the enemy team one shots me. This happens when I play mid too, but most of the time I'm winning and melting the enemy team and it feels good, cause I'm usually the one who started the snowball, and in the loses I probably didn't play that well, I can tell what I do matters in that lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Mãmbã","date":"2018-02-03T20:43:12.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I firmly think this started to be the case around the time they started introducing massive sustain runes and/or shield/buff support items.

And the OP acknowledges the damage is extreme atm, but damage alone does not win games. You can be the most fed adc in the world and if you have no peel and no front line you are helpless to solo carry a game. The underlying claim here is that ADC has never felt so reliant on all the other roles. You are either getting smashed/camped as an ADC main or you are decimating the enemy ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Hauling Ashe","date":"2018-02-04T17:52:47.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least someone's on topic and understands my point in this string.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2018-02-03T16:32:03.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vgamedude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gao5gcEI,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-02-03T02:58:29.869+0000)\n>\n> Yeah good luck solo killing their fed adc with a frontline when all you can do is lock people down while you get dwindled down due to the ridiculous damage in the game now.

Once you're behind, you might as well be useless for a very long time because you can't just go off to another lane and farm to catch up-- no, you'll get picked off the moment you try to go alone. Your support *has* to ditch you or else the game would be 3v5 instead of 4v5, so you're not really safe from anything either. If that's not harsh enough, it would be you having so much responsibility (and therefore blame), but with little actual room on how much you can do to cover that up.\n\nIf that's also not enough, it would be how much blame the community, namely Boards, puts ADCs as THE \"snowball problem\" due to itemization. No, it had nothing to do with their beloved mages and tanks who go botlane, and **literally turned botlane into THE kill lane**. They expect ADCs to be completely responsible for all that, which amuses me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyquiem","date":"2018-02-03T20:30:16.994+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, ADC can be fun, but it’s only fun, when you yourself can peel.

I've played a decent amount of marksman in the bot lane (as well as decent amount of other lanes hence I think I'm making a fair comparison) and i've got to say it's possibly the least impactful role and even lesser in lane. When I win lane,most of it is because my support is better than their support. He doesn't just sit back passively as an Alistar but goes in for his headbutt combo when the Morgana has used up her shield and snare. Or when my Janna knows how to establish brush control so that her tornado is more effective. Or just simple things like my Blitzcrank not going for a grab when there's obviously a minion right in front of him. Heck, even Soraka can play aggressively and establish lane pressure.\n\nSometimes, it gets really frustrating because even when my support and I have managed to bring the bot turret to low health and we have a mountain/infernal drake that we could secure, our jungler is oblivious about objective control. Instead he tries to gank the top that is going even over and over again, instead of helping us bot so we can rotate. \n\nThen there's the mid who refuses to roam despite having great mobility and instead decides to duke it out 1v1 vs the enemy mid lane even when it's obvious she could've easily secure a double kill bot as a 3v2 because it's League of Laning till 20min apparently, or the top who has TP up all the time but has never used it to TP to other lane. \"I brought TP so that I can TP to my lane. hur dur\". Even Trick2g realizes he can not just sit in his top lane all game to stack Q's as Nasus.\n\nAnd when it comes to teamfights, you better pray that your support knows ~~how~~ to peel for you because if you even get into range to try and AA, and if the enemy team has someone like Jarvan, you're going to turn into dust if you dont have flash.\n\nAnd if your teammates even have the knowledge to collapse onto that 1 diver who's trying to kill you instead of chasing the enemy team during LATE GAME, you better kiss their asses after game.\n\nIf you manage to 1v1 someone, chances are you have more and better items rather than you purely outplaying him.\n\nI feel like being the squishiest class despite having high damage output, your success depends heavily on your teammates. If you lose laning phase and die in teamfights, it's because of your teammates. If you win laning phase and survive in teamfights despite the enemy focusing you, it's because of your teammates. There's really a lack of agency here. There's a reason they call this class a braindead class. And I somewhat agree. It might not be totally braindead but it's the most braindead class. Positioning well, I find, isn't as hard as the many other things the other classes have to juggle with.\n\nI'm not demanding a change in the system. I'm just pointing out the inherent state of marksman and how people view it vs how I view it.\n\nPS: dealing high sustained damage is not the only means of agency. if anything having only that attribute gives you the least agency. ergo, each and other laners/jungle has more impact than the marksman. you might do the most sustained damage, but you're stepping on their shoulders to be able to do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2018-02-03T16:47:04.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'ts a team game man , I had matches ,  where I was a fed adc but lost because , my mid and top lost so I had no one to tank or cc for me in fights so the enemy's  0/7 {{champion:222}} came back and did a triple kill and that's it , we lost , it depends on the majority of won lanes to win , most likely , if 2 lanes are won , you win the game , sometimes even if 2 or all 3 lanes are lose, you can win due to combos in team fights and knowing how and who to focus , Tanks top laners are complaining for being 1 shot , like come on , even ad carried and mages can be 1 shot by an assassin diving on you in a fight and 1 shooting and  your teammates are busy fighting in frontline , just had a {{champion:429}} match where we lost just because our front liners will just go all in and focus the enemies while the enemies had {{champion:238}} {{champion:254}} will just ult me and no one notices me or even care , they even had a {{champion:141}} so\nand yesterday in ranked , won my lane as {{champion:51}} but lost to their corki adc , why ? he just E in the middle fights and 1 shoots me while my team never tried to help me , knowing we had {{champion:33}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:14}} , the strongest Tanks ever , but how are you supposed to win if your adc gets 1 shot and you do nothing ?\nyeah that's how it is\nI'm a mages main , but non of my friends would play adc when we play together so I end up playing adc sometimes, tho I hate that role but I find it way easier to carry than carrying with my mains , I mean adc can keep auto attacking forever , while mages can miss skills hots and even if they them all , long cool downs and useless against tanks","replies":[]}]}
