Please.\n\nEdit:\nAlso thanks for answering!\n\nEdit:\nI'm not talking about missing an icon, I'm using my icons to prove that riot have the wrong data about my account. On my boards account it show like I was gold. Also it show on op.gg and everywhere.\n\nThe point is that I want it fixed to my actual elos I had!

That was honestly my bad >_<!!!\n\nI apologize, I was actually looking at the rank that you ended at when the ranked queues stopped ranking you. As it turns out, that was *NOT* the rank you ended the *season* at (the system keeps tracking your progress even after the season if officially over). Again, apologies for having read that wrong.\n\nI went back in and double-checked and you're right, you did end at Diamond 4 last season (uuuuh GRATS first of all). After that I did some digging to find what icon you should have gotten for placing there, and lo and behold you already had it! In your third picture, the fourth icon over is the D4 icon.\n\nHere's a handy lil' pic for reference when you're hunting through that list of icons.

Also i have a challenger icon and a silver icon [silver from season 3].\n\nAll that is not displayed and is treated like never existed.\nNow do you think my issue is more clear?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Siegfriedx1","date":"2017-07-13T23:53:15.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello?
