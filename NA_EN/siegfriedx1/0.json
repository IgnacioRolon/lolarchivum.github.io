As soon as he thought about anything to say he couldn't help he would do so even when it was not the correct interpretation without real effort to understand the issue.\n\nAlso he acted like there was no problem from riot part, never ever said sorry for what I was going though and made me feel like shit.\n\nHe basically talked to me in a way that made me feel I was trying to scam riot or anything like that. \nLater I will be doing a very long post about my experience full of prints and images but I'm legit drained by what happened for now. ðŸ˜” \n\nHe even said a plain lie that made me very upset and I personally never saw a rioter talking that way.\n\nPeople sometimes don't know how to deal with other people problems and fail to put themselves in their place.\n\nNever was treated like that before by riot ðŸ˜”","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T02:51:21.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Siegfired, sorry to hear that you walked away feeling rejected by one of our support agents =\\ . Just for a little piece of mind, I went ahead and looked through that chat to see what might have gone wrong. \n\nYou weren't incorrect about your rankings, but it looks like that agent might have forgotten to mention some crucial info: ranked ladders are completely separate across regions. Therefore, it looks like you *were* in Diamond when you ended on the BR server, but when you transferred back to NA that rank dropped down the Gold. It's not the best news, but keep in mind that the reason your ranks are different are due to that server transfer.","replies":[{"poster":"Siegfriedx1","date":"2017-07-21T04:42:02.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HI broporo, thanks for caring about my issue I don't hope you to solve it for me but I guess you are the cooler guy around so I can open myself about it with you.\n\nI'm aware that the ranked ladders are different when on different servers. I just need someone to stop a few minutes to start reasoning on my issue to understand the bottom line of it and why I'm so bothered by the last rioter answer.\n\nQuestions that I know nobody ever did:\n\n\"why this player transfered his account to another server and we kept his account in this server decaying and counting elos like 2 different accounts?\"\n\n\"when we transfered his account what exactly we did? What we said it would happen is what happens?\"\n\n\"did someone ever checked his account to investigate what was going on? Why he need to say everything to us in order to I do small considerations about it?\"\n\nAlthough no one say a word or had interest to say a word about it, it look like to me riot is treating me like I own 2  live different accounts without telling me anything about it.\n\nIf riot want to judge my case and talk to me as I have 2 live accounts, why can't i log in the \"other one\" in Brazil? If I try to log in, it says my account was transfered.\n\nIf riot want to judge like I have 2 live accounts, why, if I ended gold in NA, I don't have a gold icon neither a gold border?\n\nIf riot want to judge like I have 2 live accounts, why when I transfer it say nothing about such strange and unfair condition?\n\nMinding what I said what is your impression? What did I do wrong to not even receive an apology from whats going on my account?\n\nDo you think it make sense or was advertised that riot would create a ghost account that would end season with me at the same time on the other server decaying my elo and showcasing something I was not on the moment I clicked to transfer back?\n\n\nJust to be clear about what was said: when I transferred from Na my account was diamond, not gold. Now I have a system claiming I ended a season in 2 different countries at the same time ( when it's clear I was in Brazil so Im not suppose to have this ghost elo) and I have no gold icon from \"finishing gold\" to even show for it. \n\nAnd you know why?\n\nBecause riot is making me believe it was all a fruit of a spaghetti transfer that no one want to comment or say sorry to me about. Apparently I don't deserve attention and being a customer for years have 0 meaning to have a person actually dedicating 30 minutes to think about what happened to my account and having a human 1 to 1 conversation with me.\n\nI don't have an icon, I don't have a border, I was not on the country and neither was my account to end the season in it. Why is it so hard to acknowledge something is extremely off and give me some credit as a customer to talk to me.\n\nSome people they don't want to talk, they want to be right. I'm not like that and I feel I'm being treated like I am. I'm not going to continue talking until I get what I want as some things have no solution and that's not how things work. But do you think it's reasonable that when I asked to receive a simole email update about my case that it was denied to me without a say or suggestion? That the last rioter said \"you were told the same thing over and over by other rioters\" when he was the first ever to say what he was saying to me making this up on the spot?\n\nThat the last rioter did absolute 0 suggestions, explanations, research and what so ever making me feel lost and helpless the entire time?\n\nThe funny thing is that If i asked to that same rioters that talked to me last how many transfers between NA and Brazil I did on my account, that I'm sure he don't even know because he had no interest on dedicating time on my issue. It was clear he wanted to say something and get to the next person.\nI had to say to him I transfered anyway to he start thinking about it and even after that he was like:\n\"yeah transfered, nothing I can do bye\"\n\nI'm frustrated by all that. With exception of the first rioter that talked to me through live chat (that was really nice), people don't even try to put themselves in my shoes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T04:57:55.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all, I want to assure you that the Support Agent you were speaking with did take the time to look over all the relative information. When you were first talking about your rank, the agent didn't look over your transfer history since transfers typically don't have anything to do with ranks whatsoever. Having inquired about your rank, he pulled up what our systems showed that the account ended at when it was on NA, which was in fact Gold 1 for Ranked Flex. When you go over to your BR account, that's where we can see the Diamond 5 rank. Going between servers like that can have an effect on your rank, since those are separate servers entirely. \n\nWith that being said, we didn't let you other account stay active and get demoted. When you transferred back to NA, you needed to re-seed yourself which is why you played those beginning games. After playing through the replacement matches, it looks like you did in fact place in Gold 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Siegfriedx1","date":"2017-07-21T05:07:14.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for assuring me about that.\n\nHow was I gold 1 in the end of the season if I moved out of NA diamond (you can confirm that)? It's clear the account decayed and the reason I was seeded gold 1 when I went back was because the mmr was low based on decaying.\n\nAlso what difference would make to be seeded as gold 1 to my board icon that is suppose to say the elo I finished my season on. You can check the exact date I moved from NA and you will see I was diamond. The account could only move to gold 1 if it was still active after I left.\n\nIf you can check that information and post here exactly the dates of  transfer with my respective elos that would be the bottom line of my thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2017-07-21T09:01:02.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think moving region is a free pass to stay in a division forever, imagine the abuse if it was the case.\n\nIt seems logical to me that, even if you quit NA server in diamond, if you come back month later and your placement match put you in gold 1 (guess you were dia 5 when transfering) the system worked as expected.\n\nThe other thing is that, it's my belief, you can earn season reward only for the region your account was in when season end, so it's normal that you donb't get border for NA if you finish in BR (maybe I understand wrong but it seems to be the reason your are upset, not getting that border/icon)","replies":[{"poster":"Siegfriedx1","date":"2017-07-21T18:05:29.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who wants to stay in a division forever, just stop registering my elo on the region. I was not the region, what sense makes to decay in a region you are not on and having elos being registered about you?\n\nI would love to have no elo on na instead of this made up gold 1.\n\nIf I can only get rewards on the season I was on don't show I was gold if I was not.
