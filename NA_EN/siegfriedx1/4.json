It mostly stemmed from two problems. \n1. Support was not popular role\n2. The game length needed to be shortened \n\n\nThey addressed this in many ways. Some of those changes indirectly or directly affected the bot lane. For example\n1. Passive gold, exp in duo lane was increased. Gold for assist kills was increased and decreased for solo kills. Catch up experience was increase and allowed duo lanes to keep up in exp to solo laners\n2.  They shortened games by increasing base damages and introducing % to far wider range of champions\n3. Increase wave clear for all lanes\n4. First turret blood was introduced\n5. Cooldown were lowered to increase players fighting more often over objectives\n6. Baron was buffed\n7. Burst from anti ADC champions were lowered to add more counterplay\n8. ADC gold cost of their items during tank rework was lowered. Every item at that time except BOTRK was buffed\n9. Supports items got revamped like Ardent. This gave them much better synergy with ADC than with any other role/class\n10. Passive gold for lane was increased so that champions can reach late game fasters\n11. Wards were changed to be limited and now you don’t even have to buy a sight stone as a support\n\nNow, all of these changes impacted every lane. The problem is, riot succeeded in make game shorter and support more popular. They result is, top laners and Mid lane, who once excelled in early and mid game no longer have that HUGE window. Back in s5 and s6, each lane phase was roughly 15-20 minutes. Mid game was 15-25 minutes. Now, you can lose a tower by 9-10 minutes. Your window of opportunity has been lowered. Supports and especially ADC used to be weak early and mid game. Now, these two classes reach mid-late game spikes so much faster. Once you reach 20-25 minutes, it is effectively late game for many ADC champions. By then, most ADCs have their core items (3-4) items and their supports have the items to cement the power of ADC. \n\nNow, the bot lane can snow ball even earlier. This was something that top and mid lanes used to depend one.  Supports would be healthier if Riot actually introduced items which benefits other classes more directly. Instead they introduce items like Ardent Censor which works with ADCs 10X than any other role. Noticed how good Nuni became when Riot gave him a buff which was really good on AP champions. That was just one ability and champion. Imagine introducing items that directly affect non ADC.\n\nTLDR: Riot nerfed the length of early and mid game, now bot lane can survive and dictate how the flows much earlier.","replies":[{"poster":"OHminus","date":"2018-04-17T02:17:21.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel that Riot's released enough pure support champions with fun enough kits {{champion:432}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:412}}  that support could be a fun role even if income was reduced drasticaly and items like redemption/locket were nerfed/removed. \n\nNot to mention the ones that were there since before season 3, which is when I started playing {{champion:12}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-04-17T14:20:14.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOu hit the nail on the head.

At this point we can't even point our collective fingers at one thing, because there are so many things that are problems that any one thing can't just be nerfed to \"solve it\". We are in a phase right now where supports snowball adcs too quickly, adcs reach their power spikes too soon, and as a result bot lanes decide games more than is fair. We had a phase where junglers and mid laners camped the shit out of bot and bot lane had no agency over the game results and we saw the ADC in 2k17 meme arise, but instead of addressing the problem of how fast bot lane could power spike off of early advantages riot accelerated the tempo of bot lane power spikes in several ways until we found ourselves at the point we are in now.

With the exception of those who have time to be regular board posters many players are unable to devote 50-60 minutes at a time. We have all been there where our parents are yelling at us or we get interrupted. It was a HUGE problem with the game and specifically in getting new players interested.\n\n30-40 minutes, while not ideal, seems to be a sweet spot to aim for IMO.
