Now let's be clear here, the revive ONLY happens if aatrox kills a champion first, which therefore means that you can stun him when he tries to tower dive, so you can kill him before he can kill you, and take the last turret shot so he can revive. His revive part is already that simple enough, but getting rid of that makes some complications. First off, his base kit is pretty strong, but the reason why he can do so much damage is the sweetspots of his q, which people need to dodge to avoid taking massive damage from the second or third cast. This ability is enhanced by his ult, because not only the damage increases but the healing, which is why aatrox in his ult form is a little overextended in terms of how strong can we make this ult. The healing is what makes him mainly survive, not his revive, his revive can be easily counteracted if opponents know how to secure him once he revives, sort of like how someone waits to finish off someone after they used stopwatch. The healing however  allows him to stay alive much longer than he should when rushing in.\r\nAlso, another thing that really sets me off that riot is getting rid of the revive is that it gives away the core attribute of the champion, being able to revive based on their brutality, which even old aatrox was surrounded of with his kit. If they took away the revive, it wouldn't make aatrox... aatrox. He would just be another riven clone because let's look here... triple cast q with knockups, a short dash, cc, and an ultimate that enhances their attack power. Aatrox wouldn't feel any more different anymore than other existing champs like riven. The self revive for getting a kill is what made him unique, it makes players have the \"I can take em or I die\" sort of feeling.\r\nBut there are some pros to getting rid of his revive in terms of it. It makes him easier to deal with for other champions, and can prevent the GA and his ult stacking sort of shenanigan. Those are really the only pros I can technically find. \r\nOnce this revive is gone, aatrox is literally gone, it's not even the champion it was intended to be anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"SgtAwesomeness","date":"2019-07-12T03:17:06.776+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"AAtrox was removed on this guy's release","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whyskered Wyrm","date":"2019-07-11T19:14:35.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Even when i dodge his sweetspots, he can kill me with autos.

Irelia as a champion, does not revive. The post we're currently in, is talking about Revival in a champion's kit. In no way or fashion, is an item, or summoner spell removed years ago, is going to factor in to what a champion has, a Bruiser in this case, has in their *kit*. The comment you responded to, was responding to another comment that is entirely about, the difference between Aatrox and other bruisers, which itself, is responding to someone complaining about how he can miss all his abilities and still kill them. \n\nAKA all Bruiser's autos hurt, at least Aatrox is fucked by GW. Who you replied to, was saying \"I dont remember Irelia having a revive\" pointing out that difference between Irelia (though technically applicable to all those bruisers) and Aatrox's **kit**. In no way, form or fashion, does pointing out that \"well TECHNICALLY\" Irelia could revive using an alternate source than their own natural kit, isn't at all what the conversation is about. \n\nIt's about Champions kits, literally. Macne is using the comparison that Irelia doesn't have a revive in their kit, as to why Aatrox maybe shouldn't have as much power in his auto's as he does. That's an assumption of his point, but that's how it reads to me. Using a more than 5 year old dead summoner spell, isn't at all applicable to the conversation, especially since that was only around during old Irelia.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Crescent Dusk","date":"2019-07-12T23:02:40.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MacneCieMacko,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ad3q3JEg,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-11T19:23:14.599+0000)\n>\n> I don't remember Irelia reviving.\n\nBecause Irelia halves her damage intake with W, has a ranged stun, crazy mobility and easy lane sustain via Q while being one of the best backline divers in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whyskered Wyrm","date":"2019-07-11T19:28:40.632+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crescent Dusk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ad3q3JEg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-07-11T19:17:00.847+0000)\n>\n> He's a bruiser.

There is no \"drain tanking raid boss\" when your only source of healing is your q. After he has used the 3rd q he has to wait around 3 seconds to do pretty much any sort of real damage.  And because his healing is tied to his damage this means that he will die if he gets focused. \n\nFurthermore as a champ that lacks innate armour pen this means that fighting armoured targets is a bad idea since you heal less. Less heal less survivability. You have to hit soft targets in order to heal enough to survive a teamfight where you get somewhat focused at the least.

But the hp regen/level is just a joke really.  These things cant replace the job the revive had. And frankly, as a melee caster champ he needs something to help him during teamfights. Under normal circumstances his ulti would do just fine but he is a caster. He relies on his q to do basically anything.  The moment his q goes down he becomes relatively harmless. He doesnt have atk speed for that juicy 100% ratio aa.   \n\nNow i know that you will basically say \"well he redirects precious threat away from their carries\" which would be nice, if that was his theme.  But its not.  And, IF they dont change anything and just  flatout remove the revive, his ulti will basically become a worse yi ulti. Yi's ulti provides atk speed, movement speed (although less than aatrox's however it doesnt decay) immunity to slows and cripples, ghost AND AND the refresh applies throughout the whole duration unlike aatrox's that it refreshes only 5 second. \n\nAs a final note, without the revive, why pick aatrox? If i want resets i can go darius and be even more successful. Plus his healing isnt tied to his damage. Then there is also illaoi that has even more lifesteal (also not tied to her damage) and even more raid boss feel.

Especially when you consider it during the early with midgame.  Early game you dont deal much damage so heal is low. That 10% is wasted. During midgame you deal good damage but 5% is low.  The cds reduction as i said in another comment is good, but wont help him during teamfights.  He already has it low enough thanks to the resets and his build.  Having even less cd will matter close to nothing when you will die in teamfights the moment your q goes on cd (or when you dont have flash because again, more armour less heal aatrox gets).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2019-07-11T20:56:27.992+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Manxxom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ad3q3JEg,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-11T18:00:01.928+0000)\n>\n>The healing is what makes him mainly survive, not his revive\n\nI'm pretty sure that's the point of the change.
