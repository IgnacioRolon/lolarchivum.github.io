That change in build path means denying Yasuo what Yasuos always want to do.\n\nThey want to split spush with their strong late game and collapse onto teamfights, and being unable to 1v1 a Kled with Thornmail and Randuins means he is denied his power spikes and farm and Kled's ult allows him to collapse into teamfights much better while being significantly tankier than a Yasuo.\n\nYasuo is an annoying champ in lane no doubt, but bruisers are not a class category that usually struggle with Yasuo short of skillshot reliant bruisers like Illaoi/Darius (Yasuo can juke their stuff pretty well, it's just most of them are bad and claim Yasuo is countered by Darius when all he needs to do is E his Q and poke him down with tornadoes before engagements, plus massively outscaling him late).\n\nRenekton alone completely thrashes Yasuo and does a far better job than Yasuo at what Yasuo is supposed to be good at (but ok, I'll grant Renekton is busted and due for nerfs).\n\nIDK, I just find champions like Zed far worse than Yasuo. Way safer, stronger scaling, stronger burst, naturally builds BC+LDR whereas Yasuo is far more delayed in building those prior to IE+BT+greaves.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasuo Master","date":"2019-10-01T04:17:41.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Username checks out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nøctμrne","date":"2019-09-30T16:40:21.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kled is very easy to beat though.

But even then if Kled rushes even a bit of armor Nocturne stands no chance by mid to late game.\n\nPicking nocturne top is cutting the nose to spite the face. You've just denied your team a frontline like the same assholes who pick ranged top. And then the enemy team can freely dive your ADC and mages without much resistance unless your jungler and supp both picked CC tank champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Nøctμrne","date":"2019-09-30T17:15:16.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Calm down, you don't understand itemization.
