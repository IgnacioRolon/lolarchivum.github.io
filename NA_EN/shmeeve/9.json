Especially your level 1 Q - it doesn't do much damage to justify throwing it out over your W, and the reason is that your W gives you a) a soul fragment stack, which in turn gives you b) mana and health back in return. And if you're running electrocute over phase rush, a lot of your early trading damage will be coming from that anyway - might as well opt into stacking up bonus health over trying to deal a modicum of damage more that many laners will heal back right now since Taste of Blood is a hot choice.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jimmy Rustles","date":"2019-11-30T19:07:59.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another mistake is yanking enemies out of my skill shots\n\nEspecially if you're lux","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-12-01T20:09:03.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you pull the enemy out of your W.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thefatlazycat","date":"2019-11-30T18:37:33.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also, as the swain main of my friend group can I have that format?","replies":[]},{"poster":"thefatlazycat","date":"2019-11-30T18:36:39.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"those monsters","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-30T19:14:03.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is this really a thing?
