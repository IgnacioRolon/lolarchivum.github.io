However, if your in a higher rank, the game expects you to do better than you already are to achieve more lp for a higher rank, doing about average or less means you lose lp, even if you win a match, it&#039;s like you have to get you and your game near perfection if you want to climb something up to like challenger.","replies":[{"poster":"ROYALR3IGN","date":"2018-12-31T15:46:10.437+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not how this works. Your LP gain isn't based on how well you do in a match, its based off the MMR of the games you win and lose. If you lose a game that has an average MMR of 1400 and your own MMR is 1500, you will lose more LP than if you lost a game that had an MMR average of 1600. Games that you are expected to win but you actually lose will lose you more LP than games the system expects you to lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2018-12-31T16:22:38.743+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read this one, he holds the truth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"420Dog","date":"2018-12-31T15:50:38.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um no... lol climbing is super easy if you are any good.
