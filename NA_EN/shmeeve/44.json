He also has a cute little move that deals damaged based on the number of enemies that character has killed.  As in \"remember grinding out enemies for experience and money?  Ya those ones  50 hours of game play ago?  Well now take damage for EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.\"  Their usually late game enemies so by the time you meet them you've always killed enough enemies for them to kill that party member 5 times over.\n\nPassing through any area where one can spawn creates the same feeling of dread as playing Russian Roulet with only 1 empty chamber.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-12-04T03:56:59.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tonberry.
