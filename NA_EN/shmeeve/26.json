The item also grants bonus armor and magic resist, as well as movement speed.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-02T05:05:38.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2018-11-03T15:38:47.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"will it knock them up like when mario throws a turtle shell?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drakath2002","date":"2018-11-02T08:08:02.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I ask what exactly happens when the poor Scuttle Cran collides with the faces of the enemy Champion?

There was nothing... all the world that had once stood there was gone, lost to oblivion, to thousands of meaningless whispers like an apocalyptic song with no instruments and no voices. And there, on a patch of dusty ground facing the great abyss of death, Kindred were smiling, silently.\n\n'Everything ends', Lamb said.\n'But we always remain!', Wolf answered, with his thick but playful voice.\n'Ah, the silence of pure darkness... The tranquility of mist, the peacefulness of this black sky...'\n\nThen, a dazzling greenish star broke through the inkblack sky, burning bright in a bath of flaming particles. Kindred watched.\n'What is that, dear Lamb? Didn't we kill... everything?'\n\nLamb be like: *MAN WHAT'S THAT WE ACED THE ENEMY TEAM, I GOT A PENTAKILL, WHA-*\n\nAnd then that damn greenie star turns to be a damn FLYING SCUTTLER CRAB and it hits Lamb in the face and Wolf is like\n'WHAT. THE. HECK?!' The end.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2018-11-02T15:22:56.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scuttler’s Cannon\n\n{{item:2053}} + {{item:1057}} + 1080 gold (2700 total)\n\n+55 Armor\n+55 Magic Resist\n\nUNIQUE PASSIVE – POINT RUNNER: Builds up to 20% bonus movement speed over 2 seconds while in the river or near turrets, fallen turrets and Void Gates.\n\nUNIQUE PASSIVE – SCUTTLER STORAGE: Takedowns on the Rift Scuttler grant a stack of Scuttler Hoarder.\n\nUNIQUE ACTIVE – SCUTTLER AIRLINES: Expends a stack of Scuttler Hoarder to launch an untargetable Rift Scuttler in the target direction.
