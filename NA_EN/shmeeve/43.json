Yow reav3! nows that next year is fastly approaching, can we expect the road map to be very early next year like maybe early january?  (fingers cross, I expect the next new champ to be revealed and be live in January considering the development of this champ is very much done now i believe, cause the development of this squad5 champ is like last year based on spideraxe's upcoming new champ/VGU list for 2018 last year). Lastly, with the 50/50 spilt, does this mean we will only get 5 new champs and 5 VGU's next year? or 50/50 as to ratio like we could get 4/4 or 6/6 new champs/vgus.\n\nPS: would you consider morg/kayle champs development as to one? because they were remade by only one team unlike xayah&rakan with 2 teams that created a drought in releases. Wish every month next year there will be a new content(champs/reworks) because new contents makes the game lively. Please no more drought months!\n\nPPSS: Does minor VGU's like ez  or VGUs like aatrox affect the 50/50 split? or just only full VGUs? PLease make reveal pages and login themes for minor VGUs because that made ez rework incomplete for me huhu. Im collecting champ login themes and ez destroyed my hope for collecting all of it unless the animation department would make login themes for champions that doesn't have one like splash art updates.\n\nSorry i cram all my questions here because i need answers from you(as always lol) reav3, my favorite rioter :) Advance thanks for the reply.\n\nNevertheless, 2018 was one of your best years champ dept !! kudos to you!","replies":[{"poster":"QMighty","date":"2018-11-20T22:17:49.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K&M count as one spot, don't ask me to find the reference but Reav3 said that awhile ago","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-11-20T01:29:46.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a very good year. thank you all for your hard work.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2018-11-20T17:19:53.973+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for enjoying or playing all the Champions or VGUs .
