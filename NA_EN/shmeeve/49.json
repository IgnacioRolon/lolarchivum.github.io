Renekton was sure that he would be destroyed while leading Nasus up the Disk, but instead he was reborn through sun, Xerath shouldn't probably be worthy, but he found some way to mess with the Disk, and he got way more power than normal Ascended out of the stolen ray","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2019-08-08T23:55:19.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say the Sun Disk's \"criteria\" could be similar to Illaoi's test of spirit. \n\nSo it doesnt actually take the individual's 'moral compass' into account so much as the individual's willpower and/or something else.

How to fail Illaoi's test is somewhat clear, Dying or just not fighting for your life is a zero, while fighting and surviving means passing with honors, there doesn't seem to be middle ground as far as I know. What we don't know is what triggers a fail with the Sun Disk, as it seems you can't do much there, just get up the pedestal, get sprayed by sun and hope for the best. As far as we know, it could be a \"Strong Will\" or something like that what defines if the chosen will turn into Baccai, Ascended or... ashes, in a similar way to how Targonian Aspects define who they will inhabit by climbing Mount Targon","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UomoAfide","date":"2019-08-08T23:33:42.536+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering how some of the Ascendeds/Darkins acted in Twlight of the Gods i think it's safe to assume that some of them might have not been the perfect paladins of virtue that Shurima probably depicted them to be.","replies":[{"poster":"TheMan292","date":"2019-08-08T23:35:38.538+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UomoAfide,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=aVQqe4VW,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2019-08-08T23:33:42.536+0000)\n>\n> Considering how some of the Ascendeds/Darkins acted in Twlight of the Gods i think it's safe to assume that some of them might have not been the perfect paladins of virtue that Shurima probably depicted them to be.\n\nwould be realistic to be honest. many brave and talented people in real life, even those that are seen as heroes (and justifiably so) are actually quite horrible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UomoAfide","date":"2019-08-08T23:35:43.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus, the trauma of fighting the Void and the loss of the Emperor must have contributed to their downfall.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NotaRobot1006","date":"2019-08-08T23:08:49.922+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Void-PTSD plus 1400 years in an eternal torture prison isn't a good recipe for a psychologically stable individual.
