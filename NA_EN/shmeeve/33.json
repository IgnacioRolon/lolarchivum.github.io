Then, I had a basketball tournament outside, so at that rate I got sunburnt bad, exhausted, tired, and frustrated, so I was pretty stressed out, then I had allergies and felt sick. So, I slept early when I got home which my cousin stayed over for the night. Anyway, after roughly 12 hours of sleep? I \"wake up\" but not entirely. I could not move AT ALL so I was like \"oh crap, am I paralyzed!?\" I was freaking out that I had some sort of disorder or health problem, like I was the next stephen hawking or something. Anyway, next thing I know, I can still see stuff somewhat around the room, like the only thing I could move was my eyes. Next thing I see, is a black shade at the far end of the room, in the shape of guess who? {{champion:28}} . Like I was not expecting THAT to be what I see as the demon thing during the sleep paralysis thing, either way I will scared out of my mind, but evelynn is technically a demon right? Anyway, the shadow kept going closer to me so I was panicking to move. Then somehow, I let out the weirdest sound in my life, sort of like as if you tried to make the sound of a turkey while your mouth was covered. Anyway, the shadow was gone, I could move again, and I was literally out of my mind. Then I realized what I just went through... After ten minutes of realization, I went back to sleep.\r\nThat was a weird night, and mother of god I was terrified during then.","replies":[]}
