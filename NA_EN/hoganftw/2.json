I would expect allies and enemies to react differently to being eaten.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PyroAeroVampire","date":"2019-06-23T21:36:34.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner's ultimate and Tahm's Devour are actually quite similar. Let's look at that a little bit.\n\nIf Tahm got a speed boost while eating an enemy, Devour would literally be better than Skarner's ultimate. Shorter cooldown (10 seconds at base against an enemy champion) deals more damage, lasts longer (Skarner Impale is 1.75 seconds, Devour is up to 2 seconds), stops vision for the target, AND makes them untargetable by anyone, including their own team, then Tahm would just build movespeed items, devour someone, then run really far away into his own team. He has to be severely slowed or else his W would quite possibly be the best single non-ultimate ability in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-06-23T18:31:05.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They took off the speed boost when eating allies because of how powerful it was defensively in lcs.\n\n\nNow he also gets a 95% slow when eating an ally.\n\n\nBut you can still counter the 95% slow and even have it speed you up if you get 100+% slow resistance from phase rush , unflinching, and boots of swiftness.\n\n\nAnd ofc riot doesn't want you moving fast with an enemy champ in your belly, youre displacing them which is strong by itself as long as you have a team that doesn't have tunnel vision syndrome.\n\n","replies":[]}]}
