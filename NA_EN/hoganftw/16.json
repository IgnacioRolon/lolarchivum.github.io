I play Underlords too and even with guaranteed item drops it doesn't take the luck out of the game. It just punishes players who didn't get anything less. It doesn't punish people who know how to play either, it just makes the game feel more fair, even if it doesn't guarantee that the game will be fair due to what items actually drop. I'm not saying that everyone gets the same items, but it makes sense that everyone has the similar item count, with those failing neutral camps probably receiving less. And given that there are item disparities, with some being leaps and bounds better than others, it still rewards lucky players but keeps it so that they don't just run away with the game from the get-go. At the very least, it allows unlucky players to have a chance to make the one or two items that they need to hopefully get back into the game.\n\nMaking the game more \"fair\" isn't ruining the game. It doesn't take away from the strategic elements either as it doesn't remove RNG of which champions/items you get stuck with, what strats you use, whether you save for interest or hyper roll, or your positioning abilities. Just like in Underlords where items drops are guaranteed, the skill factor would definitely still there and that 9/10 times the better players will make top 4 regardless of how hard RNG screws them over.\n\nIn short, unlucky players get punished far less, lucky players get rewarded slightly less, and still keeping all the elements of skill involved.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zaloog","date":"2019-07-15T18:16:10.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChaosReyn,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=HMAyA9dF,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2019-07-15T15:47:26.205+0000)\n>\n> Ok...either the count is consistent, or the count is different between matches.

Since unit quality is far more important then unit quantity in this game. When your forced to level up early in this game it reduces your chances of finding level 1 units your looking for to level up. Xp drops are terrible late game because it's meaninglessness. Since your either already hoarding enough gold where gaining 4 gold is meaningless, or you've used the vast majority of your gold rerolling to find upgrades.

Last night, opening round after creeps, I faced someone who had a lvl 2 {{champion:67}} w {{item:3124}} and iirc {{item:3046}} and their 2 star {{champion:19}}  had a full tank item built.. They had another 1-2 item parts in their inventory... I had my 1/2 item from carousel.. haha\n\nPBE (while i haven't gotten to try it) had a good idea to guarantee item drops but then going to the may drop xp or gold.. I don't want effin xp or a gold or two.. That won't help me keep up w/ the person rng gave everything to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devilreaper XIII","date":"2019-07-15T18:56:42.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shared draft should become an item shop, where players can sell and buy items to a limit, where all players are capable of getting a fixed number of items. the start of the game shouldn't be a rotation of champions either, since the champion you want can be on the other side right in front of an opponent with a good item attached to it, i once saw a tristana with rfc O____O.... too much random, instead let the player choose a class and give the player a random champion from that class with a related item to that class.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokudilandau","date":"2019-07-15T17:58:49.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've noticed on the PBE it seems to drop each time from monsters, something that was needed. Dragon kill nothing drops feels bad","replies":[]}]}
