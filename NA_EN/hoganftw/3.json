I practice it. I live it. I breathe it.\r\nIt&#039;s not a &quot;game&quot;, it&#039;s a professional E-sport. I intend on being the very best, like no one ever was.\r\nThat&#039;s like telling her brother that he just &quot;plays ball&quot; when she used to drag me to her brother&#039;s high school football games.\r\nIf his games matter more than mine does, I don&#039;t think you understand how the real world works here.\r\n\r\nSecond of all, this is my passion. I dropped everything to start my life as a professional gaming athlete.\r\nI dropped out of college, I quit my day job, I sold everything that I had not-League of Legends related.\r\nThis is a dream, I don&#039;t understand why anyone would shame me for chasing a dream.\r\nDid we shame Martin Luther King Jr. for having a dream?\r\n\r\nThird, yeah I know my health and hygiene have been on the decline, but have some goddamn faith in me woman.\r\nAt least I&#039;m using paper plates and eating lean hot pockets so you don&#039;t have to worry about dishes anymore.\r\nHell, I even take out the trash too. But oh, that&#039;s never been enough for you.\r\nI&#039;m aiming for the LCS by the end of next year. An LCS contract would have set us both up for life. \r\n\r\nVeronica, you keep talking about how I need to be realistic but I climbed to Gold 5 before.\r\nIf I can make it to gold 5 I could easily make it to diamond and beyond within just a matter of months.\r\nThe difference between Gold player and Challenger player is very slight.\r\nHell, most of the time it&#039;s just finding the right duo so that you don&#039;t get feeding monkeys on your team.\r\n\r\nI was so heartbroken when you left me, but now that I think about it you were only holding me back.\r\nYou&#039;ll be watching my games in the pub while waiting tables sweetie while I&#039;m sipping White Monsters out of a champagne glasses from my yacht.","replies":[]}
