There were checks and balances.\r\nIn Ghostcrawler&#039;s time and in the current state, the game is in the worst state that it&#039;s ever been.\r\n\r\nWe had our time to hate him, to resent him, and to shun him. We had pinned him as the root of evil.\r\nBut now comes the time when we admit our faults, we forgive him, we forgive ourselves, and most importantly, we beg him to return.\r\nThis game was nothing before he created it and now it is apparent that the game is a shell of its former self without him.\r\n\r\nGod bless.","replies":[]}
