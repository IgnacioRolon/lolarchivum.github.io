Personally I really don't see it working without some really clever mechanics on top of that 'core' mechanic. There are a lot of problems involved.....\n\n* Uncopyable abilities (as Skelenth said) like Azir W\n* Combo Abilities like Zilean Q would be awful to copy\n* Having a single ability that can be *any* ability means that it, by it's very nature, cannot synergize with the rest of this hypothetical champion's normal kit\n\nNow this does not at all mean it's impossible for this kind of champion to exist.\n\nFor example, a whiiiiiiile back I saw a ditto/copy champion kit that, as an ultimate, copied an ally. While copied, this champion would look exactly like the target (think the mirror in brawlers) and have access to all abilities with a cooldown less than 20 seconds (so no actual ultimates, but still including things like Akali R). When this champion used an ability the illusion is broken, but at the end of the day you could copy a Thresh and send another Q out, or copy a Fizz and troll-pole your way out of something.\n\nHonestly it was so far back I don't remember the concept and I can't remember the rest of the kit but it stuck with me because it was a way to make this kind of mechanic work.\n\nThey key is to allow this 'copy' mechanic to be more than just 'get another ability'. Because that *by itself* is simply not a viable mechanic, but adding in stuff like visual cloning and illusions let's this mechanic pair with some fun playstyle changes and make it more favorable.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-10-13T21:22:47.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, there is evidence of it working even by itself.

Kind of like Rogue from X-men or Buu from Dragonball Z. I imagine it to be similar to Fiora riposte, where it negates the damage and allows you to then cast the absorbed ability.
