So unless they decided to split themselves only recently - and after assuming the role of a King which itself sounds unlikely for Death to sit around + arrow sticking out of chest, I doubt he was them. Especially if tales have been told of two forms of Death, which would take some time to circulate across Runeterra; doubt they have the internet.\n\nIt's more likely they're just telling us that even kings can't escape from death's embrace - or something similar to that effect. Since he took the arrow, instead of getting chewed up by Wolf, assuming he accepted his fate after possibly having run through the forest (maybe after sending his subjects to their deaths in an attempt to save himself - doubt he wanted to lead them away since Kindred targeted him specifically, although who knows, maybe it was all of their times).\n\nAaaand I forgot this was a joke xp.
