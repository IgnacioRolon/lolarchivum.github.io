Goal is to have it be useable by both some marksmen and some other classes as per current ER.\n\nAnd [this](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/RgwqT7KP-quick-gameplay-thoughts-january-25?comment=00050000) one:\n> \nAt this point after a lot of testing, yeah, we don't think Shojin's niche was working well enough. Too overlapped with a ranged of other AD+defense (HP or other) items and not particularly bound to light fighters either.
