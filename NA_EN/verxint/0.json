Most champions are going to be pigeon holed into a certain build path no matter what based on their scaling or kits. This isn't new, it's really just more of the same with far fewer choices. In the old System I would always have similar Builds between champions but I could have one with CDR, AS, Health and MR/Armor. I could also have pages with lethality or AD.
