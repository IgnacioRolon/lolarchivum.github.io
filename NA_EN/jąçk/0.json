But with this new system it seems for me that it is treating me near the same. I get honored almost every game, and I have never been banned or even chat restricted in my 5 year career. I find it hard to believe that I have not been bumped up to honor 3 but my level 19 friend who plays league once a week and has afked multiple games has honor level 4, and he started at the lowest level. I just think that this system is a little unreliable and wanted to provide you with feedback because it seems a little bs that someone who has been playing for a month has more honor than a 5 year veteran that plays multiple games every day  with no offenses, I hope that this system continues to improve.","replies":[]}
