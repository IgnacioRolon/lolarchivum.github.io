Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to the game.\"\nI know that many diffrent people have the same issue butfor me it came back over and over again. For me this error message popped up the first time a few months ago and i was able to fix (don't remember 100%, I think it was by port forwarding) . After a while it came back and I fixed it again (this time by flushing my DNS). This time all of the methods I could find failed.\n\nSince I have an SSD I sometimes tried to quickly restart my PC (while the other player were in the loading screen) which sometimes helped and sometimes did nothing. Event after just restarting the game a few times it worked sometimes and sometimes it didn't.\n\nNow I have it again and would like to understand why, so I can ultimately fix it. \n\nMy set up and other Information that might be important: \n\nHardware (more than enough):\nGtx 660 \nCore i5 3470 3,2 Ghz\n2 BenQ screens.\nLegitech G105 keyboard + G402 Mouse (found out those can cause issues aswell)\nLAN connection (over powerline)\nDlink DSL-3580L router\n\nSoftware: \nWindows 10 Home\nI used Overwolf for a while but it is now uninstalled\nLogitech gaming software \n\nThanks in advance and if you have the same issue I hope you can find a solution here. {{champion:53}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T17:19:41.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is always online, so issues like this can be common.  It looks like your specific issue might be related to an unstable connection that's erratically losing comms to the game server.   This shouldn't be a result of your specs, SSD, or hardware.  I'd focus more on network related troubleshooting, like the port forwarding.
