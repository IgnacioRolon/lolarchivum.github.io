While people learn to just expect it and ignore the approximate time, I think you should really update your system to be more accurate. I don't know what it takes into account to get that time, but it sucks and is not doing its job; just shoddy work that shouldn't have been implemented if it never worked in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-10-02T22:34:16.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was watching NB3 stream earlier; Pobelter waited 70 minutes for queue to pop.\n\nI also play a lot of bot games (because of the short queues), approximate timer is 5 minutes, I've never had to wait more than 30 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ictus","date":"2014-10-03T00:55:50.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think the approx. time is for the entire queue, and not mmr specific.","replies":[]}]}
