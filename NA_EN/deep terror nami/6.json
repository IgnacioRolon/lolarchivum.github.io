But when you put it up to other 1350's like Star Guardian Lux it looks like it was drawn into the game with a crayon.\n\nDon't get the wrong idea tho, I LOVE my Necromancer Azir so much, it just seems like he deserves to look a little more detailed for 1350.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-12T14:12:32.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk what exactly you dislike about it. It has enough features to classify as a 1350;\n\n* New model and textures for not only Azir, but his Sand Soldiers and Sun Disc, too!\n* New green, ethereal particles!\n* New sound effects for all of his skills!\n* New voice processing!\n* New recall animation where he calls forth the trapped spirits in his staff!\n\nSG Lux has;\n\n* Completely new model (ribbons, stars and cute things!)\n* New particles for abilities! (stars and sparkles!)\n* New recall! (she spins around magically!)\n* New ability SFX! (can you even get more magical?)\n* Some new animations! (a cute new idle, and a new dance! Can you tell where the dance is from?) \n\n975 models typically only get a new recall and *maybe* particles.
