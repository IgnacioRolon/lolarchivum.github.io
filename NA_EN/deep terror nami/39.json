This also functions identically for Ezreal&#039;s R-Trueshot Barrage, but not his Q-Mystic Shot, so I think it&#039;s just a feature of Ultimates.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don&#039;t think there is any useful purpose for this. Please remove casting Ultimates in the direction you&#039;re facing when hovering your portrait, or if there is some use to it, give an option to disable it.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/704764df19924668bac3e81e41c6249c.gif\r\n######(GifCam wasn&#039;t capturing my mouse; I&#039;m just moving my cursor on and off my portrait while holding down R using quickcast w/ indicators)","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-18T23:41:25.868+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"so many missed lux ultys whils supporting for red side...  i always thought it was a glitch","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-02-19T12:15:27.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then people wonder why Supports are not prefered role, when one cannot reliably kill secure his ADC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-02-19T01:44:03.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.

You can disable mini-map \"movement\" such as right clicking on it, to avoid travelling the wrong way, but you still cannot disable mini-map CASTING.\n\nThe most obvious and annoying example of this happening is when you are something like lux or nami as people have pointed out, and your enemy is on your screen in the direction of your mini-map and you click to aim that direction but accidently click on the mini-map on the opposite side of your champion thus firing it the other way. Not only do you miss but you look incredibly foolish. Yes this \"can be avoided\", some have recommended not using casting indicators... but it **should simply have an option to DISABLE CASTING ON THE MINIMAP** like you can disable movement via right-click.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cronofuge","date":"2017-02-19T09:28:03.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that happens every now and then but after a while I forget about it so I didn't think to go to the practice tool.\n\nSo many Ezreal and Lux ults.
