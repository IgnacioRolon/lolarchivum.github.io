(In this steal Amumu Smited early as well. Watch the health!)\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t be cheap, use a Pink! Hell, they could even see me sitting there. There&#039;s another lesson to be had for it; if you&#039;re going to put vision behind the pit, don&#039;t ignore what you see. Kill them, prepare some CC, or pull the Dragon (not Baron of course) out of reach of medium range attacks.\r\n\r\n*P.S. We lost the match anyway lol. Still had a good time though.*","replies":[{"poster":"Byakuya Kuchiki","date":"2015-07-20T14:49:17.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or have a jungler that knows when to get dragon and how to press F","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2015-07-20T17:56:15.265+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"No wonder I suck at objective control!
