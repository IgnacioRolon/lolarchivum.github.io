It&#039;s especially troublesome when you had a DoT on you. If a special rule could be made so Recall (and any other 3+ second channels interrupted by damage) is not cancelled by its delayed damage, that would be great.\r\n\r\nThat is all, thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-02-03T00:54:24.202+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could get behind this.
