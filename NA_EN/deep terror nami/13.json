That's just too short of a time to properly enjoy a particular game mode.  You can't tell your friends about the fun games you had over the last weekend and enjoy that game mode with them the next weekend and if you don't play your favorite mode on the particular weekend it's available you just miss it altogether.  Take URF for example.  It sounds like URF will be available for two random weekends out of the entire year and I'm thinking, \"Well, if I just happen to not be able to play on the particular weekend or weekends URF is available that is going to really suck\".","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2016-03-08T17:15:28.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think changing the game weekly is the  best approach as people get bored or start complaining a lot as the event last longer.

I really thought that was an interesting game mode and really liked it, and if so do you plan on adding more bots to the mode?
