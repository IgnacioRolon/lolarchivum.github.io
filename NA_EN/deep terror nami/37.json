ELO Hell does not exist. That is a opinion or saying that it does exist is also a opinion.  Your reasoning for it existing for some players is correct they cant climb because their \"bad\". Its not elo hell its the player so in since elo hell occurs with all players in all leagues because at one point they can no longer climb due to them not being at the skill level required to make it higher at that moment. So blaming elo hell for not rising is completely false and just a way for ignorant people to feel as if the reason they are not improving is not because they are too ignorant to see their mistakes and keep making them but that the game system is flawed and that they are stuck where they are without ever being able to get out. I climbed myself all the way from Bronze 4 to Silver 5 in about a week. But im not saying I am a good player but that I got to the division I deserved because I played the champs I could play and help carry and managed my way out of bronze. A not of advice. Try not to use hard carry such as squishy fighter tops or early game reliant mages mid. If you are going to play any role not including adc I suggest you use a tank champion that is more tactical than damage reliant so that his team can come together in team fights. I personally use Skarner because of his low play rate and a complicated champ to counter he is easy to use against the enemys team. All I do is wait out early telling my team just not to feed and when we make it to late I just run into the enemy team and ult whoever is carrying their team be it a fed mid laner or maybes a enemy adc. Once I ulted I drag them into my team and we quickly burst them down earning us the perfect chance to charge the enemy team and get a good push in. Simple but tactical and tanky champs like this work really well in low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"darkmatchwaldo","date":"2016-03-24T00:53:57.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:77}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:48}} \n\nare all great champions for solo carrying games in bronze.
