Basically its you have to be \"polite\" when being yelled at, and you can't defend yourself with \"verbal harassment\". I usually just use positive reinforcement like if they say \"you're trash\" then I saw \"well i hope you're the garbage man and will collect me\" or if they say \"you should uninstall\" then I saw \"you're right, it'll give me more time to spend with you ;)\".\n\nIf their philosophy truly is to just sit there and not respond, then ill devise my own \"positive\" one to work around that.","replies":[{"poster":"CheckMyDoubles","date":"2015-06-12T20:17:59.246+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's the right answer.

This account just got a two week ban, and i never instigate and only rarely respond to trolls.  I'd say in the last couple weeks I might have said enough to be considered toxic maybe 3 or 4 times (all but one time so mild it really wasn't toxic), I Never harass people, I never initiate an argument, and I never insult people unless they insult me and even then I don't usually insult them (there are of course a few times but not many.  Few and far inbetween)\n\nNow the account I use to troll while I have a bad streak in teammates has trolled 500+ games (feeding and insulting/harassing teammates) It's been unpunished (except for a chat restrict, funny story because I refused to say anything in chat and only fed at first, till I got a chat restrict, then I started harassing/insulting too) since December, and definitely has more reports than games played.  \n\nWhich would you think should be punished?

No: Has toxicity in game gone up every season? Yes) I am a good example of this right at this moment in fact.  I have an account I use when I start getting bad teammates to get through the bad streak of them (it's always a streak of them) and on this account I do nothing but feed.  Well I did nothing but feed while staying silent till I got the chat ban.  After that I decided to add insults into the mix all game because why not if I'm chat restricted for being silent I might as well be a jerk.  That account has trolled over 500 games while spamming insults at my teammates and except for the chat restrict has gone unpunished.  This account which just got harassed and might have 3 to 4 games that could be considered a bit toxic just got a 14 day suspension.

I currently have a 75 game restriction... why? I don't know. I put in a support ticket asking exactly this and all RIOT can tell me is that I \"harassing your teammates to gank for you, complaining in chat, blaming your team for not following your call\"\n\nI truly don't know where this comes into play.  If I ask my jg to gank and ping a few times cause I'm getting pushed under tower is that \"harassing\"? If I complain that Riot really needs to understand that basic math is that 3>2 and the game should have ended does that make me toxic when we're down 20+ kills?  Does saying \"hey you guys probably shouldn't have walked down mid 1 at a time into a 1v5\" means I'm blaming them and why would that be a bad thing if they ARE to blame?\n\nIt's not so simple. There are outliers to any statistical system and inappropriate measures take throughout ANY justice system.  At current there is NO rulelist, NO list of banned phrases, NO ability to appeal (because RIOT support specifically says they do not remove ANY chat restriction or ban) and no form for the community (because we've been under maintenance for months) to contribute to the selection process.\n\nSorry, but people like you need to get off their high horse and realize that free speech and communication on every level shouldn't be censored.  I agree that there should be a penalty when people are horrible (and yes there's a great many people out there doing it) but to suggest that people aren't being banned improperly is just ignorant.\n\nI've asked RIOT support to provide specific details as I cannot, and I'm certain they cannot come up with a good example, find anything in my chat logs that warrant 75 games restricted.\n\nCheck out one I got reported for which lead to a restriction:\nIh8ucuzurtoxic: all good, it's bots. we can have a tea party at nexus and still win\nIh8ucuzurtoxic: great play\nIh8ucuzurtoxic: u2\nIh8ucuzurtoxic: damn minions (i died cuz I had a huge wave push mid inhib and couldn't run around them fast enough)\nIh8ucuzurtoxic: great game\nIh8ucuzurtoxic: fun times\nIh8ucuzurtoxic: plz honor\n\nIf you can find out where that was an example of:\n\nCheat\nFlame\nTroll\nLeave\n\nPlease explain it to me, cause I don't fucking get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-06-14T00:29:55.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never implied that there are no outliers or mistakes in the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Ih8ucuzurtoxic","date":"2015-06-14T01:00:46.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"To me it seems like insinuated that anyone who got restricted or banned deserved it for doing one of the four things you mentioned.

Even riot rep stated i do not speak in a majority of my matches (80% and up i dont say a word) but for eventually defending myself this is what happened. The system is automated now and support cant do anything. \nHey centuriation55,\n\nThanks for contacting us about your concerns and I'll try to help clear up why a chat restriction was placed on the account. While you do not talk in a majority of your games. You were chat restricted for the few games you did decide to chat in. As your chat logs look like this:\n\n[20:01] centuriation55: i feel bad for u guys i gota say. i dont think the game took into account your skill levels before it did matchmaking\n[20:30] centuriation55: theres a difference between \"i cant jungle\" and \"i dont know how to ward\"\n[21:12] centuriation55: im the best player here...by far\n[21:27] centuriation55: dont tell me if i played a different role you would automatically not be the biggest scrub caitlyn in north america\n[22:00] centuriation55: if you want your opinion to count for something dont suck ass when u CALL AND PLAY adc.\n[23:39] centuriation55: blames me cus she refused to tell eveyrone she is incapable of playing the role she not only called but then picked\n[23:40] centuriation55: oooooook\n[23:53] centuriation55: cus the role i picked i played well. won my lane shut down katarina. this game is on you and ur lack of skill\n[23:54] centuriation55: not me\n[24:57] centuriation55: ur the crybaby upset cus i can play my role\n[24:57] centuriation55: and lane\n[25:02] centuriation55: noob\n\nIn this game you are arguing with the ADC all game since minute one. Nothing constructive comes out of arguing. All this is doing is frustrating the rest of the team and hurting the rest of the team. Remember that there are 3 other teammates in the game that want to win just as much as you do. When you choose to spend more time segueing with someone in the chat these players suffer just as much.","replies":[{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2015-06-14T03:13:24.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was this replied on my comment? this had nothing to do with what i said lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2015-06-14T02:44:54.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Good luck.

It isn't a matter of if you encounter a troll, but when. Here's how I approach this:\n\n1. I do not swear or get upset. You'll find yourself getting banned.\n2. Upon the beginning of the match, I follow all formalities greeting opponents. Then I go to my position.\n3. I ask politely for the person to find their position. I'll repeat, but I won't get upset. If the player leaves, I thank them and it is the end. We have fun.\n4. If they persist and try to get you to engage in an argument during the match, I tell the player that I will not argue and end the conversation. Normal chat with teammates, including the troll ensures. Gj, etc. I do not mute, as I'd like read what is being said. \n5. There is a chance that you've been trolled enough and you're at a deficit in the match. Thus, the troll attempts to engage you with disparaging remarks. Do not engage. Let the troll speak. The more said, the better the ammunition for a good ban.\n6. Upon the end of the match, gg, etc. Maybe I'll throw in \"report troll\" but always gg. This is being cordial regardless of the outcome.\n7. Report. Best thing about trolls is that they're bored and they try to antagonize. Don't feed into it. They'll talk and talk, but see it as evidence for the report. By the end of the match if a lot of bashing has been done, it will make a ban definitely likely. It is very easy. In the report when filing the ticket, I always write \"read the chat text.\" If your teammates support you, they'll say something like \"ban troll\" in the text. Point is, the evidence is there.\n\nGood luck. Happy Gaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2015-06-14T01:31:11.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you have to do Not to get banned is treat everyone with respect !

'Not being nice right now' or such comments ..if they stop being rude I don't report if they continue after I asked nicely then I report ...\n\n I find that 9 out of 10 times when someone is Toxic and I say such comments they stop and no need to report...I only send a report about 1 in 50 games..but I am inclined to send more now ...I have always felt Riot should clamp down on all forms of harassment, verbal abuse, racial comments and ect. ..\n\nMost of all the things about this forum or LOL is that Any Talk of suicide ...Go Kill yourself and the such should be dealt with Most harshly....Any comments encouraging or suggesting it should have the Highest form of punishment .\n\nFor anyone reading this or my previous remarks I tempt Riot to go over my chat records..before game, during and after to see if I hold myself to the standard that I hold no one else to...no one needs to be as nice as me ...however No One has the Right to be an Ass.. on here or in game ...\n\nKaren","replies":[]}]}
