Aside from the fact that any range that Morde has is only on his abilities, he has to worry about being attacked himself. Its not like he'll have free reign to do free damage. **Its not a 2v0**. The enemy ADC and support will be doing damage as well. On top of that, Morde's passive, while having some effectiveness, will be hardly recognizable once the ADC gets Infinity Edge+ an AS item. \nAnother problem when playing Morde is that you'll lose that ranged damage on turrets,and god forbid the enemy jungler is better at objective control than the jungler on Morde's team.","replies":[{"poster":"The Fast","date":"2015-08-18T17:20:04.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem is that an ADC who isnt as strong as Draven early will not be able to punish Morde enough to stop him from gaining an exp lead and calling the dragon, which his team has a definite advantage in. I'm not saying \"NEW MORDE IS OP TOO GOOD LOL U DUMB.\" I just want to point out that its not as bad as people are making it out to be.\n\nIn place of ranged damage on towers, you can have one of several mid laners who can do that, or you can get a dragon, which can brute force towers very easily, or you can go for and/or bait baron to start a fight.\n\nLets say you are level 10. On an average adc, thats about 1200 HP, 50armor, 30MR. If you have IE + an AS item, its pretty easy to assume Morde will have Trinity or Rylai's, and some components. Lets say this Mordekaiser rushed a Rylai's and Ninja Tabi, put 2 points in W, then maxed Q. At level 11, this would put him at 116AD and 100AP.\nHis Q at this point would do about 1200 damage across all 3 hits, not counting his auto attack's damage. Which would put that at about 1500. Add in his ult and there is no way that ADC isn't dead. Fact of the matter is if for ANY reason Mordekaiser gets to you, you are dead. It may be a rare occurence, but it WILL happen at some point, either by a heavy engage support or by jungler gank, or by him camping a bush out for you, and you will by mutilated.\n\nThis also assumes Mordekaiser is a full item behind you. A Rylai's is sufficient to catch the majority of champions.\n\nHe has all the tools he needs, even when behind.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2015-08-18T15:36:03.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chuckles, your one of those people who goes, Just kite {{champion:77}} {{champion:23}} heh well good luck with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Rivvy","date":"2015-08-18T15:38:01.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Karn Bishop,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=6eYsL5OP,comment-id=00030002000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-18T15:36:03.751+0000)\n>\n> Chuckles, your one of those people who goes, Just kite {{champion:77}} {{champion:23}} heh well good luck with that.\n\nI actually have on Quinn.","replies":[{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2015-08-18T15:43:05.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Then you've never Vs'd a skilled player, skilled melee forms know how to deal with kiting.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-08-18T15:50:12.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"good thing there's usually a support to kite them too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rivvy","date":"2015-08-18T15:55:25.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Karn Bishop,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=6eYsL5OP,comment-id=0003000200010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-18T15:43:05.518+0000)\n>\n> Then you've never Vs'd a skilled player, skilled melee forms know how to deal with kiting.\n\nYou keep making your excuses.

If it was, riot would have left him alone and made a new champ for this experiment of theirs, one that would have a kit that would work bot lane. But instead, they are taking a champ made for mid and making crap changes because they want to focus this \"melee ADC\" thing. If they didn't want to make a new champ, There are plenty of melee AD champs that could fill the role better since they have cc, gap closers and pokes.\n\nThey don't care about mord or people who invested time into him, and no, I don't main him, but he IS one of my favorites and I can understand how bull shit this is to people who do.
