If you select primary position, with fixed algorithm you do get it most of times. Even If you get secondary now and then, you still have better chance to play the lane you want than is the scream arena. If you don't care, pick Fill and swap If someone wants. The only shitty thing about this is newly forced Fill option which enforce you to play something you can't play while simultaneously you can't scream your role. But I think that's acceptable sacrifice.\n\n**Blind vs Draft**\nDraft pick is important to avoid extremly bad comp against extremly good comp. The reason we play Draft is to avoid ARAM-style games low-tier melees against high-tier rangeds which is merely enjoyable to any side. The reason, however, some play Blind, is so that undesired class/champ is not enforced on them just because their comp needs it and all the above players selfishly made their desired choices or so that their champ is not pre-picked by enemy. If we play in blind, more games will feel unbalanced and random. If they play in draft, they'll have to swallow the fact they can't be OTP and some people simply play that way.\n\n**Bans vs Nonbans**\nSome people OTP annoying or broken champ. Those who play broken champ because they are easy to play and outplay anyone, those I do not feel pitty of. However there are champs that now and then are not particulary overpowered or uncounterable (uncounterpickable), but people consider their playstyle toxic and annoying and thus they are basically permabanned. Those who OTP such champs would never get to play them. And that isn't fair as much as it is not fair to force us go into the scream-arena.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-09T13:54:23.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we can't compromise then we end up with completely nothing.\n\n**Position select**\nActually the biggest thing to draft.  I don't play blind because I don't want to scream my role and then still not get it because they instalocked.\n\n**Blind vs Draft**\nA ton of people just play blind bacause it's faster to get into a game.  I don't think there's an overwhelming malicious intent in Blind any more than there is in Draft (they still troll plenty in Draft to trick the opposing team into _thinking_ they are a different role/lane).  I think the people who care about comps will be able to manage the ones who want to Blind pick a champ no matter what, just like they do now in Draft.\n\n**Bans vs Nonbans**\nWith you on this.  One it's kinda hard to find a middle ground there.  We'd almost need a Blind ban system where we pre-select two bans before entering and anything that 5/10 voted for would be banned.  Once people know the algorithm they might try to game it though.
