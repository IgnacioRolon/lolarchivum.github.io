OFFICIALLY! Even if that date is a few days into the future - and you don't have to give any reason - just give us the exact release date.\n\nBecause this is BS.\n\nAnd what about the release bundle? What will be in it? 3250 RP for what exactly...? The skin, 10 icons and the ward skin, hmm? With no promotional sale, it better be a good bundle, whatever it is...\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} ","replies":[]}]}
