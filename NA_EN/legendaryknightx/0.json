I didn&#039;t cuss at them, I didn&#039;t call them bad, I asked them nicely to stop and just try and play the game while talking with the other team about what was going on. \r\n\r\nSo riot this is the third time this has happened, and each ban has only been over one game not multiple games like most reform cards. Why am I getting chat bans when I don&#039;t cuss at the players, don&#039;t call them bad in any fashion, try to help them and give them advice like on item builds, warding or mias, I don&#039;t tell them to kys or anything like that. \r\nAt worst I try to explain to them why an item is good like thornmail in to an all ad team while they tell me stfu and kys. If I am chat ban because I continue to try and give them advice and work together like a team after they tell me to stfu then I understand. Also why are they not ban for telling me to kys, cussing me out, telling me to stfu, inting, or trolling my jungle?\r\n\r\nI just want clarification as to if explaining things to players in a factual non offensive matter after they say stfu is considered toxic behavior so I can avoid it in the future. Also why am I not getting emails with my reform card, why can&#039;t I copy and paste it from client to here so that I can show you exactly what was said and why is no one replying to my ticket on this subject. \r\n\r\nSorry for the long winded post Riot but I really just want clarification.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-09T08:53:03.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post the logs and someone on the boards can help see if something you said was toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendaryKnightX","date":"2017-10-09T08:54:49.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gladly would but they haven't emailed them to me and it won't let me copy paste, that was part of the problem, I can screen shot them and thats about it but I'm not sure how to post pictures on here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ky N Takahashi","date":"2017-10-09T09:09:11.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LegendaryKnightX,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vP12QvQB,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-10-09T08:54:49.882+0000)\n>\n> I gladly would but they haven&#x27;t emailed them to me and it won&#x27;t let me copy paste, that was part of the problem, I can screen shot them and thats about it but I&#x27;m not sure how to post pictures on here.\n\nI think you might have to upload it somewhere and then post the link.

Just thought i'd let you know anyway in case you wanted to upload them.\nI know from experience that Riot's banning system is quite iffy. Seems like a lot of people suffer the same thing too.\n\nAnyway, good luck. {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"LegendaryKnightX","date":"2017-10-09T11:06:29.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man!
