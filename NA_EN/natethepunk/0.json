I keep seeing teams getting crushed because Mundo ult, yumi E, raka heal and many other champions abilities assist or other champions abilities on their self's assisting with heals destroying teams. It's not always needed but when 2-3 of their team can heal like a a mofo it's needed. Sometimes a support grabbing it can but a huge help since ideally they should always be on their ADCs butt.\r\n\r\nAp users do NOT get morellos. Yes it cuts healing for 3 seconds but thats about how long all your burst last. After your 3 second burst you just sit there, nothing to do. You get no benefit from it. Grab a void staff, its by far an under rated item against MR.","replies":[]}
