Everything works fine, except when the game starts and opens up, I get a black screen. Instead of seeing those cards, I see a black screen. I can wait in q and make a draft pick. But when the actual game opens up, black screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game several times and repaired the client, but i still see the black screen. I have waited an hour on this black screen, and nothing happens. I honestly dont know what to do. I think the origin of the problem is when i accidentally quit the client when I was loading into a game (Idk if i quit the client or the game itself). Anyways, I have OSX El Capitan. Let me know if u guys have any tips.\n\nThis also gave me leaverbuster so I want to figure this out","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T23:04:55.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having a connection issue maintaining comms to the game server.
