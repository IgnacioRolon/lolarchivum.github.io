At times I notice about a .5 - 3 sec delay in commands and at most I am unable to move my char or cast abilities/spells for up to 5 sec or 10 sec. Tried running as admin, re-installed game, graphic drivers up to date, um not sure what else. ( Processor I7 3.4 g, memory 16 gb, 64 bit windows ten, nivida geforce 980... not thinking the problem is with the hardware though since games like ark and the division are running at max settings no problems) Any suggestions would be great. Thanks :D","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-10T03:14:42.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you say input delay, it makes me think you're describing packet loss rather than FPS drops.   Usually when I hear about FPS drops it's a driver or 3rd party issue.  Go ahead and take a look at our [FPS Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684) article for more information on some common fixes :D\n\nHOWEVER! If your FPS is actually relatively stable and you're just seeing input delay, then it's probably a network issue in which your packets are getting lost somewhere on the internet. If *that's* the case, then I'd recommend looking at our [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for more information \n\nLet me know if either one of these help!","replies":[]}]}
