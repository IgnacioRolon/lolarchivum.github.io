I am really liking Renekton and is play style. I was just wondering if he is worth playing top still. Im in gold and im hoping to pick a solid top laner with carry potential. Renekton caught my eye and I do like his kit. Overall, I just want to know if renekton is viable in Gold with carry potential. Or should I go someone like Vladimir or lissandra.

Renekton is an AD bruiser who bullies everyone he can early on due to his high base damages and lack of resource. Vlad doesn't really get strong until 9, when his Transfusion's CD goes down to like 4 seconds. Renekton transitions lategame into a frontline tank who rips through enemy lines, forcing them to peel him off of carries. Vlad is a hypercarry mage who does massive AOE damage to everyone. \n\nLissandra is kinda similar to Orianna, 'cept she's easier to go top with due to her increased CC and mobility with Glacial Path.\n\nRenekton is frontline, Vlad is damage, and Lissandra is control. If that helps you pick easier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeargentAnus","date":"2015-01-07T21:41:35.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:75}} has a rough time against him in the early game.
