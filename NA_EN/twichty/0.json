I've have been trying to find expansions into fields that I have interest in. One truly large field is marketing  and development. I have been looking for a Internship of any sorts, then I thought about Riot. I know you are huge company with a lot on your plate everyday. I know that you take very few college interns from a huge pool that is very competitive. However I'm here to just ask if there is any way I could get into contact with an employee with the idea of a non-pay pure work experience internship at riot. I know I could show that I have the ability to benefit Riot games, and it would be greatly appreciated if I could be given the opportunity to try to sell my self as an Intern to an employee.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\n\r\nTwichty","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T22:38:03.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NJYosub has the right idea ^_^!

Maybe you should check it out instead of posting it here, because the chance of Rito noticing it is um... a little bit too low.
