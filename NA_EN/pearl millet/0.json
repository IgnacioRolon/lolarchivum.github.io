I do fully believe they don't care for the players that play League of Legends. In my year of playing this game I cannot believe the behavior I just witnessed. I know for a fact what I just went through, nothing will be done by Riot.\n\nI was in a match where there was a Kennan that asked if the Taric on our team was gay. I was slightly offended because he thought it was a joke to ask someone if they were gay. What really gets me is that the Taric and the Kennan thinks it is a joke to be homosexual. I was a little offended because I am gay and I did not like it when they said it was a joke. You don't joke about sexuality, race, or religion. \n\nWell I asked the Kennan to please stop and told him I was offended by his words and \"joke\". What does he say to me? \"I'm sorry for your gayness.\" Oh it doesn't stop there.  The Shen goes on to say that it's not that big of a deal to say things like that and I just need to play the game so he can win his series. The Taric is supporting his friend Shen and he doesn't care about the intolerance and rudeness that is going on. He only wants to win his series. When did intolerance and rudeness become second to winning a series in a video game? It shouldn't be. I could have muted everyone but I did not. I really wanted to teach these children how to treat others and watch what they say. Well the enemy team was thrown into the conversation and now I get harassed by a Vayne that is catholic and tells me if is my fault I am receiving all of this negative behavior because of my life choice of being homosexual. That upset me a little more as well. I respect everyone's personal beliefs and opinions but don't insult other people and be judgmental. I can easily say rude things about your lifestyle but I am not going to. There is a difference between an immature person and someone that has respect for others. I did not lower myself to their attitude and joke about their beliefs and opinions.\n\nThe Ahri insulted homosexuality and myself. The Shen and Taric told me to get over it and play the game so they can win their series. Winning their series was more important then telling the rude and immature Kennan to stop saying immature and condescending things. The Taric and Shen told me to stop but had no problem ignoring and saying LOL in chat towards Kennan. What I was saying wasn't even insulting or rude. All I said is that it is immature and rude to say things like that to people. You don't know who is listening and it is not right to joke about another person's life style. I am also disgusted at the Vayne who thinks it is right for people to be insulted for their beliefs and lifestyle.\n\nRiot, I am disgusted with you because I do not think you are going to do anything about the issue. I reported all but one person in the match. I threw the match and did nothing. I thought my time would be better used to teach these nasty people. I see people using the derogatory language towards race, religion and sexuality a little bit. I have never experienced the amount of hate I just witnessed in my last match. It goes to show how much other games take a very good stance on the issue. You are disgusting Riot and you need to take it more seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2015-09-19T02:24:05.123+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"We live in a society today where image is **EVERYTHING**. People identify by what they are or what they believe, rather than who they are as a person -- and when someone doesn't agree with their \"identity,\" they get upset and offended; this is where political correctness was born, from the vanity of society.\n\nSo, let's look at what happened:\n\nSomeone made a joke about sexuality, given that most people like to call Taric gay, and often ship Ezrael + Taric. Was it mean-spirited, or was it targeted at anyone? No, it really wasn't. Was it even picking on homosexuality in general? Not really. So I really see no issue with what they said -- but then we have you, one of the \"modern\" people who think everyone should automatically believe just as you do, or they're obviously an evil monster. Rather than just blow the joke off and ignore it like most people did, you took it to yourself to \"educate\" them as to why they should think your way. This turned into a big fight involving what sounds like 9/10 people in your game. Was that the right thing to do? Not in my mind. Was your reaction justified? Not really.\n\nI have a bit of advice for you, whether you choose to listen or not (though my post will probably be deleted anyway): Don't identify by what you are or what choices you make, identify by who you are as a person. So you're gay, probably white and a male -- is that who you are? No, it isn't; you're this person who enjoys doing this and that, enjoys playing League, has this kind of morality, believes this and that, treats others this way, and so on. That's who you are. Identify by who you are on the inside, and what makes you unique (and, sorry, your sexuality is neither of those). We can find thousands of other people who look just like you and have the same sexual orientation, but none of them are just like you; that's what sets you apart, not your sexuality or race or religion. So, basically, **identify by who you are**, **not what you are**, and your life will be far happier.\n\nDon't be incredibly vain and shallow like the rest of society; be yourself and don't bother with what anyone else thinks or says -- just go on being yourself. If someone says something bad about homosexuality (or you perceive it as bad), just realize your sexuality is not what makes you who you are, laugh them off, and act like nothing has happened. \n\nStop being vain. It's not a good trait to have, and even though you're probably atheist, most religions deem it a sin. ^^\n\nPS: Not everyone has to agree with you or your sexuality or any other choices you make, just like no one is forced to agree with all my choices and ideals. Don't throw a tantrum because someone thinks differently than you do, and act your age. :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Senpanda","date":"2015-09-19T02:28:03.069+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go back to tumblr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twiggles","date":"2015-09-18T23:53:55.734+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So instead of muting the people harassing you and reporting them after the game, you decided to make yourself a problem as well by feeding into their insults and basically afking the game?

I guarantee you that they took nothing you said to heart. Especially the Vayne who should have been an instant mute and report. No sense trying to reason with toxic people. It's almost always better to mute, report, and move on.\n\nI am by no means saying that you deserved to be harassed (nobody does), but you neglected your opportunity to mitigate it and just escalated the issue instead. Kennen (and possibly the others as well) should have been muted as soon as he responded rudely to your polite request.

I said you fed into their insults, which means you engaged them in conversation thereby making it known that they were getting to you. You basically gave them what they wanted at that point, which helps nobody.\n\n> I did participate in the match. I did not outright throw the game. I did not play as vigorously as they did because most of my time was spent talking to them.\n\nThis is what you said in your original post, directly copy and pasted: **I threw the match and did nothing. I thought my time would be better used to teach these nasty people.**\nDid you throw and do nothing, or did you participate? It's one or the other. You can't do nothing and something at the same time, so you've already lied in one of your posts here.\n\n> I didn't, and don't think, Riot will do anything about it. They don't care about their players, I have reported players in the past for using negative comments towards people's religion and nothing was done. Riot doesn't care. They do not care that I was basically bullied by a gang of people and reported them. Nothing will be done about it.\n\nRiot doesn't care about their players? The people that they depend upon for their income? Not every single report you or anyone else makes will be acted upon, as reports are counted by volume using an automated system. Being offensive in a couple of games will not get attention, as it is based on consistent toxicity over a period of time and reports. Riot does care because they need their players to have a good experience. That doesn't mean that every case will be immediately resolved though. However, reporting them now will certainly have left a mark towards punishment should they continue to behave that way in the future.\n\n>  I did what I felt was right and made me feel better. I handled the situation like an adult and did not insult them once. All I did was try to teach a group of immature people a thing or two about what to say and what not to say. It made me feel better. I fully support my actions and stand by them because I do not feel like I did anything wrong. I usually do mute people but there are certain things that warrant action.\n\nThat's perfectly fine. Do what you think is right. However, you also need to understand the consequences of doing that. Because you (as stated in your original post) threw the match and did nothing, you are rightfully reportable for afking. If that isn't the case then fine. I don't know for sure because of the contradiction I pointed out earlier. I can respect that you stand up for your beliefs, but you also need to understand that toxic people over the internet just won't care. No action you take aside from reporting them for their behavior will do anything, no matter how right you may be. If it makes you feel better, then fine. Just know what you might be getting yourself into in the process.\n\nI really hope the rest of your games go better than this one. Have a great day/evening/whatever time it is for you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AdanChristo","date":"2015-09-19T04:29:49.473+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"T_T political correctness is infecting League, first it's the media, now video games? take your cancer and vent it at tumblr, league is something special and not for your political correctness cancer","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-09-19T00:31:26.150+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone calls me retarded.  \n\nDo I: A) Give them a lecture on why using the term \"retarded\" as an insult is wrong only to further spark arguments and insults or B) ignore them because they are an ignorant asshole and not worth my time.  \n\nHmmm seems like an easy choice to me.  \n\nThis is going to sound mean but you just need to toughen up and ignore them, if you let every little thing effect you like this the you are better off not playing League anymore.
