It's pretty easy for anyone to just mute him but instead of being a man/woman they report like a crybaby child to mummy Riot. League of Softies. It would help if Riot didn't allow 13-18 year olds to play the game, but it's allowed if an adult hits OK\n\nI mean, at least you have the very easy option to hit the mute button. The people who really need punishment from Riot as the player has no power, is the people who int or troll in game. One way is by afk farming in a side lane and not even joining the team when they breaking down the nexus. Another is that they stand and watch you die in a potential 2v1 because those things actually impact the player's ability to win the game.  But it's not as easy as doing a computer ai auto banning system based only on chat logs or afkers (leaverbuster), so Riot does the easy stuff and pretend like they care about reducing toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-05-31T21:10:57.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what else is an easy option?
