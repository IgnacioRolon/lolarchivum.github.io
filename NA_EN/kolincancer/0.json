{"poster":"KolinCancer","date":"2017-04-09T17:31:10.474+0000","title":"Massive Steady Framerate drop and random DCs repeatedly happening ove rlast 2 days","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So yestarday i was playing usually at 170 with my computer in its second fastest preset mode however yestarday i began noticing a framerate drop during a game which dropped all the way down to 03 fps and thats with my gpu oc'd +100 mhz and 50 clock speed with minimal graphics (my last ditch effort to not allow my team to lose the game) but it did nothing to help my fps. in addition to that today i was playing and i still got some fps loss, which i resolved by ctrl alt del, ending the game and restarting the program which was incredibly harmful to my team sucess rate but better then nothing, that issue was still trumped by repeatedly being completely blind sided by instant DC's. I must have had 5 in my last game. ive tried the client repairs i just restalled lol last night idk wtf is up. ill post my system info below someone help otherwise theres no reason for me to even try and play.\n\nI also uploaded a zip with my game logs in it to 4share (first time doing something such as this so sorry if its not the proper way but if u read the description for the zip youll see its linked with this post and i assure you there are only log files located in said zip.
