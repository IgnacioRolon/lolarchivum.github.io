So when I click OK the reconnect screen comes up and when I click reconnect the error code keeps popping up. I have to shut everything down from my computer and restart is and when I open league back up I can play. This happens 8-9/10 times when i play a league game. I've searched on this before and I tried deleting the lol_patcher file but it says it's unable to delete. I tried finding a solution to this and it said \"Go into AVG Protection, click advanced, then something about a file and stuff, but I can't find the advanced thing on my AVG protection, I was wondering if anyone would take their time to maybe skype me and let me share screens and guide me through it if possible. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGooley","date":"2016-05-20T21:05:38.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am getting the same thing now at random my last two games never have had the problem no updates or anything.
