It makes the jungle easier to deal with but I think this is unintended as there is no mention of it anywhere in the skill description. It would be much preferable if this was an intended thing and just skipped being in a description  :P\r\nIf you want to replicate the bug, you only have to throw a spear at red or blue and you will see it.\r\n-Tjturtle","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-01-28T21:57:46.510+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's actually intended.

She is meant to stun the creeps in the jungle? Where is her trade off for this?\n\nI mean I am all for jungle diversity (so bored of Lee) but how about helping some of the junglers who struggle early? Like giving this free stun to Sej or Zac or Elise (give her dmg on cocoon) or Olaf? Why is Nid given power outside of her \"normal\" role to fill a spot other champions are already weak at?","replies":[{"poster":"tjturtle","date":"2015-01-29T02:00:49.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well in my opinion, and it is biased don't get me wrong, Elise has a passive healing with her spiders, Zac does % damage and has a way of healing as well and I have personally played Olaf in the jungle and I haven't noticed a problem with him in that regard :/\n\nIts not really a free stun, you're spending mana on it just as other junglers would, I completely agree that some champions are inherently weak in the jungle right now despite being made for it, but I don't see Nidalee becoming a top tier jungler because of this. If anything it just makes it actually possible. \n\nAnd roles for champions shift generally every couple of patches. Heck look at lulu she was much the same. If Nidalee gets out of hand I find it likely Riot will do something to compensate. How soon? I dunno, but they maintain things as best they can, meta shifts are too strong sometimes. All I know is that I can now play a favourite champion regardless of roles almost and enjoy myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-01-29T05:16:10.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I don't mind that they are trying something. (granted with trailblazer and blue buff her heal and her stun don't really cost much) But the main point is why try to make someone a brand new jungler when they dont seem to know what to do with the ones they already have?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"youngjake93","date":"2015-01-29T05:35:45.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=wPI2QYOA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-28T21:57:46.510+0000)\n>\n> It's actually intended.
