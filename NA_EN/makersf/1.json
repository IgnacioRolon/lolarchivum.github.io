After waiting a bit of time to let players adapt to the change, we can see that LB is kind of struggling (to use an euphemism), with a win rate of around [43-45% in diamond](http://www.lolking.net/champions/leblanc&amp;region=all&amp;map=sr&amp;queue=1x1&amp;league=diamond#statistics) and a win rate of [43% across all the leagues](http://www.lolking.net/champions/leblanc&amp;region=all&amp;map=sr&amp;queue=1x1&amp;league=ranked#statistics)\n\nWhy I linked the diamond statistic? To show that LB is not in a difficult position because of an high skill cap, and it is not in a difficult position because people pick her when they shouldn't ( at least, I expect Diamonds to pick her in average when it makes sense)\n\n**So, why did a facerolling champion become from terrible to play against to kind of UP?**\nThe damage remained the same, and the remove of the silence should mean that the opposing player can react to the aggression.\nThis is what riot is thinking in their mind\n\n> LeBlanc's a champion who has a lot of power associated with her character - omnidirectional movement, high burst damage, precise target selection, a cool hat - so it's been difficult to give her meaningful counterplay without directly hurting that identity. We're taking a more deliberate approach here because we want LeBlanc to remain an exciting champion to play and watch, but removing the silence on Q means at least her opponents can fight back when she's QRWEing (or WQREing or WRQEing for those long range fancy plays) around the fight. That said, LeBlanc will definitely stay on our radar as we track how she's performing post-change.\n\nBut the effect was something else: LeBlan can not perform her combo anymore on the big majority of champions. The reason is simple: whatever root/snare/silence/knockup/stun (basically, whatever is not a slow) blocks her combo, so she can no longer make the Mimicked Q mark trigger.\n\nHere are some mid champs: [remember that W and mimmiked W are dashes, not teleports, so you get CCed if it while in the air]\n\nLux roots you while you jump on her\nVeigar stuns you while you jump on him\nXerath stuns you while you jump on him\nAhri charms you while you jump on her\nZed can avoid W with shadow\nTalon can E behind you\nKata can E behind you\nYasuo can knock up with Q while jumping\nFizz can avoid the stack with troll pole\nFiddle no way to stop drain, silences constantly, can channel the ulti in your face and you have no way to stop him.\n\nThere are many others which can out trade thanks to shields or damage as they now where you will land: Kassa, Ori, Velkoz, Malhazar.\n\nAnd we should also remember that Braum wall blocks your Q,E, and Thresh E blocks your W, so that if they are in the team gets really hard for you to combo.\n\nNow, you could say that this is fair, as it is not nice to get stomped in lane by an assassin which can go and snowball other lanes too.\nI agree with that, but the point of LB is snowballing early in order to give and advantage to the team. If she doesn't get a couple of kills at level 1-8, she wont do much the rest of the match. She is a high risk low reward pick, as a single mistake at early level compromise your whole game (opposed to, let's say, Yasuo, which will comeback even if he's 0/4 in lane)\n\n\nSo, what am I proposing?\nI don't have a solid reply here, I'm not in the balance team. I think making the W a flash would be terribly to strong, making her untargettable like fizz would people hate her even more before.\nDefinitely she needs an interrupt like kassa Q where there was the silence before, but I'd like to go be a bit more innovative, and suggest the addition of **one** of this:\n\n* silence the target but allow whatever dash/movement/flash ability (hard to do as there is not an effect like that in lol, and hardly they'll introduce a new one)\n\n* silence the target for a really brief duration, like 0.3 s (with the QRW it would become around 0.4/0.5 secs, like blitz ulti silence)\n\n* make here immune to the next CC after a mark explodes for 0.2 secs (we want to give her the time to W on the target, but in teamfight if a teammate CC her this should stop her). Not refreshable with multiple triggers and not cumulative.\n\n\nMy point is: it was not fair when LB dived you under tower and you couldn't do anything to stop her, but right now she can hardly output the damage she need to output in order to be relevant in the game, as her combo is nullified by basically every mage/support.\n\nWhat do you think?\nIf you need to commentate with a \"leblak is OP chomp,  nerf111 nublord, destry her!!1one\" please refrain to commentate, I'd like to have some constructive discussion here\n\nEDIT:\n@Ghostcrawler\nmind to share your ideas about the problem and/or point us to the right dev to ask to?","replies":[{"poster":"iStarter","date":"2014-08-21T14:22:39.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's always had a low winrate, her recent popularity is what made her get hit by the nerf bat.

Right now she basically jumps at someone and hopes they dont blow her up.  She does need something though.\n\nMy personal proposal is putting the silence on her chain.

But the \"So, why did a facerolling champion become from terrible to play against to kind of UP?\" sentence baffled me.\n\nLe Blanc has always had low win rates across all tiers. She was NEVER a faceroll champ. Its the competetive scene that made her famous. Once competetive scene dropped her, everyone did.

The mid champs that don't counter her are really, really, really few, and many are not usually picked exactly because they lack that type of CC (now populare there is only Orianna that i can think of, but she scales greatly and has good utility, plus a shield to mitigate the DMG in lane)\n\nBTW, if the win rates are not an indication of the strength of the champion (and I can agree to that), what should we use to discuss a champion?

My experience doesn't matter, your neither. What matters is what do the majority of the LB players(and the worst and best  0.1% players in order to not have a champ with too high of a skill floor/ceiling). We can't discuss with the impression of 5-10 people, we need something that expresses what the majority of the players feels/do/achieve with her, and that's provided by statistic. I can agree with you that WinRate may not be the right one to use, but definitely a discussion should be based on DATA, which means FACTS, not impressions.\n\n2) She wont ever be good in TFs. Riot made a champion that's strong early and in lane, and weak late game (which means TFs). She's like Nunu: needs to get rolling in the early levels and later is more a presence than something else.\nThere are many champs that are supposed to get caught by CC, but no one of them jumps in a straight line in the face of the enemy and totally rely on that to deal the 1/3 (the mimicked Q trigger) of the combo damage, and explodes the moment he's CCed. People that deal the same thing are like Jarvan, Malph and Vi ults, which actually are not stopped if not by killing them, and they all are pretty tanky. We have Kassa, that again doesnt' rely on the jump to deal damage, we have kata that has a strong AoE ulti with resets to get out as soon as possible.\n\nThe point is, in order to allow an opponent to react/retaliate (which is good), they prevented her to combo (which is bad). It is no longer a skill matchup: if the opponent has a hard CC you won't deal DMG, and eventually they'll scale better than you. There is no winning for LB.","replies":[{"poster":"Sunfield","date":"2014-08-22T09:47:54.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Based on that, they analyse and they make changes, that are then playtested. We are at the \"analyse\" stage here ;)\n\nIt's funny how you keep saying you can't use statistic to solve this problem, but you don't say why nor what should we use.

The fact that right now the meta is more for late game champs doesn't mean all the early game champs will be reworked. The rework is made when the kit of a champion can not be fixed with just a couple of changes. She was considered OP with a silence, she is performing quite poorly without. I'm sure there is a middle point between the two that can fix her without needing a rework.\n\n***Important part of the post***\nBut all of this is not related to the discussion. I understand you are saying she is fine as she is now, but it looks like you don't play her that much.

I'll get to what I think those could be in a minute.\n\nI DON'T agree with the reason you state she's weak. You say she has trouble proccing her mark, but **she didn't receive any change in her ability to proc her mark.** What she did get, was the ability for her opponents to trade with her - before, she'd q-w-e-w, then walk away, and you (a caster) couldn't do a thing about it. Now you can harass her while she walks back to safety, or all-in her if you're that type of champ.\n\nSo, **what leblanc needs back is a way to avoid getting harassed or all-inned on her way back to safety, after a combo. But it can't be a silence like before.**\n\nThat's just not healthy. Even if it's a skillshot silence, if LB is good at skillshots (or, more likely, W's on you and then point-blank silences you), there's no way to outplay her. Either she does her combo well and wins the trade, or does it poorly and loses the trade. More importantly,\n\n#A silence isn't in line with Leblanc's theme as a deceiver\n\nA deceiver doesn't get in your face and prevent you from doing anything back, she whacks you, then leaves you so confused that you don't know how to wack her back. *Leblanc needs ways to trick her opponent into missing her with their attacks.* **She needs her clone at every engage.**\n\nI haven't thought about exactly how I'd like to see this work. When I do, I will likely create my own thread with proposed changes. At the moment, I'm thinking something along the lines of:\n\n>#Q: Mark of Deception.\n>LB's next ability will trigger the mark. If she triggers the mark, she will become stealthed for 0.5 seconds. When the stealth ends, she creates a controllable clone of herself for 8 seconds. (ie, her passive triggers). This does not affect the cooldown of her passive, but LB cannot have a clone from both passive and Q.","replies":[{"poster":"MakersF","date":"2014-08-22T22:27:34.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess no one wants to see her as strong as she was before the nerf or, God forbids, even stronger! So definitely a SMALL buff is the way to go.\n\nI believe you got the reason why they initially give her the silence: to win trades. This had the really bad side effect of preventing the opponent not only to trade back, but even to flash/escape/shield/whatever from her combo.\nThis last point was the problem riot tried to address with the nerf (IMO).\n\n> removing the silence on Q means at least her opponents can fight back when she's QRWEing\n\nWhat I believe you might have missed from my post was not the fact that LB loses trades (you need to play kind of badly to lose trades with LB if you pull off a full combo, as she deals such a big amount of damage that the enemy shouldn't be able to hit you that hard), but the fact that now, as a side effect of the lost silence, they can not only trade back (which was intended and \"healthy\") but they can stun/root her, preventing her to do the full combo.\n\nThis not only make LB take damage while trading (which is good), but prevent her to deal the full dmg (which is bad)\n\nMy point was that the silence removal nerfed her 2 times so to say.\n\nThat's why I liked a lot the proposal that gave her a shield, or I initially proposed an immunity to one CC (she jumps on you in a straight line and you know she'll jump on you: it is almost impossible to miss any CC, skillshot or not).\n\nYour proposal is not a bad idea, but a blue buff would make it totally useless, like ignite and any other buff or debuff. If they make it so the clone mimiks those as well your solution might actually work.
