Sometimes you have a support Leona that lets you land ults and Q often, as Sion is more reliable with a diving partner like that. \n\nDoes Sion really need a global alert when he ults? Pantheon gives enemies a second or two of counterplay when he jumps a third of the way across the map, Sion gives them five or six seconds traveling the same distance. And should it really be that difficult to steer? He shouldn't be turning on a dime like Rammus, but it's very unforgiving as it is.\n\nAs a solid buff, his shield should explode when popped. The counterplay to his shield detonation should be \"GTFO\" not \"Kick his ass\". It takes way too damn long to detonate the shield right now, and Riot seems to want it to be like that. Naut has the same problem of his shield getting popped and him losing a large chunk of his damage, and it's not doing him any favors right now either.\n\nFinally, lets give a little tenacity to his passive. Every champion and their dog either has a cc in their kit or builds a slow from the multitude of items that grant one. And that's not counting all the mobility to just out maneuver him while pouncing on his allies. Your passive is meant to take one last enemy with you, not get hit by glitterlance and then die while Lulu spams laugh.

Once you get it to level three with some health items, its not hard to detonate it for the damage. Pay attention to your opponents cooldowns. If they have a dash, wait for them to blow it, then use their CC. Worst Case scenario (as long as you don't miss) they burn flash for your ult.

Here is how I personally play him, and how I manage to be successful.\n\n\nI'm not really convinced. I do have a 70% winrate with Sion in Season 6. Maybe not enough games to be a significant sample, but I *also* had a 60% winrate in S5.\n\nTry to slow your enemy with E, **then** charging your Q. Either they have to use their dash to go out, and you can safely zone them out and farm, or they take a huge chunk of damage. Do not underestimate your shield damage, especially when it is maxed (I max it 2nd, in certain games). It's important to detonate it, and to not only use it as a defensive skill.\n\nAnd this ult, it's so strong... You can split-push and safely go away (immune to CC) when the enemy arrives. You can initiate big team fights and set-up the perfect engage for the rest of your team. You can roam and lane gank your allies. You can even do silly things like rush into a tower, damage it (yes, your ult damage structures), then hit it, then die and use your passive to finish it.\n\nFor items, I suggest: \n\n* rushing Iceborn Gauntlet or Frozen Heart (my preference go to IBG because it enables you to split-push efficiently, but it's really a matter of preference)\n* tank boots depending on the enemy team comp\n* Sunfire/Deadman/Banshee in the right order (depending on the biggest enemy threat, etc.). Maybe Spirit Visage for the CDR instead of Banshee if you don't really need the Banshee's passive. Maybe ZZ'rot in some specific circumstances where you really need to take towers, or Randuin if you really need the Crit reduction and/or slow.\n* Titanic Hydra to close the deal. Maybe as 5th or 4th item if you are ahead and don't need the resistances first.\n\nAlternative builds:\n\n* rush Cinderhulk and Hunter's Potion (for the mana) in Jungle. You can infinitely clear, gank, use your 5 potions charge to get back to clearing, and gank again. You have to back only to buy items. It replaces Sunfire in the standard build, and I still rush IBG second.\n* include a Righteous Glory at some point, instead of one of the Armor items. I'm personally not fond of this item, but its active is still pretty strong.\n* I disagree with most of the items suggested: Ravenous is inferior to Titanic except in zombie mode, but you shouldn't count on you dying for an item to be good and Black Cleaver is a strong item but not on Sion, you cannot proc it fast enough (2 of your skills are magic damage, not physical)\n\nThe 20% CDR on your first item, and the mana too, is really important to be able to use your skills effectively. Your ult rank 3 has a ridiculously low cooldown compared to its strength, abuse it. Your Q is really strong too. If the enemy sees you charge it, they'll most probably try to CC you, and that's a good thing: it's one CC less that your carries will have to deal with, and you'll get back your Q cooldown in 2 seconds anyway. Remember that your E is also an armor shred, your ADC will be happy if you can put it on the guy they're attacking. And your passive has a HUGE BotRK-like on-hit effect.\n\nYour job in team-fight is to:\n\n* engage with your ult\n* E then try to Q and get CC'ed, then Q anyway 2 seconds later\n* die first, and then force the enemy team to focus you a 2nd time (and die because of your carries left unchecked) or to suffer massive damage thanks to your passive on-hit (and die anyway) (protip: your MS buff when you're in zombie mode counts as a spell for the Gauntlet ;) )\n\nThe result of a typical teamfight with Sion should be a 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 for his team, where he is the only one dying.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-09T18:36:49.731+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually get {{item:3110}} and {{item:3025}} for max CDR.
