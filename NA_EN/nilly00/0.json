There is a reason players ask this question.\r\nDont you understand that there are in fact a few champs that are just plainly unbalanced?\r\n And thats not just an opinion there is a reason so many people ban champs like {{champion:84}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} \r\nthey ban them because they are strong and insanely annoying to play against.{{summoner:3}}\r\nI am sure you know League of Legends is famous for its insanely toxic player base but didnt you ever try to find the source?\r\nIf there are champions so overpowered it is no surprise people are getting frustrated and angry about these champs and then they let out their frustration on other players.\r\nPeople say _\"just learn to play around it\"_\r\nHow?\r\n{{champion:245}} just towerdives you kills you and then ults back as if nothing happened. If you dont oneshot him his ult is going to save him thats like a better version of Guardian angel.\r\n{{champion:55}} Just instantly kills an entire team. How do i play around that? she just teleports i cant evade her and her blades bounce of enemys making her pokes 100% safe\r\ni wont talk about all the broken champs here because that would take way to long.\r\nI am just begging you: PLEASE listen to your players people are **literally stopping to play the game** because those champs are just so unbalanced.\r\nAnd i just dont get why you dont do anything about it.{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \r\nI see no reason why you dont nerf these champs. Everyone would appreciate these changes. Or if you atleast would admit: _\"yes we realize these champs are unbalanced\"_  we could at least tell all those people \"_hey you didnÂ´t win because you are good you won  because your champ is unbalanced\"_\r\nI just hope you understand the player base and try to finally nerf the champs the players want to have nerfed and dont keep on nerfing things everyone thought are balanced.\r\n\r\nPlease.I am begging you Riot.{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T03:53:20.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see you feel pretty passionate about this.
