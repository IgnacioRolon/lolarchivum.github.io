Those games are completely irrelevant, it is not because they beat Lyon and even worse wildcard that you can judge their level in the Worlds competition, otherwise we should think Fenerbahce was a great team as well (not that they had terrible performance in main event, but they were still the weakest out of main events teams)\n\nIn the actual main event of Worlds competition they were average-ish level wise. They weren't bad, they weren't great either, but they had the great quality of making the most out of their opporunities, which is a key quality that differentiate between good and great team or average and good teams or average and mediocre teams\n\nIn a tie-breaker scenario, EDG beats them. No doubts, as they played week 2 as a well beyond average level.\nStill C9 showed the qualities to get through as 2nd seed and given how the other teams lack of consistency deserved to get through","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-10-18T03:20:05.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regional LCS title just mean snothing.
