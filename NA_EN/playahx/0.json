Help? (The audio errors also happen in-game)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T15:42:19.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are experiencing a combination of issues, so we'll take it one step at a time.  For your audio issues, you may be using third party programs that aren't interacting with league.  If you have any like play.tv or lolrecorder, go ahead and remove them.  You should also make sure that your audio drivers are up to date too!\n\nThe black screen your seeing is usually a result of a poor connection that's unable to download assets.  I suggest going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get it resolved.  Make sure to go over each step to make sure everything runs smoothly.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
