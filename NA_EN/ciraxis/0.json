I sent a ticket to Riot Support and the responding agent told me my IP is just visually bugged and wasn't showing the correct amount. (According to what they said it would have been bugged for over 10 days and I find this a little hard to believe.) They said when I relog my IP will be showing the correct amount. **It did not change**. Then I did some math and responded with this:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vbaiwzhdzkz920j/riotsupport2.png?dl=0\n\n23 hours later they return to again insist it was a visual bug, and neither gave me 7800 IP or refunded Xayah and Rakan for me like I asked. **Instead I'm told to use my last remaining refund token**.\n\nExactly 7800 IP went missing from my account and it's because of a visual bug? And if it really is a visual bug, I got tricked into spending more IP than I wanted to because of the buggy client, and instead of just refunding the champs for me I have to use my last refund token? What's the big deal with just refunding them?\n\nAt this point I'm so frustrated that I am just going to use the refund token and hope this never happens again, because next time I get screwed and Riot Support doesn't want to help me I won't have a token left to spend.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-21T23:24:04.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It looks like this was incredibly confusing the way those IP values were showing. I did some digging, and made sure to look through your purchase history as well as your match history for IP gains and losses. In the long run, this weird IP display was caused by the visual error the agent mentioned in your ticket. \n\nAs it turns out, the IP value you mentioned you had when you bought Camille doesn't line up with how much you actually had in our system. It really sucks that those values weren't showing up correctly, but we won't be able to refund any extra purchases since you were only charged once for Xayah and Rakan.","replies":[{"poster":"Ciraxis","date":"2017-04-21T23:55:03.071+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"So your client malfunctions for a long period of time and I'm punished for it by having to spend my last refund token?

Be it IP or RP(money they already have from you) they are incredibly anti consumer. I hope the European Union slaps them around for a bit at some point. :Z The 3 lifetime refunds system is such a cop out, especially to those with older accounts.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
