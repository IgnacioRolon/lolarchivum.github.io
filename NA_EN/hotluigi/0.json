He has had some minor disciplinary actions taken against him(chat restrictions) but still has some toxic tendencies especially when we are in a particularly unfortunate game. I want to help him become more positive towards other people as I think it will help us win more games and make the experience for our teammates a bit better (also I don't want to lose my duo partner!) Any suggestions for helping a particularly stubborn player, or maybe if a riot member sees this they could get me some chat logs so I could show him some examples of what he needs to cut out!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-26T01:01:17.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really want to give out any of your friends personal chat logs, mostly just for personal security reasons, but I might have a few tips for them. Personally if I come across some rather....let's say passionate folks, I tend to either mute everyone or sometimes I'll even drag the entire chatbox off-screen. That way I can't be baited into an argument or anything like that, and I can also focus more on the game itself and communicate using pings.","replies":[{"poster":"HOTluigi","date":"2018-01-26T14:52:14.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the response! tbh these are recommendations that I have already given him.. I agree with the personal security thing, also why I didn't include his in-game name. This may be somewhat unorthodox but would you be able to send stuff to him through direct message? I'm guessing you are able to see what player I am talking about being the only player I have duo'd with?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-29T21:52:48.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't actually send direct messages to people like you're thinking. We'd have to add him in game just like normal players to DM them =\\","replies":[]}]}]}]}
