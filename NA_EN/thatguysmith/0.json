Bug Splat errors usually occur when there is some type of hardware issue with League of Legends (Normally out of date Graphics Drivers for instance).  However, a bunch of different things can trigger it.  Because of this, make sure to check out all of the steps in this guide:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes\n\nI'm not going to lie, there are quite a number of steps here.  However, we need to make sure that your hardware is up to date to make sure that this isn't the root cause.\n\nIf you are still being trolled by Bug Splat errors, regardless of the steps in that guide, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  One of our Tech Specialists can take an in-depth look of your computer configuration and determine what the root cause is.
