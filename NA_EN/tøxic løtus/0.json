XD, But i request any players that encounter bots in ARAM or The Rift to please report them.\n\nP.S: If you're wondering how exactly u identify them is Leveling bots is they either have no keystone mastery, Have rarely used summoner spells, AA the minions until they see the champ which then the follow to just use all their abilities on, Buy random items that wouldnt make sense","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T03:06:21.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bruh I feel your pain! The best way to combat bots is the make sure you're reporting them each in the post-game lobby. With those reports through the client, we can pull the game that was reported as well and build a stronger case towards punishments. Without any hard data like the match they were in, it's kinda hard to take action.","replies":[{"poster":"Evil Yasuo","date":"2017-10-04T10:15:28.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=gEGgTAWq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-04T03:06:21.143+0000)\n>\n> Bruh I feel your pain!

Reporting shouldn't even be necessary. I could probably use the API to make an automated system that can instantly detect like 90% of them with almost no false positives.","replies":[{"poster":"Real Sexy Yoona","date":"2017-10-04T08:17:14.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I think most of them just push the wave- like doesn't move backwards at all. If there is a way of tracking that it should be easy. \n\nAnd yes, it's sooooooooo awfully stressful. You could argue that the result of ARAM games are somewhat decided in the random champ selections (as some champions are hilariously better than others in ARAM) , but when you realize you have a bot in your team= there is no hope at all. ZERO.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mus","date":"2017-10-04T08:35:18.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will agree with total and I also agree with the rioter.\nThey are extremely easy to spot. \nSome run the same summoners like ghost and heal (Only for aram though, they run other things for coop)\nWhile others have certain patterns.\n\nAlot of them just int like normal players so you will see alot of them go 0-20 or something like that but now alot of the bots are changing their methods\n\nStill some of the easy to spot ones but there are some harder to detect ones.\n\n\n\n____________\n\n\n\n\nEx. \nTheres a bot in COOP that caught my interest.\n\nIts a jungle bot\n\nAnd they start gromp level 1\n\nBut stare at it.\n\nThen attempt to kill it\n\nExecute \n\nThen do it again\n\nExecute. \n\nWhich Is a little weird if it was one person\n\nBut then I noticed it alot across several bots games to know its a bot pattern. \n\nSo the bot programs are getting updates it seems. \nBecause if I didn't play coop that much, I as a player who didn't play it would not assume this was  a bot but a player because he didn't run it down. \n\n\nThis bot has come into play this year because I haven't seen it before. \n\n______________________________\n\nSo regardless if its easy to spot.\n\nIt still is best to report them just to send a flag into the system for review.\n\nCause there are some bots that are alot more difficult to detect.","replies":[]}]}
