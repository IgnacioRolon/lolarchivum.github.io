I almost got really overheated and flamed a couple of team mates in my last game and I really wanted to mute myself so I couldn't say anything else that might offend them.\r\n\r\n I know I can just not type anything but my stress is still there. When I get triggered, typing your anger out is kind of a way of relieving toxic stress and that might be a way for other people to relieve the stress too.\r\n\r\n So I was wondering if there is a way I can mute myself and if i get triggered and flame, i can type in chat but no one will see it... {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-25T02:28:12.650+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, you are not the only player to have this particular problem.  Unfortunately, there is no way to permanently mute yourself :(  I think there are three different solutions open to you at this point:\n\n1.  Scream holy hell at your monitor.  Machines don't have feelings, you can abuse that.\n2.  Type out what you want to say but DON'T press 'enter'.  Just delete it all after you type it so you get it out of your system\n3.  Immediately after starting every game, type /mute all.  This will probably make your desire to type way less and lets you just focus on the game.\n\nI know this isn't the best solution, but hopefully it can help out!","replies":[{"poster":"žennoŽTG","date":"2017-08-25T13:28:07.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hihi xD.
