{"poster":"zeskgames","date":"2018-08-04T02:03:43.925+0000","title":"A not-so-pressing lore question, who invented tacos?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Notice:** Before you write this off as another meme post craving attention, I&#039;m serious (seriously curious that is), in the League universe, who invented tacos? \n****\n\n**Some taco stats:** Tacos, for those who don&#039;t know are made by taking a hard of soft tortilla shell and filling it with a mainly meat or vegetables based filling. Even IRL the origin of the taco is unknown, but we know for sure it comes from a place of Hispanic origin around the 19th century (This could be Mexico, Spain, any one of the countries in South America, and many, many more). \n\n****\n**The Runeterra Conundrum:** On the note of Hispanic countries, this leads us to the reason I&#039;m asking this question in the first place. All of the fictional continents in Runeterra are based on real countries, \n1. Ionia: Asian/Indian Influences\n2. Bilgewater: Caribbean/Islander/Costal African Influences\n3. Shurima: Egyptian/Saharan Influences\n4. Demacia: Medieval European Influences \nThe list goes on. __But__ out of all the regions in Runeterra NONE of them have Hispanic influences, making the search for the origin of Tacos that much harder. \n****\n**What we know:** Okay, with the main problem addressed its time to talk about what we know. There are (that I know of) two champions in the game that directly reference Tacos; {{champion:240}} and {{champion:142}}. \nLets start with Kled&#039;s quote. \n{{champion:240}}: &quot;After we finish murdering these folks, what do you think? Tacos? Yeah, tacos.&quot;\n(Get ready for an info dump) Okay, so Kled is a Yordle, meaning _more than likely_ he has lived in **Bandle city** for SOME period of time, in addition Kled was affilated with **Noxus** before striking it out on his own, living in the **Northern Plains**. So, three major locations, Bandle City, Noxus, and the Northern Plains. Now, Kled moved to the Northern Plains so he could be left alone, so we can assume that not many people live out there. So for research purposes we can cross the Northern Plains of our list of origin points. That leaves Noxus and Bandle City. Bandle City is known for being a very mysterious and secretive place, meaning that if a resident invented tacos there, other areas wouldn&#039;t know about it. BUT the inventor of Tacos could&#039;ve easily left Bandle City to spread and perfect his/her craft. Next Noxus, the Noxians are known for their conquests, if they invented tacos, the recipe might trickle through the areas that they&#039;ve taken over in order to assimilate those cultures into their own. The big problem with this theory is that Kled is crazy, so we have to take everything he says with a grain of salt. \nLets move on to Zoe\n{{champion:142}}: &quot;There is a day we must all fulfill our destiny. ...That day is taco day!!&quot;\nZoe is from **Mount Targon** so that adds another location to the list. However, being the aspect of Targon she travels around a lot (including through dimensions) meaning Tacos could be a food from another universe. On that note, Zoe could have brought the recipe to Runeterra herself. \n****\n**To Summarize**\nThere are a few possible origins for Tacos\n1. Noxus: A recipe that is brought through the regions they&#039;ve conquered\n2. Bandle City: A Yordle took the recipe from Bandle City and spread it through the rest of the world\n3. Mount Targon (A): Tacos are a food commonly found on Mount Targon.\n4. Mount Targon (B): Zoe found the recipe for Tacos in another dimension and, being Zoe, excitedly spread the recipe to everyone she could get her hands on. \n\nSo with that in mind, who do you think invented Tacos in Runeterra?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-08-04T07:46:13.507+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":3,"body":"Noxus.
