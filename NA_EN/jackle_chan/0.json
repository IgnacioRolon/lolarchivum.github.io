For some reason, I'd say in about 5/6 of my games, when I finish and go to the post game screen, the \"the request to pvp.net has timed out\" pop up comes up, and my game gets stuck on the loading post game stats screen. I can hit \"ok\" on the pop up, then hit \"skip waiting for stats\" on the loading menu, but then for some reason, I can't get invite from friends, and I can't invite friends either until I relog. It doesn't affect gameplay at all, and I never really disconnect at all except for after all my games. It's just super annoying because I can almost never see the post game stats after, and it's a pain to relog after every game. I've tried to use the repair function on the patcher window, but it didn't really fix the issue. Anyone have the same problem, or know the fix?\r\n\r\nThanks!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T20:44:37.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client cannot keep a good connection to PvP.net, which is the matchmaking with friends/chat service. This often happens if your connection to the PvP.net service becomes poor or drops at any point, and the Mac client is especially sensitive to connection changes. I strongly recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac) as a first step in solving this.\n\nLet me know if you continue to have this issue after taking those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JACKlE CHAN","date":"2016-08-16T03:08:13.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm I'll try clearing out some storage space.
