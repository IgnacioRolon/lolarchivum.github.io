It was opened yesterday and appears you got the Snowdown 2014 astronaut poro and Rengar! :D BTW, that poro icon is super cute!\n\nBe sure to check your icon inventory for the icon and your loot inventory for that champion shard. If you're not seeing either of those things, let me know and I can see what I can do about making those things appear for you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Laura X Howlett","date":"2017-12-29T15:17:45.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so can you explain why i didnt get the the purple champion capsule at lvl 20?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laura X Howlett","date":"2017-12-28T04:05:07.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i did get a BASIC champion capsule at lvl 20, but i thought you get the purple champion capsule every ten lvls, that what my question was about, becuase i got a purple champion capsule at lvl 10, and i also got that kind of capsule every ten lvls on my main account, so i was a lil confused on why i dindt get the purple champion chest at lvl 20, like i did before","replies":[]}]}]}
