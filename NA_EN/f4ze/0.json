I have tried running the Hextech repair tool, flushing my dns, port forwarding, resetting routers, Restarting and PC and LOL and even disabling firewall to no avail. The problem appeared exactly 17 hours from now when i was playing my 8th ranked placement game on my F4ZE acc when i suddenly disconnected. I could not reconnect to that game at all and thus got a leaverbuster strike and a loss. I tried playing another game and got through the champ select phase, but again it could not connect to the game and got another loss on my ranked placements. I have scoured the forums which spoke of similar issues all the way back from 2014 so this isn't a completely new problem.\r\n\r\nThe only thing i haven't tried is completely reinstalling LOL, but i think that wont work. If this is a server side issue i really hope you guys can fix it as i have trie","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T21:09:05.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there might be something blocking your connection from being able to reach the EUNE game servers.

Port forwarding is disabled as I have to constantly update the port forwards with the new reassigned ip addresses everytime I restart my pc or my router. \n\nIf i can know exactly what my ISP is doing to prevent me from playing a game, I can confront them with it. Im already in the process of changing ISPs as well as I am getting barely playable connections on my Steam games as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T00:43:31.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa that looks like your connection is having a really hard time trying to get to our servers, from that trace route your network is never able to actually reach us at all which is why you can't get connected.
