So I played a game with the skin, and I was surprised to see that I was pretty much playing Marie Antoinette that had fire powers. I would like to know if you could possibly fix Annie&#039;s hair and make it blonde like in the splashart, and Make it less... chunkier I guess would be the word. The splashart looks really nice but in game it doesn&#039;t look that well.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-13T18:18:28.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ImortalLyfe,\n\nWe don't have plans to made adjustments to Sweetheart Annie at this time.","replies":[]}]}
