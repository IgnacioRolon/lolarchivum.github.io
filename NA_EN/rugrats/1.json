It seems like no matter what I do people yell at me. I&#039;m not talking because we&#039;re losing or I&#039;m not ganking. My own teammate called me a shitter for playing Shaco when we were winning. I literally muted everyone for a whole match because it was bad every game and I wanted to see if it would help me concentrate. We destroyed them and then people in post game called me an asshole because I was Shaco. I didnt even say a word... Why so much disdain for just another champ? I&#039;m a nice guy, and I just like the way he works.","replies":[{"poster":"Bemapon","date":"2015-12-07T05:56:34.597+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco is the closest thing I have to a main. I havent really been playing much recently but I have seen some Shaco hate pop up here and there on the boards more recently. I didnt notice too much hate when I was playing maybe because my play style is more team based. \n\nI have however had my midlaner say \"I am actually enjoying having you on my team Shaco.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-12-07T03:39:06.417+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Shaco is in the Yorick and Urgot tier of champions that are ungodly annoying to face early game, and contribute nothing to teamfights late game. Win lane lose game champions draw the ire of the community universally.\n\nI hate playing with Shacos because Shaco Syndrome dictates that I'm going to be stuck with the Wood V moron that takes flash and never ganks my lane while telling me to \"git gud\".  Paradoxically, Shaco Syndrome also dictates that I'll face Shaclone's smurfs on the enemy team, they'll camp my lane or invade my jungle, and I'll get killed over and over again.\n\nShaco is an extremely toxic champion to play against.  If Lee Sin wasn't so goddamn popular, Shaco would be god-tier in this meta.  Even if I ward and brace myself for Shaco blinking in and trying to cheese me, even if I win the trade, there's no point in chasing him, as he will simply blink back, and I'll be wasting my time.  His kit is just so goddamn overloaded it's not funny.\n\nUntil Shaco gets a healthy kit, get used to the crying.  Because as the way it stands, a game without Shaco is a much healthier game than one with Shaco in it.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDiff","date":"2015-12-07T04:41:27.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But Shaco can contribute 3 things in a teamfight.\n1: Assasinate the ADC or APC to render them useless in teamfights\n2: Set boxes in the middle of the teamfights to AoE Fear\n3: Bait his ult to maximize dmg","replies":[{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2015-12-07T17:47:16.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't tell them that Shaco can be useful, or else they'll cry to RIOT again for a nerf","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-12-07T10:30:51.457+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because, as Shaco, you either win the game for us or lose it for us.

I think shaco is undeserving of his reputation as a toxic champion. He has one escape, which is also his engage, and is countered by pink wards. People who say he can't be competitive are partially right, you'll never see him in LCS. But there are many shaco mains who have climbed to diamond, master, (and one challenger I can think of,) so saying he only works in low elo is just wrong. \n\nIn a game today I got hate for my build, which was a tankier version so I wouldn't get one shot but still deal damage, I ended the game 14/4/17. It happens, you learn to live with it. I do well in most of my shaco games, but that one game you do poorly, expect to get raged at hard. It comes with playing the champion. \n\nAlso, anyone who judges you based on a champion you play, is a moron and should be ignored. If you like Shaco, play him, he has a very determined fan base {{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-12-07T06:11:53.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont think Shaco is inherently toxic.

No competitive viability. Pretty much exists to shit on noobs. I mean with other assassins they see at least some competitive lime light.

A coordinated team can not only play against Shaco's toxic kit, but they can coordinate themselves in such a way that an invade by Shaco will most definitely result in a first blood on the enemy team, not Shaco's.  \n\nIn Yolo Queue, however, Shaco can easily cheese his way to victory, especially in this early game meta.  If I had one RP for every time I've warded the jungle, asked for help when Shaco invaded, but got nothing from top and/or bot and mid, I'd be to buy every single one of Annie's skins.\n\nI think Shaco is an epic fail of a champion in every way, shape, and form, from his lore to his kit, but that shouldn't be grounds for him to be ignored like Yorick, it should be grounds for him to be pushed to the top of the rework list.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDiff","date":"2015-12-07T05:06:23.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The play where you get blue buff really fast and then invade their jungle for red buff and first blood is a complete pub stomp. That can be counter played by warding your jungle and with some help with your team it should be easy to shut that out, but if you play shaco like normal junglers and gank lanes with his Q, he can be really powerful and should be feared. As for teamfights, a good shaco does 3 things in team fights. First he assasinates the ADC or the APC with his combo and ultimate, second he baits his ult so he can maximize his damage when it explodes, and then he places boxes in the middle of the fight for some CC from his box's fear. After that it is rinse and repeat to other enemies, assuming you didn't die after you jumped on the carries. Tbh, only bad shaco's play him like a pub stomper, and there is more toxic kits than shacos.

I've never once met a Shaco I actually enjoyed playing with or against not only because I have a bias (this didn't just randomly happen one day), but because  every Shaco I've seen has been a scum of the Earth little bitch-baby and isn't afraid to advertise it like a shameless whore.  I dodge every draft where I see a Shaco on my team and decline every Shaco in Teambuilder because I'm anticipating a painful experience where they're going to be useless, feed, flame, ignore all forms of logic and reason, then have the 50/50 chance to AFK after we don't surrender when they want to.\n\nNo one likes Shaco or Shaco players - you may not be like this, but your champions tend to say a lot about you whether you like it or not.  Are there exceptions?  Of course, but because you associate yourself with a particular champ, the community will pull from past experiences with them to judge you.  Not saying it's an okay thing to do, but it happens.\n\nI'm a Vayne main and my favorite champion is Ahri; there's a lot of bias against the fanbases of these champs, but I can accept it because I understand where people are coming from.  Bottom line is people are going to hate you if you play certain champions, just learn to deal with it I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2015-12-07T07:09:38.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"I'm a nice guy, and I just like the way he works.\"\n^PICK ONE!
