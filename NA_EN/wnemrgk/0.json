I go to the support and request a ticket for this out of no where ban. They tell me \"It looks like the account was placed under a protective ban after we noticed some unusual login activity\". They give cookie cutter questions to \"verify\" i'm the account owner. Now I don't know about you, but for someone who took a 4 year break on my account and just got back in, these questions are almost impossible to answer. I answer to the best of my ability but it asks me for the locations I've played on the account, the first champs I played, RP code pin numbers? and other questions that someone who clearly hasn't played for that long, or even if they did, could possibly  remember. I understand that \"account security\" is important, but I've sent 2 tickets with the same generic replay that they can't give me my account back because there wasn't enough information to verify I was the owner. I feel cheated out, i really got back into playing this game and had fun climbing through the ranks, but out of no where I get banned because someone most likely logged into my account somehow, and now they won't give me it back. I've recently bought rp and was planning to get more for some cool skins but now it looks like all of that is wasted too.....any help would be greatly appreciated, as emailing support again seems pointless now.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T20:56:07.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know those questions can be a little difficult, but they were chosen for a very specific reason. The answers to those questions are pretty hard for someone to figure out unless they were the one who created and played on the account. You're not entirely locked out of your account though, so take some time to look over those questions to see if there's any more that you could answer. Even if you aren't 100% sure of the answers, do your best to get as close as you can remember.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ayarn","date":"2017-05-28T17:36:48.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that a sounds very odd case ","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadow distroyer","date":"2017-06-04T00:48:42.234+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who the hell is going to remember their RP card numbers??? As soon as I finish putting in the code I just throw them away. Rito i think you guys/women/potato chip/fidgitspinners  (just so I'm not \"sexest\") need to look over some of these questions. I got banned for 14 days recently as soon as i played a 5 man game. we were all messing around and saying some stupid things(very very racist comments) BUTT the point is why would we get banned if it was between a group of us friends and no one reported anyone it wasn't even in all chat (maybe not was a little bit drunk But thats becides the point) \n\nOOOOOH BTW BIG NOTE:\n\nPut a little notification on you screen like a popup saying you got reported.\nAND NOT JUST COME OUTTA NO WHERE WITH THE **sound effects** *BAM PEW PEW PEW BAM PEWCHAWO* ban for 14 days can you eas into the banning system. For example start with the one-two day ban then go to the 3-5 day ban then go to the 7-9 day ban then 2 weeks not just bann them for 2 weeks straight up. welp thats my rant let me kno what you guys think \n\n@Broporo @Riot @FidgitSpinner101/,,Potatochip  @vainglory is starting to low key get better then this game. they are going to be ahead of riot games within the next 2-5 years FYI","replies":[]}]}
