As for ulting during a stun, no, he can't do that.\n\nIt sounds to me like your opponent got hit by a stun after he launched his whirlwind, then the stun ran out before his knockup did, thereby letting him hit you with his ult by mashing the R key.","replies":[{"poster":"Frost the Reaper","date":"2016-07-17T02:56:29.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^x1000. If you stun yasuo he's stunned. However if he gets out of the stun and your still in the air (The knock up on his kit is like 1.5 seconds I think?) Then he can quickly mash R and ult you.","replies":[]}]}]}
