We're buying it because it gives the raw power and sustain that we need (if we're rushing it) and that the only class that actually rushes this item are the 'standard' mages. Assassins, tanks, ADCs, Tear/ROA users, hell even some mages, as I've mentioned, don't rush CDR immediately.

So it's not that you buy morello just for the mana or just for the ap. There are other options and a lot of mages still go for the morello because of the CDR that comes with it. Perhaps the competition is simply too weak. I know that many champs need the mana, but would actually prefer more AP instead of CDR or hp. But Riot probably doesn't want too much AP because 1 hit combos are pretty lame to play against.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zepdrix","date":"2017-07-13T03:34:15.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle rushes 40% CDR, no exceptions.\n\nI can't think of any other champions in which it is a necessity to rush CDR though,\nso the rest of your points are well made. :)","replies":[{"poster":"obsesse","date":"2017-07-13T16:50:50.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually see Kayle getting Nashor into Guinsoo's or Wit's End depending on matchup; rarely do I see a Nashor into another CDR item.

Also in patch 5.13 and patch 5.22.\n\nMorellonomicon got more damage and other stuff but more damage and a cost increase. Side note this is one of the biggest cdr options in the game right now. This happened in patch 6.9\n\nZhonya's is one of the few that actually got less damage in these amge tune ups. It got less damage and cdr and longer cd on active but cheaper cost.\n\nRod of Ages has had its ap nerfed in 6.12 but that was deserved and it also got a cheaper price tag to go along with it.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-07-13T06:35:55.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nash gives 20.\n\nOther 20 items are frozen heart, ibg, and tri.\n\nMages need a 20 item as it allows for build diversity, otherwise they would have to build more cookie cutter.\n\nSorry on my phone","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2017-07-13T18:40:02.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot about nashor's tooth but it is such a niche item that I don't count it for most mage discussions.
