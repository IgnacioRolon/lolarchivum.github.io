I will have normal ping and everything, but all of a sudden, my game will freeze, telling me I am trying to reconnect. A minute later, I will reconnect. As you can imagine, this is very, very, annoying. Try laning against a Yasuo when suddenly you give him a free kill by standing still for a couple of seconds before walking back to your fountain. This happens probably at least once everyother game, and some games it happens multiple times. \r\n\r\nIf someone could fill me in on what is going  on and how to fix, I would appreciate it. I even asked our internet provider to bump up our internet, but that hasn't done anything. I live in Virginia and use Cox cable (sadly).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-20T17:36:12.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your detailed post on this.
