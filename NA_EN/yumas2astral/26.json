I don&#039;t play Yasuo myself because I find him to be really boring, despite what the majority of people think.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I got tired of people picking him at all times, on every situation, against any champion. I don&#039;t know if that is common on NA, but on my server, people just pick him without caring about many important things, for example: if the team needs a tank, or if the team needs an AP champion, or if the team already has a squishy melee carry. And more important, if the team actually has knockups to make Yasuo work during late game.\r\n\r\nBut no, people just pick him on any situation, without really caring about what will happen. Yesterday, I was playing Cho&#039;Gath on a normal draft, and the enemy picked Yasuo against me. I mean... What the hell? Cho&#039;Gath is a strong counter to Yasuo. In fact, I stomped him on lane. Why would him pick Yasuo? Just for the sake of playing this champion?\r\n\r\nThe lane wasn&#039;t fun, because it is still a Yasuo, but I still managed to win my lane nonetheless. I am not saying that Yasuo is OP or anything. In fact, he is surprisingly easy to counter and unless there is more than one knockup on the enemy team besides Yasuo himself he will fall off late game because he is very dependent on the team composition.\r\n\r\nBut he is still a very unfun champion to play against, due to his opressive laning phase (contrary to the popular belief, Yasuo&#039;s early game is NOT weak, especially since it&#039;s on the lane phase where he can take the most advantage of his mobility with nearby enemy minions), ability to scale super well and snowball easily, being resourceless, and having a wind wall that is capable of blocking even ultimates.\r\n\r\nAnd worse yet, people don&#039;t know the appropriate moment to pick him. They just pick him without caring about the circunstances. Once I was in a ranked game, and despite the rest of my team trying to convince one of my allies to pick a tank, he didn&#039;t care about what we were saying. He just picked Yasuo, and against a Maokai. He surprisingly won the lane - but unfortunately, he was completely useless during the mid/late game because he was squishy and was lacking in utility. Also, our team didn&#039;t had the needed knockups to make him work. We lost because we didn&#039;t had a proper tank that could start teamfights.\r\n\r\nThis happens to me every time. I am so tired of playing with a Yasuo on the game, that I started to dodge on normal draft games, whenever there is a Yasuo on either team. On ranked games, I don&#039;t do this for obvious reasons. So I just counterpick him with a champion that can stomp him during the lane phase, such as Cho&#039;Gath and Fizz. Or if Yasuo is on my team, I pick champions with knockups, because I know that nobody else will do that.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done with Yasuo to make him less of a feast and famine champion that is unfun to play against and more of a healthy champion that can work and still scale well and be really fun both to play as and against?","replies":[{"poster":"Ellphi","date":"2015-10-14T03:45:08.354+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":6,"body":"People pick him because he's fun\n\nHonestly my Ranked winrate with Yasuo is probably less than 40% but he's still my go-to champ for top or mid because he's entertaining\n\nPeople pick retarded shyt all the time, e.g Lee Sin is picked like every other game when he's literally almost always a terrible pick.

If you play champions that have easy  mechanics  like Vi, Warwick, Xin ZHao etc, there is a lot of options Yasuo can take to outplay you if circumstances are good enough. Yasuo is what i would call a healthy melee ad carry. His mobility is limited to creeps so predicting his movements is easier than most champions. His damage can be dodged or stopped short unlike championis like Akali, Kayle, etc. Most matchups with Yasuo are very skill based and depend on mechanics and decision making which makes games rather than the usual I picked this champ so therefore you automatically lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"leaguewut","date":"2015-10-14T22:16:19.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is partly so toxic to play versus because of his wall. I'm of the belief it should have a shield health against projectiles that scales with his crit and/or bonus AD so that it only truly becomes invulnerable lategame (though it should ignore the damage of the first hit, like Braum's shield).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teémò","date":"2015-10-14T21:41:23.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"picking  yasuo or zed against lulu or any utility mage in mid lane. You can be Vi ult'd into the yasuo ult and lulu will just eat it up. {{champion:117}}  he can be incredibly easy to manipulate through. Manipulating the minnions in the wave or freezing lane putting you between him  and his own minnions annie's the best  example of this to a yasuo or just knowing that him dashing to you for his knock up is like a slow motion malphite ult that you can bait and flash repositioning yourself well able to land any close range ability ult what ever and he can't dash to you to get away and becomes totally out of position","replies":[]},{"poster":"FooDang","date":"2015-10-14T17:49:49.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing I dislike is Yasuo can keep fishing with his knockup  until he can Ult.  Outside of Champion abilities to save someone his Ult is guaranteed, The only thing he can miss is his knockup.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Himbeekee","date":"2015-10-14T17:34:54.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not to mention everyone who plays yasuo is toxic AF...","replies":[]}]}
