But she has some major weaknesses.  Champions with spamable slows are extremely tough for Kalista because it lowers her ability to use her passive.  This means you can't be kited as easily.  The reason she can be a huge pain in the but is that by building a hurricane right away she can farm huge cs with minimal effort and there's almost no way to stop her.  She does NOT do well to counter pressure though if you can land a stun to stop her passive jumps away. So you want to play very aggressive and get jungle help early game.\n\nFor Fiora, EVERY champ should build a thornmail if she gets ahead of them.  The item is extremely strong against her because of how quick she hits.  I've had a team that follows my lead on this and has shut down a level 18 Fiora full build while we're all 14-15 catching up because we built thornmail.\n\nCounter building is very important against a lot of champions and it is worth the dps loss and other defensive item loss if you're playing against a champion that can be counter builded.  Fiora is a key example of this as this one item (especially if built early against her) will be her undoing.\n\nThe reason thornmail is so strong is that it has the ability to hit your attacker HARDER than you're being hit because it applies the damage back to her before your armor value.  That means that when she hits, she recieves back her full hit and you only take her damage mitigated by armor. This means if you have 2k hp and she does that dmg to you, she can take over 2k hp dmg basically killing herself.  That's why it's a great item to build against her.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-06-11T13:37:22.857+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo and Shaco.

Yeah yeah, 'just kite him late game', but honestly, I find that his Wither makes it pretty hard to do as soon as he gets it on you.\n\nDoesn't help I distinctly remember having to be a jungler for one particular Nasus: Builts a Triforce and ghostblade and NO defensive items, despite BLATANTLY being behind until I begged him to, and despite him CLEARLY being squishy as fuck, he INSISITED on calling EVERYTHING that killed him \"BS.\" And don't even get me STARTED on the ceaseless pinging.\n\n---\n\nTryndamere's also up there too, because I'm roughly bronze-silver MMR so I'm bad.

Why the hate? T.T\n\nWhen I first started playing, I saw him on a loading screen and basically thought \"I don't like you.\" I didn't have a reason then, though; something about him just annoyed me a bit. I went to his lore in the client, and thought \"Now I have a reason not to like you.\" This was before Riot shortened it to the tiny paragraph it is now.\n\n* He's toted as prodigy for little reason other than mapping some tunnels.\n* He can only use his conveniently-latent magical power because his amulet-gauntlet does all the focusing for him. He was otherwise too lazy and careless to cultivate the talent.\n* He only competes in the League (regardless of the League no longer being canon) because his glove had handwaves--I mean, mysterious ties to summoning magic, putting the lore reason why he exists as a champion somewhere on the spectrum from \"shaky\" to \"bullshit\".\n* His smug face in every one of his new splashes since release barring one or two, in addition to his arrogance with his quotes, voiced or written. At least Draven's arrogance is so ridiculous it's kind of funny; Ezreal's just makes me wish I could kick him in the dick.\n\nTo me, everything he is just reeks of a pretentious Mary Sue. The fact that Riot keeps ship teasing him with my favorite character only adds to the salt.\n\nAgain, I don't mind his gameplay; I don't hate you by the transitive property or something for maining him. Though I find it ironic that Ezreal touts his skill so much for being a low-medium difficulty champ at most, and not even having all skillshot abilities (Arcane Shift is a target-free blink with a guided attack on the side; I don't count it)(I know skillshots don't completely determine difficulty).\n\nAh, that felt good. /rant","replies":[{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-06-14T05:37:47.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny enough I liked him for all of the reasons you hate him, even in terms of character, lol.\n\nI liked his original lore - supposedly brilliant but easily bored he basically skipped school to go exploring. Even though I agree, I wish he had more in his original background than \"dicked around in some tunnels\", it at least reinforced his exploration, \"Who Needs A Map\" theme. Although I also wish more of his skins had dug into his idea. Ezreal actually being developed as a true researcher, archaeologist, etc would have been neat. The only thing they ended up doing was giving him the shitty Explorer skin. But even if he could have been present in some of the splash art for like the Jurassic skins would have been cool xD\n\nAnd somehow, the fact that he's a sarcastic dick endeared him to me moreso than the *other* self-absorbed sarcastic dicks in League. I dunno, I was also an underachieving slacker in school so maybe there's some self projection there.\n\nAnd I love his gameplay; he's been my main since his release. And even though Arcane Gate's projectile locks on, I'd say it is still Skill Shot-esque since it can be easily messed up by any minion or monster. But having a Champion with ~~4~~ 3.5 skillshots and 0 CC whatsoever, but still holds his own as a viable-but-not-OP Champion (especially considering his W has been gutted so hard) says something about how good he can be played.

Thats fine i can accept the malphite ult, but then you land and stand around for 3 minutes because it stuns you too. its like an AoE morg Q. Just cant stand him.\n\nI know how to counter him and who to pick into him, he isnt broken. i just hate him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tifas left elbow","date":"2015-06-11T22:38:20.021+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:74}} Not fun to play or play against.

I feel like every time there is one on the enemy team, I always have a team of scarecrows (no brain, WoZ). If someone has lulu, don't polymorph her randomly while she walks around, polymorph her the minute she uses death lotus, or if your ult is up, use it when she shunpos. Too many bad plays against her. And I still don't know how people lose lane to her. Her poke used to be twice as high.\n\nTryndamere....I just can't. I hate that his slow is so heavy, and I hate that if you're not slowed, then you lost half of your AD. There's really no winning if you are within any sort of sight range of his. And his ultimate infuriates me.\n\nEnemy Kayles ALWAYS get to late game for me. Whenever I see one jungle, her ganks come out great (idk how...ever). If she lanes, I see her first blood a strong counter at level 2 (yorick, Riven, Darius). I'm jinxed. She always reaches the point of \"Well we won a 4v5 but she took two turrets....anyone wanna go stop her?..no?...okay well we'll pretend like we didn't see her take inhibitor......................oh no that's game......anyone want to go protect nexus?.......well nice try amumu...maybe next time you'll pretend to not see her too to save yourself the humiliation of pushing back one of her waves only to be killed in 3 seconds\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2015-06-11T18:10:57.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to vote {{champion:76}} .

Nothing with a kit this cancerous should be allowed to be on the roster; Riot should know better than this by now.  The League of Mobility reached full speed because of you.  You and Lee - this is all your fault.\nEdit: Forgot {{champion:238}} I have no resources and can farm freely from a safe distance while you go OOM trying to CS.
