This is because the new E gives fantastic new effects when combined with his other skills, and they increase if you max it. In addition, W is mostly useful for its root rather than for its damage. \r\n\r\nHowever, maybe I am wrong and Q &gt; W &gt; E is still the way to go.

The E bonus when hit with Q increases Q damage by a %.  This makes the points in Q extra powerful.\n\nAlso, Q gives passive movement speed, also making it valuable to max first.\n\n\nI could see E being maxed first in a super passive lane possibly.
