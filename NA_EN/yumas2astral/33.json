Is it an AP assassin item or a hybrid sustain item?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":52,"down_votes":5,"body":"{{item:3146}} &lt;-- this item suffer from the same issue as {{item:3151}}, which is currently divided into being an anti-tank item (due to its passive) or an item that is good against squishies (due to the flat magic penetration). That is being solved in the PBE: Liandry has been changed to finally focus on its niche as an anti-tank AP item, while another item with flat magic penetration is being added to compensate; one that has a better passive for AP assassins (apply Grievous Wounds).\n\nI think Hextech Gunblade also suffers from a similar problem. The active screams &quot;AP assassin item&quot;. But the build path, the stats, and the omnivamp screams &quot;sustain item for hybrid champions\".\n\nMost AP assassins don&#039;t actually build Hextech Gunblade. The three exceptions are Akali and Katarina, which actually take advantage of the stats and build path (and in case of Akali, gives her even more sustain). There is also LeBlanc, which is a weird abomination that builds it because she really needs the damage and slow that this item offers. Shaco used to build it, but AP Shaco is no longer a thing. Ahri builds it sometimes but it is not included in her most popular build paths (I know Ahri is not an assassin, but she tends to be mentioned when people talk about AP assassins). Other AP assassins like Fizz, Ekko, Kassadin, Nidalee, and Evelynn do not build it because its build path and stats sucks for them. It is also too expensive for them.\n\nAs for the hybrid champions; there are very few actual hybrids, and the term itself is ambiguous. If we are talking about hybrid scaling champions, then there are actually a good amount of them. Examples include Ezreal and Tristana. But almost none of them actually builds both AP and AD. If we are talking about champions which build both AD and AP, there are quite a few of them, such as Jax, and Mordekaiser. With that said, while they can, they rarely build hybrid. Jax&#039;s meta build is the Triforce + Titanic Hydra build which is mid game centric and is purely AD. Mordekaiser doesn&#039;t have good itemization that can support an hybrid build for him, so most of time he builds purely AP. Kog&#039;Maw actually builds hybrid most of time, but he rarely has room to fit Hextech Gunblade on his build.\n\nOn my opinion, this item should also be split in two items. One which is focused on the active, for AP assassins, It should be purely AP (and build only from AP items), and be a bit cheaper. Peharps, have cooldown reduction. The other item should be the actual AD/AP item, with the omnivamp passive, and another passive (or active) that better supports hybrid builds. Peharps an on-hit effect?","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-02-18T14:10:38.758+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Weird that they are not touching Gunblade in the AP items update.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xiniba","date":"2018-02-18T13:48:46.374+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:84}} is balanced around Gunblade so do not expect any changes pre Rework.","replies":[{"poster":"EyasHawk","date":"2018-02-18T17:59:09.665+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"I wouldnt call Akali balanced at all to be honest. lol \nInsane burst + resets + lifesteal to full Hp in seconds + Stealth is a recipe for disaster on an Assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2018-02-18T18:41:36.563+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EyasHawk,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TZcAgQEK,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-02-18T17:59:09.665+0000)\n>\n> I wouldnt call Akali balanced at all to be honest. lol \n> Insane burst + resets + lifesteal to full Hp in seconds + Stealth is a recipe for disaster on an Assassin.\n\nAnd then she falls off incredibly hard late game where she can't burst the ADC fast enough, and is easy prey to CC.\n\nI am not saying that Akali is weak, just that she is the definition of a binary champion.","replies":[{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2018-02-19T01:02:10.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being binary is what makes Akali unhealthy.

I completely agree with the conclusion that Gunblade needs to be split into at least two additional items, and in the manner the OP specified.\n\nCurrently, the active is picked for its extremely reliable burst damage, like Deathfire Grasp without follow-up, and this in itself conflicts with Protobelt, whose dash active also carries a shotgun damage component (which itself would work with the melee-range approach of most assassins). It might therefore be better to make Protobelt the dedicated item for upfront burst and mobility (though that in itself arguably counts as two different niches), and thus core on AP assassins.\n\nAs for the omnivamp effect, the issue thus far has been that Riot just doesn't know how to balance it on casters, even if autoattackers are allowed to have it with Death's Dance. Personally, I think it might be interesting to have something like a self-beneficial version of Athene's Unholy Grail, where you store a portion of the damage you deal, but this time can use an item active to heal yourself for that stored damage. It would allow for much better control over how spells fill this reserve up (you could have different modifiers for damage over time, single-target versus AoE, damage against champions versus non-champions, etc.), while still maintaining the clarity of a single, universal source of healing.\n\nBeyond that, I personally don't think there really needs to be any accommodations made for a hybrid item. Currently, the only two hybrid AD/AP items in the game are Gunblade and Rageblade, and neither is picked primarily for its hybrid stats, not even on champions with hybrid scalings who purchase it (e.g. Akali). In fact, in both cases, the extra stat actually weighs the item down, and in the case of Rageblade this is deliberate (the item needs to stall its build path in a manner that doesn't load too much on useful stats). Therefore, _removing_ the hybridity of those items might actually benefit them both, and if League is ever to have hybrid builds, that would require encouraging multiplicative scaling between those two stats, or at least changes that would make hybrid builds compete with the multiplicative scalings of full AD or AP builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2018-02-19T17:29:58.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd agree with this. Another example to me is Luden's Echo. It looks primarily like a heavy damage spike to ranged poke builds, but I often use it because it's the healthiest spike of AP and movement speed, and therefore strong on AP bruisers in sticking to targets, at least in the early goings. Runic Echoes is the same way, and would make sense on bruisers there in the jungle. The CDR change will be interesting because it will be more appropriate for pokers, I think, but those champions surely got their CDR elsewhere already, probably mostly Morellonomicon, Hextech Protobelt, and Boots of Lucidity, or maybe a support/defensive item. \n\nI'm not sure I agree with Morellonomicon being bifunctional, though. It's basically healthy AP/CDR/mana, and a caster passive on one item. I feel like it's as much a generic caster boost as one can get. Maybe you can clarify that. I'd consider it bifunctional if specific stats on it help a particular class more than another with two or more marginally competing stats, and I just don't see that on Morellonomicon. As an example, Trinity Force has a crap-ton of stats, many of which competing, but none of them are stronger on the item than the movement and damage passives. CDR on it actually serves to proc those more often. I feel like this leaves the item somewhat single function because it's best used on tanky/kiting champions who weave spells and autoattacks reliably. Morellonomicon may help more champions, but the generic AP help, to me, makes the item helpful to all AP classes, not just one or two classes in split ways, and then tends to benefit champions who abuse both playstyles, like Luden's with Nidalee (who is basically non-viable without it or Lich Bane).","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-02-19T18:40:41.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree that Luden's Echo is also a good example of an item that could easily be split into at least two more.
