I have yet to see a Tahm Kench top lane, but I suppose that he would be a good counter to other tanks and bruisers, due to his Grey Health and his high base damage. He would also be difficult to poke with long ranged mages that make other tanks have a hard time during the lane phase.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sure that once Tahm Kench is used on a LCS match, he will suddenly become popular, people will realize how strong he is, and he will become pick or ban, soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeurth","date":"2015-07-11T23:39:25.264+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":17,"body":"\"Tahm Kench is one of the most balanced champions since Vel'Koz.\"\nNo, he really isn't.\nHe's pretty OP if you can play him correctly along with his ulti.\nTired of people saying a support eating a full hp champion and taking them down to 1/4 is balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Gallowgrim","date":"2015-07-12T01:11:17.768+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"So sick of people grossly exaggerating how much damage a Devour can do.\n\nFirst it was chunk to 50%, now its chunk to 25%?\n\nGiven his optimal build, we're looking at  \"chunk to 65%\" at best, with 67% far more likely.
