In my opinion, everyone just needs to relax and look at the design decisions they make.\n\nIn order to add something, you are mitigating part of the meta. for example, if you improve tanky items, you reduce the viability of sustain. Thus burst and piercing come into fashion as a compensatory measure. If the game's elements (what Riot has control over), are unbalanced, then the way players play the game effectively compensates for this, creating a balanced meta.\n\nThat meta remains stable until another compensatory gameplay style is found, or until the game elements change. From what I've seen in my short time, the game elements are changing very frequently (and sometimes to a large degree) in this game, so the entire meta shifts every other update.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-12-28T23:51:48.571+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FeLr5deg,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-12-28T15:41:50.744+0000)\n>\n> Precision gives better armor and magic pen then the ferocity tree right?\n> \n> Why?

Pantheon's in the thick of it for a while, but he only has one short burst aoe (other than his ult), and for the most part focuses a single target, usually a squish that, if he has his way, will be dead in a few seconds anyway. Urgot I can understand more, even though he primarily focuses one or two targets, he spams all day from the beginning to the end of a fight.\n\nOf course there's lane phase to consider also, Panth with deathfire in lane is probably a LOT more effective than thunderlord's.

It gives you damage, sustain, and an easy to proc nuke.  Either some of that offensive power has to go, or Ferocity needs buffed hard in the damage department.  As it is you get most of the relevant masteries in 12-18-0 already.  So those last 6 points need to be where a tree REALLY differentiates itself, and right now Cunning is far and away the better choice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElegantDoge","date":"2015-12-29T14:51:09.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm the only one not finding Thunderlord to be useful on anyone ?\nLike,i almost never use it on my adc because fervor still give free ad and as a adc,i'll be doing sustained damages so i can stack it pretty quickly or i use the warlord bloodlust on champs like Caitlyn(free as is nice).\nOr on some bruiser like Fiora ,Riven ,Jax etc.. who can stack fervor insanely quick.Yes ,Thunderlord give me some free damage pretty fast but it's just once every 20 sec after 3 hit.\nOn Fiora,having +80 ad late game with *10 fervor give me even more true damage and it just take a few sec to reach the 10th stack.\n\nI don't know,i agree that because of the nerf on the others,Thunderlord is pretty much mandatory on some champions(almost any mage by example unless you're anivia,Malzahar etc..)\n\nOtherwise i think most players are just being sheeps.\n\nJust today i had a lucian  who wanted to fight my Ashe with 6 stacks of fervor (a gank happened before and it got messy)and got completely rekt(i had the oracle lens) .I just had to AA+W+AA and i was at 10 stacks  meaning i had+40 ad while his stupid thunderlord was still on CD.\n\nI hope Riot doesn't nerf the mastery or may be change it so people can understand not everything is about Thunderlord.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-12-29T23:31:17.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lejambondémasqué,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FeLr5deg,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2015-12-29T14:51:09.974+0000)\n>\n> I'm the only one not finding Thunderlord to be useful on anyone ?\n> Like,i almost never use it on my adc because fervor still give free ad and as a adc,i'll be doing sustained damages so i can stack it pretty quickly or i use the warlord bloodlust on champs like Caitlyn(free as is nice).\n> Or on some bruiser like Fiora ,Riven ,Jax etc.. who can stack fervor insanely quick.Yes ,Thunderlord give me some free damage pretty fast but it's just once every 20 sec after 3 hit.\n> On Fiora,having +80 ad late game with *10 fervor give me even more true damage and it just take a few sec to reach the 10th stack.\n> \n> I don't know,i agree that because of the nerf on the others,Thunderlord is pretty much mandatory on some champions(almost any mage by example unless you're anivia,Malzahar etc..)\n> \n> Otherwise i think most players are just being sheeps.\n> \n> Just today i had a lucian  who wanted to fight my Ashe with 6 stacks of fervor (a gank happened before and it got messy)and got completely rekt(i had the oracle lens) .I just had to AA+W+AA and i was at 10 stacks  meaning i had+40 ad while his stupid thunderlord was still on CD.\n> \n> I hope Riot doesn't nerf the mastery or may be change it so people can understand not everything is about Thunderlord.\n\nFervor does not give free AD. It gives bonus physical damage to your auto-attacks. It is essentially free AD on autos, but with a key differences: it doesn't boost abilities' scalings, it doesn't crit, and it is treated as an on-hit effect.","replies":[{"poster":"ElegantDoge","date":"2015-12-30T10:16:30.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YumaS2Astral,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FeLr5deg,comment-id=00190000,timestamp=2015-12-29T23:31:17.127+0000)\n>\n> Fervor does not give free AD.
