Almost every adc is forced to build IE, phantom/shyv because that's the quickest road to the highest dps most of the time and vayne outdamages them with botrk + phantom/shyv due to her true damage steroid (while also having a decent amount of lifesteal mixed into her strengths)\n\nThis is only around 32 bonus ad including BOTRK and doran's blade built by her and she's getting the max benefit of her silver bolts at a very early stage of the game.\n\nI think a possible way to fix  and delay her power spike is to add an AD ratio to the silver bolts % max health while also lowering the base damage (both the flat and the % max health). My reasoning for this is so that late game, once she has IE, BOTRK, LW  etc,  she will put out around similar numbers in regards to % max health on silver bolts and not have quite such a strong power spike once she gets her BOTRK.\n\nI probably didnt'edit my post enough but lemme know what you guys think.

Vayne is hybridized damage herself. But unlike Koggles who is Physical and Magical, Vayne gets the arguably better Physical and **true** damage hybridization. How does this become even better? Her true damage is based on the targets **maximum** health. Meaning that building to counter it just causes it to hit even harder.\n\nIf Koggles built to make his W hit harder, all the tank has to do is stack up magic resist. What can a tank do to save themselves from Vayne's silver bolt? They have to kamikaze her and die killing her or have one of their carries snipe her off. \n\nI would love Koggles to be the tank killer, but that isn't him. He's the immobile artillery.

What you just said doesn't change the fact that Vayne is a better tank-buster than Kog is.\n\nLowering resistances? Vayne doesn't need that, LOL. You do understand what TRUE damage is right? Its damage that BYPASSES Armor AND Magic Resist. What counters true damage? Health does. But guess what? Vayne's true damage is a % of the target's MAXIMUM health. So the more health they build, the harder it hits. \n\nAlso...what do you mean by \" He deals hybrid damage vs AD/true damage\"?  What? Do you understand what you're saying?

In a sustained fight, her silver bolts start to pay off, but especially when it comes to poking tanks out, Kogmaw does it significantly better. \n\nAgain, items like frozen heart make it incredibly difficult for Vayne because it slows down her procs AND has resistances against her normal damage. That same item vs a Kogmaw isn't nearly as effective, because of his hybrid damage that doesn't need a certain amount of autos to proc.

Of course this is an extreme example (maybe...) but i do see this as a serious issue.  \n\nThe reason i have issue with this is if that Vayne player is smart they will be able to come back and come back hard, but a bad Vayne player (and there are a lot of them) will give up and automatically assume the game is over. Then the boards will be spammed with \"Buff Vayne\" (and probably GG Riot, Fire Balance Team, etc...) and then she will get buffed again. Which will make it meaningless to have nerfed her in the first place. I know champions are generally buffed or nerfed based on how they are played at higher levels of play but still i think it could end up being an issue for her balance. The opposite would be this nerf doesn't do anything to her laning phase or she can go even with any ADC. This is still a problem because in first one she is still overbearing and in the second one the enemy is struggling meanwhile Vayne hits her spike and its no longer even. \n\nI would suggest, if possible, to look for a solution that doesn't just straight weaken her laning phase but makes it more difficult to perform at the same levels she is performing at currently. Probably easier said then done, but all those \"nerf Vayne\" fanatics need to realize they will have Vayne's on their team. You do not want a crappy weak Vayne on your team who is then going to quit because she was \"nerfed too hard\".","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-09-29T11:43:57.518+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah because the boards are flooded with \"buff azir\" threads by all of the people failing at Azir and giving him such a abysmall win rate\n\nWhen one champion is knocked down most people just jump ship to the next FotM","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2015-09-29T08:44:20.738+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Z2cXn12Q,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2015-09-29T06:05:07.023+0000)\n>\n> We're currently testing a small reduction to Vayne's starting AD, our belief being that Vayne's currently got too strong a lane for how powerful her late game is (with the strong late game a defining feature of hers and a strong lane not intended).

She just doesn't need to build damage that early, unlike other ADCs she can just build Blade of the Ruined King and rely on her ult to be her main source of AD until she finishes a Phantom Dancer.\n\nBut sooner or latter, she will need to start building big AD items like Infinity Edge or Bloodthisther. Otherwise her damage will not actually be that big late. I say that because once I've been against a Vayne top that, after building Blade of the Ruined King and Frozen Mallet, started to build tanky. Starting late game she was dealing very little damage even factoring in the Silver Bolts. The fact that she was building tanky was not a problem since I was using Malzahar and he is a tank buster (btw, she didn't had QSS)\n\nAlso, true damage based on a percentage of max health can in fact have counterplay. However, the counterplay isn't based on itemization. The counterplay can be based on other factors, for example, Vayne needs to hit a target three times; this can be countered by reducing Vayne's attack speed. Also, it must be the same target otherwise stacks are removed, this can be countered by going as a group against her and forcing Vayne to constantly switch targets.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2015-09-29T04:26:18.120+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, a reasonable nerf I've seen talked about is removing the flat true damage on her w so it affects tanks more than squishes.","replies":[]}]}
