Notably, I'd say that a lot of that comes down to the fact that Ahri is a far better roamer than Yasuo, and plies her power in other lanes, rather than stay and try and beat Yasuo in the 1v1s he is stronger in in this situation.\n\nThere is one very important thing to note though.  Ahri starts falling off like a rock around 30 minutes in, where Yasuo starts soaring in winrate after his large mid-game dip.   If Yasuo just survives the Ahri matchup without giving her a lead, he wins the matchup pretty much.    This is showcased in how their stats play out.  They both have about the same kill count average, yasuo on average dies once more per game than Ahri, BUT Ahri tends to get 2+ more assist than Yasuo, and Yasuo tends to have a fairly large gold lead on Ahri.   This pretty much plays to exactly how the matchup goes, where Yasuo fights to survive Ahri in lane while farming up, while Ahri tries to bully him early before roaming after he starts spiking in power and she has to leave the lane or else get bullied herself, because as much as people love to QQ about Ahri, her damage is actually fairly low for a mage/assassin.  She is great at multiple trades thanks to innate sustain, and a low CD kit, but she tends to be lackluster at all ins unless she has at least one other person helping her do damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Ichi Ni San","date":"2017-09-29T02:26:25.084+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty solid analysis mate.\n\nwith how their relative cooldowns and damage scale up as the game goes on, yas can clear a wave much much fast than ahri, even faster the bigger it is due to low cooldown eq chains he uses in the wave. late game yasuo will shit on anything that isnt locking him down with cc, thats pretty much yasuos only win condition as i see it, but who am i.\n\nlvl 1 trades are a lot better for yasuo if he gets to auto you all the way to your turret and get the xp lead, but it seems to get pretty hard to compete for cs if he gives up the early level pressure without trading, or dies to ganks at all.\n\nthe way i see it, ahri that lands spells should be taking every chance she gets to poke yas out of lane, since his pseudo-sustain passive gets wasted pretty hard mid. with that, kill him and put him in the dirt once and for all, then roam bot and do the same to the ad","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-09-28T21:02:09.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?

Then he backs, buys one crit item, and can just entirely ignore his kit and statcheck you to death with his autos that crit 90% of the time with one item and do absurd damage -- then it gets to be infuriating. And when he buys lifesteal and autos you for 500-600+ on top of his Q that has a 2 second CD... he just becomes a statcheck late game with hyper mobility and all kinds of survival tools and CC.\n\nAnd he really has no counterplay other than him fucking up. He has an answer to every situation.\n\nA samurai is all about precision and control, right? So, instead of autoing at the speed of light with reckless abandon, make him into a real samurai type thing. Give him some real counterplay, and lower his bullshit synergy with lifesteal and crit items.\n\n---\n\nSo, first off, cap Yas's attack speed. I feel like 0.8-1.2ish would be fine. You could increase his base AD or something if you need to, or make extra AS give him bonus MS or something.\n\n***Passive:*** Honestly, his passive is fine for a melee skirmisher thing. But, there needs to be one small change:\n\n* ***His autos cannot crit***.\n\n   * Double crit still applies to Q\n\n***Q:*** His Q can stay the same stab thing he has, but a few changes to it: \n\n* First, lower the base damage. \n\n* Second, a passive on his Q: When Yas autos, he creates weak points on the enemy (stacking 3 times). \n\n   * Using his Q on an enemy with this debuff will consume the stacks to make it deal X% extra damage per stack (perhaps it could pierce 15% armor per stack as well).\n\n***AS would still lower the CD on his Q***\n\n***Yas does not generate stacks on his Q anymore***\n\n***W:*** This can stay the same, but it needs to spawn ***in FRONT of Yas, not inside of him***. Just change the animation slightly and make him slash the ground in front of him or slash upwards and make a wall of wind.\n\n* But if you're feeling nice, have it break after blocking an ultimate ability (still blocks the ability).\n\n***E:*** This one needs some changes:\n\n***First, make it a skillshot instead of targeted.***\n\n* So Yas dashes in a straight line (speed and distance scaling with MS maybe), autoing everything he passes through (these autos can crit) \n\n   * 100% AA damage for first target struck, 80% for second, 50% for everything else \n\n   *If a champion is the first target struck, they gain two stacks of his auto passive thing. \n\n* Give it a limited number of charges, maybe 2-3, that recharges based on AS.\n\n* Now has a ~3s CD.\n\n***R:*** So, Yas's R is bullshit as it is currently. So let's give it more counterplay (which you supposedly like) and give Yas some clear windows of power where he's scary and feels good about what he's doing:\n\n* New passive: When Yas lands a Q on a target with 3 stacks of his auto passive, his ult activates (one cast per 3 stack Q, does not stack).\n\n* Yas's ult is now a two-part. First part, he dashes (not a blink) incredibly fast in a direction (after a slight delay, maybe 0.2ish seconds, the whole sheathe grab thing you know?). If he hits a champion, he throws them into the air, and deals a small amount of damage. If a champion is thrown into the air, he leaps up after them, does his thing he does now, and slams them into the ground. \n\n   * After casting, every auto (and first hit of E) for the next ~5s will apply three stacks of his auto passive at once.\n\n***Has a 10s CD (on both activation and second cast) per target, but otherwise has no cooldown***\n\n---\n\nNow, I'm not a professional game designer, and that could very well be broken, but it preserves Yas's identity as a fast skirmisher (while enhancing the samurai feel) that relies on a lot of button mashing, combos and twitchy fingers, preserves his teamfight power (but now it's on him rather than his team stacking knockups), but adds meaningful windows of power to his kit, allows people other than himself to counterplay him, and in my opinion would make for some very high points in his gameplay that feel good, rather than just the one and done ult we have now.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2017-10-02T00:53:02.552+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, basically you\n\nA.

The issue is whether or not that work is the most important work they could be doing.\n\nAny time Riot comments on why they haven't addressed some issue, this is the response. They are working on things that are higher priority. They have a limited workforce, and it would cause other problems to expand that too quickly.\n\nTL;DR they haven't forgotten. Just be patient while they work through their priorities list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shiznyte","date":"2017-09-29T16:12:59.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good Yasuo player is a very frustrating thing to deal with... He has A lot good Early game pressure, once he gets a few items under his Belt he becomes a huge power house, and farming is easy when you can force most people out of lane. getting 100% crit from 1 item and a component makes him do quite a bit of damage early on, his Focus shield is extremely effective especially if he build Def stats. The current {{item:3046}}{{item:1018}}  {{item:3022}} {{item:3047}} (and two more defensive items of your choosing) is a very strong build on Yasuo Lot's of damage from crits and plenty of survivability from items and hit Kit. Sure he has the same weakness as every other hero in the game if you want to say it is {{summoner:3}} or hard CC but good yasuo's will run {{summoner:1}} maybe pick up a QSS and windwall stops a surprising amount of Hard CC. He has plenty of out play potential, yes he is a sort of hard champion to play, but maybe not as hard as people think. Having no mana and Short CD's makes for a pretty simple play style once you learn his skill ranges. This champion is a very touchy subject for a lot of people because if people think you are saying anything negative they take it as a personal attack. If he's too strong hes always banned because people know hes too strong I think where he is right now is fine because he is very playable champion if you put your time in, and he isn't banned 70% of the time like he is when he is overtuned.","replies":[{"poster":"RooneR","date":"2017-09-30T09:37:36.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shiznyte,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hEQoWcps,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2017-09-29T16:12:59.949+0000)\n>\n> A good Yasuo player is a very frustrating thing to deal with...
