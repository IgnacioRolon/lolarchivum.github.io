{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-10-08T02:21:24.178+0000","title":"Don't pick an AD champion against Veigar just because his ult does damage based on your AP","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"Many people see his ult doing damage based on the enemy&#039;s AP and then think: &quot;Veigar is hard countered by AD champions&quot;\r\n\r\nThen they instalock {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}}  - I would mention {{champion:126}} too, but he is rarely picked and those who pick him generally are good with him. Same for {{champion:110}} \r\n\r\nOf course, if you are good with Yasuo/Zed/Talon, and your team needs an AD assassin that can deal not only with Veigar, but also with the rest of their team, then go ahead and pick them.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that many times those people don&#039;t know how to properly play those AD champions and end up feeding. And even when they know how to play those AD champions, sometimes they are not a good choice for the team. Either because they fall off late game, or because the team needs an AP champion so that the enemy tank does not have an easy time itemizing against our team.\r\n\r\nAlso, Veigar usually ends up one-shotting anyone late game no matter if they are AD or AP. The only champions that he can&#039;t one shot are AD bruisers and tanks, and that&#039;s because they have the HP and magic resistance needed to survive Veigar&#039;s combo.\r\n\r\nPro tip: Veigar isn&#039;t necessarily countered by AD champions. You can also counter him with AP champions that can outrange him. Examples include {{champion:99}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:96}}. There is also {{champion:105}} which despite being AP, can counter Veigar because he can become untargetable with his Playful/Trickster and avoid Veigar&#039;s ult. You can also build AD Fizz and thus counter Veigar even more, but be wary if that&#039;s what your team needs. I&#039;ve also had success countering Veigar with {{champion:8}} because he can use the Sanguine Pool to avoid Veigar&#039;s ult and has enough HP to survive the rest of his burst.\r\n\r\nAlso, every AP champion can buy a {{item:3157}}. This item can counter Veigar because you can activate it at the moment that Veigar&#039;s ult is about to hit you. And because you become untargetable, you become immune to his ult, which will go into full cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2015-10-08T02:51:40.703+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"This kind of reminds me of when Kassadin was near 100% pick ban.

He's safer in lane and is more reliable as a pick.\n\nI'm not saying Talon doesn't scale like a madman, I'm just saying he lacks many of the tools of other mid laners to reach that point.
