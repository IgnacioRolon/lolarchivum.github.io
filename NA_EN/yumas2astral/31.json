Adding more AP to it means that it will just encourage more burst heavy AP champions from purchasing it. Meaning that we will be back to when Rylai had 100 AP and it was purchased by every mage (save a few specific mages which already had CC everywhere on their kit).\n\nThis item should be like Frozen Mallet. You purchase it when you want to have a little bit of soft CC and tankyness, but you sacrifice damage potential by doing this instead of purchasing things like Titanic Hydra.\n\nTo do this, something they could do is to reduce the AP to 45 or 50, increase the HP to 500 or 600 (maybe 700) and then revert the slow to what it used to be back when it had 100 AP and 400 HP. Then change its recipe to a {{item:1026}} + a {{item:1011}}. Maybe slighty increase the cost.\n\nThis way, this would be a better item for champions like {{champion:27}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:8}} and peharps {{champion:30}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:50}} - They would love the stronger slow and extra HP, and wouldn&#039;t mind the loss of AP too much, especially since their kits have a lot of natural damage already. (especially Vlad which can convert the extra HP into AP) The extra tankiness would help them last more and deal more damage to begin with.\n\nOn other hand, champions like {{champion:1}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:134}} would need to think twice before purchasing this item, since doing so would mean they would do less damage, and those champions generally want to do as much damage as possible in a short time. Whereas they abused old Rylai because it was one of the few big AP items back then. The slow was just the icing on the cake. Some of them could buy this to have an easier time landing their CC, but that would be a loss in damage potential (something that wasn't true with old Rylai due to it having 100 AP)","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2018-04-27T01:06:00.769+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":28,"body":"Rylai should be removed because a passive permaslow is literally one of the worst fucking things you could put on buyable items","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-04-27T01:49:27.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"Says a Garen who can literally escape any on kit slows/cc, and also mow down  in the process.

He probably doesn't need Rylai's to beat Garen.\n\nCass does much higher damage than Garen, has a higher speed boost, a stun (you seem to have forgotten she has that, do you actually play this game?), and once more can actually sustain in combat. She also has a shield to tank a lot of his damage with Seraph's. She kites him and kills him if she's good. Your inflated opinion of Garen vs. Cass is likely due to Cass requiring more skill than you can muster to play, and Garen being pretty brainless so your opponent can get the most out of him.\n\n> Same with Ryze.

Still won't make him take less than 10 seconds to kill without silences.  But hey maybe they can get really really ahead and burst him down quickly after the silence right?  Well, minus the 1600 true damage ult that you have to pay for due to getting really really ahead.  But yeah after that you're fine.\n\nThough honestly, I won't blame Garen for most of this.  Every character is supposed to be hard to deal with in some way or they won't have a reason to exist.  In Garen's case he needs damage to be viable, since otherwise he'd just be a Silencebot 3000 with built-in execute function.  The real problem is that he's so damn hard to kill even if you _aren't_ silenced, just because of his inherent tankiness independent of items.  You don't normally see that on a character.  Items make the tank.  But in Garen's case he's got it naturally, so he gets away with this new fad of just building like an assassin then facerolling everything with no real counterplay aside from just hoping you survive; heaven forbid you actually be able to kill the assassin-built bastard for your troubles.","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2018-04-27T06:34:49.727+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leverette,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ufokg4YY,comment-id=000400010001000000000001,timestamp=2018-04-27T06:18:13.919+0000)\n>\n> Yeah let them get right on that against a man with a 3s silence\n\nI stopped reading tbh.

There were like 5 ADCs that added me after the game and asked me to duo with them, which rarely happens.

You consider me a bad player for not being able to play complex champions, even when you don't know that, while I consider you stupid for failing to understand how the game works, because if you did, you wouldn't have such a bad winrate.\n\nHonestly, since you are having a worse win rate than me, it can only mean 2 things: you are weaker in the places where I'm stronger (macro, knowledge etc), and the places you are probably stronger than me (micro mechanics) are not as good either to get you a positive win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-04-28T15:03:30.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just don't read.\n\nAt Plat V you should both have macro and micro play.\n\nIf you can't go higher with more technical champions, that screams a lack of progression in ability to play.\n\nI actually think adc is the hardest role in the game next to jungler right now (because jungler has a a serious deficit of wards right now, and with the removal of trackers, and the 10 minute mark on Support wards).\n\nAdc generally is the one role which has trouble last hitting every minion and making the lane presence count. It also has to play at a prone distance which makes it vulnerable to poke, and most don't have escape mechanisms that are that strong. It's also the one role in the game where a bad performance literally cripples you for the rest of the game, because not only are you behind in CS, you're also behind in levels.\n\nNot only that, Junglers have the most problems accessing bot lane for ganks, because bot's map design really limits the entrance paths, and good laners respond easily.\n\nLearning to Orb correctly, and responsibly auto attack a champion is one of the hardest things to learn in league, and adc is the only role that relies almost exclusively on that ability, and holds the most risk in it.\n\nTristana is much harder to use correctly than most adcs. Her technical level imo is higher than {{champion:51}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:29}} (pretty much all adcs), because she needs to maintain her Rocket jump and keep it off cooldown or she's toast. She might be a reset mechanic queen, but that doesn't mean doing it right comes easy. (I Specialize in tearing Tristana apart)\n\nCaitlyn is very hard to carry with. I don't know why you think she's doing okay. Although her mechanics are fairly simple, she's in the wrong meta. She might be able to defensively control her lane, but out of lane she's a complete ..... target. Too many champs can kill her before she 4th bullet's, and avoid her Net. They can also abuse the small delay on trap activation. If someone's doing well with her, they're far more mechanically and macro skilled than a Janna.\n\nZed is extremely hard to learn mechanically. Although he can go 13/8 in the hands of someone whose completely unskilled vs people of same level, a true Zed player goes 15/1, and gives up far less takedown gold, and has more of a push presence because they have less time dead. Getting 3 shadows on one target Q takes talent, because of the configuration of what skill order you have to play, and unlike most champs, you really need to be aware of Stasis. A good Zed can kill someone from 1700 range. A bad Zed can only kill people from about 800. That exponentially increases the rate of presence and what you can do. Good Zeds also get in 2-3 more auto attacks per skirmish.\n\nI consider you a bad player because your scores on Janna are lackluster, and show a deficiency in complex champs in general. That tells me a story. It means your macro game is something you struggle at (not saying you don't have it), and to use it, you have to huddle yourself in a niche of a relatively afk champ to be able to look at maps and predict movements. If you had a 60% kill participation rate on {{champion:14}} or {{champion:92}} , that'd probably indicate to me that you have solid macro play while also playing relatively complex champs. (these 2 aren't hard to learn combat on, but they are hard to master)\n\nIf you had 60% Participation on those champs, it'd tell me a few things:\n\n1) You can manage to be in team fights while also being an effective farmer. (You're worthless as a kill participation if you don't farm)\n2) You roam at the correct times, predicting when a team fight is going to happen, rather then reacting to it after it's begun. (You lose kill participation if you show up late)\n3) You are thrifty at skill use (no other player barriers/move speed buffs to automatically give you assists, even if you're not doing much, so 60% kill participation means much more on those champs than on a Janna).\n\nEven Nami and Sona have a harder time getting 60% kill participation than Janna, because their abilities have to be cast to get assists. Janna is the only champ in the game that gains assists just for existing.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-04-28T16:43:00.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me clarify my Janna play. I crush lane most of the time, because I know how to take advantage of her AA - W range and poke the enemy ADC and Support out of lane, thus creating big pressure. Maxing W works wonders. It might be easy to do, but you won't see other Jannas in Plat max W. They all max E and afk. Since I'm responsible for creating a lead bot (my ADC usually afk farms), we take first tower and rotate to top side and follow the basic winning strategy of this meta. And it works really well. Sometimes, in order to force my team to pressure something that is worth (like pushing a minion wave to secure an easy tower, when they won't), means that I will put myself in a dangerous position to apply said plan. Sometimes, it leads to my death, but the setup is good and my team still gets a big advantage out of it. If this ruins my KDA, but increases my team's advantage, then I will do it 100%. Also, there are games where we are losing hard, because some top laner goes 0/5 in 10 minutes. At that point, I know if I play my regular style, we will just lose, so I need to make a risky play to try and get an advantage. Sometimes, it won't work and I will die for it. I could honestly just stay under tower and deny my tower falling down, while I watch other lane towers fall to preserve my KDA. Since I value my win rate more, I'd rather take a risk. That's to clarify how I play Janna and why I don't have 2 death avg. I wish I could send some replays. Also, as a sidenote, I deny most Lee-Q-esque dashes with my tornado and me general timings on Q and R are good, so her only mechanical parts of her kit are applied in really good success rate.\n\nNow, moving on, I do agree that ADC is the hardest role in the game, because you have so limited options as to what you can do with your kit, yet so much is expected out of you, therefore getting good at those mechanics is more than important. You can't be a good ADC for example, if you can't kite properly, but you can be a good mid laner, even if you can't aim your abilities 100% of the time.\n\nCaitlyn is one of the hardest ADCs. Not as much mechanically, like Kalista or Draven or Ezreal, but because she has a very clear way to playing out her kit, that if you mess up and not gain the advantages you can get, you are screwed. If you don't get a lane lead and first tower as Cait, you either fucked up somewhere, or you just got hardcamped by the jungler. If you don't do that, then you are almost useless up until much later. The way that Cait gets this advantage is very simple, but also requires a lot of practice to pull off properly. Playing around your traps and your AA range sure seems simple, but it's not as simple. If you're unable to constantly abuse your extra AA range and zone people off with traps and chip down the towers, then you are doing it wrong.\n\nTristana is on the easier side. She has a good escape tool, which you should know when and where to use, which is the case with most champions with a dash. Her only real unique mechanic skill is being able to proc the bomb for a jump reset, which isn't really that hard.\n\nSivir is honestly one the hardest side of the ADCs, if you ask me. Lowest range + no repositioning spells means that you have to be very careful. Knowing when to use your spell shield + perfecting the W AA reset + being able to use the MS boosts to kite properly takes a lot of practice, and since she generally doesn't build a lot of attack speed, you need to orbwalk much better. Kiting as Sivir is harder since you are forced to do it more often (low AA range) as opposed to a Jinx who can just sit there and fire off autos. Sivir is much harder to maximize your DPS than most carries. The only other champions that are hard to maximize damage output are Ezreal and Draven , for different reasons, which is why you don't see good Dravens or Ezreals up until much higher elo.\n\nMy KDAs as Sivir might not be as good, because 1) I played some games with her to practice after a long time, so I didn't perform as well and 2) same with Janna, sometimes I must do the risky play, so I die more often. I could preserve my KDAs.\n\nAlso, generally, I find it harder to keep good KDAs on ADCs and supports. Seeing how you rely so much on your other ally laner, they can break your laning phase and make you look like a monkey. You can see how I had much better KDAs in last season for example with Maokai and the season before that with Viktor.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"USG Failsawce","date":"2018-04-27T14:16:33.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Azadethe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ufokg4YY,comment-id=0004000100010000,timestamp=2018-04-27T04:03:50.256+0000)\n>\n> lulz.

Malzahar can get up to two procs of aery, but the damage of aery drops off a lot in the mid to late game.  Comet is unreliable until you get rylai which is a third item.
