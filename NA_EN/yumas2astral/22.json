Between Lee Sin and Gragas, many champions no longer have ways to slow enemies attack speed. Some of those removals were actually necessary, such as in case of Lee Sin, and recently, Darius (since he would be even more obnoxious if he could still slow enemy attack speed). However, we currently have very few ways to slow enemy&#039;s attack speed. The few champions who still have attack speed debuffs are {{champion:75}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:54}} but none of them are currently popular. The only items with attack speed slow that we have were both nerfed and do not see nearly as much play as they used to: {{item:3143}} {{item:3110}} Randuin&#039;s Omen, for example, due to its nerfs, is currently seeing much less play, and people are using {{item:3742}} instead of it because it has higher effective HP against physical damage, but this item does not slow the enemy&#039;s attack speed.\r\n\r\nIt seems like Riot is trying to get rid of every attack speed debuff. I don&#039;t know their reasons for doing that, but attack speed slows are currently very useful, especially in a meta where many of the most popular champions rely on attack speed, examples including {{champion:67}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:157}} - In addition, I doubt how attack speed debuffs would be toxic when despite being crippling for some champions, they are completely useless against others - example including casters like {{champion:45}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-21T18:21:34.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Attack speed Debuffs completely kill off most Marksmen and all devourer users (With Yi as an exception) as well as Yasuo, Tryn, and Irelia. Unlike AS BUFFS, AS DEBUFFS affect the TOTAL amount, not the BASE. This means if you have 100% AS with a base of .6, you attack at 1.2 attacks per second. If you reduce their AS by 50%, you put them base at .6. With FH and Randuin's already doing 15% each, it is a bit silly to tack on abilities and is actually almost useless to tack on abilities since they stack multiplicatively, which means it's 15% off totaling 85%, then 15% of that 85%, which brings you down to 72.25% If you were to stack on anymore like Malph's E at 50%, you'd go down to 36.125%, which is still a hefty amount, but by itself it turns 100% into 50% and two 15% items only take it from 50% to 36%. \n\nIt's just a bit asinine to add more AS slows, really. If they added more, we'd all be using nothing but Assassins or Jayce and Varus as our physical damage since Marksmen wouldn't be able to AA fast enough and the others don't rely on AA's, but would have the same pushing power (Not as much as Trist, but still.).","replies":[]},{"poster":"kombu","date":"2015-10-21T13:45:26.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue that malphite is at least moderately popular","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-10-21T16:04:53.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because that would be bad for the adc overlords","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jukuren Rorikon","date":"2015-10-21T13:26:35.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played as aatrox vs Maphite yesterday.

Then again, his E alone can bring you down to .5 from 1.0. It's insane, which is why they removed it from a lot of champions who aren't all that tanky. Gragas and Lee were already murdering ADC's and APC's with just their damage. To be able to murder your APC and make your ADC useless at the exact same time is a bit too scary given the fact they could get a Thornmail and make the ADC commit suicide, literally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gorgannan","date":"2015-10-21T17:43:42.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malph is actually quite popular.\n\nAnyway, about the OP. If you look at it, every bruiser that had an AS slow has had a history of being toxic. It works on Malphite, as he's a tank, Nunu too, but Darius and Lee were unbeatable by most melees. TBH, I think Nasus should only slow MS. He's not a bad champ, just very out of meta, but the AS slow on him means you can't escape, you can't fight, and he drains % hp when you're around him. \n\nThey wanted to make any AS's accessable to everyone, so a Randuins FH Lee wouldn't make your ADC have .7 AS.","replies":[]}]}
