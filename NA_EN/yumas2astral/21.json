Everyone wants to be the carry themselves, especially at lower elos where you can&#039;t rely on your team at all to win games. That&#039;s why people tend to pick full AD top laners ({{champion:41}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:114}}), mid lane assassins ({{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:55}}) and damage-oriented junglers ({{champion:64}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:107}})\r\n\r\nEven when people pick champions that are tanky, those champions tend to be bruisers who are still damage oriented and are lacking in utility, peeling potential, and/or teamfighting presence. Also, many of those champions have balancing issues, and people tend to be attracted by &quot;broken&quot; champions. Examples: top ({{champion:86}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:2}}) and jungle ({{champion:106}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:60}})\r\n\r\nGenerally people only pick champions who are true tanks when those champions are broken, examples including {{champion:223}}, and {{champion:113}} at the time that she wasn&#039;t nerfed. I am not saying that people don&#039;t use tanks, it is just that most of time they want to carry and thus they pick champions who have the most potential to carry by themselves. The problem is that by doing that, they are left with a team that has lots of assassins and damage oriented bruisers. But they are lacking on utility and teamfighting potential, can&#039;t initiate teamfights, and are very squishy.\r\n\r\nAnd due to that, people who go support are forced to pick tanks to compensate. People generally don&#039;t care about what the support want to do and thus they leave the &quot;dirty work&quot; of tanking and initiating for the supports.\r\n\r\nThis may partially explain why tank supports are so popular. If people were less selfish and thougth more on their team and less about just themselves, and picked top/mid/junglers with more utility and/or tanking potential, I am very sure that this would allow the supports to pick squishier options.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that this is the entire reason why tank supports are dominating. Of course there are other problems; for example, AP supports are lacking on good itemization, and tank supports can usually survive for more time to use their utility. Also, I am not saying that a support can&#039;t carry on low elo; but lets be honest, it is a lot harder to carry when you are on a position where you are forced not to farm and you are forced to focus on utility/tankyness instead of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"BÃ¢rd","date":"2015-10-12T06:35:17.520+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason people pick tank supports is that they are efficient.\n\nThink about it this way.\n\nSupports are generally champions who have lots of utility in each of their spells, so it stands to reason that you want to use those spells as many times as possible in a teamfight.\n\nThere are two ways of doing this, CDR to increase the frequency, and tank stats to increase how long you can fight.\n\nSo it stands to reason that supports who benefit from a tanky build with CDR would be more effective.\n\nThis is one reason {{champion:16}} , who deals % HP true damage to herself, and {{champion:37}} who needs an AP build to be useful, are seen much less often than {{champion:111}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:201}}, whose spells are all packed with utility, allowing them to build full tank.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-10-12T07:01:31.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The True Bard,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rjbGPTlE,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-10-12T06:35:17.520+0000)\n>\n> The reason people pick tank supports is that they are efficient.\n> \n> Think about it this way.\n> \n> Supports are generally champions who have lots of utility in each of their spells, so it stands to reason that you want to use those spells as many times as possible in a teamfight.\n> \n> There are two ways of doing this, CDR to increase the frequency, and tank stats to increase how long you can fight.\n> \n> So it stands to reason that supports who benefit from a tanky build with CDR would be more effective.\n> \n> This is one reason {{champion:16}} , who deals % HP true damage to herself, and {{champion:37}} who needs an AP build to be useful, are seen much less often than {{champion:111}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:201}}, whose spells are all packed with utility, allowing them to build full tank.\n\nSoraka doesn't deal true damage to herself.

And he's squishy in lane (doesn't become decently tanky until he builds several major items that aren't sightstone and boots).\n\nIf I thought it was really necessary to nerf him again, I'd probably increase his mana costs.  I hardly ever feel mana constrained on him (although I do build coin because I don't like to spend Flay passive on last hitting, so that may be some of it).\n\nThe support item changes were also an indirect nerf to Thresh, because he's uniquely (for engage supports) bad at using the tank item.  He's ok with coin, but not compared to the benefit the actual tank supports get from relic (which, honestly, may be a big part of the answer to this thread; coin is weak early, frost queen is weak late, but all stages of the relic shield line are pretty damn strong if you have the kit to use them and benefit from the stats they give).","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-10-12T21:07:40.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Tell me, how do you nerf a Thresh,\n\nInto the ground is a good place to start.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AzureInTheDark","date":"2015-10-12T23:46:29.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unrelated, but.\n\nKATTOBINGU NO ORE!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-10-12T19:39:19.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what about the pros?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShaftyMegee","date":"2015-10-12T18:30:23.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main support, I don't like being the damage dealer (though I can if I want).

But if you expect your support (with support level gold)  to be the teams tank, Your going to have a bad time. \n\nTanks support have to become more ability reliant to actually soak up damage. But not many tank supports have that. Thresh, Blitz, may be good at pick potential. But they don't really have the ability to soak damage. (I prefer to refer to these as fighter supports)\n\nThe one good tank Support is Alistar, Because his ult gives him 70% damage reduction. which pretty much can't be countered. Braum can Directionally reduce the damage he can take. Maybe Leona with her Eclipse, but I think that has less up time than braum shield.\n\nI think what the team really needs is engage, which you don't have to be a tank support to do. Annie is a popular support pick in the LCS. And she isn't a tank. You can also get some Engage from certain top laners like Lissandra or Kennin, Neither of whom are tanks. \n\nBut I think the real problem with Favoritism for tank supports (over poke supports) is that Poke supports can't do enough damage to tank supports, without them becoming oppressive against the ADC in the laning phase. (ADC's will have less effective health than the supports because they buy fewer pots) It's also possible that Relic shield offers too much sustain than a Tank support should have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2015-10-12T09:18:37.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will say about jungling - picking a tank jungle in solo queue is really risky a lot of the time.
