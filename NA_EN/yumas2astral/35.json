He also had way more ways to express skillful play than pressing W and praying. \n\nThe Kog rework was unnecessary and actually killed diversity in both builds and playstyles.  Even my Nashor's build for AP Mid Kog is actually WEAKER than before and it wasn't that amazing to begin with. There is no upside to him anymore. I've talked to other Kog players and most of them would prefer the whole thing be reverted but I doubt Riot is willing to admit a mistake and do something like that.

We'll probably do a balance hotfix early next week to get some quick changes in halfway between 5.22 and 5.23. Odds are very high there'll be some Graves nerfs and some Kog'maw buffs in that.\n\nAnd how about an hotfix in Darius he is so weak!!! I cannot even do damage to Vayne when she's top !!! pretty sad actually","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgnosticTwitch","date":"2015-11-13T20:34:05.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you just say Kog'maw BUFFS?!?!?!\n\nThe new Kog'maw is the most over-powered change Riot has ever done to this game.  I know multiple people who have expressed that they're considering quitting the game after seeing the new Kog in action.  One friend said \"if this is they're idea of balanced, I'm just done with this game\".\n\nAfter spending years of getting things to a point where they're much more balanced, and sacrificing some champion build diversity to make it happen, are you now pushing back to the point where a champion and snowball to complete dominance?  All the changes combined it really feels like that's the direction things are going in.  Most of my gamer friends quit the game in early season 2 because because of how much certain champions could snowball to the point it wasn't remotely fun to play against.\n\nFrom what I've seen from this update, and they way it was discussed on your Youtube videos, it seriously feels like you're actually trying to re-add the elements to the game that you previously balanced out of the game because they are just not fun to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-11-13T01:25:53.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played a few games that had a Kog'Maw and it seems to me that he is strong as an AP champion, pretty much destroys his lane opponent.

It's not jus that he has a different style (one which is imo less rewarding and interesting), he is completely unviable vs competent mids. With no base damage on W, worse AP scaling and a mana cost, you have no trade options and even more difficulty farming than before. \n\nMoreover, if you survive laning phase, you are no longer rewarded with a good late game (and games rarely get there anyway). He has a lot less burst than before, less poke and just less damage in general. Even the Nashor's builds feel like they do very little full build. The AS boost doesn't matter in most practical scenarios because your enemies won't be standing still for you and you would also have to be very close to use it (often exposing yourself to dive/bust spells). However, unlike an ADC, you don't have lifesteal or crit. etc. It just doesn't work mid AP atm and we were promised it would be as strong as before. Instead, my favorite champion was essentially deleted.\n\nKog already had a unique identity and an interesting kit with very different playstyles for mid compared to ADC. This is actually what was so cool about him. Now, he is stuck in only one lane and with only one playstyle. Worst of all, this playstyle is incredibly boring and unrewarding. Oh... I press W and now attack really fast hitting like a wet noodle but I can't kite or do anything skillful. How are any of these changes an improvement? I simply don't get it. My favorite champion was just drastically changed for no reason and with no community discussion. Not only can I no longer play my favorite style with him, I can't even go mid (AD mid wasn't viable either). \n\n","replies":[]}]}]}
