Jungler goes with Yi, top laner goes with Kayle (with {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:7}} as summoner spells and Windspeaker&#039;s Blessing as a keystone). Yi jungles as normal, Kayle farms top until she buys an {{item:3504}}. She is free to play passive because this item is very cheap and she doesn&#039;t need a lot of farm to buy it. After Yi gets one item, Kayle and Yi proceed to push top and take out all towers. Yi can dive the enemy freely because of Kayle&#039;s ult and heal. Kayle proceeds to buy support items like {{item:3109}} and just protects Yi all game. It gets worse if they have another enchanter support like {{champion:117}} or {{champion:25}} because then it is literally impossible to stop Yi.\r\n\r\nI admit I don&#039;t know how to counter this. Some say I should need to tell my jungler to camp bot and/or mid and snowball those lanes. The problem is that not everytime my team has the coordination to do that. And I admit I don&#039;t know how to stop it on my own. Can someone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-06-30T13:51:59.143+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":15,"body":"wait until Riot finally realizes that Kayle has been busted af for seasons.","replies":[{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-06-30T17:48:01.109+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":22,"body":"Wut I think Kayle is absolute trash of a champion.

This is my \"Name\" account, with Name / Tag / etc. (Kind of like Shakarez / Kayle bot) (I also happen to be unofficial head mod on the reddit / discord owner)\n\nKayle is one of the few \"problem\" champions in this game. Not in the sense that she's \"broken,\" but in her versatility and numbers. Her kit doesn't interact in a way that can actually \"outplay\" other champions, but functions as a mid game monster with the strengths and weaknesses of both Mages and Marksmen. She's a champion with a lot of weaknesses, and she's balanced around her one tricks. Kayle, Like aurelion sol, has a very wide difference between newer players and experienced players. \n\nNow, when talking about her balance Kayle isn't a champion that riot directly nerfs. Kayle is a champion that exists around Mage / Marksman / and Supportive itemization. When an item under this list is disproportionately too strong, Kayle takes the item and turns it on it's head and amplifies the reach of said item. Basically, in the support role enchanters are extremely strong right now because of their items. If you're going to take this strategy down, It's not Kayle that needs to get hit (because they'll have to buff something on her) but items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Spongeboob","date":"2017-07-01T14:07:43.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.
