That after the nerf i dont feel like i can hang in the game anymore. He is not doing enought damage to be felt. I have playd him sinse he came out and is really looking for a new champion to play now because Aurelion is really not worth playing anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"N00B PWN3R","date":"2016-03-30T07:25:38.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Aurelion Sol is a toxic stunlocking champion, such champions are unhealthy for a game like league.

The problem I have is, that his stun actually lasts longer than Annie's, whom most people complain as the \"worst to play against\" stun. 2 seconds is a long time in this game, especially with the high amount of burst damage available to multiple champions. Stuns in this game feel like guaranteed kills, no team comp should be without one.","replies":[]}]}]}
