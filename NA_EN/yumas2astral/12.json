Regardless of the fact that shen lacks the initiation tools of a more powerful tank like Maokai or Sion, he makes up for that in Global pressure. Yet this is disturbing because YoloQ doesn't always make the best use of objective based skills, or global skills. \n\nPersonally, I will look to the LCS for inspiration on what champions I should master. But I attempt to unravel the champion and figure out WHY he's a good pick. I don't pick up champions without testing them first, and I don't assume that an LCS pick is Freelo.\n\nAlso, I actually Tried Shen Support long before he was played in the LCS. He has a kit that seems to work decent in a duo lane, and he may be only support with a global. Though the main reason I tried him was I wanted a support who did not rely on Mana.
