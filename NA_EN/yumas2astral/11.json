I'm perfectly able to do so after playing against people with multiple tiers. I have played against Plat and Diamond friends, one of them Riven mains, and I can consistently beat them. The damage calculations favors a cautious yet aggressive Vlad. Riven straight up loses against a Vlad who takes pool at lvl2 and another point in Q at lvl3. She can't do anything that Vlad can't do right back to her, and he can heal it up easily while she cannot.\n\nAnd against Irelia, she does have enough sustain to engage on me at full health. However, the constant poke and harrass will leave her with little to no healing consumables left. If she started flask, she started with no combat power while I started with Amp.

DId I say my Q chunked them for half HP? That's literally impossible, even against a Sona. I said that when they reach lvl2 they're close to half HP. Let's says it takes 35 secs for them to get to lvl2. My Q deals, after resistances, 82.5 damage. 1-2 Autos for every Q, like I tend to do, after armor, contributes with 30-60 damage. If I Q every 10 seconds (realistically it's like 12) and give at least 1 auto after that, it's 377 damage. \"About\" half HP. Irelia will have to consume at least 2 pots and 1 flask charge to get her full health back. Riven will have to get shield at lvl1 not to get to half HP. Plus, even if they play smart I still successfully zoned them during the time they need to create an advantage.\n\n\nAnd if you need to use your pool more with more than 26 seconds then you're the one who has a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-06-21T21:52:15.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Vlad main I must say: The only champion that gives serious problems to me is Riven, she can all-in me and there is nothing I can do against that.

You think you can get away with saying that **** to me over the Internet? Think again, f***er.\n \nAs we speak I am contacting my secret network of Diamond 1 overlords across the World and your Summoner Name is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, bronzie. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your Summoner. You’re f***ing dead, bronzie. I can be anywhere on the map, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with Tryndamere.\n \nNot only am I extensively trained in Top lane, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Shop Keeper and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable bronze face off the continent, you little low elo sh*t.\n \nIf only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” backtalk was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your f***ing tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you filthy low elo trash. I will **** fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re f***ing dead, non diamond scum.\n \nYou should try wearing diapers. I used to have accidents when I was growing up too. It used to really stress me out. Finally I bought myself a pack of diapers and started wearing them whenever I may not have immediate access to toilets. I felt so much better not have that worry hanging over me. Now I wear them pretty regularly. You should try it.\n \nWhy are bronzies/silver trash/gold trash/plat trash such perpetual posters about balance when in fact, they know nothing about the core design of this game. If you are bronze, it evidently means you are inferior than \"humans\" who are diamond; thus, I can safely conclude your logic presented on balance topics is below the threshold of what even a 5 year old can post. It also holds no base to support a thoughtful intelligent conversation amid us diamond players. Thus, we just ignore and dislike your post and move on. Please don't post garbage created in your incapable brain because it only makes society dumber and moves us back a 100 years in development. I also hate the fact that bronzies think they know balance that their post often show much vanity than proper information about the game.\n \nLow elos should learn to stop back talking diamond 1s or higher. If someone from bronze has an opinion that differs from a diamond 1's, the bronzie should NOT try to reason with the high elo. He shouldn't ask why either. He should take what the diamond says as fact without talking back. Too many times, I've seen a bronzie backtalk a diamond 1, and it's disgusting, because the bronzie is wrong most of the time. The only time a bronzie is right is when 500,000 bronzies are talking back to a single diamond 1. There's a reason why you're stuck in bronze. It's because you think differently than the diamonds. Start thinking like a diamond.\n \nAmerica's place as the foremost world power is at jeopardy. Not because of middle eastern conflicts or China's economic awakening but because it does nothing to curb the tide of bronziocracy. American bronzies are given suffrage and even legal and reproductive rights despite having proved their inferior mental and moral status. In countries like Korea where being the worst at something is shameful people give their all to better themselves. However American culture celebrates mediocrity and encourages bronzies to merely stop playing the game when their self esteem might be tarnished by their inferior performances. Instead of sharpening their minds and, even more importantly, teaching themselves to overcome their inherent genetic disadvantages through hard work, American bronzies transition to smoking cannabis and having unprotected ***. They diminish their mental abilities even further while creating the next generation of bronzies. The only way to curb America's economic decline is the mandatory sterilization of all bronzies. While it would be inhumane to simply eradicate the bronzies America is already saddled with, their negative economic impact can be curbed by leveraging them as farm animals and mannequins.","replies":[{"poster":"Provengreil","date":"2015-06-22T14:30:33.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we just let this copypasta die already?

Not just on Vlad, but many champions that are going to benefit heavily from  the AP item changes. \n\nFor Vlad though, I'm not sure what the best option would be. Should they emphasize his healing ability but cut his damage? Should they reduce his ability to heal as effectively and keep his damage? Or should they do something regarding CD's and base stats to keep him down in earlier parts of the game? Thematically I love Vlad, a \"blood mage\" who sucks the juice out of his opponents and hits them in the face with it. But his damage combined with his healing ability makes him extremely annoying and strong. I love that Vlad can build HP and AP to compliment each other, it's one of my favorite gimmicks in league: {{champion:27}} {{champion:3}} and {{champion:13}} have similar \"fun\" builds that incorporate different scaling mechanics (less so with Ryze now). \n\nWhat I really want Riot to emphasize when they nerf or rework Vlad is to make his build much more... intelligent. Right now, Vlad pretty much goes for high AP builds, and why shouldn't he? He gets a lot of HP for the AP he gets. At 600AP he gets about 850 health if he opts for an HP item as his last item he can have a good chunk of health to work through while he is also dishing out high DPS. \n\nI remember my first Vlad game ever. Back in the Season 4 preseason/Season 3 postseason. It was an ARAM and he was free that week, so I was going to try him out. I was pretty new at the game and didn't know what I was doing for the most part but I decided to just build against my opponents the best way I knew how. My final build probably looked something like this: {{item:3152}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} . It was a really long match that we were losing for the large portion of the game, but we made a comeback near the lategame as I became nearly unkillable and it allowed me to deal a lot of damage in teamfights. I likely had about 350AP and 3500 health at the end of the game. But what I found is that if teamfights were very extended, my team would come out on top because of my R damage amp (which is INSANITY; teamwide DFG?) and my sustain throughout the teamfights; but if the fight was very short it meant that the enemy team had obliterated us and I was a nonfactor. It was a very memorable game as it was probably the first times I had carried a game, but I think I bought Vlad shortly after that. \n\nWhat I want to see out of Vladimir is a way that he can use both aspects of his Passive to boost each other. Right now, the only health items you will see on Vlad is typically a {{item:3065}} or a {{item:3116}} with the rest being full AP items. But I want to go back to what I experienced in my first game as Vladimir. Itemizing primarily against your opponents to make yourself the strongest you possibly can, rather than what it feels like now when the opponent has to itemize AGAINST Vladimir because you need either MR or Grievous Wounds to deal with him as he sustains back whatever you throw at him and he hits like a truck if you have no MR. With the change to WotA in the works, MR is no longer a way to deal with his spell vamp as the healing portion will be at max strength regardless of resistances. \n\nI think now would be the best time for Riot to get Vlad in a healthy spot though. They can afford to have him more of a tank that deals good damage rather than a high dps mage that can take more than a few hits. Think about it this way. If they cut a lot of his damage in his Q and E, he can still use the heal from WotA without needing penetration. So he can grab{{item:3152}} and {{item:3065}} and use his natural sustain built into his kit in addition to the boosted unhindered heals from his WotA to keep him alive through very extended teamfights. He can then build up more tanky items and just become a super tank that can hit back. Taking Rabadon's wouldn't be that bad either as it gives you AP and HP bonus on top of the 120 AP you get from it that supplements both his heals and his damage. Vladimir is a champion who has low AP ratios on his abilities already (really being saved by their low CD's) so either reducing base damages or his AP ratios a little bit more might incentivise a more hybrid buildpath. \n\nThose are my thoughts on the matter.

Drain tanks are typically unbalancable, but I feel like late game Vlad works just fine. His kit's play and counterplay are awful, but the need to be in the middle of a fight to deal damage means that there is a lot of decision making to be had, similar to how melee DPS champions have to weigh those decisions.\n\nIf I were to do a small scale change, I'd do something like Yasuo where his counterplay starts high but scales down with some stat, maybe Q's range scaling with HP or something.
