Obviously that's unlikely to be the case, but it shows that a behind Rengar can suddenly get the rewards for snowballing without even necessarily doing anything.\n\nEven so, it's sort of unfair Rengar is capable of getting all benefits of the hunt without even winning while Kha only gets something if he wins. Kha doesn't even have to be in the game for Rengar to get all the benefits from the event, since 20 stacks is basically equal to winning. Without Rengar in the game, Kha doesn't get 4th evolution. Kinda one sided imo.\n\nI also don't think you can polarize all games in that sense with two such alternatives of \"I'm super fed or were going to win any sec.\" Not every game is like that.\n\nEdit: We may end up going in circles here rather than being productive, so I'm OK with agreeing to disagree if you're cool with that.\n\nOff subject of the hunt, I always felt like the mechanic they use for GP's ult upgrades would be good on Kha'Zix so he could get all evolutions in one game. Maybe have it based on killing enemy champions, since you have a character who is suppose to be consuming his prey and evolving based off of that. Obviously that would make it mirror Rengar's current system, but I think it could be more than it is.","replies":[{"poster":"KhaSam xd","date":"2016-10-19T11:21:53.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No you need 20 stacks of necklace to start the hunt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lewd KaiˇSa","date":"2016-08-15T11:47:42.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you cant go from 0 to 20 stacks instantly because the rengar needs 12 for the hunt to start plus they kha kill/assist would of give him another trophy if he was just any old champion so you would basically be at 13 anyways mean it at max can give you 7 bonus trophies. meanwhile kha gets something he cant get","replies":[{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-08-15T16:54:02.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We discussed that.

The only time I ever get to experience the hunt is when the game goes on for 30-40 min.\n\nI can see the truth in your argument, and where Rengar has slightly an advantage when it comes to the hunt, and I totally agree with you on that, but if you were to compare both champions in without looking at the benefit of the hunt, Kha'Zix beats Rengar at almost every point post-6 ESPECIALLY if he is isolated, which is most of the game.\n\nOther than that fact, I agree with you completely.","replies":[{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-08-14T17:39:00.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah in the 1v1 Kha wins.
