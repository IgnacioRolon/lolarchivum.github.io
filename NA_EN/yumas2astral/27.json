This means he can be very useful as a support, because supports tend to have lower gold income, which will not be a problem for a champion that has high base damages. It also means that he isn&#039;t that amazing as the team&#039;s main AP carry, because he doesn&#039;t scale as well as he should.\r\n\r\nIt also means that, even when behind and/or having few AP items, he can destroy you.\r\n\r\nWhat should Riot do to fix Brand&#039;s problem? The solution is obvious; shift some power from his bases to his scalings. His passive was buffed to 4% of the enemy&#039;s maximum health to compensate for DFT being gone, when what Riot should have done is to increase the AP scaling from the explosion when you manage to hit three stacks with Brand&#039;s abilities. This would reward him more for comboing the enemy, not just for throwing a spell.\r\n\r\nAlso. 35% AP scaling on E? 25% AP scaling on the ult? No wonder why Brand is rarely played mid, he isn&#039;t rewarded enough for building AP and having a higher gold income.\r\n\r\nReducing Brand&#039;s base damage would nerf him as a support, since he would be less useful when behind, which isn&#039;t what you want on a support (a support should be useful even when behind, in contrast to a carry, which should scale well, but you can shut down and prevent him from scaling to begin with). \r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** Brand feels OP currently because he has insane base damage, which allows him to heavily damage you even when you are behind. This also makes him very strong as a support. Brand was intended to go mid, but he isn&#039;t rewarded enough for building AP to allow him to be more than a niche pick in mid.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-07-21T14:29:12.137+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"He isn't played mid for what you said BUT is also needed to say why he went bot in the first place:\n\nHis kit is just not good against so many midlaners that can easily dodge his telegraphed skills while also his ultimate is bad on a pure 1vs1 on top of the mana problems he always had when he was mid. \n\nThen you have botlane that is a 2vs2 lane where he can hit both enemies with his aoes, indeed his ultimate is better on a 2vs2 scenario and he doesn't need to waste his mana on wavecler, just all for poke while also being usually against immobile champs that cant dodge his skills.\n\nSo, I'm sure that just tweaking his bast dmgs and ap scaling will make him a bad support/a worse supp, but I'm also sure that just these changes will never make him a good midlaner.","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2018-07-21T15:21:52.236+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bassicly what saltran said\n\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is Rlyai, Liandry core\n\nThis items dont give to much ability power yet they are so set in stone that unless you give brand W 1.3 W ap Ratio etc or something absurd like that he ll still be best off with liandry and rylai and not really utilizie ap ratios\n\n\nAnd as a compettetive player who peeked challenger. you have no idea how much brand has to get buffed for me to pick him over Syndra or even veigar, or for any serious midlaner for that matter\n\n\nThe only reason Brand survived and has any viability at all is {{item:3310}} \nAnd can we really ask for a spellthief change just so that brand can get compensated buff to hopefully still not be outclassed by many midlaners\nRiot wanted for Brand niche to be his AOE damage.

He is a mid ranged champion with telegraphed skills. All shifting base damage to ratios would accomplish is making him worst at both roles since the instant he falls behind then he is completely useless. He has a ton of mana issues, an ult that is way better against more than one opponent and like I said stupidly telegraphed skills while not being that long ranged of a champion.\n\nLux can do everything from such a longer range than Brand can so she is able to play at a safer distance, just like other champions that rely on skillshots like Vel'Koz and Xerath.

Funny, but I have been a dedicated midlane Brand on other different server account too since I've joined league during season 3\n\nWhat I can tell you what DOESN'T feel good about him when I play mid and NEVER felt good, before his rework and even after his rework: it's his **WAVECLEAR**. \n\nFirst of all, 3/4 of his abilities are not meant to waveclear. Yes, 3/4 because the only good spell Brand has to clear waves is his W. Conflagration doesn't do enough damage to minions unless maxed and it wastes a good portion of mana, basically wasting it. Q is not meant to waveclear at all, obviously, it's like a \"kill a minion for sure\" spell if you lack 1-2 AA's to lasthit it.\n\nIn fact, his best way to farm a wave is to enhance-W the entirety of it, but you have to aggro minions on yourself for that to happen, since W radius can only hit 3 minions at best, and a wave rarely stacks up for W's radius to be enough to hit all of it. Example: cannon wave, Q cannon, E it + W entire wave while you are surrounded by minions. Obviously noone is going to do that with an enemy laner present,it's asking to get blowned up.\n\nSince waves rarely stack up to hit them with W alone, you have to either waste half your mana pool + a few AA's to clear it in one rotation, or hit melees + casters separately with 2 W's which wastes time and again, more mana, than compared to other midlane mages. If you look at the mage roster, the only others who can't clear waves better than Brand is Fiddlesticks and early on somewhat Zilean. Other example: Kennen has to use all his abilities + several AA's to clear wave in one rotation, and even then he uses energy meanwhile I have to use mana. _Every single other mage_ has better tools to clear waves and for _way less mana_ , and whenever i play Brand it feels that I am at a heavy mana/waveclear disadvantage. \n\nAs midlane Brand, you can be quite oppressive during early stages of the game with good harass and bully your mage opponents well, but the thing is, when playing Brand mid, unless your opponent has a similar waveclear speed with you, you **MUST** play aggressive. If you preserve to a passive playstyle with Brand on mid and decide to simply waveclear with your spells, you eventually will get outpushed every time by mages who can do it better and for less mana,which again, basically everyone. And if you are in a bad matchup, you are forced to play passive in fear of dying to enemy laner (example:Zed) which spells game over. Zoning and bullying helps to mitigate this disadvantage, since you now can use only AA's and seldom spells to clear waves and in turn slow down enemy waveclear by a decent margin because they are afraid of trying to come close to a wave in fear of getting heavily harassed.\n\nI think major part of this problem lies in Brand's overall kit. It feels amazing for fighting, but just feels poor and insufficient for wave management. In my honest opinion, if somehow Brand's E and/or Q could be changed to improve the issue, putting him on the same level with other midlane mages in terms of waveclear, that'd make him overall feel much,much better midlane.","replies":[{"poster":"EasternBladeStar","date":"2018-07-22T09:47:46.946+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being forced to clear waves with nearly all your kit also leaves you open for Zed and various other assassins' harass / all-in.

I&#x27;m interested since I play him mid almost exclusively in ranked.\n\nIn my personal opinion as a Diamond V-III Brand main, playing mid as Brand is generally under-performing because of both his waveclear and his ability to take on other mid laners in a 1v1. In team fights he is a monster, but playing him mid you have to sacrafice some lane control vs most match ups and you can't stand toe to toe with other mid laners, namely AP and AD assassins. Due to his low mobility, assassins can win vs Brand quite easily, and it's difficult to consistently land a full Brand combo on agile enemies. Not only that, but most other mid laners can offer a lot more pressure in the early stages of the game to other lanes due to their mobility and ability to target out the heavy hitter (such as getting to bot lane in twice the speed and taking out the adc while you're left either scrounging for some cs or trying to chase after with futility). \n\nSo now that Brand is already behind in the early stages, you'd think he would excel late game. He can, especially if the enemy is grouped and build a lot of HP, but Brand's AP scaling is very poor compared to other mages and he offers little to no CC which is vital for the late game (i.e. Viegar has the best stun in the game and best ap scaling in the game, so naturally he is poor early game but strong late game). That, and Brand can be caught out more easily than even most adc's because of his severe lack of mobility in a meta where mobility is reigning king. Brand is strong, but it still feels lack luster compared to other mid titans. Playing him as a support means that you're not the main focus and you still have a powerful AD/ AP assassin or strong mid laner to help carry you through the game. Also, since Brand is immobile, it would be a good idea to pick up TP on him, except for the fact that after landing a full combo and some other spells will still leave the enemy able to escape (compounded HEAVILY if they take nullifying orb or buy a hexdrinker), so most Brand's will opt to take ignite to have more lane pressure (otherwise it's almost a guaranteed loss unless you're primary focus is farm AND the rest of your team doesn't need your help). \n\nThere really is so easy solution to fixing Brand mid and he seems to be tricky to balance. Some general ideas would be to give him mobility, or more kill pressure in 1v1's while not making it overwhelming, or even the idea of TP scrolls like DoTa 2 has to make it so that immobile champs can have more pressure to outside lanes. Perhaps making his E do more damage for a balanced wave clear or even extending the range of his E so that he offer more kill pressure to those pesky assassins. But of course, doing the latter would make him that much more stronger as a support. After all is said and done, I don't think his passive is the problem. Making the passive scale with AP or even magic pen would be a cool idea, as it would make his late game stronger, but early game he would suffer that much more. Maybe making the passive do more damage depending on how much AD or AP the enemy has will make it a better ability in this damage heavy meta, but that would take away his lure in doing heavy damage to the tanks. \n\nMy best suggestion: \nPerhaps making it so that each of his 3 abilities does a _different type_ of passive scaling damage could be the answer. \nExample: \n- His E would do passive damage that scales with the enemy's max HP like it already does (Basically unchanged). \n- His W would do more passive damage scaling with the enemy's AD. \n- His Q would do more passive damage scaling with the enemy's AP. \n- His R would do more passive damage with their highest adaptive stat. \n- Landing a full combo would double these effects, won't apply all 3 scalings at once, but rather the one that is more applicable, such as tanks receiving the max HP passive damage and AD's receiving the passive AD scaling. . . \n\n* **Lastly, this passive damage would also scale off of Brand's AP.** That means that if Brand wants to build pure magic pen to punish botlane squishys, he wouldn't do as much passive damage thus hindering his late game. In addition, his early game pressure as a support with his passive ability would go down, but he would also deal more damage to enemies who are doing exceedingly well since he could dish out more passive damage depending on how strong they get. This could also be a counter to the current snowballing meta we have now while also making the Brand support less of a threat early game. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2018-07-22T12:33:13.194+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XYf1I911,comment-id=000f00060000,timestamp=2018-07-22T06:29:47.319+0000)\n>\n> What doesn&#x27;t feel good for you when playing him mid?

As much AOE no matter what anyone makes you think, Singletargeted nuke. Higher range, lower cooldowns, scuttle control, she can also move while casting, easier time hitting her abilities\n\n\nTaliyah has CC on the level of brand. Bassicly no cooldowns, As High Aoe damage, better zoning, is generaly faster, the ultimate utility global presence, absurd DPS, easier time hitting her abilties\n\n\nVeigar outclasses him the least because he is weaker then both taliyah and syndra (Except for that recent banner hotfix)\n\nBut veigar has way better stun like way better, just a bit lower cooldowns, just a bit less Aoe, singletargeted burst, infinite scalling which matters once every 70 games.\n\n\nThere is also Velkoz who suffers in a similar ways compared to this champions but I am pretty sure that even he outclasses brand. Granted brand is saved by spellthief and nothing can save Velkoz from a compettetive standpoint.. Sure you can play him if you like tentacles but if you are a Pro player and pick this shit in LCS i ll look down on you and consider you a bad player.\n\nVelkoz true damage niche doesnt exist since this other champions do so much magic damage.

Does a good chunk of damage and applies his passive which makes you have to play real careful for the next 4 seconds while it also deals % health damage.

This has the same effect as Brand W in coercing enemy movement since it deals respectable damage, but his threatening spell that takes advantage of this coercion is easier to dodge (E).

Ofc you gotta be wary of passive proc but no lux is gonna walk up to auto after max range E. Her Q is pretty non-threatening as long as you're behind minons. Once there's only 1 left, you back up or just play ballsy and dodge the Q since it's a pretty ok to dodge skillshot. At no point does her E coerce you into getting hit by Q.\n\n---\n\n> Zyra\n>\n> Dodge E slow line skillshot, try to dodge Q. If you dodge them both you can just kill the plants. If you get hit by Q you gotta back off and wait for plant aggro to go away. At no point does she force you into her E with her Q. She just does generally good poke damage with her Q and plants to force backs.\n\n---\n\n> Ziggs\n>\n> Dodge bombs. That's about it. Max range satchel won't do much but blow you backwards and his minefield won't affect you if you just stay in or behind minions. At no point are you coerced into moving into a satchel setup.\n\n---\n\n> Xerath\n>\n> Stay behind minions, try not to get poked out by every Q. That's about it. Some slight coercion into staying behind minions to avoid E but that's just what ADCs generally do anyway. Xerath support is all about Q poke down until they're low enough for a flash E all-in.\n\nWe're talking about laning phase, not a level 18 full build support.","replies":[{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2018-07-23T13:01:52.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"As a brand main, who has over 200k mastery with him, I do have to say \"O BOI, you do exaggerate don't you? \" I also main Lux, velkoz and soraka bot lane. All are capable of poking in different ways.\n\nNow the only difference with brand currently is that his W casting time starts from under the ground, where you position the circle and that makes it harder to dodge it without a dash, considering it has decent range to it. Other than that, Brand's W works exactly like Lux's E but with smaller radius and range. The E part is way too dangerous because i have go close up to the minion/champ to do it and the enemy support and adc can poke me back. It does have its advantages when the adc is stuck by his tower and his minions but usually, this is by no means an easy way to poke with brand.\n\nThe Q part of brand is actually simpler than Lux's since her Q can go past 2 minions. If that was not bad enough, her Q also means that she will always hit her E and her ult. Brand on the other hand, needs to apply a stack of his passive to Q and that is pretty discernible when he will Q you. He just has too much damage, stop picking on his small utility as a immobile closed ranged mage.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-07-23T13:13:09.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"75 / 120 / 165 / 210 / 255 (+ 60% AP) + 4% of their maximum health over 4 seconds\n\nvs\n\n60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 (+ 60% AP)\n\nHMMMMMMMMMMMM\n\nEdit: I should have quoted you're post cuz that is definitely not the same post I replied to.","replies":[{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2018-07-23T15:37:55.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mr Sleeper,\n\nI really think you are sleep today. Have you ever considered that lux also has a passive with AP scaling and base damage?\n\nHMMMMMMMMMMMM\n\nIn addition, have you also considered that there is legit 15 more damage on Brand's W in comparison to Lux's E, when she gets to have a bigger raidus, cast range and a incredible scaling AOE slow? If that was not enough, her E proc's cheap shot rune and that has just 4 second cooldown.\n\nConsidering the above, then why is Lux not considered, as big of an issue as Brand currently is? First of all, Lux has incredible mana issues and her burst is nothing against a tank that has 1 MR item.\n\nOn the other hand, brand is not the \"go to\" burst support because of his ability to poke but rather his overall damage is too high and is very reliable against tanks as well as squishies. To top it off, he can more reliably burst  because Lux needs that Q to hit her R and even if she exhaust all her burst, she cannot 100-0 in one rotation. Brand also lacks this ability in a 1v1 situation but with a ult he can easily kill a squishy and also chunk a great deal of health of tanks while also being quite tanky due to the in build HP in his core items (rylais/liandries). Brand is just way too reliable, even if he lacks the quick burst, utility and poke that Lux offers.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-07-25T04:53:06.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Another point miss.

Your whole original post was about Brand's W being  good/reliable as a poke spell in combination with his E. You even gave examples of other mages, including Lux, that have poke and how easily avoidable they are in comparison to brand's spells.\n\nAs a predominant poke or mage/burst support I refuted this by comparing Lux's E with Brand's W.\nLux's E has greater range and bigger radius but slightly longer cast time depending on how close Lux is to you when she E's. But due to the fact that you go aery and cheap shot on Lux support, she has much greater poke than brand. Some even take absoloute focus on lux due to her range and poke. She even has quicker if not greater burst than brand and provides immense utility in her W, Q and E. So if anyone than Lux should be circle jerked here for being an opressive support, but she is not, so that should show you that poke is not what makes brand so strong as support.\n\nIn addition, how can brand's W coerce movement and Lux's E cannot? Moreover, her E does not hit immediately, it has 5 seconds cast time and i believe there is a slight delay if you quickly hit E maybe like 0.25 seconds. Brand not only has to get closer to you to W but also has smaller radius . As for referencing my points, i didn't think you did not possess a brain. Have you ever read brand's passive and read what his ult and E do? Or even his whole kit? Brand counters tanks harder than squishies...
