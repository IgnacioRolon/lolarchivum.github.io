Zhonya's has a skill element that is virtually absent altogether from Maw. Maw procs when you're in a cc, when you're out of position, and when you would be assassinated without time to react. In other words, it passively requires less skill from the AD and more skill from the AP. \n\nZhonya's doesn't do that. If you're caught out, and use Zhonya's, you'll probably die anyway. If you're cc'd you can't use the active. If you're assassinated before you can hit the button, you die anyway. Outside of full-swing teamfights or inherent kit synergy (eg Fiddles, Morg, Heimer, etc), Zhonya's isn't a great \"oh crap\" button to compensate for mistakes. \n\nIn general, Maw gives a much larger EHP advantage than Zhonya's due to the MR + Shield + LifeSteal + Pen.

However, Katarina does not completely dislike having cooldown reduction. Her passive makes purchasing dedicated cooldown reduction items unecessary, but it is still welcome if she is able to afford it, especially because she is not always guaranteed to activate the passive.
