Vlad gains HP with his passive and he generally buy tanky AP items such as Liandry and Rylai. Fizz is not naturally tanky but he can be tanky when built AD. Hecarim is naturally tanky and that is unquestionable. Cho&#039;Gath, well... has his ult.\n\nThere are also many other non-squishy top laners that I like to use, and they are actually the majority of the top laners I use: {{champion:98}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:48}} and more recently I am starting to use {{champion:223}} as a top laner.\n\nThat said, I still think that Riven should be changed. She is way too powerful, and I say that despite playing tanky champions who are supposed to beat her.\n\nThey are just supposed. On theory, tankyness should counter Riven. But the problem is that items like {{item:3035}}, {{item:3134}}, and {{item:3071}} negate a lot of that tanykness. A good Riven will always rush those items if they notice that the enemy is stacking armor. It is always the same thing, for example, when I play Shen. I even start with armor quints; and win trades against Riven. But the moment she has Last Whisper, I can no longer win trades against her, no matter how much armor I have.\n\nWhen people think about Riven, they say \"burst damage\" but Riven actually has a lot of sustained damage, enough to deal with many bruisers and tanks. This is because of her Q and her passive, if executed with animation cancelling. She will never kill a tank/buiser as fast as she can kill a squishy, but she can, and will negate their damage with her shield. Keep in mind that by purchasing armor/HP, you are sacrificing damage. If you don&#039;t actually have the damage to kill Riven before she kills you, then it doesn&#039;t matter how much armor you stack, she will kill you regardless.\n\nThat&#039;s why I like to play {{champion:54}} against Riven, even though he is not one of my favorite top laners. He is one of the best because not only he gains even more armor the more armor you stack, but his offensive abilities actually scale with armor, allowing his damage to scale and allowing him to actually have enough damage to deal with Riven later. However, Malphite has other problems that make him not be the best pick against Riven. For example, apart from his ult, there isn&#039;t much that he can do to peel a Riven off a teammate. His Q is not of much help due to her dashes. And if Malphite has powerful AP champions as her allies, Malphite will have problems, since he is not very useful against mages.\n\nI still think that Riven is too powerful and obnoxious, and that is not because she can 1-shot me. That&#039;s because no matter what I do against her, I am always feeling helpless.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2015-07-16T14:22:18.753+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":7,"body":"Riven is not supposed to be countered by tankyness.

You are calling me out on my statements (which I dont mind) so let's remove the fluff and asumptions and let me spell out my point:\n\n1. I have seen a lot of boxbox's stream including some of his animation cancelling vidoes (which this combo btw does not use). This combo using 3 autos can be cast an about 1.5-2 seconds asuming you want 3 autos. Yes I do believe how quick that is. Assuming reaction time + ping takes you 0.5 seconds that gives you 1 sec to cc her which should be plenty even including cast animations. A good player might even see her moving within flash range and cc her preemptively again making her an easy take down for the adc.\n\n2. Again I don't care if riven is buffed or nerfed or whatever but I do make sure facts are kept straight:  {{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:154}}  I might have missed some but all of these can pass as tanks, bruiser, or supports and all have a cc or a way to save their adc which has a little cast time or in case of veigar can easily be used preemptively. Some of them need their ult sure but this is a supports job so ult is a small price to pay.\n\n3. A level 18 jinx with 9 armor armor from her runes (a common setup) and a fully stacked BT should has a bit over 4000 effective physical health while that combo assuming {{item:3074}} {{item:3072}}  {{item:3035}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3142}}  and a last 80 ad item would only do about 3500 physical damage. Note that this setup is highly offensive for a riven player and assumes last item IE, essence reaver, or extra BT where most riven players normally goes either a defensive item or BC. I can do this a bit more rigorous counting in fully stacked spell and blade weaving but I doubt it would amount to more than the defensive item the jinx will get and the less than full damage I used for the ult. Also remember that any adc is going to get shields, heals or whatever the support can give them to boost their tankiness making an instant burst less likely. A longer combo could maybe do it but that would make even more time for the adc to get peel.\n\n4. Weaving in aa's I know more or less exactly how long that takes. You can do animation cancelling to speed up things but then you miss out on aa's. Also note that 4 full casts of q (which can be cast 3 times per cd) would take at least 23.4 seconds assuming you can instant cast all the strikes and have maxed out cdr. Is this fast for a skill with 3 uses per cd? yes. Is it instant? no. Can it be peeled? very much yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Puppet33r","date":"2015-07-19T09:36:28.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realize that like pretty much all of those champs you mentioned(with a few exceptions) will be engaging on to the enemy backline instead of babysitting their adc?

Riven is also a very safe champion to play as, because she is nearly impossible to gank unless she has grossly overextended, and even then she can still end up escaping a gank if she has flash up and hasn't burned her cooldowns.\n\nThe problem with dealing with Riven is that whether you beat her or not depends on whether or not she screws up pretty significantly.  Riven always has the advantage, it is up to her to determine whether or not she keeps it.","replies":[{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2015-07-17T02:42:09.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What higher-skilled players learn about dealing with Darius is how -not- to lose lane, farm under turret and keep the score 0/0 so he can become useless later on. It has less to do with mechanics and more to do with game knowledge (Knowing how to lose a lane without it becoming a terrible weight for the rest of the team is an important skill).\n\nRiven however is entirely dependent on -her- skill. When I play against a Riven it's not about the matchup and more about \"Does this player understand ani canceling?\" It's less down to my own skill. or the skill difference, but more about whether this player has mastered this particular skill or hasn't, there's no counterplay against an ani-canceling Riven than picking one of her counters.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"jDVL20eCYs","date":"2015-07-16T14:42:34.188+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":38,"body":"Plays heca, vlad, fizz and cho xd xd\nThe most cancerouse top laners xd xd\nI mean even heca xd xd\nAnd you complain about riven xd xd\nOp stop you make me laugh to death xd xd\nCan't breath xd xd","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-16T14:49:38.489+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't bread?\nAre you allergic to gluten, perhaps?\nhttp://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/better-wheat-bread-through-chemistry-130111.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"SlytherinUmbreon","date":"2015-07-16T16:20:41.884+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:80}} the feels","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2015-07-16T15:47:05.414+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But he is right.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WutsKraken","date":"2015-07-16T15:29:21.234+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't dislike Riven because I can't lane vs her.
