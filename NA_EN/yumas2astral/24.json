(I am speaking of the new runes)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now that Deathfire Touch has been removed, I don&#039;t know what should I take on Malzahar. Scorch is the closest thing that there is to Deathfire Touch on the new runes. The problem is that it is not a keystone, it deals a fixed amount of damage that doesn&#039;t scale with AP or AD at all, and has a cooldown, It also doesn&#039;t seem worth taking over Gathering Storm. Will Arcane Comet be a good choice? I don&#039;t really know but it seems that this mastery has synergy with champions that have hard CC (Malzahar happens to have his ult). I also have thougth of taking Predator (it may seem weird but the movement speed active seems appealing).\r\n\r\nAs for Vladimir I don&#039;t really know what to take. Electrocute seems to be the closest thing that has synergy with him. Phase Rush, which is the new version of Stormraider&#039;s Surge, is harder to proc and only gives slow resistance to melee champions now. So it doesn&#039;t seem to be that good for Vlad anymore. The other old keystone that was amazing for Vlad was Deathfire Touch and, as you know, there is no replacement in the new keystones for Deathfire Touch. Speaking of which, I will really miss the movement speed quintessences for Vlad, because his base movement speed is so low.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-08T03:08:47.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would go Airie on vlad as it is a weaker meteor but it actually hits.

Riot Medler said they would keep an eye on DoT champs but they think the Meteor change will help (I don't think it will though).\n\nMalz has been super strong ever since the mage rework either as a support or a mid control mage.  I have played Malz a lot since Season 3 and would like to see him remain viable if not top tier.  He could use a nerf, but I don't think a lack of good keystones is the answer to his balance issues.","replies":[{"poster":"LitAF","date":"2017-11-07T22:56:37.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since his rework in patch 7 something to his voidlings he sucks as a support.\nI believe the new system is already an indirect nerf to DoT mages, but we'll see.","replies":[]}]}]}
