They may farm occasionally, but mostly they just take a stroll and smell the daisies. Does riot have any advice on how to deal with this? How should we categorize this in reports if it is punishable? It&#039;s basically afk because the farm they do get will never contribute to their team&#039;s victory, however they are technically moving around the map. They may die to enemies that are travelling through the area, but that&#039;s not the same as intentional feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-21T02:43:05.162+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The system will eventually learn to catch it, and massively underperforming repeatedly is already easy to detect.\n\nThe issue is that it is very hard for a computer to determine if it is a bad game or intentional unless there is a constant pattern, and the massive number of false/brat-rage reports means riot cant even begin to review them all manually.\n\nIncidentally, the fact people are doing this shows that they _are_ getting banned for just quitting or inting.","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-05-21T21:26:46.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wonder if the system will learn to catch this behavior BEFORE the next 3 years because thats how long i've been doing it connstantly on my smurf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ramyskie","date":"2018-05-21T15:10:10.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jYRmA1cs,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-05-21T02:43:05.162+0000)\n>\n> The system will eventually learn to catch it, and massively underperforming repeatedly is already easy to detect.\n> \n> The issue is that it is very hard for a computer to determine if it is a bad game or intentional unless there is a constant pattern, and the massive number of false/brat-rage reports means riot cant even begin to review them all manually.\n> \n> Incidentally, the fact people are doing this shows that they _are_ getting banned for just quitting or inting.\n\nMy match history clearly suggested that the system do not catch up to massively under-performing repeatedly. Negative KD team mates every game and frequently below 1 even when assists are counted when the average across the whole tier is 2.3. A game of 70% KP while getting flamed by the team is ironcially depressing considering that excluding me, the team would never be able to have the chance to surrender since they will lose pre 15.\n\nIncidentally, the fact that they are taking the extra effort to do this means that the system is not considering that to be negative behaviour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SangreDeNoche","date":"2018-05-21T03:13:25.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jYRmA1cs,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-05-21T02:43:05.162+0000)\n> Incidentally, the fact people are doing this shows that they _are_ getting banned for just quitting or inting.\n\nor it means the people doing it _perceive_ it that way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VełKoz Bot","date":"2018-05-21T06:01:42.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an Ezreal do this the other day, sat in Krugs pit for the last 10-15 minutes of the game.

I think what you said is wrong too though, all it takes is calling someone an idiot in ONE game and there is a chance you can get punished. I would even say if you called yourself an idiot you could get punished (saying something like, \"sorry guys, I've been playing like an idiot, I will try to do better\" could potentially lead to a chat restriction. \n\nThis is due to the fact that Riot and their fanboys think \"context doesn't matter, ever.\" So the system only picks up the word Idiot and punishes you for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-05-22T03:48:04.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wouldnt go as far and say calling yourself an idiot gets you banned...\nbut yea. context DOES matter from time to time.\nand i dont mean context in the way of \"but he started, look what he said first to me!\"\n\ni really mean in that way.\nwe saw it with the ban baiters.\nwhat i still rarely see is\n\"im from asian and friendly. im a Friendly Asian Guy. say only the capital letters or i int :D\"","replies":[{"poster":"EvilxUndertonez","date":"2018-05-22T05:04:21.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arammus,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jYRmA1cs,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-22T03:48:04.269+0000)\n>\n> i wouldnt go as far and say calling yourself an idiot gets you banned...\n> but yea. context DOES matter from time to time.\n> and i dont mean context in the way of &quot;but he started, look what he said first to me!&quot;\n> \n> i really mean in that way.\n> we saw it with the ban baiters.\n> what i still rarely see is\n> &quot;im from asian and friendly. im a Friendly Asian Guy. say only the capital letters or i int :D&quot;\n\nI am talking about grammatical context, not conversational/social context. I am under the impression the IFS system simply scans for keywords and phrases. It doesn't care what grammatical context it is in. If it finds one of it's \"blacklisted\" key words or phrases (I'm sure idiot is one of them) it will dish out a punishment. I really don't think it cares who you are talking too, it simply goes by the fact that you triggered it with a blacklisted term.\n\nI could be wrong, it wouldn't be the first time...{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2018-05-21T20:10:53.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report it as being afk and write in the comments \"Walked around jungle doing nothing, not attacking players\"\n\nTheir afk system won't pick it up but if there's a bunch of reports that a human being can check a replay for and they see this behavior, the player can be banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Vi Earth","date":"2018-05-21T06:23:00.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"the easiest way to deal with this is. ff then its over yay","replies":[{"poster":"SangreDeNoche","date":"2018-05-21T07:22:30.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Vi Earth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jYRmA1cs,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-05-21T06:23:00.271+0000)\n>\n> the easiest way to deal with this is. ff then its over yay\n\nThat requires 5 votes pre-20 and 4 votes post 20.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Vi Earth","date":"2018-05-21T07:53:00.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"could always just leave the game yay,","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2018-05-21T08:23:07.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's called an active AFK, and it's equally punishable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU SO BAD","date":"2018-05-21T07:54:38.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Report for afk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alien Bug Thing","date":"2018-05-21T07:44:37.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"report as afk.  pretty sure their afk detection can notice if they dont get any xp for long period of time even if they are moving.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2018-05-21T07:26:14.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are basically AFK since they're not contributing to the game in any way, so I'd count it as any other AFK report.","replies":[]}]}
