They were literally standing still and spamming their taunts until they got killed then flaming me for not \"helping.\" I figured \"If I can't beat them, join them.\" Now people keep complaining to me about how much of a scumbag *I* am when the game was already over when I started dying intentionally. Something like 2 to 30. Then again maybe you didn't ignore those numbers like the last two people did, maybe you're just another person who can't read. *Shrugs*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-03-14T04:28:57.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"feelsbadman","replies":[]}]}
