I submitted a ticket but I'm worried that it will get thrown aside since I don't even know what the email address I used for the signup is. Just that it was an assigned college email from 5 years ago. How long does this usually take for a response? I do have a card connected to the account but since the email wasn't verified they won't have the Cvv code for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-03T16:35:19.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We won't throw you aside, and our account team will do our best to assist you.
