It used to not do that but I have to wait about 5 minutes to actually get into the clickable client when i can hear my friends' invites in the background. I've repaired the client twice and restarted my computer, but none of those seemed to fix the issue. i can't even get in right now as I'm typing this haha. is there a solution out there yet or?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-26T17:41:50.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really odd delay!
