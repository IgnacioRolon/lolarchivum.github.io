Grab Riot's [Hextech Repair Tool](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi) and check both the box for &#x27;Reinstall&#x27; and &#x27;Clean Uninstall&#x27;, then hit the Start button.

It changes every patch, but contains the same stuff.\nDelete the two files named \"S_OK\" and \"release manifest\"\nOpen up the \"deploy\" folder.\nDelete the \"logs\", \"META-INF\", \"lol.properties\", and \"LoLClient.exe\"\nRestart your Patcher.\nIt will repatch the recent patch you had just downloaded.\n\nI'm not sure if you have any custom DNS/IPconfig settings set up or any custom Port Forwarding but I would imagine that these could also present a problem in this scenario. \n\nHope this helps!\n~KP\n\nP.S. Please don't get mad at me Riot... XD\n\nEDIT: If none of this works you may want to check for OS updates from Windows or Apple (depending on whose software you're using) sometimes updates will fix these problems. These problems may also come from updates if you have recently updated your PC OS was well. It may take some digging but Porocles may be right that it is a permissions issue brought on by a windows/mac update.","replies":[{"poster":"Wii Fit Trainer","date":"2016-07-26T21:17:27.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did try to delete those folders while they were still around, but when you first install League before you patch it for the first time, those files don't exist (which unfortunately is the part I'm stuck at).
