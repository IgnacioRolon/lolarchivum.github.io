It makes all in-s so much more deadly, trading irrelevant when you outrade everyone by pressing corrupting pot in your inventory... \r\n\r\nIt has no downsides, it's literally an auto-win rune \r\n\r\nTime warp tonic + Corrupting potion turn late game hypercarries into lane bullies from level 1, they COMPLETELY negate ignite's existence\r\n\r\nTime warp tonic + Corrupting potion is literally the red pot start from 5 years ago Riot nerfed because it was too toxic that's available EVERYTIME you go back. \r\n\r\nYou buy corrupting potion for sustain, but then also have the all in potential of a doran blade, like wtf? Why are Doran items still in the game when Corrupt potion + time warp tonic make them obsolete? \r\n\r\nI'll probably be downvoted by players who never cheese and never got cheesed by this disgusting rune, but PLEASE remove it. It's 100% pure cheese, no skill, and overpowered when compared to any other secondary rune... It completely changes the lane phase dynamic and is good in every situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Goopy Amethyst","date":"2019-10-14T05:26:00.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a {{champion:78}} main, who'se main building always includes time warp tonic because is the best way to sustain, I can assure you that the answer is a little bit easier.\nWhen you go against someone with Time Warp Tonic and corrupting potion, your job is to play safe, is like facing an enemy with ignite, the first levels you gotta be careful.\nI say the best agressive answer is to constantly poke, and only all-in when you know they've taken all their 3 shots out of the tonic.","replies":[{"poster":"Juice","date":"2019-10-14T05:30:01.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you're saying this secondary useless rune is as important as summoner spell? I have to play around this SECONDARY rune as I would have to play against Ignite? \n\nDoes this person have to play around my Bone plating and Overgrowth (which gives me 100 hp in late game) or around my Demolish? Maybe around the 12 AD i get for killing 10 people in game ? \n\nTime warp tonic + corrupting potion is exact same thing as the old red pot cheese from season 3, it gives you damage AND HP boost to secure any all in, save you from tower dives, negate ignite damage, and not to mention it gives sustain to champs who's only weakness is lack of sustain. \n\nOnce they have taken 3 shots of tonic I have to go back too, since I will probably be lower HP from all the trading and them outsustaining me throughout the whole thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Goopy Amethyst","date":"2019-10-14T05:38:49.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runes affect the way you play too.\nYou wouldn't stay trading with an Urgot that just procked his conqueror.\nHere is the same, the rune is always useful on early, then it falls off hard.\nAgain, it's like ignite, unless you wanna deny a lot of healing, ignite is almost useless after early.","replies":[{"poster":"Juice","date":"2019-10-14T05:42:05.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Difference is conqueror is easy to play around, it's a PRIMARY rune (not secondary) , again don't compare secondary runes to keystones. \n\nConqueror also requires a specific set up for it to work. \n\nAnd it falls off hard compared to what? 12 damage you'd get for killing 10 people? 100 hp you'd get from overgrowth?
