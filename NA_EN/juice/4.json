The only way it can is if you're going AP Nasus or some kind of AP hybrid build, in which case it's better to simply pick an AP champion. \n\nOverall, E max Nasus is the poor man's Yorick. Just pick Yorick if you like E max Nasus more. Yorick does EXACTLY what E max Nasus does but much much better.\n\nPersonally, I pick Nasus for his insane mid game, not to split. I really don't like Nasus that much as a split pusher. His team fighting power is insane in the mid game.

Im a nasus main (not a very good one mid you) but ive noticed that nasus is too weak early game and if theres ANY game where nasus would 100% stomp..just bring yi; better early game, better mid game, and better late game. If Yi is banned just go olaf, better early game, better mid game, and better late game. (which is funny because i remember having 600 stacks at 28 minutes only for the conquorer olaf that rushed full lifesteal to  literally eat my booty even though i \"kited\" basiclaly half his ult by running) should also be noted that i won the early game also (with alot of ganks and freezing the wave) just for him to kill me later (with 400 stacks at 20) through my steraks and thornmail. Same thing would happen with yi.\n\n\nAlso the early game is too bullshit at this point. You have to start e in literally EVERY matchup just to try and get some farm when u get to lane or else half your health  or MORE is going to be gone for one minion (which is funny because they still out damage you while tanking 4-6 minions ) And then theres the problem that you cant actually 1v1 any other juggernaut until about 13-20 minutes (with conquorer)  unless its a garen and then u can 1v1 him around a bit after first back or u cant 1v1 him at all if youre the villain (because a rank 1 ult should ALWAYS do 1200-1350 true damage just because you got a kill)(also usually all jugggernauts eventually outscale you around 30-40 minutes unless youve been split pushing the entire time but at that point that game shoudlve already been over)\n\n\nWhats even more bullshit though is getting tower dove by the kled level 2 because he has ignite and your under 100% (around 75% is enough for him to towerdive you ) and living with literally 7 health because u flashed away and he cant chase you without scaaaaaaaarl\n\n\n\nwhats sad is even if your literally 3 feet away from your tower the rammus will zoom in level 3 and literally just cc you to death only for the garen to silence you right after so you have 0 time to flash while you take 1000000000 damage (whats worse is bringing ghost although i basiclaly always do)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalthough all that said nasus isnt really that bad im just a bad playing him and even then I go on winstreaks of over 75% in 40 games but then right after i get tilted from 1 game for about 4 days and proceed to go on a lose streak of 0-35% for 30 games . Also if you get one gank your probably set for a early sheen to literally just dominate the game after that point, and if you dont get a gank and do survive with nasus, around level 11 you basically outscale literally everyone (except darius you have to kill him level 10 so he doesnt rape you with his level 11 ult) also you can beat every late game champ (except olaf and yi and irelia ) at around right after first sheen if you brought conquorer. (its good to let them poke you with their gapcloser before going in and ghosting and usually people dont really know so they push the wave to your tower thinking they can still dominate you)(literally every riven, but if she doesnt early game your probably going to get raped because riven is broken)\n\n\nOne last thing is that if you do get fed and your team does good also you can basically just 5v1 (which everytime that has happened ive literally either gotten a solo triple or a solo quadra tbh)\n\nSo not weak. people just cant play him properly . Also theres a way to win literally every matchup (except like the buffed darius one i wouldnt know though because after they buffed him ive literally been permabanning him) The thing is though you can win every matchup but most times one person on your team is going to HARD feed and regardless of how many resistances youll have youre going to get one shot. (Looking at you voidstaff(40% magic pen), executioners calling (literal aids) and the new infinity edge (why would you make it do true damage and not compensate nasus with a buff to his ult health?)\n\n\n\nHoneslty I hope they buff nasus' ult again, the other ult buff was actual cancer to the game and all he really needed was more resistances and more health. (750 health wont matter when the darius hits you with 1600 truedamage) Instead of making him spam his q (which if he got on them he wouldnt have needed tbh) you shoudlve just given him a olaf and yi ult and nerfed it by 80% so he isnt kited into oblivion)\n\n\nthat being said nerf yi. for the love of god nerf yi. (although if you do want to kill yi just go up to him and make him ult then ghost and pop ult(take that ult speed rune)  and just run away for about 8 seconds then go in and wither him cuz your ult lasts almost double of his.)(but cowsep has shown how cancer he is tbh) Fuck nasus play yi.(just dont try to 5v1)\n\n\n\nI HOPE THEY LOWER THE DAMAGE AND NERF IGNITE .
