We're aware that some of our players encounter issues while trying to spectate and we're working hard to get it fixed. Unfortunately, I can't provide you a time and date when it will be fixed in order to prevent any sort of confusion.\n\nI appreciate your patience and understanding regarding this issue, and thank you again for taking time out of your day to send us this report. Please let me know if you have any questions.\n\nRadkus\nPlayer Support Specialist\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"SepharU","date":"2017-01-24T18:01:10.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have done this :\n\n1. Reinstalled LOL\n2. I ran spectate mode from legacy and the updated beta version\n3. I deleted LOLreplay just to check if it was bugging\n4. I restarted the computer and both clients several times to see if it gives me other results\n\nWhat i see is that, if a player has only played 2-3 minuttes in a game, and is in the delaying time around 3 min, i will get into the spectate window where they show the champion they have selected (where it counts down before the spectate actually can begin, sometimes that spectate windows dosent show anything, (only black) but i can hear the music playing), but after the spectate mode starts where you actually is going into the real game, it goes pitchblack and i get the message about unable to DL spectate data after 20-25 secs. I can see that the client is trying to do someting cause you see that blue circle, but it always ends up with that message.\n\nI have tried several scenarios, and i am used to look for solution on the net but this problem i cant solve by my self.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-24T17:45:50.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really interesting two receive two reports on this so suddenly, and I'd like to find what's going on.  To start, can you test spectate out on the legacy client to help rule out possibilities with the updated version?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nLet me know if it works there.","replies":[]}]}
