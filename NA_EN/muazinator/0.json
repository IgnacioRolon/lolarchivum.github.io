I looked around and the only response i get is that i need to use my middle mouse button to zoom in or out. However, i play on a trackball and i don't own a mouse with a middle mouse button. Is there anyway else that i can zoom in or out or am i stuck?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T15:45:07.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zooming are bound to reserved keys, and unless your trackball has a trackwheel there isn't much we can do.  You may be able to restore your settings to default to reset your camera, but there's no way to manually adjust the zoom without those keys.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nI know that doesn't help a whole lot, but hopefully the reset can assist until a more permanent solution is found.","replies":[{"poster":"Muazinator","date":"2017-03-26T23:04:19.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"During the game i tried to restore default settings although that didn't do anything to help me; however, i went into a custom game and my camera view was normal just like it used to be, I'm assuming it just ended up being a one time thing that appeared out of nowhere. I have no idea how my screen even became zoomed in since i started the game like that. But thanks for the response, if my issue happens again, I'll be sure to try the file deletion steps that you told me.","replies":[]}]}]}
