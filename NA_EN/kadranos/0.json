It still continued.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a client side issue, of course. Nothing to do with in game. \r\n\r\nI dont mind the noises to be honest, but I do tend to listen to music while playing, and  can't hear it without the other sounds haha. \r\n\r\nOther than that, great job on the pre-season update. Love it so far!\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"ZenaSpiritdragon","date":"2017-11-08T20:59:32.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here! Had to restart the client to make it stop.

It's a known bug we are working on now. Seems to be happening when you leave the runes page and then save outside of Runes. To get it to stop playing, go back into Runes, click a page and then exit. It should stop playing! I'm working on getting a fix for this ASAP!\n\nEdit - looks like we can piggyback the fix for this when we do a patch for when we find something else that is inevitably broken with all the new Runes stuff that went out. In the meantime, what I wrote above should be a way to stop the ambience! Really sorry about it :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wrecki","date":"2020-02-03T01:48:01.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like to update that I just encountered this bug, it still exists 2 years later lol","replies":[]}]}
