Is it possible to get another refund even if we've used all 3? I'm asking because I actually was supposed to gift my gf the new Lux skin but accidentally bought it for myself. I don't want the skin since I don't really play Lux at all so I really just would rather get the RP back and gift her it instead of having to put down another 25$.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T22:55:42.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eeek, that really sucks! Unfortunately, we have a pretty strict [*Refund Policy*](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ) that really allow exceptions outside of using the three tokens your account is provided at creation.\n\nI feel for you since I've made my fair share of misclicks or mispurchases in games(I'm a pretty clumsy person), and I really wish there was something more we could do. Please let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
