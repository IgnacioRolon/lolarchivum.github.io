Or they can be from CN, but got banned hence they can only play cross-server, as CN and KR require citizenship to register accounts meaning you only ever get 1 account on those servers.\n\nEither way, let's not assume that they're intentionally just crossing servers to troll, because there are multiple legit scenarios to why they are at NA. Not to mention, since RIot does not endorse region locking so you can't restrict where people are playing from anyway (CN servers are not owned by Riot so they operate on a different term, hence having region locking).\n\nWhat's more important is the trolling itself. Let's not confuse the act of trolling with their national identity as the latter is really not relevant.","replies":[{"poster":"IlCapoDelSalotto","date":"2017-10-19T12:22:48.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had to refresh so might have repeated myself.\n\nNo one gets to 1k ms while playing in their own server, I hardly believe that. And if they do, they shouldn't play in the first place before fixing it. And you don't seem to get my point either.\n\nThey can even be born in my own city and now live on the other side of the world, but after they spam their *extremely high* ping then start laughing, turn around after a fight starts, run up to the enemies after every respawn and just sit there waiting to be killed, and thanks to daddy google translate see them flaming me in chinese while throwing some english-like insults, that goes beyond the normal troll, at least for me.\n\nIt's like someone coming near me just to dump a load besides me instead of doing it in their comfortable bush near them.\n\nAnd yeah, lee's build should say everything.\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/1j67bn.png\n","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-10-19T13:59:07.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You miss the part where I was saying there are other scenarios possible for cross-server play to happen, and that there's nothing wrong with cross-server play itself considering Riot actively voices against region locking.\n\nYou also miss the point entirely many times now, the point is that their whatever identity (or perceived identity) has nothing to do with their trolling (or perceived trolling), and you are probably putting too much emphasis on it.\n\nThe rabbit hole goes deeper than this, since you don't even know what they were saying 80% of the time (and none of us were there) so I can even make the argument of negative bias where you might just be thinking the worst of them purely out of assumptions, but I digress. Trolls are just trolls, report them like any other fucking trolls you see; there is no reason to pull it out to whip uniquely while using their background like a spotlight, it's absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"IlCapoDelSalotto","date":"2017-10-19T17:10:09.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I sure can't think well of a lee building like that.
