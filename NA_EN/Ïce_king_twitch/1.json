Today I invite you on a journey of discovery, for today we will be venturing out to observe the Silver-Ranked Assassin Main in its natural habitat.\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}} Now as may not be aware, the Silver-Ranked Assassin Main might appear dangerous, but is actually quite harmless. Still, let&#039;s do our best not to disturb them, so we can observe their natural behavior!\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}} Note the numerous posters on the outside of the subject&#039;s habitat. These seem to be some sort of indication that the subject&#039;s sire and dame should not enter the dwelling, and attempts to signal a particular fondness for the rhythmic screeching patterns known as &quot;screamo music&quot;.\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}} Quite strange! However, our journey doesn&#039;t stop here. Let&#039;s take a look inside!\r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} Oh my fucking god, ganked again! This fucking jungler is no help! *typing noises* This is why I&#039;m in elo hell! *munch munch* Fucking noob, doesn&#039;t he fucking see I&#039;m carrying! They don&#039;t understand! Just like my parents don&#039;t understand me!! Mom, bring me some more doritos!!\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}} Sneaky, sneaky! Better not make too much noise, or he&#039;ll notice us! Luckily, the scent of his own filthy laundry and unwashed body mask even my stench! Let&#039;s try and get a closer look at what he&#039;s signalling there...\r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} &quot;report khazix for ks!!! noob no help! Fucking nooblords at this elo, my Zed can 1v1 any of you!!&quot;\r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} I&#039;m the fucking best! Faker should ask ME for lessons!! I&#039;m only 1/9 because of my shit team never helping!\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}} Yeesh! That&#039;s filthy enough to make a sewer rat blush! But let&#039;s see how he reacts when the dame shows up...\r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} Mom!!! Mom!! Ugh, she never does ANYTHING for me!!!\r\n\r\n{{champion:37}} Sweetie, I brought your Doritos. Can you and your friends hold it down a little bit? Grandma Sue is over, and she has a headache from her weekend in Vegas.\r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} Oh my god, mom!!! I&#039;m playing a competitive game! If I keep winning I&#039;ll be a pro gamer, I can&#039;t focus on containing my emotions! Why don&#039;t you understand me!!\r\n\r\n{{champion:37}} Oh, you kids and your games *chuckles*. I&#039;m getting Taco Bell for dinner, any requests?\r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} ...Fine... bring me two chalupas... and a taco. With extra mild sauce.\r\n\r\n{{champion:37}} *Rubs the Silverrank&#039;s hair* Sure thing. I&#039;ll let you know when we&#039;re back.\r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} Whatever. OH MY GOD WOW THIS FUCKING JUNGLER STILL WON&#039;T WARD OR GANK FOR ME GG REPORT UDYR.\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}} Wards? Uh-oh... we&#039;d better skidaddle before he decides to buy nothing but pink wards and spots us!\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}} Well, there you have it! Truly, these are majestic creatures, more afraid of their team then they are of you! Let&#039;s not be too hard on them, shall we? They&#039;re only doing their best! ...Even if their best is Silver V. I&#039;m out for now, but I&#039;ll be back with more exciting stories of the creatures of LoL!","replies":[]}
