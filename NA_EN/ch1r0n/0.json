There are problems doing from a format where you only need to change a few lines of code when certain criteria to having to manufacture, sell and distribute physical objects.  It happened with Urf, too.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons why Riot would run out of that Thresh figure:\n\n1.  Underestimated demand.  Could happen.\n2.  Budget.  The merch team could have made all the figures they could afford.\n\nStill sucks that you have to wait for a chance at one, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ch1r0n","date":"2015-10-01T04:49:52.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Danke Schon Sarutobi.
