When is it worth it? We all know the game is different each and every game and builds require tuning but let&#039;s think in a general average sense for now.\r\n\r\nAegis is +200 Health, +20 Magic Resist with a +20 Magic Resist and +75% base Health Regen\r\nLocket is +400 Health, +20 Magic Resist with a +20 Magic Resist and +75% base Health Regen but now comes with a team shield that does 50(+10 per lvl) \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t see this as being worth it what so ever until end game simply because it is too big of a blow to not have at least Aegis but some people INSIST I finish the Locket basically anytime after obtaining Aegis. \r\n\r\nWith all that being said what do you guys think? I&#039;m more than happy to finish it&#039;s full build if the general consensus agrees, but I just don&#039;t see it.","replies":[{"poster":"Teachan","date":"2015-06-04T16:41:58.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cdr, extra health and active make it more than worth it.  Do you need to finish it? No, but the assumption is when someone builds aegis they go to locket right away.  Any damage prevention is worth it (in this case only 900 gold).  \n\n\nPersonally, I don't play many supports that build Aegis vs say Mikael's or Righteous Glory.  But if I do end up building it, I rush it.  The active is stronger in mid game more so than late as people don't have full builds where the shield would get destroyed.  At the very least, in mid game it'll hold for a bit more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-06-04T15:18:27.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they increased the Cooldown Reduction on Locket, or possibly even buffed the aura, then I would like the item much more. It just seems very underwhelming, especially considering other item possibilities.","replies":[]}]}
