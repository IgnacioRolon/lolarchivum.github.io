Now I don&#039;t think that we should already complain about his numbers being too high while he&#039;s still in the pbe, though I wanted to make a suggestion about his new ultimate.\r\n\r\nThe thing is: I have been looking forward for a hero like this to be introduced into League for years, seeing as Rubick was my favorite character to have ever existed in any kind of MOBA. So now my question is... why can Sylas only steal ults? The thing about Rubick that makes him so much fun to play is the fact that he can copy the last spell your enemy used and not just your ultimate. Why doesn&#039;t Sylas work like that? It would come with several advantages:\r\n\r\nFirstly, it would allow his enemies some counterplay, which would make it so much less frustrating to play against him\r\n\r\nSecondly, he would be able to steal a wider variety of spells, allowing him to be so much more flexible and interesting to play\r\n\r\nThirdly, and maybe most importantly, it would make him feel SO MUCH BETTER! It would be so incredibly satisfying when you finally manage to steal the ult you wanted. It would require timing and skill and positioning to get what you want. Additionally the whole theme would be so much more interesting. He would actually feel like a spell slining mage who throws his enemies&#039; spells back at them because he has to wait for them to actually cast them. Now it&#039;s basically just &quot;Oh I guess I&#039;ll take this now&quot; without any interaction between the champions. \r\n\r\nOf course these changes would need the casttime of the ult to be low, and probably the cooldown early would have to be adjusted and the individual cooldown per enemy removed, but other than that I can&#039;t help but feel that this change would make him better to play in so many aspects?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Did I not consider something? I&#039;d really love to hear a reason why this wouldn&#039;t be a good idea.\r\n\r\nHave a great day!\r\nArx77","replies":[{"poster":"Fízz v2","date":"2019-01-12T19:56:22.951+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Idk but in terms of playing Sylas, I think I prefer his current ult tbh. being able to steal everything would make him a lot harder to balance and weirder to play","replies":[{"poster":"Arx77","date":"2019-01-12T20:04:11.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Harder to play? yeah probably.\nWeirder to play? I think it would be harder to get used to yes.\n\nBut more rewarding to play? I really believe so, both for him and his enemies. But I'm biased, I admit. Though I don't think he would be harder to balance. The average strength of spells for him would be lower than for his enemies, who have the necessary kit, so he at least wouldn't be overpowered. But the average strength of spells would be pretty decent, making it quite possible to balance him in the end. Though I'm no expert, just putting an idea out here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lollordFrozen","date":"2019-01-12T20:10:20.605+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about we stuff Rubik into a teddy bear suit and smuggle him into league!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-01-13T00:34:55.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that would be a great idea and a potential way to balance him.\nRight now, with free choice between 5 ults, he will be broken unless his base kit sucks, in which case he will feel bad to play.\nThere are many Insane ults that get baalnced by a medicore base kit, if you can acces them easily without paying for it with the rest of you're kit, it's absurd.\nHaveing the rubik mechanic would mean you#re opponents have more controll over when you can acces their ult and by quickly casting another spell afterwards they cand deny it to you, makeing it not as free to get you're hands on powerfull ults.","replies":[{"poster":"Arx77","date":"2019-01-13T11:12:09.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! I'm glad you agree!\n\nMy concern was really mostly the fact that he could choose between ultimates freely and whenever he felt like it.\n\nThough for me it's not even the balance aspect that's the most important one. I just feel like it would be so none-interactive. His ult is a point-and-click ability, and I 100% agree with that decision, but I feel like that makes it so bad to play against, especially since you don't even need your ult for him to steal it. On the other hand, if he stole the last spell used then there would be this interaction, forcing people to immediately use other spells after using their ult. On the other hand, it would allow for mind games in lane. \n\nFor example: Let's say he's toplane, fighting against Jax. Do you really want to give him the counter strike? Probably not. On the other hand, his leapstrike would make him more mobile and maybe threaten a quick trade where he could use it to leap out.\n\nOr midlane against for example a Lux. If Lux uses her ult and is close enough, then Sylas will almost always manage to copy it since she has quite the high cast time, so she might want to be careful that it really leads to a killing blow.\n\nOr a Malzahar. Now it doesn't matter who he casts his ult on since Sylas will always be able to take his ult. With these changes Sylas would only be able to copy the ult if Malzahar didn’t ult him, so now Malzahar has to decide whether he uses his ult on the adc and lets his ult get taken, whether he uses it on Sylas or whether he waits until Sylas copies something else before using his ult on the adc, now not letting it get copied.\n\nI'm getting of track, but I just wanted to express the potential I see in this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snarf of thunder","date":"2019-01-12T19:45:22.743+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well even if it was a great idea, what makes you think riot will even pay attention to this?

Balance is not one of the purposes of the PBE (Riot says the PBE population is too small for that).\n\nLoL has had a concept of stealing some kind of spells - specifically, Summoner Spells, with Zoe, and that champion is a trainwreck that Riot released specifically because she makes hate the game and this somehow makes them more addicted to it. Stealing ults at will is going to be literally impossible to balance. Can you imagine if Ez's ult was 200 units wide one match, and then 500 units wide the next? Inconsistent; unreliable. Sylas takes that to 11. LoL is not DotA, and Sylas is a terrible idea, but he'll be released anyway, just like Zoe, the Akali rework, original Aatrox, and every other loony idea Riot comes up with.","replies":[{"poster":"Arx77","date":"2019-01-13T13:47:28.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of my idea is partially to bring consistency into inconsistency, by giving so many options that the average outcome is still consistent.
