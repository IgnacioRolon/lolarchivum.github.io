It's only happened twice, but I'm afraid of the consequences. You see, I'm visiting my aunt's house for a while and when we have nothing to do I pull out my computer and play some LOL. So I have no control on the internet. How many times until I get punished for being a leaver? Lately, I feel like I should just stop playing so I can avoid this, but again... LOL is basically my life. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-27T18:28:06.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You won't receive a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) if it's just for one game, but it's likely to happen if it continues the way you mention.  It may be best to not use matchmaking modes for now unless you know your connection is going to be stable.  If it's alright with your aunt, you could do some troubleshooting unless the issue is specifically with the ISP.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
