Every time I click it, it causes the game to shut down. Super fun! \r\n\r\nAs much as you guys might like the new client, I fucking hate it. Please let me use the old client. It is far better than this new shit that is full of fun bugs and removed features.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have this problem? How did you fix it?\r\n\r\nOnly way I can get the old client to launch is to go into the riot games folder on my computer and search for the old client logo then launch as Admin. But if I try to make that link a shortcut, nothing works anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T18:04:19.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds to me like a security setting is preventing the patcher from launching , and having to run as admin further affirms that.  Go through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure both versions are allowed to launch and scan game files.  You can also launch the legacy client manually:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
