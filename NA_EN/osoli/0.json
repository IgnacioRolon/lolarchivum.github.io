Could this mean that tanky midlane champs like lissandra can shutdown the assassin midlane or can be a new counter for the adc buff happening next patch. What do yall think am i wrong or &quot;right&quot; i want to know the communities opinion and see if a more diverse roster in the midlane come about.","replies":[]}
