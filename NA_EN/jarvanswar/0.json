The Lux situation im refering to is her Voice actor coming to do some VO for a skin, and also later being asked to update the base VO while she was there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReisenTheDos","date":"2017-04-17T09:16:51.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of champions that got visual updates but not voice over updates, was there a reasoning why Miss Fortune wasn't given a new voice over during the Bilgewater event?

(This is also known as \"royalties.\")  Just imagine how much Riot would have to pay Carrie Keranen in royalties for her performance as Lux and you might understand why Riot's jobs are non-Union.\n\nSo, in theory, Riot Games will negotiate a one-time session fee for a Voice Actor that might pay _more_ than a similar Union job, but would give up any future claims on royalties.  Anime VOs are another form of \"non-union\" job, which explains why there's a lot of crossover between anime and video games.\n\nNow, there are some unionized voice actors that do non-union work, provided that their name is kept secret.  (A big rumor is that Yorick's VA is one of these union actors.)\n\nStill, if Shen's VA has joined the union since he last worked with Riot, he might not be able to return for another performance.\n\nI hope that makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"JarvansWAR","date":"2017-04-11T01:55:28.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They never mentioned their system reflecting the Union system, so I suppose the VAs are contracted to a specific set of rules.

Some, like the last Ryze rework which went to Sean Schemmel (Goku from _DBZ_), was an audition process.  Others appear to be a \"let's ask who we think fits best and make them an offer,\" sort of process.\n\n>After all, they do get paid quite well and so far no VAs have had an issue with it.\n\nWe don't know for sure how well they get paid, since every contract is different.  I would hope, with the now very lengthy number of potential lines they have to say, that Riot's compensation has increased as much.\n\nAnd the only VAs that have had an issue with Riot's methods are the ones that declined to work with them. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AtaxiChaos","date":"2017-04-11T02:56:24.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_ACTUALLY_  there currently are no royalties for gaming, which is a big deal and one of several reasons that there's a gaming VO strike going on right now.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-04-11T13:26:03.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AtaxiChaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=G0EEY4dE,comment-id=00010000000000000001,timestamp=2017-04-11T02:56:24.031+0000)\n>\n> _ACTUALLY_  there currently are no royalties for gaming, which is a big deal and one of several reasons that there&#x27;s a gaming VO strike going on right now.\n\nI'm aware of this.
