I believe there will  always be a massive disconnect between champions when some can make extremely efficient purchases while others must settle for lackluster benefits when comparing similar gold leads with similar types of champions. For example: Zed can snowball out of control since all he needs is lethality and cdr, both easily accessible in conjunction with each other.  Meanwhile Talon can get an early advantage and do similar to Zed, but Talon cannot sustain very long without sheen. This lack of early lethality makes Talon less deadly, but more capable of out sustaining his enemy.\n\n\nThere should be more tier 2/3-4 options for items. There should, preferably, be a tier 2 item for almost any tier 1 item combination. Mana crystal + Longsword? Potentially perfect tier 2 item for talon, especially over sheen for very early game gold efficiency for example.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Semaj3xt4h","date":"2019-10-21T12:50:10.686+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bans are garbage, get rid of the bench, that's why you see so many of the same champions because people don't want to get out of their comfort zone anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-10-21T13:39:17.388+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"Aram accounts are a non issue.
