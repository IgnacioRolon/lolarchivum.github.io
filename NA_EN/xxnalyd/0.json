However, I think I did find the cause of it while browsing. This account had clairvoyance selected the last time I used it (I know, I was a noob, I thought it was good), but now when I try to play a game on summoner's rift in good ole 2017 I only have one spell. It doesn't allow me to choose a second spell, and repair tool did not correct this.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T22:05:50.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeeeeiiiiiird, this account must have been inactive for a good minute to be having this problem. No worries, we *should* be able to clear this up with a quick config reset by following the steps below. If this doesn't help, however, feel free to hit me back up and I can do a little more digging for you!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxNalyd","date":"2017-09-24T10:26:31.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping for my desire to play with two summs :(","replies":[]}]}
