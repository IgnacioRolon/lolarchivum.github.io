She has a few semi-weak early levels and high mana costs as currently tuned, and I think that is fair because if you get her an early {{item:3003}} she is one of the hardest-scaling late game supports in the game.  \n\nI am M6 working on M7 with her, and to me it often feels unfair to the enemy team when I am {{champion:37}} on a large lead.  All of her spells are good and her cooldowns are insanely low.  All of her damage is 100% guaranteed within its range, on point-and-click autoattacks or a literal press-one-button spell with no skillshots required on a spammable 3-second late-game cooldown.  She has a major two-champion heal that gives a spammable team shield on a 4-second late game cooldown.  She has escapability through a major movespeed buff on 6-second late game cooldown.  She has an ultimate that's a team stun once per minute late game.  And her technicals are not difficult as League mechanics go - any champion is a difficult pilot at a high skill level, but  {{champion:37}} isn't exactly {{champion:142}}, she's a one-difficulty champ who was designed as a forgiving support for newer players.\n\nSo I think if she weren't as weak early as she is she'd be absolutely oppressive, because she's pretty oppressive now when played correctly.\n\nHer natural late-game formation is the deathball, and it would be really neat to see some pro teams take a chance on her with some of the {{champion:145}}/{{champion:110}}-style late game deathball comps that were popular mid-Season 8 in some scrims or early matches in Season 9.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-12-18T22:56:41.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one of the best utility supports =/= strong heals or even strong in general.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aseraan","date":"2018-12-17T19:29:02.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sry by spam i wanted to say stands  next to tower and  healing the adc every time he she isnt full.\nAnyway i will not go into hypotesis like the chance of a xerath q hitting every enemy at onec.\n\nWhere i stand is ap supps  are far more  interactive and  dangerous to play than a  healer/shielder  cuz if i want to build dame i have to keep poking or i will fall down  quick not even talking about how i have little to no excape if i get caught out.\n\nWhere is if  i say playing a healer/shileder picking coin and then afk the whole game and still having 30 assist.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-12-17T23:10:40.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An ap support will be in more danger versus an ap support than versus a healer support and healer supports will be in more danger versus an ap support than versus a healer support.

The thing is With damage so high there is no point in putting healing or shielding into a front liner which is why it all goes into the adc or mage because by keeping them up they instagib more things more reliably. which wins fights versus a fighter/ tank getting 2 more auto attacks in while their spells are still on cooldown and they are easily focusable.\n\nAnother reason why healers dont want to get into range to interact is that riot absolutely shreds their base defenses and gives them no good defensive options (almost all their items being defensive doesnt make those options good) which means one combo from that 'interactive' ap support with super low mana costs and cooldown will kill them every time thus why would you want to walk into that.","replies":[{"poster":"Aseraan","date":"2018-12-17T23:41:03.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is all nice and all but  in game i still face greedy utility supports who wants to be a dps and builds  ap  regardless the IDEA behind the role.","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2018-12-19T23:59:04.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have AP scaling on your Shield ability.
