Now, I was going to disenchant Slayer Jinx and Battlecast Ward for it, but I would end up with 669 Yellow Essence total, and I need 675 Essence. So I was wondering if you guys, Riot, could sooomehow give me 6 Yellow Essence, cause it's bugging me sooo much, and I finally got a skin for my Singed. :DD\r\nIf that's possible, or okay with you guys, of course! ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T00:49:10.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, friend, but we are unable to give you essence, neither orange nor blue. :(\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"GrimmBones","date":"2016-12-01T14:33:02.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aww, oh well.
