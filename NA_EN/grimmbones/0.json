(Updated)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played a ranked game, we finished it, and, you know when the post-game screen won't load, so it only says to skip it? Well, that popped up, then League just crashed all of a sudden, and whenever I log in, it says that I have to Reconnect to a game that has already been finished, and, when I click Reconnect, it just says that I should check my internet connection and try again. :/\r\n\r\nUpdate: Now I can enter my client now, however, it didn't record my last ranked game, both in the match history and LP wise. :/\r\nI should be at around 100 LP, but it says I'm at 87. I was at 66 LP after losing the promotion, and I won 2 in a row. Only the 1st one has been documented in the Client, and I gained around 21 LP, thus I'm at 87 LP, but should have gained additional 20+ LP from the second won game, but for some reason I didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Zoom 9x","date":"2016-09-27T13:13:00.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have the same problem, I wonder if we will get that LP. :(","replies":[{"poster":"GrimmBones","date":"2016-09-28T21:21:05.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably not, tbh. But oh well. Guess shit happens. :'D\nHopefully, if you and I are lucky, this same bug will happen to lost games, so you don't get your LP reduced. :'DD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-27T15:20:34.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This situation sounds like a ghost game issue, when a match has ended but it's not able to communicate that with our servers.  This can cause some players to get stuck at the reconnect screen until communication is re-established.  Usually re-logging can help force it along, but other times you may just have to wait until the end of the match is communicated which can take up to an hour.  \n\nUnfortunately, a side effect that could sometimes happen is the match not being saved.  There's still a possibility that the game info can push forward, but I can't make any guarantees for these ghost games.  Hopefully, everything will update but if not I wish you the best in your matches going forward!","replies":[{"poster":"GrimmBones","date":"2016-09-28T21:17:31.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I just checked. I still don't have that game in the Match History, and I didn't get the LP. But I guess it can't be helped. I'll try to play some more games, hopefully they get through. :'D\nAnd thanks, both for explaining and wishing me the bust in the upcoming matches! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Subhuman Trash","date":"2016-09-27T15:01:12.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me aswell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ikariajim","date":"2016-09-27T14:49:15.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same think here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomosima","date":"2016-09-27T14:16:24.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got the same problem won an ranked game and got no lp cant do anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPortos","date":"2016-09-27T12:06:01.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"got the same problem as you","replies":[]}]}
