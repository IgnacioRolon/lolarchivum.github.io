This confuses me because the next day (today) i queued by myself, my teammate got an s, but i didn't get a hextech chest. How exactly does the chest/key system work? Do you have to be queued with the person that got an s to get a chest even though you didn't get an s that game?","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-11T02:47:25.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You also need to own the champ you are playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T01:51:21.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do need to be in a premade with someone who gets an S in order to get a chest for it.
