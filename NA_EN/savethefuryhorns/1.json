No champion portraits. just usernames, background image, the champion boxes [the red box] and then it sits there. Is there any reason for this?\r\n\r\nTried using replay.gg and all I got was a bug splat for every replay.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, at the bottom of the replay, it shows Client 6.13 =S\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"yahiya","date":"2016-07-26T18:27:12.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem except it doesn't  even open loading screen just  bug splat  whenever i start a replay","replies":[{"poster":"SaveTheFuryhorns","date":"2016-07-26T20:08:43.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=yahiya,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=YiPVbwib,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-26T18:27:12.355+0000)\n>\n> I have the same problem except it doesn&#x27;t  even open loading screen just  bug splat  whenever i start a replay\n\nThat's what happens when I use replay.gg.
