I see it from November patches, and Riot even had a Live Problem board going for it, where it was supposedly resolved, but now I'm experiencing these problems.\r\n\r\nAside from doing a full repair, are there any other solutions I can try?\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T21:59:24.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, these emote errors can really be a pain. Especially when they're supposed to be so much fun for people to use!! I've seen those EM01/03 errors clear up by either relogging or clearing their config settings, but they could also happen from the client not being able to sync up with the servers to save or download those settings. That 003 error is a pretty typical sign of something blocking your connection from reaching our servers, so I'd like to start troubleshooting that first for sure.\n\nDo me a favor, and check out these steps on how you can configure or troubleshoot your firewalls/antivirus-> [**Troubleshooting Firewalls**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3). Be sure to let me know if that helps or doesn't so I can guide you through a few other possible fixes! Sometimes we need to narrow down what the problem *isn't* before we can find out what's really causing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaveTheFuryhorns","date":"2018-01-20T03:02:58.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: I downloaded the entire game over, and am still experiencing the same issues. I've changed my DNS, and kept my firewall disabled, but nothing has helped so far. At least I can play the game now, but still suffering issues with my runes, emotes, and sometimes I can't press \"Play\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaveTheFuryhorns","date":"2018-01-18T00:57:56.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw geez, thanks. I tried doing the full repair, and that failed on me, so I'm glad you got back to me. I turned off my firewall, and now it appears to be patching. (At least it's showing the bar now, even though it's at 0% still but will keep an eye on it)\n\nI can even log in now. Will update if it doesn't move from 0% (It just went to 1%!! woo!)\n\nEDIT 1: The Emotes still aren't working, and are giving me the two errors, but I'm hoping the patch will fix it :)\n\nEDIT 2: Getting Error EM05 now =S","replies":[]}]}
