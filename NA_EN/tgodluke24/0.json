Came home excited to purchase the new Super Galaxy Kindred. I get in game lock in kindred and come to find out I purchased the wrong skin. I accidently purchased Super Galaxy Shyvanna , a skin for a champion I never play. I would really apriactie it if you could help a fellow player out, as I'm out of refunds.","replies":[{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2016-06-11T04:12:41.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of off topic, but that skin that you DID buy is actually one of the best ones for that champion.  Might as well use it IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-11T01:17:41.013+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do here :(  Every time you click to purchase a skin in the store, another dialogue box comes up and confirms that this is the action you want to take.  If you are out of refund tokens, you will need to wait until you can buy the skin again.\n\nI wish I had better news and could help out >.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rolling Girl","date":"2016-06-13T10:54:52.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best bet would be to submit a support ticket. Maybe they'll cut you some slack then but I doubt they can do anything from posting on the boards alone. Best of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neru84","date":"2016-06-11T00:20:07.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, they cant give you anymore refunds. Every account can only have 3 refunds the system is made that way and maybe they will give you rp or something idk lol","replies":[]}]}
