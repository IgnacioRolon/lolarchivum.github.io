Even unrealistic scenarios that are incredibly biased in favor of the burn still churn out horribly low numbers.\n\nYou'd think that if you pump up a target's HP enough and lower their MR enough, eventually Liandry's will do some crazy high DPS, right? But it doesn't, because it deals %current HP, and it doesn't apply until after the target gets nuked by whatever spell triggered Liandry's, and it deals damage in half-second ticks so any amount of MR can just nullify it completely. The more AP you have, the weaker Liandry's burn gets. The more MR your target has, the weaker Liandry's burn gets. The more damage the burn does, the weaker it gets.\n\nI remember doing the math for Malzahar's E back when Liandry's burn got buffed. On a movement impaired target with 3000 health and 0 effective MR, using a max rank E with only Liandry's for AP, the Liandry's burn did less than 70 damage over its full duration. Teemo's mushrooms would be significantly less, since the DoT duration is the same, but has a higher base damage and AP ratio.\n\nAs a testament to how horribly weak this item's effect is, there was an entire patch where it literally did not function at all, and nobody noticed until the patch notes said it was fixed.\n\ntl;dr Liandry's sucks, the burn is the worst effect in the game, the item is only good because it gives Mpen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2016-04-11T22:47:37.561+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":2,"body":"Remember the first to fall!\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a8/Deathfire_Grasp_item.png/revision/latest?cb=20130731230043","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-04-12T01:54:33.795+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{champion:86}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2016-04-12T00:22:48.926+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"RIP DFG\n\nIronically, old DFG is probably better than literally any mage item in the game after this rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreampod","date":"2016-04-12T06:15:11.443+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old DFG is probably better than literally any mage item in the game NOW.\n\nThere is a reason it got removed from the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-04-11T20:05:54.693+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":19,"body":"Zhonya's will also be cheaper so that's a plus.\n\nBuff to Hextech gunblade is nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Apostle of Light","date":"2016-04-11T20:10:28.498+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like that it's cheaper but I'm worried about the late game.

Who will probably be trash unless they reduce their mana costs massively, or make complete rework to the entire Mana Regen mages into AP burst/assassins.\n\nRiot's entire ''we want Mages' casts to be more more meaninful instead of just spam with 'infinite mana''' entire premise is horribly flawed because for years they have been pumping mages that have different kits with _very_ different spell weights and mana efficiency. They cant just go and reduce/remove mana regen and except mages to literally fight against the current because while AD champions get ludicrously good itemization.\n\nRiot just saying ''cast wisely, mages lolololololol'' wont magically make Syndra's Q, Orianna's Q or Karma's Q deal more damage.","replies":[{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2016-04-12T02:20:00.729+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"JHC wait for the mage update.

However, paradoxically - it also favors very low cost spells in order to stack it up. This iteration swaps out the minor regeneration for a very powerful effective mana cost reduction for truly painful spells.\n\nThe Awe passive is kept on every Tear of the Goddess upgrade.

This additional item is intended to support very aggressive lane patterns by providing some of the old pressure patterns that Catalyst enabled while still fulfilling a mage's primary damage line.\n\n**Chalice of Harmony** {{item:3028}} \n\n**Passive remade**: Increases your Health Regeneration by 100% if your Health % is lower than your Mana %. **Increases your Mana Regeneration by 100% if your Mana % is lower than your Health %.**\nMikael's Crucible and Athene's Unholy Grail gain this passive instead of Mana Font\nOne of the relationships I want to break up with this pass is the attachment of Flat Mana to Mana Regeneration. Additionally, we're going to siphon some of the sustain out of bot lane in 6.9 and thus introducing a fairly powerful option to solve whatever sustain that you need early on.","replies":[]}]}]}
