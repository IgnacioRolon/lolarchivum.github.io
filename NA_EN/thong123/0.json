They are supposed to send you an email explaining the situation and why you were banned, I received no such email. On top of that, I rarely ever play on this account, maybe once every month or so, maybe more. So I have literally no idea why I would be banned. Absolutely ridiculous. I don&#039;t even talk in my games, I mute everyone at the start of the games, just listen to music, and play. That&#039;s it.

This guy chose the ridiculously immature title \"just got permanently banned for no reason lol\"  ... really? No reason at all? He clearly didn't know the reason, so why say no reason? And then lol? Why is it funny? Why would you laugh at loud while telling people about your problem? Why go into detail on how he never chats and plays on the account? I don't know... these are all things that people might downvote for. Just comes off as a whiney, premature, attention seeking post. He could easily wait for a response from support.
