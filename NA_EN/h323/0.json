If I've contradicted myself or used imprecise language, my apologies. I'm just a guy.\n\nThe point I'm trying to get across is that Riot's stance on negativity in-game is NOT zero-tolerance, unless that negativity involves hate speech or calls for violence. The original post here shows VERY minor negativity, which I would be EXTREMELY surprised to see trigger any punishment whatsoever. \n\nSpeaking up for yourself isn't punishable if done REASONABLY. I had a bad game yesterday in which I badly lost my lane, and my jungler asked for me to be reported for inting in /all chat. I told him I wasn't trolling and I'm simply having a bad game (and lagging a bit). I didn't feel the need to immediately mute and report him. The line not to be crossed is when \"speaking up for yourself\" becomes engaging in a flame-war that takes over the chat log. THAT is punishable. \n\nIf my explanation here isn't sufficient for you, link me the thread where I stated otherwise and I'll do my best to reconcile my posts for your information.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-10-25T20:10:56.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally?
