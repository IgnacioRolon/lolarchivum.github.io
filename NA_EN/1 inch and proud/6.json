Why should number of reports matter in regards to punishments? Do you really, legitimately want the IFS to autopunish you if you're reported by 9 people?\n\nReporting is there so that players can ping Riot through the IFS that someone's behavior is unsportsmanlike, in breach of the rules, or otherwise making the game un-fun. The reason that the amount of reports doesn't matter is because _having a system that would punish people simply for being reported by x number of players per-game would be unfair and ultimately broken._\n\nPlayers are punished for their behavior, _not_ for the amount of reports they receive.\n\n> Why you and Riot try to say it would be so stupidly designed that one guy crying is the same as 9 people reporting a guy?\n\nLikewise, I don't understand what you mean here.\n\nIf mass-reports mattered in regards to punishments, then the system would be fundamentally broken - people could just spam reports against anyone and everyone and inevitably, with enough people doing the same thing, the system would start issuing a lot of punishments to players who don't deserve it.\n\nOne report is the same as nine reports; it's a boolean flag, meaning that the IFS checks for one of two values. Either zero, which indicates that no report was filed, or any value greater than zero, indicating that a player has been reported. After that, the number of reports _do not matter_. The player's behavior does.\n\nAnd that's not stupid design. It makes it so that people can't abuse the system by rallying for mass reports to ensure one person gets punished when they don't deserve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Aryan MasterRage","date":"2019-08-14T02:21:24.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Why should number of reports matter in regards to punishments?\n\nIsn't it obvious? Because pissing off 9 people by verbal abuse is worse than pissing off one person? Or 9 people thinking a guy is feeding means that the guy was actually more likely to be feeding compared to being reported by only one person? Since IFS is bad to detect verbal abuse and especially feeding, utilizing the report data should be a priority.\n\n> Do you really, legitimately want the IFS to autopunish you if you're reported by 9 people?\n\nNo autopunish but getting reported by only 1 party shouldn't even trigger a review. It's just someone being mad. Getting more reports should push the person closer to the punishment threshold.\n\n> Players are punished for their behavior, not for the amount of reports they receive.\n\nWhy not just remove reporting and review everyone then?\n\n> If mass-reports mattered in regards to punishments, then the system would be fundamentally broken - people could just spam reports against anyone and everyone and inevitably, with enough people doing the same thing, the system would start issuing a lot of punishments to players who don't deserve it.\n\nCould be solved by limiting the reports. Let's say you get 1 report per game and you can have max 10 reports stacked. Or disqualifying the reports from players who report much more than average.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-08-04T14:07:47.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More like 9 reports is the same as 1 report.\n\nThe system operates with the statement \"if report count > 0, review the game\".

That means Riot decides, not a premade who wants to troll you by getting you punished. I dont think you gave it enough thought. Its about the behavior, not amount of reports. Thats how it should be. I dont know how you cant seethat, I have a feeling you just didnt thinkit through enough though. That happens, its all good.

I know that ever since the 'Teemo/Mid support' incident that chatroom has since been removed but can't help but call out the fact that Riot has been pandering and giving special treatment to certain individuals and only dulling out fair punishments when this biasness gets screenshotted.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-08-05T06:51:51.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sounds like he was attempting to get good with new champions in ranked, which is a obvious no-no to me... but that's just conjecture and not in master's.
