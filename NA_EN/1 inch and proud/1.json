(Gets even worse when you factor in that the enemy team might give reduced kill gold, considering they are behind)\n\nHowever, which invisibility mechanics have no counterplay? There are a lot of true sight abilities in the game, control wards vs stealth and sweeper also always works. So not sure where the \"no counter play\" part is.","replies":[{"poster":"Mrs Qtpie","date":"2019-07-20T06:36:17.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Unseen Threąt,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IhTaTcZE,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-07-20T06:33:05.272+0000)\n>\n> I think the shutdown mechanics right now are super boring, as being ahead forces you to be extremely cautious, as getting 3 kills and dying for it isnt even worth if you have a high shutdown.
