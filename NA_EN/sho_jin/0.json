This lost me some lp because i could never tell when it was going to dc me out. Also got a low priority que due to this, Can riot at least remove my low priority? They already owe me at least 20 LP from a game where i got registered as a leaver,  but i participated and got my lane (bot lane, was support) snowballing. So unfair","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-05T00:24:33.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DeadEyeGamer, \n\nSo you may have a problem where Client isn't connecting with your computer.
