Though I do agree on skins like KDA Akali, which is a bit too 'trashy' even by most game companies' standards I feel.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Apathy","date":"2019-07-01T00:58:23.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was just a joke... ;)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shädäm","date":"2019-07-01T11:45:53.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her succes builds on the fact that Riot leeches on the anime style recently. I'm not saying its bad, considering I'm a weeb myself, but they learned that pumping out edgelords and \"anime characters\" will just bring more popularity, and they left behind their original style that actually made me, and I'm sure a lot of other people like the world of Runeterra. Its the Demacian paladin style, the much darker Knightly style of Noxus, their own unique species of Yordles and all that. It was just fun to see all these different worlds being present in one. But recent champions just made the game more flat and boring. Pyke is an exception, for his style was totally amazing and unique, but I feel like his idea of coming back from the dead and take revenge on his enemies has been done before on anothe pirate ( {{champion:41}} )","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shädäm","date":"2019-07-01T00:41:41.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Maybe go back to the fuckign drawing board and maybe spend more than 2 days for designing a champion.

Yeah, like Ahri, being a charmster, or Evelyn basicly being a sex-whore-demon. That is reasonable. But why would a girl who got into the void and was figthing to survuve every single day would wear skintight suit and have a giant cleavage. And remember that Riot designers had to say sorry to the public for going too far in sexualization, but it looks like they never fucking learn.\n\nOr just look at characters that never had to be oversexualized to be famous (both male and female): Lux has not a single skin with giant cleavages and skintight latex suits. Again, Ahri is considerably humble. And did we ever see Garens form? Never! Garen is a proof that armour can be sexy.\n\nAnd yes, males can be oversexualised, just like females, but we dont see that as much of a problem. Exposed pecs or abs are common among male characters, just look at Kayn or Sylas. Thats the same case, but we are just more forgivable, because muscles are not necessarily sexual features like thighs, ass or boobs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2019-07-04T20:06:41.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Apathy,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=11MEZqdO,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-07-01T00:45:22.094+0000)\n>\n> Agree with every point, lmao the only character i would make exception for is evelynn, but the rest are basically fodder for credit card #`s\n\nI'd also put Jinx up there.
