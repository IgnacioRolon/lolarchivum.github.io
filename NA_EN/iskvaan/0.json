I can't see their pick, or the following picks. What is worse, is that eventually it comes time for me to select my champion, and I cannot select, which ultimately results in my (unwilling) dodge.  I can still type in chat and see responses, and when I am in a premade I am assured the champ select is progressing normally. The only way I have been able to escape is to close the client.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been occurring for the past couple of months, and is becoming more and more frequent, to the point of it happening two games in a row today, causing me to dodge champ select and incur LP loss. This happens when I am playing solo as well as when in a premade, both ranked and normals. I do not believe it is a problem with my ISP, because it has occurred while in a premade with my roommate, who had no such issues. There is no other connection issue that I can detect - voice chat works normally, internet browsers function normally, in-lobby chat does not lag. Only the champ select process freezes.\r\n\r\nWhen this only came up every once in a while it was only an annoyance, but with it more and more frequent it will have a serious impact on my ability to play ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T03:45:34.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm even though it doesn't happen very often, we should still take a step back and fix this up before hopping back into another matchmade game. I don't want you to end up freezing up again and getting any penalties for this.\n\nIt sounds like your client is having some hiccups every once and awhile and partially losing its connection to the game lobby you were in. When you can't select or see any champs in the lobby, it's because your network isn't able to send or receive that information to and from our servers.
