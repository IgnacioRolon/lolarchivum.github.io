You are not Katarina. Or if you wanna chase kills to clean a fight, but that happens only when the fight is already won.\n\n**Strong kiter with scaling AA range**: Yes. This is part of that late game power that makes her identity.\n\n**Waveclearing Turret Pusher**: Only in the later stages of the game. In lane, you are forced to always push, making it super easy for a lane bully to zone you away from a wave and deny you fram simply because you can't trade as Trist with a lane bully. Your job in lane is to farm, but the E's passive forces you to always push. As for **Turret Pushing**, I'm sorry but any of the above mentioned carries can destroy towers really fast if given 10 seconds to hammer them down. It's not exclusive to Trist's **Explosive Charge** nor is it her identity.\n\n**Self peeling hypercarry**: Her identity. That's it.\n\n**Strong Single Target and AoE Damage**: You are heavily overestimating what her AoE can do. Do you know why Rageblade was a great purchase for her prior to the item's rework? Because it provided you with that AoE that you naturally don't have. **Explosive Charge** needs stacks and it's on a long cooldown.

You may have a problem if you can't understand that.\n\nMy statement doesn't change: It's based around how many autos you can get. Spell stacking is not your primary source of stacking as those spells are primary tools for self peel above anything else.

I just want to drop my two cents. I care a lot about Tristana, I really do. I keep grinding large amounts of mastery points because I find her fun and I love her character. \n\nTo me (and many others), her gameplay identity is simple: **The best self peeling late game hyper carry**\nEverything else, **including tower-taking**, should be **secondary** to her. Please do **not** lose focus on this very simple concept.\n\nI don't feel tower-taking should be her core, because her kit just isn't built around sieges, laning or split pushing, rather team fighting and scaling. She has a weak laning phase, which I don't mind but it's just counter-intuitive to want to base her around taking towers when she can't even start doing it effectively before the 25th min mark. Taking towers should be a bonus (if at all present), not her identity, even more when her passive is thought out and designed to make her a powerhouse in the late game specifically. If you're going to change all of that, then the champion might as well not even be Tristana anymore and you should just make a new character.\n\nI asked Scarizard during a live Q & A on Twitch about Tristana, and he told me you guys didn't know what to do with her. That was about 7 to 9 months ago, and it was the only time a rioter talked about Trist last year.\n\nWhat I'm most sad about is not her being untouched for over a year, but rather the lack of communication and apparent apathy or negligence I sense from Riot towards the champion. Or maybe you just don't know her anymore. I've come to learn how Aatrox fans feel.\n\nI wanted to share some ideas I've had for her for a while now. Please note that I don't mean any of these as _\"Do them all\"_ but rather _\"Think about each one\"_ and I just share them in case you guy may have missed them when talking about Trist.\n\n**QOL Improvements to Rocket Jump**\n- Make it uninterruptible. She can take damage while flying, but let her always complete her jump. This I feel would do wonders for her without touching anything else on her kit.\n- Streamline how the skill works with CC. It's really frustrating to have something that looks like a jump (we know it's a dash) to be interrupted mid air by ground-based CC. It's really counter intuitive, creates really awkward situations and takes away from the \"Jumping around\" fantasy you seem to want for her.\n- Have her cast animation be faster\n- Have her travel speed be faster\n\n**Other QOL Improvements**\n- Improve her AA animation. One person in another thread pointed out how her autos are somewhat clunky, and at times feel really easy to cancel by accident. This would make her kiting better, further playing to the late game self-peeling identity I talked about before.\n- Don't have **Explosive Charge** go on cooldown if the target dies before the bomb is palced on them, which cancels the animation, the damage, but does make the skill go on cooldown and it can be a frustrating problem.\n\n**Other Ideas**\nThe game is in a state where it's important for an ADC to be able to become relevant with two and sometimes one item (BF+Runnan's for example). Trist right now reminds me of the old Gangplank, who needed about 30 mins to just get going. The old Rageblade solved many of her problems, helping her with her slow scaling and terrible base ASPD, but that's gone.\n\nI don't mind her weak laning phase, that's fine. But if the game around her has become so explosive and fast, you need to give her something that lets her compete at 20 - 25 mins, or slow down the overall pace of the game... but that's a whole different topic probably much harder to do at this time.\n\nAbout her resets: You shouldn't treat her the way you do Kah or Katarina. Her resets are mostly used to either clean fights or do that awesome self peel she can do, rather than jumping into a high risk situation just hoping to get a reset. Please **do not** turn her into a _\"Dive ADC\"_ as that's completely counter-intuitive to her passive, which rewards her from keeping her distance and then combines that with her jump to, again: Keep her safe as the best self-peel late game hypercarry.\n\nFinally, a really crazy idea: Viktor has an item unique to him. Would it be too much of a stretch to think of giving her Boomer as an actual item that scales with her and fulfilling some of the things the old Rageblade would do on her? Thematically I think is not too crazy. Her lore presents her with this line: _\"For Trist and her gun, Boomer, every mission is a chance to prove that heroes do exist\" and it would tie nicely with her passive too. (It would even make sense for Riggle getting stronger)\n\nThis identity crisis you speak of, I feel did not existe prior to her rework, and only became apparent when you guys tried to give too much importance to the tower taking aspect of her kit, which I think has come to the point of just holding her back and colliding with what everyone have always looked her as: **The best self peeling late game hyper carry**\nI think even Forg1ven or DoubleLift called her something like that at some point. Don't strive away from that. It's who she is.\n\nDo not create problems where there were non. She has a clear identity, now work towards that.\n\nI'm sad it has taken Riot this long to say anything about her, other than how nice Scarizard was that day with me answering my questions.\n\nAnyway. I'm just one player. But the main reason I still play is this champion. I can't remain silent.\nHave a nice day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-01-25T02:50:51.870+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"A risk heavy marksmen is an identity that's not explored enough in LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"NGNL Asian","date":"2017-01-25T03:15:14.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chromatic Eagle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dfBEYBNq,comment-id=0003000600000004,timestamp=2017-01-25T02:50:51.870+0000)\n>\n> A risk heavy marksmen is an identity that&#x27;s not explored enough in LoL.\n\nvayne ez etc","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2017-01-25T05:01:04.139+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ezreal is arguably the second \"least risky\" ADC with Caitlyn being the safest.

I play my lane focusing on farm so I can get to my important items ASAP so I can be effective in team fights because that's what her kit encourages me to do. There's another ADC player that agrees that's the right way of playing her.

Ezreal's dash is much faster and is usually maxed 2nd with 13 seconds at max with builds that easily get him 30-40% CDR which would put his dash's CD down to like 8 seconds and then be decreased by 1.5 seconds for every Q you land. You will see Ezreal use his Arcane shift more often in a team fight than Tristana's jump UNLESS the fight was so in Tristana's teams favor that it probably wouldn't matter. Also not to forget that Ezreal also always gets either {{item:3078}} or {{item:3025}} both of which give him great kiting ability and easily helps him stall out until his E is back up.\n\nIn Cait's case, she has a net that dashes her away and slows you, and up to 5 traps that you can place between you and her to slow you down. If you do stand in one, you basically missed your chance to catch her, but even if you go around it, it'll still slow you down enough to help her get away.\n\nYes Tristana has that ultimate but that is also an ultimate ability that has a decent CD that is generally only going to hit 1 person unless your team was bunched up chasing her in which case then you deserved it. In a 1v1 case? Sure she is technically the \"safest\" ADC. As I said before though, in worst case scenario she runs away then at least she won't be poking you from a safe distance since everything in her kit is based on auto attacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-01-25T04:01:02.858+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dark Nephthys,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dfBEYBNq,comment-id=0003000c000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T03:35:44.673+0000)\n>\n> Yes Tristana&#x27;s jump has a reset if you let her get those resets\n\nshe just needs to detonate her bomb with 4 auto attacks. thats really a small requirement.\n\nno adc has as much self peel and safety as her.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-01-25T04:21:41.742+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dfBEYBNq,comment-id=0003000c0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T04:01:02.858+0000)\n>\n> she just needs to detonate her bomb with 4 auto attacks. thats really a small requirement.\n> \n> no adc has as much self peel and safety as her.\n\nAnd then her E which is the bulk of her damage is on CD for 14 seconds with probably her Q as well since you really use both her Q and E together to get off the stacks quicker.

That was true back when he built Bloodrazor, it was true when he built Trinity into Bork.  Along with Trist, he was a bit too strong when Bloothrister got remade and all the lane bullies got nerfed as a result.  The old Trinity (into IE and a pair of PDs) gave him a pretty great late game to boot.  100% crit chance?  Not shabby.  But that was a bit of an outlier.  Kog has always been the go-to guy for really kicking it Mid-Game and scaling from there.\n\nBut Riot seemed *convinced* that he was supposed to be a late game hyper-scaler like Twitch or Vayne.  His success curve really hasn't ever been like that.  He has *always* leveled off (or even dropped) in the deep late game.  So when Riot flipped out over Kog being strong mid-game with the whole machine gun fiasco, I was pretty puzzled.  Especially since they shifted his power from late game (no base damage W with AD scaling) to early/mid (2% + 20 base damage W and no AD ratio) and were apparently shocked when that made his early/mid really strong.\n\nI've got a bit more hope that they're have figured out that Kog needs to kick in mid-game for the whole 'main damage source for your team' thing to work since they improved his W base damage.  Even if that... probably wasn't the best way to buff him.\n\nI feel like Riot really needs to get in touch with the main players of champs when making changes like these.  People who have hundreds, if not thousands of games logged on a champion and who know their nuances.  Because while a change like what they did to Trist's range and attack speed might not seem super important to someone who was only passingly familiar with what made old Trist work, to any veteran player it's obvious that those changes watered down her identity significantly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-01-24T22:57:16.214+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dfBEYBNq,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-01-24T22:44:20.889+0000)\n>\n> There might be. We&#x27;re testing some buffs to her AS/level and Q CD.

Even with the current meta, I don't think doing that would make her to strong but if it was then maybe allow her E's CD to reset if the bomb's explosion killed an enemy (or at least get some % decrease in her E's CD) that way she can actually use it and be more useful in team fights.","replies":[{"poster":"Pinkstripe","date":"2017-01-25T00:49:32.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{item:3508}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-01-25T01:07:05.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LordBroccoli281,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dfBEYBNq,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T00:49:32.255+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3508}}\n\nIf Tristana bought that then her damage potential will drop a decent amount and even with 40% CDR, her skills would still be really high at around 9-10 seconds each which is still a lot for rank 5 skills with 40% CDR.
