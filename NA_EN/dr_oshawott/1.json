Ops no.

Everyone in Runeterra knows the tale, and he knew that. If you see kindred, you have two options: Lamb or Wolf.\n\nHe choose Wolf and ran away...

Maybe, if he accepted the Lamb, he would died from old age, like the actress from the other tale... but he took Wolf's Way.\n\nWhat makes It ambiguous is if Fate is backing Kindred or not if they are perfectly attuned to fate. Because Kindred seems to have too much of an hands on approach. Don't get me Wrong. I have appreciated our debate on Kindred. And as for the squire I half forgot that desertion would be disastrous for anyone. If Kindred kills because their fate is sealed and they 100% know it then they no one can judge them. Death pretty much does what it wants and at least Kindred is not a mass murderer. The point that I have been arguing is that Kindred being the embodiment of death seems a bit obsessed with Death itself, perhaps with replace itself with death. Death is a phenomenon and a being and existing beings can be swayed.  \n\nHell one can even say that Kindred dislikes Karthus for stealing her job and declaring himself death itself. However on the flipside of my statement. One can say that Kindred represents the good and natural death. Whereas Karthus is an unnatural deathbringer and turns the living into the undead. A twisted Parody of life and death.\n\nEither way My point is to show light on what may or may not be unsavory aspects of Kindred. They are drawn to massacres and then killing those that either accept death or fight it makes it difficult to know if they are even justified in doing what they doing as Death will always happen. Seeing the two and Knowing that you are death makes you wonder what would happen if they did kill x person that saw them. Kindred or no Kindred.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-10-16T20:20:30.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah he would have died on the spot aniway.

The squire could have died a horrible death from infection after the battle for all we know. \n\nThe point is that Kindred are merely the personification of a person's acceptance of death. Do you embrace death as just a part of life? Or do you run from death but succumb regardless to its merciless grip? That is Kindred. \n\nLets say the squire was doomed to die regardless. His choice was to either stay and die in battle. A clean and quick death, full of honor. Or to run and die from infection or his wounds. A slow a terrible death, filled with fear. Again, Kindred represent the path we take in when we meet our final hour.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-10-17T20:59:46.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND if they're merely a personification, that might as well be just a myth, they CAN'T have been the ones to actively kill the boy.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2015-10-19T18:12:17.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Photos of Ghosts,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WMn2k706,comment-id=00020000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2015-10-17T20:59:46.669+0000)\n>\n> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND if they're merely a personification, that might as well be just a myth, they CAN'T have been the ones to actively kill the boy.\n\nDepends on what you consider real.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-10-19T20:09:25.082+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WMn2k706,comment-id=000200000000000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2015-10-19T18:12:17.869+0000)\n>\n> Depends on what you consider real.\n\n\"That's deep.

If she ran straight back, she would meat the bandits, and wolf would get a kill.  Instead, she stayed and talked to them and rather take Lamb's arrow.  Because of this, they parted ways and appeared again in the future, during the end of her life.\n\nAhh it's a metaphor for avoiding death. because Magga was brave in front of Kindred.
