Here are generally the 3 things that happen.\r\n\r\nA) I'm chasing/being chased and I want to get vision in a bush to see if I'm being baited. I'm about to get into the bush and I instinctively ward to see if anyone is there. I start channeling Rift (And I can't even stop to my own accord) and I die.\r\n\r\nB) I'm in a fight with someone and they kite themselves into a bush that's unwarded for me. Instinctively, I ward on the bush to get vision and get that one last auto/ability on them, but alas, I start spawning Rift and inevitably die.\r\n\r\nC) I'm in any kind of life/death situation where warding would be essential, but I remember that I have Rift so I just have to take the L and move on.\r\n\r\nAll 3 of these things are toxic mechanics. Warding is a massive part of the game, and the fact that having a certain item/buff can get rid of it is absolutely insane.\r\n\r\nHere is my solution to the problem. So, by the time someone gets Rift Herald (10-20 mins into game i believe), you should not have 6 items, so it should automatically go into your first empty item slot. But let's say someone tries to cheat the system and buy 6 items to see what happens. Since having 6 active items at this point is literally impossible, the Eye should go into your first non-active item slot and cover up that item. (You still get the item's stats obviously). \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of this solution?

But seriously they should change how it works. I'm not sure if putting it as an item but would be a good idea since sometimes when I play top lane I just stack cloth armors and other items (I mainly play tanks currently on my alternate account).  Maybe putting like a slot item in your ward slot so you could trigger it to be a ward or rift herald? So basically, if you hold down shift and press 4, it would change to rift herald as your main ward slot instead of the ward. I don't really know how to fix it 100% tbh, got the idea I think from dota 2.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aimléss","date":"2017-12-01T07:33:12.262+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We use what? 1234567, qwer and b right?
