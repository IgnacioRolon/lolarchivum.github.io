I can tell them right at the begining of the game to not take any risk, just focus on farming, and i'll find them dead under the ennemy tower less than 5 minut later. \n\nThey want to play and just do what pops in their mind. Getting better require training. And training is just setting up goals, actions, and staying focused on that. \n\nYes anyone can be at least gold. It just requires preparation and the will to do it. It requires to actually train and not be like \"HUM WHICH CHAMPION WILL I TAKE THIS GAME ? ... I'VE NOT PLAYED AZIR IN A LONG TIME, GO FOR HIM\"\nIt requires to play the same champion at least multiple time in a row, so the mecanics inherent to the champion become natural and you can focus on a more abstract level of play.\n\nEven as a diamond veigar/ww I can't just start playing a new champion and be like \"i'm going to carry games\", If I have to focus on what my competences are doing, which damages my autos will be doing, or If I dont know which trades I can or can't take, I wont be able to focus on the other parts of the play, like decision making, roaming etc.\n\nEDIT :\nanother concrete example, I've been playing with a bronze friend a lot. I was playing on lower lvel accounts to help him get to silver because he couldnt get out of bronze. He was playing Aatroxx. He was farming quite well, had good mecanics, he was crushing his  lane nearlly every  time.\n\nProblem : he had no decision making at all. Like none. He was playing every teamfight like the whole team was going to follow him instantly, even if he was in the middle of the map and our team was spread accross the map. He was then blaming people for not grouping. I tried to help him for 20 games. And he didnt change at all. He was repeating the same exact mistake every time. He was absolutely triggered by the presence of an ennemy in his vision field. He had to go for that kill. Even if noone was backing him up and that every single other ennemies was missing.\n\nSometimes people dont want to put any reflexion because \"it's a game\", and they are not here to \"use their brain\". Well, expect to lose against people who use theirs then.

(E.g. cars, pedestrians.) \n   2) Avoid stationary objects. (E.g. trees, buildings.) \n   3) Stay in your lane. \n   4) Read road-signs and traffic-lights. \n   5) Check speedometer. _\n\nWhen I drive nowadays, it's second-nature. But this phenomenon isn't limited to driving. Hardcore gamers complain about Dark Souls, but I know normies who struggle with games like Kirby's Dreamland. Normies haven't built the same repository of intuitions as gamers have. \n\nI've been playing videogames for a long time. But I generally don't play RTS's. So when I first joined League, I was a fish out of water. But most challengers entered the scene from games like like WoW or Dota, so Moba's were already second nature to them. So when top streamers respond \" idk... just farm and carry\", I suspect that it genuinely represents the sum of tips that are consciously available to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Falcon Of Death","date":"2017-10-13T00:33:08.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"use your brain","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2017-10-13T11:49:13.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am Diamond.\nI can't play {{champion:1}}. \n\nI understand how subjective difficulty can be.\n\nSomething more related to the actual post, I have two procedures that are useful.\n\n1. Identify your teams win condition (Ideally, still in the draft).\n2. Do everything in your power to bring that win condition to fruition.\n\nSay you're picking your midlaner and you have a J4 jungle, Rakan support, and MF ADC. \nIt's pretty clear that your win condition is MF winning lane followed by a mid game teamfight with Baron taken shortly after and a hard push to victory.\n\nYour mid pick needs the following properties in this case.\n\n* Can roam bot easily.\n* Can push in a lane to prevent the enemy laner from going bot.\n* Somewhat of a threat in teamfights.\n* Magic damage dealer, since your lineup is AD heavy so far.\n\nThe best champions that fit this scenario are {{champion:103}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:101}} \n\nChampions that are decent, but not ideal are {{champion:1}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:238}} \n\nThen, you need to get the enemy into a situation where they think they can do Baron. If they do, J4+Bullet time for the ace, take baron, hard push for the end.\nIf they won't, start it yourself. If they try to stop you, wombo them. If they don't take baron and push until they try to fight you.\n\nThe other procedure is this.\n\n1. Assume the enemy has a trick up their sleeve.\n2. Figure out what it is. If there is one, find a way around it and move to step 3. If there isn't move directly to step 3.\n3. Capitalize.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myozthirirn","date":"2017-10-12T23:08:26.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"If you cant get out of silver in lees than ~50 games, you belong there.
