[Megathread?]","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"So if you&#039;re anything like me, you don&#039;t really bother to read the lore of a lot of champions because a lot of them are novels and &#039;aint nobody got time for that. But reading a one paragraph summary can clear things up and make it sooo much easier to get a better understanding of champions and their backstories because don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m interested in the lore, just not the time it takes to read it.\r\n\r\nYou can get these by \r\n\r\nA) Reading the lore yourself\r\nB) Having read the lore before and just writing what you already know\r\nC) Look at another summary and write the key points in _your own words._ No plagiarism on my Christian boards! &gt;:c\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll start with my favorite champion, Talon.\r\n\r\nTalon was this guy who lived the hood-life on the streets, where the only thigns he had going for him were being a master with blades and a great thief. The other Noxians weren&#039;t too fond of Talon stealing all their stuff so they sent many assassins to kill him, but he swiftly defeated them and left their bodies as his response to this. Then this cool guy named General Du Couteau (we&#039;ll call him GDC) came face-to-face with Talon while he was disarmed. Now GDC had Talon in a life or death situation with 2 choices: &quot;Death at his hand, or life as an agent of the Noxian High Command&quot;. Talon chose to be an agent, but he would only serve GDC because he only wanted to serve the man he could not defeat. After years of carrying out secret missions for GDC, GDC dissapeared with no trace. Talon chose to try to track him down and find him rather than claiming freedom because of the immense respect he gained for him over the years.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s probably around the max length you should make it unless it is a pretty long lore and has a lot of stuff to cover.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can do the same lore someone else did, if you can make it different enough to theirs that it is worth reading both of them rather than just one.\r\n\r\nI hope we can get a lot of great variety and we all get a slightly better understanding of the game! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2017-12-31T05:19:15.185+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why do my favourites when I can do everyone?\n\n- {{champion:266}} Super strong darkin warrior who loves killing shit and wants revenge on humans for killing his people.\n- {{champion:103}} Orphaned vastaya who's trying to deal with a memory eating addiction while trying to figure out who what she even is.\n- {{champion:84}} Ninja prodigy of the Kinkou clan who's super good at killing people to ensure order and peace.\n- {{champion:12}} Minotaur whose clan got murdered by Noxus.
