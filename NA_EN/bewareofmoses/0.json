So i uninstalled it from my computer and a 2 weeks later i decided to start playing again so I downloaded it and no problem what so ever . after a while in one of my games the computer shut off and would continously restart it self so I restarted the system and couldnt open my LOL. It kept sending the message to me: \"This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling it may fix the problem. So I deleted it and tried to re install but when i click the link and come into my downloads and i click it again it wont open like i never touched it. So i used some info from this forum but the launcher wouldnt open it would send me the same message. I already tried to sys recovery it stays the same\r\nSo PLZ anyone out there PLZZZ help me I have tried for days without no avail. PLZ help me so i can continue with LOL","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T18:12:52.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your installation of League may be completely borked. I recommend grabbing our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and completing a clean reinstall of League. After installing the application, simply run it, check the boxes for both **Reinstall** and **clean uninstall** and let it run. After it's finished, right click on the League Icon and select **run as administrator** and let the patching process finish. \n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"BewareofMoses","date":"2016-08-15T22:59:29.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Targons Blade thanks for replying.
