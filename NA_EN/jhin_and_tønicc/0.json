I messaged him once, he didn't reply (thinking he wanted to focus). I got in discord with him and another friend told me if you were on league. I said \"yeah I had my client open, why?\" \"They hacked (my friends name here).\" They apparently got on to his account, and played 2 ranked games and lost the matches on purpose, lost all his LP and spent all of his IP (4k) and they purchased Olaf on his account. I'm afraid now because I'm expecting my account to get breached. A lot of people are saying for 2 step verification like Blizzard or Steam.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T15:36:34.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to help!
