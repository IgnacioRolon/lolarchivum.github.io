I opted to just start another account on the EU East server (the recommended server for Qatar). No champs, skins, and the worst: summoner spells. I opened up a ticket to see if they had a military discount for transfers and noticed at the bottom a way to upload documents... no discount, recommended I post in the forums to gather support from the masses.\r\nLook, I know Riot is offering us a free game and is in the business to make an awesome gaming experience (and to make money). I'm not trying to take money from the company that I've paid over and over for the quality stuff they put out... but a lot of military go back and forth to the Middle East area for work 6-12 months at a time.\r\nWhat I am asking for is that Riot allow us to upload our orders (like all military do to suspend things like our cell phone service) to Riot to prove we aren't just looking for a discounted (or free) transfer. It has the estimated dates we will be gone and forging these documents is against the Uniform Code of Military Justice (meaning: you could lose your job or your rank for faking these documents). In return the military that supports all of you (to include Riot) gets to keep playing (when Internet is available) the game they love. We work long hours over here and I love unwinding with a game or 3... I'd rather do it with all my champions.\r\n\r\nThank you for everyone's time, I hope you can get behind this request!","replies":[]}
