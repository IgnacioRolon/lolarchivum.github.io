Don&#039;t let any top MMORPG lists confuse you. Don&#039;t let the weeb filth that worship that game fool you. All the best cosmetics is RNG, RNG with real dollars. You could spend a thousand dollars and not get the skin you want. This is how the publisher barely keeps itself afloat. The dungeons are garb. The RNG is garb. the PvP is garb. \n\nSave yourself the grief, just buy Riot Points instead of RNG boxes. :) but if you DO decide to buy RNG boxes from TERA, don&#039;t forget to dispute the charges if you don&#039;t get what you want.","replies":[]}
