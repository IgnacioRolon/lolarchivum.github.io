Despite the not-so-great community and rare losing streaks, I have always found League of Legends--especially with friends--to be an enjoyable game.  However the new champion--Sylas--has really concerned me.  One of my favorite aspects of league is the enormous amount of champions in league of legends.  While Riot has occasionally borrowed some aspects of certain champions and reused them (Current Aatrox is similar to Riven), they never made a champion just have the ability to essential copy another champions ultimate.  I know Sylas is unique in himself because his ultimate copies other ultimates: something no champion has ever had, but is this really healthy for the game...  The ultimate for most champions is what sets them apart from others (I know, its not just the ult but the ult does play a major factor).  The uniqueness is lost a little from every champion because Sylas can just afford the player a little bit of every champion in the game.  Tell me what you think.  Do you think Sylas is a well-designed champion.  Was Riot just running out of ideas or lazy?  Do you think the arrival of Sylas will make you like/hate league more or less?  Thank you for your time.  \r\nP.S.  I just remembered that I could ban him every game if I wanted to, hence effectively removing him from all my games.","replies":[]}
