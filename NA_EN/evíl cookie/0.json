Thats a huge difference.\n\nIt's a ground and a strong slow, similar to Cass's E. People caught in that basically aren't going anywhere. Putting that on a targeted, ranged, instant spell would be way too strong, although I can see it being sort of okay on a completed item that costs 2-3k gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Evíl cookie","date":"2019-01-17T09:11:07.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's single target with a long cooldown.

You're in mid and facing, say, a Zed. What are you going to bring besides Flash? Ignite, to do a few hundred true damage before he blinks away after his combo? Exhaust, so he needs to blink away after his combo and then wait 20 seconds before going in again to kill you? No, you're gonna bring this ground/slow and hit him with it before he can blink away, causing him to die to your turret, team, combo, etc. And maybe your ADC will bring this spell, too, because the ADC is a high-value target for an assassin.\n\nAssassins would eventually realize that if they can't delete someone in a fraction of a second, they are unviable, because they'll have no escape tool and will only be able to trade a kill for a death rather than pull ahead. So, what happens to keep assassins viable? They receive buffs until they can reliably do their job and actually help their team. The result: all assassins can kill you before you can react.\n\nDo you know how many buffs Kat in particular would need if this spell existed?","replies":[{"poster":"Evíl cookie","date":"2019-01-18T10:13:48.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V8QHj7n3,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-17T11:46:27.619+0000)\n>\n> Imagine that this goes live.

He just has to think of which summoner spell his opponent has, if it is on cooldown and how risky it is to go all in and dive under turret.

They'd need a significant buff to deal with a targeted \"you're a diver now\" spell.\n\nCass's W isn't an instant targeted spell.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2019-01-16T19:59:42.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about this exact implementation, but a grounding summoner would probably be a great idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agent Corgi","date":"2019-01-16T19:33:48.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's like Exhaust but instead of reducing the damage you take from the target, you inhibit their Mobility instead.\nWould be a pretty good Summoner to take if you had to go up against a champion who can jump all over the place, For example, I can definitely see a Support taking this if the enemy team has an ADC with a Mobility spell like Lucian or Ezreal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-01-16T12:37:47.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Not very distinct from {{summoner:3}}.\n\nHaving a grounding isn't enough to make up for the loss of the 40% damage reduction and 5% less MS reduction.\n\nAlso, no. Universal grounding is not the answer to mobility any more than universal GW is the answer to healing. GW has resulted in healing being buffed to where it's OP if the enemy has no GW, but still isn't relevant if they do have it.
