Portal Jump\n\nIf Zoe gets rootet/knockuped after blinking to the target position she sould stay at this position till the end of the root\nand blink backwards after the root duration. \n\nThis adds simply more counterplay options and Zoe has to think of it before going in. \n\n2. Sleepy Trouble Bubble\n\nIf Zoe miss this skillshot the field should slow the opponent on it (the field is getting you tired) instead of the same effect as hitting the skill. \n\nThe zoning effect is really really powerful and sometimes it is better to miss this ability. If you hit someone you should get rewarded more than missing.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-09-14T18:03:36.868+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 2.

That mean he have a lane priority in pro play (a good thing after the jungle change). After the laning fight (the part where the ADC start kiting Urgot), his job is not trying to get to them abd blow them up but to be a tank which good damage and some utilities (so who give a shit about ADC kiting him). And about Zoe, what did her job is? From what i know, most of her job is to blow up her  and the only way for she can do that is do the (R)-E-Q-( sometime W)combo, the combo that even pro player have a hard time dealing with (of cource sometime she would you her E to zone).","replies":[{"poster":"Ranmaru","date":"2018-09-15T17:05:30.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=d9u7c1anh,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=otj0A7vb,comment-id=000200000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-09-15T15:59:45.601+0000)\n>\n> Urgot is usually pick in pro play against a top laner that is not very good at kiting and he actually win a lot of match up right now.

Better than the normal arguments for straight nerfs.\n\nHer E is always going to be an issue based on it's design, a skill shot, which range can be extended if thrown through walls which slows for 1.4 seconds then stuns for 2.25 seconds, totalling 3.65 seconds of CC. If you miss it, it leaves a zoning trap which if stepped on starts the same 1.4 then 2.25 seconds process. Plus can be shot from through a wall 1000 unit away or point blank and it does the same thing. Plus the damage and true damage enhancement. That's a lot. (It used to also have a cooldown reduction on hit).\n\nRewarding her for missing her skill shot with the same duration stun because of a massive trap kind of make it feel too forgiving when you compare it to Xerath's stun or Morgana's Q.\n\nChange you suggested seems like a fair balance, the 'trap' will only make you drowsy but make it last like 2 seconds up from the 1.4, so at least you have time to get a Q shot in.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-09-14T09:27:17.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaspers,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=otj0A7vb,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-09-14T09:07:24.091+0000)\n>\n> which slows for 1.4 seconds then stuns for 2.25 seconds, totalling 3.65 seconds of CC\n\nStun? it wears off the 0.1 sec you get damaged\nit's not a stun, it's a sleep and it's only a total of 3.65 sec cc if you  don't  get damaged\n\nit's as strong if less strong than veigar's aoe 2.5 sec stun","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-09-14T09:41:13.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get ya but I'd prefer the 2.5 (level 5) second stun over potential 3.5 (level 1).
