I didn't even know i had a heal. But i knew something was weird about it. We were all low levels, less than level 10 and im getting flamed at? This gaming community has shaped it's players and not in a good direction. And i have to say it's affected me and have recently noticed. But i feel as thought it is getting worse and worse, especially without the Tribunal in place. I've been taking note and for 8 out of 10 games at least 3 players verbally abuse. But the fact that they're doing that is because that's the normal for games, making it seem like it's okay because everyone does it. Why log in just to make someone feel bad? While they are here to get better, have fun, enjoy friends.  I don't want to ramble on for paragraph on paragraph, but, people need more positive during games, and when a teammate makes mistakes, they make a mistake. No one can have a good game every game and people have to be more understanding. At points it's gotten so bad i feel like quiting League all together, even with all the time, dedication, and love i have put into it.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Be nice to players and play with respect. c:\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a video tht has been brought up many times but it portraits it well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4uVh-rUrg","replies":[]}
