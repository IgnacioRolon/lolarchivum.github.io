To my knowledge, an S- or better is how you achieve a token for mastery 6. I have gotten MULTIPLE (10+) S- ranks during draft pick SR games and ranked SR games on this champ, but I haven't been getting a single token since my first token. I'm not sure if this is a glitch, or maybe i have to get an S+, or maybe its not a guaranteed drop? I'm unsure of how it works, and wanted to know if anyone could help me out.
