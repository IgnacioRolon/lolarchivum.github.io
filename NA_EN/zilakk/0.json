I click on the logo and it tells me that it has stopped responding, i went back to the legacy client, same problem. And abslouteley nothing seems to work, after a while of failed attempts, opening as admin, allowing through firewall, restarting, etc. It tells me that a file named ''api-ms-win-crt-utility-l1-1-0'' was not working. I then completely uninstall and reinstall (this is an excruciating process for me personally, as my internet is very slow) so I open the alpha client after downloading it to download the game data, sometimes it would the thing were it wouldn't respond at the logo, and the times it would work, and i finally get to log in. It works for about exactly a minute then nothing responds, everyhting is still clickable and interactable, but nothing loads anymore, not even the download. And the legacy client completely doesn't work, I'm completely at a loss here. I'll be waiting for any reply, hopefully, because i was planning to play on the 3 days of vacation i had.\nI say recently, but in general, I've been having a lot of problems with league since the beginning of season 7.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-20T23:24:11.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there's a setting with your PC that's blocking the patcher from loading, regardless of the version you're using.
