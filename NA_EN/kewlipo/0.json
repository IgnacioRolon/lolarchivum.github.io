I'm sorry to hear this is still an issue for you. \n\nAwful latency (ping) during specific hours is usually a direct result of your ISP rerouting traffic to League during specific hours to mitigate network congestion. Before we take an in-depth look at your network routing, I'd first like you to work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all local network settings are configured properly for League.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change to your latency.","replies":[]}]}
