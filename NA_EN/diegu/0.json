Problem is that I logged on yesterday and I opened \"Your Shop\", but when my friends did, it said that \"Your Shop\" was disabled and they couldn't open theirs. I log in today to buy some of the skins I got the discount for and they weren't there, instead there was Black Belt {{champion:77}}, Slay belle {{champion:55}}, Tango {{champion:28}}, Cosmic Dusk {{champion:498}}, Slayer {{champion:222}}, and Arcade {{champion:92}}. I just wanted to know if I could get the discounts from the first time I opened the discord shop and since they are obviously \"better\" than black belt udyr and tango eve (LOL). However I will understand if Riot doesn't revert it because I have no idea how i could open \"Your Shop\" and my friends couldn't, and I don't know if this is a bug or just something that happens to many players.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/4ddb3cb4e43b8987a84abff272eeb094 This Link is a gyazo screenshot of messages to my friend because of how hyped I was, it doesn't show the first discounts that I got and it doesnt show the dates of when I sent that message but I took that screenshot to give you a perspective of how hyped I was of getting those skin discounts and to try to give a little bit of proof that I'm not lying.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nDieguPvP (TG Diegu)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T21:46:14.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those offers were reset after we brought the shop down to fix some issues.
