I own the Soccerer Lux skin, and picked after her. She did not own any Jax skin, but did own Star Gaurdian Lux. I myself have no Jax skins.\r\n\r\nThe game started, she had a base skin (Despite picking Star Gaurdian), and I had Mighty Jax. Of course, it didn&#039;t let me keep the skin, but I feel this is something that should be addressed as it effects players who did buy skins and wish to use them.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-20T00:34:24.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sslazze, \n\nThanks for the report!
