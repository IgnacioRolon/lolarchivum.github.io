After champion select, are you receiving any errors?  Does the loading screen even load at all?  If a loading screen is delaying, it's usually a result of a connection issue having trouble connecting to the game server and not due to another player.  Let me know, and I'd be happy to offer some assistance!","replies":[{"poster":"Vier","date":"2016-07-30T07:13:58.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there,\n\nThis is what happens exactly.\n\nChampion Select no matter what mode goes fine and normal. Then sometimes a crash happens to the actual game and I am left with the \"Game has crashed, click here to reconnect\" I click it but just keeps on bringing me to a black screen and crashes again.

Simply click exit and close down your client as well. Wait around 5 seconds and then restart your client so that you can reconnect. Hope this helps. \nIf this fails, be sure to run as administrator  or  send a ticket to riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-30T15:22:05.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed follow up!  After champion select, your network establishes a connection to your group's game server.  If no connection is made, you will end up with the black screen that you're seeing.  There may be a connection issue here which could be caused by several things like the strength of your network or even a firewall.  \n\nAs a first step, please go over our[ connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this resolved.  I also recommend using our[ hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs), which can automatically make adjustments like configuring your firewall to all League access.\n\nThese resources should get you fixed up, but let me know if you continue to have any problems!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Labeanplant","date":"2016-07-29T15:04:44.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They wont, this has been happening forever and is an ongoing problem.
