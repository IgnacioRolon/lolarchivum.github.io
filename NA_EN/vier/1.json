Since his VO is usually more light-hearted, we felt giving his VO processing to sound more sinister really rounded out the thematic.\n\nUnlike Order of the Lotus Karma (or Karma in general), Irelia is way less particle heavy, which is why we felt a model and texture change would fulfill this thematic. We did change her (R) particles to match the weapon, which are similar to the quality of life particles we gave to Warden Sivir. \n\nAs you've seen in other skin lines - Debonair, Eternum or Arcade (which includes Final Boss), not every skin in the line has to be in the same price tier - it's more about what each champion needs individually, versus what the first skin in the line had.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-05-14T17:30:24.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You told us before. ^^ I was just hoping for a completely different feel for her, which is what a 1350 (or higher tier) skin would give.

Or Ezreal having a plethora of skins... only 1 having updated particles).\n\nThey need a cleaner spread & more of a big-picture attitude when it comes to scoping out a skin. Prioritizing price-tier will improve that are greatly.\n\nWhoever thought Ezreal should get another 750 skin is bonkers.\n\nSomeone should've drafted the idea, \"hey guys, Ezreal needs a skin somewhere between 975 & 1350 bracket.\"\n\nDon't even get me started on who's bright idea it was to give him yet another skin right now too... that's another issue with how they scope out skin-lines for another topic.\n\nAnother fine example of scope before price... Marauder Ashe with base particles... completely ruins the skin. Somebody should've had the foresight to consider that skin needed particle recolor which would merit a tier-increase.
