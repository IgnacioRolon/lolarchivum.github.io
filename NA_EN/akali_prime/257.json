Whose dumbass idea was it to make her hide in her shroud so we can barely get a look at the skin 900IQ rito games \n\n2. What is even her recall? Everyone else fights and kills the little droids while the droids just surround akali and take her to heaven I guess?? Fuck if I know. It was so random. \n\n3.From what I could see due to the first point.
