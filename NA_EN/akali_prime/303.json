Now in one instance i literally dodged all his abilities then go in to trade with him while all his abilities are on CD with me having all my abilities still up but guess who wins the trade anyways? ekko did because all he did was get a few autos off and proc his passive anyways and gains a speed boost, i dont think thats very fair gameplay,\n i think only his abilities should be able to proc his passive so he would be punished for missing them like any other assassin/mage. \n\nanother thing is his ult and how he uses it to escape whenever he dun fucked up (i know thats the entire point of his ultimate) but for an ability like that the CD on it is WAY too short. i was playing riven vs him and i remember we both used our ults around the same time and next time we came back to lane before i knew it his ult was up and ready to go while mine was still at around 50 secs left in the countdown (give or take).\none more thing is when ever he escapes its really annoying he has 2 slows and a speed boost passive that you have to get by to catch him i mean does she seriously need 2 slows AND a speed boost?? especially with his Q having around a 4 second CD. i dont have a problem with his damage or anything i just have a problem on how this champion receives little to no type of punishment whenever he makes a mistake and it makes laning phase with him hell.","replies":[]}
