Anyways the game lasted 10 minutes longer than it should've and we almost lost because twitch decided to make a 1000 IQ play in a ranked game.\n\nshit like this should most defiantly be punishable i dont understand why its now, do you guys have any idea how many games ive lost because of shit like this? id put it under griefing, intentionally not ending the game, intentionally throwing the game, poor sportsmanship etc.  i was literally shaking that last half the game because to see us come back into the game after a rough start only to lose because of player not doing their job is disheartening and a spit to my and the other 3 players faces.\nplease let mages deal more dmg to the nexus so someone can step up when the adc decides to step down. that is all.","replies":[]}
