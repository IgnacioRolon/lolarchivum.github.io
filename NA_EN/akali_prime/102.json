Because it's always someone else's fault. I mean, even if you accept you're at fault(but don't say it), and just, as you said, mention how you can't do anything because they kite you for ages... it's someone else's fault. Who has the most deaths? They fed laning phase. Did jungler ever gank? Maybe if we had some ganks we could've finished this. Is botlane afk farming?(let's be fair, sometimes, this is an ADC's job description...) Stupid adc can't even join teamfights.\n\nReally, the only safe place to vent your frustrations... is to the air, vocally. As long as you're not on voice chat, or streaming with a mic, screaming(or growling, if you have to consider other people in your domicile) in frustration and ranting is your best release for frustrations over how a game is going. No one is going to be on you about being toxic for it, no one is going to mock you for feeling frustrated... no one but you will ever know. Right? There's almost no reason to ever type anything in a game, even if it's an accurate and helpful statement, most people will take it as a flame, or a trigger to flame... or so it seems.\n\nAnd just remember, there's no context to text. There's no tonal inflections, no way to tell if something is literal, sarcasm, joking, saccharine, or whatever. In a high-octane environment--and let's face it, most league matches are this--you have to be sure you're typing the most neutral, non-offending, non-insulting, non-finger pointing way possible. If someone can take it as an offense, or an insult... they will. Simple because that's how they interpret the text, because there is no tone to infer what you actually mean. Might be obvious to you, but it's not obvious to everyone else what your text statement means. :3\n\ntl;dr: Only safe venting space is out-loud off of voice comms/stream platform where only you can hear it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-11-01T17:31:12.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.\nhttps://res.cloudinary.com/teepublic/image/private/s--Jatf_pqF--/b_rgb:42332c,c_limit,f_jpg,h_800,q_90,w_800/v1487554430/production/designs/1241989_1.jpg\n\nJk.

Everyone has their own thresholds for what they consider to be report-worthy. \n\nPersonally, I would be okay with \"Fucking hell, this [enemy player] is pissing me off. They keep diving me over and over. Just fuck off already, damn POS\". I would hope that other people are okay (even if not enthused by it), too.\n\nBut some people might not be okay with that. They might get bothered that an ally is spamming chat, or want them to just shut up already. It's not my place to say they should be okay with it.\n\nThe real concern is the phrasing. If you aren't careful, it's easy to say something that sounds like it is blaming teammates. \"This [Enemy player] keeps roaming top to dive me, so tilting\" could be interpreted as blaming the ally for not preventing the roaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-11-01T11:06:30.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some complaining is fine, but after a while it is annoying and unhelpful.","replies":[]}]}
