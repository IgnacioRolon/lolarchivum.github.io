With standard CDR runes + Trinity Force, he can keep Wither up 75% of the time.\n\nThe new Steraks is also broken as fuck on him.

And that's an intended window of power to prevent  chain CCing \nSeeing how you usually only take the damage to proc it when you get disabled in a Team fight .  Since we are talking Late game  with two teams fighting it out I don't see the problem with Nasus Fulfilling his Power Fantasy of being a Juggernaut.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-10-31T11:58:36.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=niGxmmtc,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-31T09:16:14.631+0000)\n>\n> Trinity Force + Deadman&#x27;s Plate + Zz&#x27;rot give him about 515 movement speed.

Of course Nasus rightfully deserve to be strong in late game. But that's not what OP was complaining about.\n\nBut mate, no need to be condescending with OP, when they're asking a legit question. And *especially* no need to be condescending when your facts are wrong/irrelevant. OP claims that Nasus can perma-slow, and nothing in your post proves otherwise, and Nasus can indeed have a slow up-time of 90+% with Wither. If you add any other source of slow, like Deadman or Iceborn Gauntlet, he can actually slow permanently.
