My question is why whenever these champions are in the game someone is forced to babysit them all game just so they wont solo win?\r\n and not even that is true, one champion babysitting another so they dont push too hard thats only in a perfect world the thing about split push champions is after they hit a certain level, usually level 6 then damn near no one can 1v1 them why is this? so not only they can endlessly siege a lane but they can also 1v1 anyone who tries to stop them? then this forces you to sick 2 or 3 people on them every time they push too far leaving the rest of the map open to their team. i literally have a zero winrate against yorick i have never won with him on the enemy team and if i have it was a very few times i cannot even remember them. he is hard as fuckin shit to beat, hes literally nasus with his own minions with that strong ass q and heal. took 4 of us to take him down last game, but not before he took a tower and killed me at the same time can someone please explain to me how do i deal with these champions it because it doesnt feel like you can, gank them when they split too far, their team pushes another lane. focus on their team, by the time your done {{champion:75}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:24}} are already at your nexus.\r\nand dont tell me to pick ________ champion against them because the thing is i dont play top or jg so its up to them to deal with those champions pre six   \r\nbut im in low elo so half the time those champions get fed and snowball into split pushing one shotting machines and its frustrating because i dont kow what to do against that. someone please explain to me how to deal with these champs.","replies":[]}
