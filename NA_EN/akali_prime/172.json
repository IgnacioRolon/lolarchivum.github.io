I was playing vi jg and forgot smite because i was tending to my baby brothers while waiting in champion select and i kid you not its 15 minutes into the freakin game and im still level 3 because i can barely clear any camps by myself without the enemy jglr camping me to get free kills since hes automatically ahead. The game is literally unplayable because i accidentally forgot one summoner spell. If jglrs need smite THIS BADLY to even play the game then it should automatically be the default summoner spell when your in the jg role because this is just ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"BestJhinUniverse","date":"2017-11-01T23:30:36.552+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"How would it function if you intended to trade the role at champ select?","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-11-01T23:35:03.018+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be the default summoner spell but you can still always change it just like any other spell.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2017-11-02T13:30:03.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead of having summ spells defaulting, what about instead a flashing notification?

I don't think there is really that good of a reason for people to not be able to build jungle items if they don't have smite.\n\nA lot of the value of the jungle items are in the hp/mp/exp gain for clearing jungle, I don't think it is likely lanes will pick up jungle items for their base stats. But if a jungler forgets smite but can still get the jungle items, he could still Jungle.
