That much makes sense. Why wouldn't someone with 550 range not sit there and auto-attack you? I'm going to assume that you're talking about Akali since it's in your name. She's had tools in her kit to make up for this. Doran's Shield really helps you stay healthy enough early while in lane and based on your match history, you rarely build it. Also, you can hard push the lane to force the enemy to focus on waveclearing instead of focusing on you. However, be wary when doing that because if your laner has a lot of waveclear early, they can freeze the wave under their turret.

Depending on the champion and their AA range, they can abuse League's minion AI and not actually be attacked by them. If you AA and walk backwards as a ranged champion, by the time the closest minion  aggros onto you, you're already out of its aggro range and then it deprioritises you and attacks something else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2019-07-17T07:12:21.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I don't know the specific rules on it, but there are very different outcomes for range vs. melee to my knowledge. Easiest example to give in my opinion is when an enemy is fleeing a tower because he knows he can't hold it. Once that enemy gets a certain distance outside his tower's sight, the tower doesn't see you anymore. You can deal damage to that champion from the base of an enemy tower and it won't aggro you if the enemy is outside the tower's sight range (which I believe to be just a hair outside the attacking range). You also don't draw aggro if the positions are switched and you're outside the enemy turret's sight range. That leaves a lot of room for abusing tower aggro when the odds are stacked against the turret's team.\n\nSimilarly, a ranged champion can do the exact same thing to melee champions with minions: attack out of minion aggro range (at least moreso than the melee champion could possibly do), and skate past minions mostly undisturbed to finish off that champion inside the enemy minion's aggro range, but while the melee champion is outside of it, and ultimately still not disturb the minions. This is very easy to do with a handful of champions like your Teemos and Lucians who can either deal heavy damage with intermittent hits, or who can combo quickly for damage while keeping distance, and follow up on a fleeing situation at the most opportune time.\n\nRange is a very effective tool against tower aggro, and is similarly useful against minion aggro as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2019-07-17T04:18:42.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except it’s not rng. It’s just that the call for help mechanisms from minions inherently favor champions that are further away because they don’t enter combat soon enough to reaggro.
