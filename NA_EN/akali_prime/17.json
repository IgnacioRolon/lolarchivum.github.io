Either way, her kit is binary and seems too strong vs melee champions while being destroyed by cc (her ult is extremely telegraphed, even if it seems quick you can cc her in her tracks). She's usually seen as a low elo stomper but right now she's op in high elo too. There's this player with like 3 challenger account as an akali main. I don't like putting 1 person to determine that she is op or not, but it does say that the champion works in high elo very efficiently.","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-01-13T05:12:48.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. Because Riot was (at the time) slowly removing Spell Vamp from the game. The only champion that still has it is Lee Sin with his W. And Maw still grants it when the shield procs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
