I'm not sure about Pyke though, there hasn't been any updates on the Nexus page as of now.\n\nRegarding Irelia, same thing happened with Rakan and Xayah, they didn't have their own champion insights article but they did have their \"creative collaboration\" mini-documentary.\n\nBut yeah, I really do enjoy those articles, seeing how these champions came to be and how they've shifted conceptually throughout their projects. It's always good to see the thought and consideration that goes behind making and/or remaking the champions we all love.","replies":[]}]}
