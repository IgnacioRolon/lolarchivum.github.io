If you had gone in with the yasuo or slightly after him  then maybe something more successful could have been done.\n\nBoth of you made the wrong choice in my opinion, and making the wrong choice is not reportable. The yasuo probably thought killing the players 1st was the best choice, just as you thought running in without anyone assisting you, on a non-split push champ, to attack the nexus was the best choice.\n\nThat situation alone did not lose you the game. The bad team fight that happened shortly afterwords did, and whatever happened earlier in the game that caused both of your own nexus towers to fall also contributed a lot to losing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-08-07T15:41:20.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bad teamfight would've never happened if he ended the game when we was supposed to.","replies":[{"poster":"Trundamere","date":"2018-08-07T15:58:26.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"May have never happened if you did not rush in ahead of the yasuo like you did. Also wouldn't have happened for many other factors that happened earlier in the game that resulted in some of your deaths and the loss of both of your own nexus towers.\n\nIn the ELO you are in, Blaming other people for losing the game is not going to make you a better player. You made just as many mistakes as everyone else in the room, how do I know this? because everybody in low ELO who is not smurfing, makes a lot of mistakes. I make a lot of mistakes, you make a lot of mistakes, everyone who is below plat makes a lot of mistakes. If you expect your team mates to make the right choice in low ELO, which again NEITHER of you did. then your going to be fairly disappointed in a lot of cases.
