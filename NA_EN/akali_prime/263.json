I believe you're referring to when Udyr killed you at 18 minutes.\n\nThe point of armor/magic resist is to make sure that you don't melt as quickly. It does a good job powering up quickly and then falling off as the game progresses. If you built only tank stats, you probably would've been fine. However, you built one Bramble Vest and you're suddenly expecting yourself to be extremely tanky. That's not how this works. You can't go for zero defensive masteries besides maybe the armor stat shard, and then for itemization run Cinderhulk into Rav Hydra (which does not synergize with CH because it doesn't give you any HP) and then say, \"Okay I got 35 armor you can't kill me.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-03-15T18:07:31.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"And what about the shen on my team who at the time had 186 armor and was also shredded by udyr solo","replies":[{"poster":"ZerglingOne","date":"2019-03-15T18:19:39.086+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali Prime,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0ceFRGBx,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-03-15T18:07:31.871+0000)\n>\n> And what about the shen on my team who at the time had 186 armor and was also shredded by udyr solo\n\nUdyr is essentially a juggernaut. You're not supposed to beat him in a stand up fight. He has 3 steroids with his passive, Q ASPD, and the damage on every 3rd hit.\n\nBasically you have to remember. If you'd lose to Darius in a given situation, you'd probably lose to Udyr too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2019-03-15T18:42:43.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali Prime,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0ceFRGBx,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-03-15T18:07:31.871+0000)\n>\n> And what about the shen on my team who at the time had 186 armor and was also shredded by udyr solo\n\nUdyr is 3 levels up and has double his gold value. \n\nThis isn't an exaggeration. It's literally 6,503 vs. 13,202. If you're Nami and your lead is that substantial you should shred your opponent, now imagine that gold differential is on one of the strongest early-game bruisers/duelists.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2019-03-15T17:55:10.451+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Magic resist is useful if the enemy team has an AP champion (even more useful if there are multiple APs) but I agree armor is completely trash even when the enemy comp is full AD.","replies":[{"poster":"ZerglingOne","date":"2019-03-15T18:05:04.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HP Crookshanks,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0ceFRGBx,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-03-15T17:55:10.451+0000)\n>\n> Magic resist is useful if the enemy team has an AP champion (even more useful if there are multiple APs) but I agree armor is completely trash even when the enemy comp is full AD.\n\nNo, Malphite still completely shits on comps like that.\n\nGranted, it's literally only Malphite that's like that, but still.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-03-15T18:12:52.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HP Crookshanks,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0ceFRGBx,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-03-15T17:55:10.451+0000)\n>\n> Magic resist is useful if the enemy team has an AP champion (even more useful if there are multiple APs) but I agree armor is completely trash even when the enemy comp is full AD.\n\nunless your 700 armor (with w of course) rammus but if you add in blade of the ruined king then nvm on the armor advantage there.","replies":[]}]}]}
