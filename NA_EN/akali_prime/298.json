It just kind of bothers me a lot..I get maybe its because of her wings but we have aatrox who grows wings and gets bigger when he ults and he's already twice the size of kayle so I don't believe that's a legit reason to keep her so tiny.\r\nI would like her model to scale up just a little bit more who cares if her wings become a little more opposing that's literally how angels are supposed to be. \r\nMake her a little bigger please.","replies":[]}
