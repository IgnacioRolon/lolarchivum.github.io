(but this would mean fiddle cant auto anything for 60 seconds, so its not ideal to stack them)\n\nQ - scarecrows embrace\nfiddle throws one of his chain sickles as a skill shot, once it his an enemy he will began to pull them towards him while draining their hp and healing for a percentage of the damage (think thresh Q) an addition fiddle can cast his Q a second time to either pull another enemy (can pull 2 different enemies at once) and deal the same amount of damage and healing, or he can pull his first target a second time but this will do reduced damage and healing.(fiddle is unable to autoattack or move when using Qs)\n\nW - demonic flock\nFiddle sends out three crows in a coned skillshot (think khazix evolved W) that damages and fears the enemies hit.\n\nE - crows flight\nfiddle turns into a flock of crows (can still be targeted and hit) and gains increased movement speed for 2.5 seconds, damaging all enemies he passes through. he can also fly over walls. \n\nR - Crowstorm \nbasically the same as his old ult except he gains a shield and increased movement speed while ult is active (can use basically abilites while ulting) \n\n\nim not doing any numbers because i wouldnt be sure how to balance all this and number crunching is too much work lol lets just pretend all his ability scalings and cooldowns are reasonable lol. feedback is welcomed tell me what you guys think!","replies":[]}
