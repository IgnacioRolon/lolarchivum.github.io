or grieving? how? dispite  me saying im not even trying, i clearly am since it takes effort to even play the game when i could've easily just afk'd and probably avoided a chat restriction all together. i got auto-filled into a role i didn't want to play therefore i didn't give the game 100% my all which im pretty sure is not against the rules. Like i said earlier game 2 i completely understand the reason for being reported but the thing is that game didn't trigger my chat restriction, game 1 did. And that game was full of toxic players saying things 10x worse than anything ive said that whole game. false reports should not trigger punishments because i didnt do anything wrong that game except play badly. \ni will be sending in a support ticket. \n\nanother Edit: i meant to say game 2 occurred last night, not game 1. i would fix it but idk how to scroll up in the editing mode to fix any mistakes i made. just know the order in which the games occurred are reversed.","replies":[{"poster":"Hydroxlic","date":"2017-10-19T01:18:50.734+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hells bellsX: trash bs %%%%% aint do shit all laning phase the only thing he can do is flip someone which requires him to get close\n \nWell I'm not going to say that this was the cause....But this was definitely the cause.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-10-19T10:40:01.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hydroxlic,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ocrEEIu6,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-10-19T01:18:50.734+0000)\n>\n> Well I&#x27;m not going to say that this was the cause....But this was definitely the cause.\n\nhappened a whole day before i got chat restriction, thats is not the cause, the false reports triggered the auto restriction.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-10-19T02:34:57.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first game you state how you're not trying, giving up, and just whining about getting auto filled.\n\nWhat got you a punishment is definitely the hate speech in game 2.
