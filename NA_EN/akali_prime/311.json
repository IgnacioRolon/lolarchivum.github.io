They accidentally counted for the required 20 truly owned champs to enter ranked. You shouldnt have been able to play ranked in the last hours. I guess they fixed the bug and you cant play ranked anymore until you have personally unlocked 20 champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2020-02-29T05:27:15.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because the free champions and your smaller pool are overlapping.\n\n**Ex.** You own 20 champions.\n\n First rotation, 10 of the champions are unique to your account so you have 30 in total.\n\n Next rotation comes around, one of the champions from the rotation is also one you already own, so now you have 29 in total.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2020-02-29T05:31:20.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea but the free rotation hasn't changed between earlier today and now. so it still makes no sense how i was able to play earlier and now i cant.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2020-02-29T06:35:01.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh.
