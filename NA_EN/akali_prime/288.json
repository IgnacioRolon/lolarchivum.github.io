I played Galio into Katarina the other day and actually won lane because I was able to predict when she would dash onto one of her daggers or a minion. Or, you could play an artillery like Xerath or Lux who can farm at a distance away from your allied minions. He can't poke you if he can't reach you.","replies":[{"poster":"highpriest Salex","date":"2017-05-30T20:13:22.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say you beat Kat as Galio as if he's not a counter...

The idea I was inferring was to play similarly against Yasuo. I've seen Vel'Koz utterly destroy Yasuo because of the inherent counter his kit is vs him. Also, I said dashes because I couldn't bring to mind the word \"blink\" for some reason... started to say \"flashes\" but I didn't want to get that confused with {{summoner:4}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-05-31T00:40:40.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, Flash is considered a blink as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Navarune","date":"2017-05-31T14:25:59.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Certainly.
