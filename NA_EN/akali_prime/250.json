Which really really sucks because 80% of champions in this game has some type of dash which is his biggest counter, also if he is CCd in anyway shape or form you will completely remove and put his main source of damage on CD. i honestly not even sure why he is a midlaner because 9/10 of all midlaners either are assassins or could out damage sol in seconds killing him before he can even boop you a 3rd time its frustrating trying to play this beautiful champion when 80% of all match ups counter you.\r\nso over the months ive been thinking how could we change this? what can we do to his kit that could make him more accessible? One solution i came up with was what if he wasn&#039;t a mage anymore? just what if instead of his passive and W didn&#039;t scale off of ap but instead of his %health?  like {{champion:113}} old W, so now you can build him mostly tanky with maybe rylais and Rod of ages this will keep him from being almost instantly deleted if someone jumps on him and he will be a tank now so champions focusing would mean hes doing his job right? lol \r\nAnother change that could happen that wouldn&#039;t require any change to his numbers would be to simple let him detonate his Q early when for when champions are on top of him, an extension of this idea would be to let his Q damage scale off its size and how long its been traveling, that way if sol detonated his Q right on top of him early it would do little damage and stun the target. Or if he manages to make a spirit bomb and hit the enemy team with it itll do massive damage to them, high risk high reward.\r\n\r\nthese are just some thought on the champion if you have any suggestions or other ideas please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Hovering Hentai","date":"2017-06-18T19:30:14.842+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He really just needs to be able to double tap his Q like {{champion:34}}","replies":[{"poster":"dolce de leche","date":"2017-06-18T19:44:02.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This all day.

Its not thematically fitting plus you'd be screwing off all his mains so hard. Imagine if your main was a bruiser and now he's a support. \n\nI'd rather they swap his E and R, his E feels much more ultimate like. Of course change the numbers, but this would give him some actual self peel and make him feel like he has a bit more to do in combat than just use stars.","replies":[]}]}
