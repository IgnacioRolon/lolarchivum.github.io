If you watch any sport, they tend to play to the weakest side of the opposing team. That is the case here, they camped the shit out of you, you got beat, and it sucked. Plain and simple, they played the game, and out matched your team (including you). It always sucks to be on the receiving end of these types of games, but there is nothing against the rules about it.\n\nIf you are harassing the enemy team, that is not playing the game. Sure you can give a ;-) whenever they miss a big skill shot or ult, or possibly give them a laugh or emote when you get a double under their tower, but that is not the same as calling them names and trying to harass them into tilting.\n\nI repeat, it sucks that you had a really bad game, but those happen.

Let say the midlaner did the same exact same thing, would you make a forum post saying \"I've been ganked by the enemy midlaner over and over this game, i think midlaners shoudn't be able to gank more than 10 times in a game, they should be punished if they come gank another lane more than 10 times !!!\"\n\nI'm sure that if you were in a game where your jungler came top and helped you kill your enemy over and over you'll be more than happy and you'll honor that jungler...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-12-31T01:13:42.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of it like corner camping in CoD.
