It is equally likely to happen to the enemy team as it is to your own team. You could do your best to prevent it in your own games by encouraging your teammates when they make mistakes, and not saying anything(or ping spamming/passive aggressive bullying) that will tilt someone into giving up or feeding.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2016-11-08T16:33:28.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one didnt afk until like 7 minutes into the game and the other afkd half way through the game","replies":[]}]}]}
