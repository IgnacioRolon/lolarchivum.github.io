If they are easy auto champions, natural engagers with tankiness or just champions who have enhanced autos naturally. Anything can exploit the hell out of this item, on top of that its second passive on {{item:3147}} doubles as a EZ control ward. So thats about 5 burds its killing now. Strong attack damage, a good chunk of lethality that scale off your level so 'snowballs' galore, cool down, extra auto burst and a ward killing ability, even if its not 'easy' to control. But when you have 3+ champions using the item, they are gonna shut down vision a good chunk just by roaming around.\n\nThose same champions i mention have 'measures' to exit vision for 1 second, possibly multiple times (Especially {{champion:84}} with her W) and gap close to get another empowered auto off alongside the one they likely got off at the beginning of a engage, with a whooping 5 seconds to give 'breathing room' on it. If they don't put a 30 second proc cooldown on it, then it basically became a abuse stick for any champion who can duck out of vision once or more times( AKA {{champion:35}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:238}} and {{champion:133}} because of her R mobility and Q vision blind, hell even {{champion:104}}  could exploit it with his smokescreen for 2 procs ) plus this is not counting champions who can plain just use the burst and don't need to proc the effect multiple times, this is just a example of champions who can use it because they can all go 'invisible for a second, sometimes more then once and exploit stacking the dmg bonus multiple times.\n\nPoint and case: GOD FUCKING DAMNMIT RIOT WHY DOES THE SHITTER ITEM NOT HAVE A COOLDOWN ON IT!?\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-07-24T18:45:46.000+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">then it basically became a abuse stick for any champion who can duck out of vision once or more times( AKA {{champion:35}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:238}} and {{champion:133}} because of her R mobility and Q vision blind, hell even {{champion:104}}  could exploit it with his smokescreen for 2 procs \n\nThis isn't an abuse in most of theses cases, they already build draktharr in previous patch before rework.

When assassins assassinate ppl they use their entire combo to, Adc's just auto someone get they duskblade proc and auto again and someone is dead. \n\nAssassins with duskblade is similar to a mages  because they use their entire combo, they burst ppl down because their dmg comes from their spells assassin dont have dps they just have burst.

People have been rioting once again about the abuse of adcs with lethality. \n\nOh I dont know maybe its the items that make them look good. Assassins have always been a hit or miss concept.

But it isnt lethality its duskblade, mf is a perfectly balanced champion and was doing well without it. Ppl dont complain about the champions they complain about the fact that they abuse items that they shouldnt. \n\nWhen lethality was out the reason it was a problem on Mf was because it scaled with you level it shouldn't have, it allowed adc's to use it which obviously wasnt healthy because they had to nerf the three abusers MF, varus, and Jihn. Making it scale with your level makes more sense because assassins want to be higher level while adc's are always a lvl behind because the exp s shared with the support. That problem was solved but now duskblade is out and range champions are abusing it  makes it even worse because they dont even need to use their full combo they just run in  auto get the proc and auto and burst someone down. DPS and burst isnt healthy thats why ppl complain about crit too because a adc being able to dps and burst isnt healthy for the game at all, their isnt even a delay like assassin or mages.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2017-07-24T00:21:30.726+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:59}} is more cancerous with it than any adc lul","replies":[{"poster":"Executioner","date":"2017-07-25T18:10:26.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant stand j4 with duskblade.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TálØnly","date":"2017-07-24T04:24:39.319+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"they buff lethality  for assassins and  adcs one shot me before I reach them \nKms xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpookyNeedle","date":"2017-07-24T07:30:16.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Some ranged champs in fine with using duskblade {{champion:133}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:110}} maybe {{champion:21}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-07-24T15:00:17.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"u don't build it on {{champion:110}}","replies":[{"poster":"Executioner","date":"2017-07-25T07:07:49.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, why are people even including varus?","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-07-25T11:05:44.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seems like they don't read patches, so they think he's still played as AD caster","replies":[{"poster":"Executioner","date":"2017-07-25T16:08:59.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of this blind hate, can be cured by reading.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-07-24T19:25:43.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hells bellsX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TkAdU8ji,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-07-24T00:02:21.361+0000)\n>\n> ESPECIALLY {{champion:21}}  i saw her literally one shot an assassin with just a basic attack with this thing atleast with assassins they have to get close and hit you to prock duskblade but adcs are a different story and its broken asf on them.\n\nClips or it didn't happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iDemacia","date":"2017-07-24T07:06:36.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just build {{item:3147}}  in a game as AD {{champion:7}}.
