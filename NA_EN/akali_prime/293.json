I don't remember reading that.\n\nEnchanted weapons would be the most likely option, especially given how her kama tends to glow.\n\nThere are also other times where something deals magic damage even though it isn't magical in nature, like almost all of Alistar's abilities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BenLegend443","date":"2018-12-09T09:37:01.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm fairly sure this was her lore as the Fist of Shadow, not the Rogue Assassin.
