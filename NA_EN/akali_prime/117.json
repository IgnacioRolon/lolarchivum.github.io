So repairing isn't the solution, at least in my case","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T01:51:38.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case it might actually be something within your pc itself.

I will submit a support ticket accordingly.  I hope it's not a complicated thing to resolve. I'm not even upset at Riot or the game in general over this.  All I want is hopefully to find a solution to the problem.  \n\nThank you for responding though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yang in 2020","date":"2017-05-28T00:53:12.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems a number of people are having a very similar problem right now, myself included.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoliPiner69","date":"2017-05-28T00:29:08.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same things happening to me really need a solution","replies":[]}]}
