This led to me being stuck having to farm under tower all laning phase because she would move or aggro the enemy unless they got too close she would occasionally use her Q to damage enemies when they got too close or use her E to heal me but she never once used her W which is her main source of power.\r\nld just sit there and not do anything She never spoke a single word that whole game and did dumb things like if i went aggro on enemies she wouldnt do anything and just sat under tower yet she wasnt afk and moved around in one fight she ulted herself while she was at full hp and i had like only 300 hp left and needed and she let me die then she died herself. she even teleported to the back tower (the one in front of base) while she was in base and had homeguards. This player was just inhumanly dumb and did absolutely nothing to help the team at all i really need riot to look into this before she ruins someone elses game.","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-06-11T01:44:12.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe he was lagging a lot?
