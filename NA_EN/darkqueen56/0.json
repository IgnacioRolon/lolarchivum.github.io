I feel like I've tried everything to fix it, i repaired league twice, i went back to the earlier build (before the update), and i un-installed, then re-installed it, but that didn't work. i really hope its not my laptop that's messed up because i just got it a couple weeks ago, its brand new. i hope that this can be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T18:30:15.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this issue a lot recently after the Windows 10 Anniversary update rolled out. The update enabled the Game DVR option inside the Xbox app and could be the direct cause of your PC freezes. I suggest you follow [this guide](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) and disable the game bar to see if it fixes the problem.\n\nLet me know if it did.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkQueen56","date":"2016-08-28T21:56:46.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh my gosh, it worked. thank you so so much for your help!!!","replies":[]}]}]}
