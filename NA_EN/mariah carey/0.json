I wanted to let more people know before they waste their money as Amazon for some reason has still not removed the ability to purchase RP as this problem persists. It would be really nice if Riot could shed some light on this situation, I've been buying RP on Amazon for over a year and this is really unprofessional.","replies":[{"poster":"Mariah Carey","date":"2016-10-01T21:02:52.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost a week and I still haven't received my RP.

I've talked to Amazon support multiple times and they're saying their $50 codes have expired. Check the most recent reviews, all of the ones made in recent days are one star with multiple people saying they haven't received any code.","replies":[]}]}]}
