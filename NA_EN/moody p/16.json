Ardent, funnel, tank meta - you name it and he's right up at the top, every time, as one of the worst enablers of obnoxious hyper carries taking over the game way sooner than they're supposed.\r\n\r\nNothing about this character is thought out very well and the sheer gold value he brings through shields and heals combined with his frankly unfair ultimate makes it so that any meta he can be decent in is automatically a meta in which he's top tier in. \r\n\r\nI have played Taric off and on since well before the rework, back to my beginning in season 4. I maintain good winrates on him for every season I've played him in. I can tell you with certainty that this rework is less healthy than the original kit; an ultimate like Tarics is basically the reason that damage creep needed to happen; because you lose automatically if you can't obliterate Tarics MVP(s) before the invulnerability pops. Except he has a multitude of tools to make it very difficult to do that, two of which are targeted and one of which covers a massive AOE so as to be very difficult to dodge.\r\n\r\nIt's time to admit that Taric is a problem champion.

More mana than he can sustain before building anything other than a Glacial Shroud. His heals are far, far, FAR from efficient, and are mainly there to allow him to spam his passive once he gets a healthy mana supply.\n\nHis shield is a shield based on the recipient's %Max HP. It starts at 8, and tops at 12. It's also one of his abilities that you max next to last. Therefore, squishy targets get smaller shields. It's not even remotely close to a Janna shield or Karma shield. It's more of an afterthought active for clutch saves and to designate a Bastion target.\n\nHis Dazzle is the meat of his kit, but relies heavily on your ally being exactly where you need them, and not fleeing so you can land your stuns to help them. If they're on top of you, not so much of an issue, but chances are people will want to kill your squishy friend first.\n\nHis R is telegraphed and delayed, and lasts a moderately short time. It is a game changer at times, but not without its shortcomings. It's entirely possible to kill Taric or his ally before the invulnerability even hits them. Considering the burst in the game, this isn't hard to do. If he does manage to land it, you have to simply back off until it wears off. Or you can CC people hit by it, since they're not immune to CC.\n\nTaric's base HP is also fairly low for a tank, and he really needs a few items under his belt to really be durable. This can be his downfall early game, because he REALLY needs to be building mana too, not only for his mana guzzling Q, but also so he can effectively use his passive.\n His rework is probably one of the healthiest reworks Riot has ever done, because there were incredibly few things that had to be fixed post launch, and he's remained very stable since then. There are a lot of Achilles' heels built into his kit, and a lot of windows of opportunity where you can either drive him to blow his mana to save his allies, or bait out his ultimate. Your assessment that he's toxic and broken is not only absurd, it's indicative of someone who hasn't actually played Taric, because if you did, you'd be HIGHLY AWARE of his weaknesses and weak points.\nOf course, his largest weakness is being CC'd from a range. This is INCREDIBLY easy to do in this current meta, where Morgana and Zyra are top performing supports who can easily tear him to pieces since he's not really going to be building MR. This meta isn't particularly favorable to Taric outside of highly organized teams that can coordinate things and fill in the gaps in his weak moments.\n\nTaric is not a problem, and if you disagree, please by all means show your work. You've made some boldly absurd statements without anything to actually back them up.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-04-16T10:46:44.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I like that I said listing Tarics kit is not an argument and then you proceeded to list his kit. lol.\n\nFighting to outlast Tarics mana bar is not a healthy representation of gameplay; Sona is a horrible design for the same reason.

Champions that excel in these roles - like Taric - are harder to point the finger at because they rely on someone else doing the flashy things.
