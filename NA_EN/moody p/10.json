She is only somewhat good or amazing if your macro play is way better than average. \n\nShe is broken high tier since they are good at the game and Akali is a champion where if you don't make any mistakes, you auto-win your lane. Pro play is an example of why Akali is OP too. High skill cap and floor, they don't make any mistakes therefore she is complete broken tier before and still is good while begin trash soloQ unless your master+.\n\nAs I said a million times.
