Obviously this makes the generous assumption that your team didn't collectively tab out to check Twitter as soon as you went in. If that happens, then yes, you've been countered. \r\n\r\nVayne never appears in tank metas because the optimal ADCs in these games are high range hyper carries who can sit behind their front line and do well in the stability of front-to-back teamfights that are enabled by tanks. Twitch, Tristana, KogMaw, etc. Vayne thrives in chaotic and disorganized fights and she usually shows up (as an actual strong pick and not just her standard popularity) when soloQ has degenerated into fiesta time. \r\n\r\nVayne is more accurately an anti bruiser and is at her strongest when soloQ is laced with bruisers and assassins, creating disorganized fights that she thrives in. \r\n\r\nBasically, tanks are not bad in soloQ because Vayne is strong. Vayne is strong because tanks are bad in soloQ.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2019-08-05T23:26:45.953+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"She actually counters Tanks\nBut one tank after one\nShe isn't exactly a team fighter \nGetting locked by a tank then getting bursted is something that happens with any carry anyway , not only Vayne","replies":[{"poster":"BrightWîngs","date":"2019-08-05T23:50:58.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"true but she is a fantastic team fighter","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2019-08-06T00:03:58.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BrightWîngs,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=79qhQEj1,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-08-05T23:50:58.848+0000)\n>\n> true but she is a fantastic team fighter\n\nKind of depending on the situation\nIf you are against a team fighting comp then she is fucked up\nIf she is against some squishies where she can just 3 auto them then yes she is fantastic","replies":[{"poster":"BrightWîngs","date":"2019-08-06T10:51:14.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne has plenty of tools to teamfight she is by far one of the best team fighting ADCs do you realize how hard it is to kill someone you can even click on XD.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2019-08-05T23:37:08.541+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"MoodyP defending a ranged top laner...\n\n\nDude are you OK?

Vayne has a really ambiguous range that gets worse every time she tumbles. That's basically how Vayne has remained relevant for so long and is busting games left and right whenever Caitlynn isn't meta. That's her first problem.\n\nThe second problem is that, Vayne was never a teamfighter and her issue has always been her bullying on tanks in lane way too much. So \"outside of a 1v1 fight...\" is right, because she's broken against tank in 1v1 and that's always been one of her bigger problems.\n\n* The above 2 is amplified by the fact Vayne's passive makes her snowball extremely hard since any advantage Vayne gets means she'll get even more advantage since you can't escape her.\n\nHer third problem is that her ulti is broken when combined with the rest of her kit. She's too good at deleting both tanks and squishy alike while remaining relatively hard to pin down as long as the enemy team doesn't overcommit on nothing but just her.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-08-06T01:49:42.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if any of this mattered then Vayne would be relevant in games where tanks are prevalent.

There's not much you can do about point and click CC, but you can predict that the engage tanks are _probably_ going to engage on the squishy short range adc, and q/flash out of range/sit behind your front line so they can't get to you while you melt them. qss and bodies to block for you are paramount to any adc's success. If vayne does get locked down, she was standing somewhere she shouldn't have been.\n\nYou also have tools (q, ult+q, e, bork, qss, flash, heal) to help you survive and get away from things that want to clap you.
