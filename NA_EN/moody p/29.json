There should be more outplay potential in the game, but damage negates all outplay potential.\n\nI call this the celebrity effect:\n\n1. Riot has been pushing e-sports for a long time.\n2. They think big numbers and the faster the health bar disappear, the more exciting the game would look. On the other hand, fights lasting longer, and champions surviving longer is \"unexciting to the viewers\" in their standards.\n3. Therefore, they increase the damage, nerf defense and in the past \"changed how a healthy damage formula worked into a celebrity looking one\".\n4. Out playing opponents takes too much work, excitement and is frustrating to a lot of people, therefore, if everyone can one shot everyone, it makes players feel good and don't have to put in as much work. Therefore, they further buffed damage and nerfed defense.\n\nTo sum it up: big damage/numbers = exciting, hard to kill = boring/makes noobs quit. How else are they supposed to even the gap? but most importantly? If you and your opponent takes longer to die, how are you supposed to look like a celebrity when people are watching? One shotting people make you look like you're a god at the game, therefore, they must find a way for you to be able to look like one. It's all about how you look when  people are watching you. That's the whole point.\n\nDo you understand now?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-12-08T17:40:28.296+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"im not usually one to agree with moodyP... but seriously guys..\n\n nerf the op shit.\n\nthe answer to \"school shootings\" isn't to give all the kids weapons so they can defend themselves.
