He is very, very reliable and its almost stifling in how guaranteed he starts feeling after you get used to his E.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by nuance is that most other juggernauts have some kind of depth to their playstyle that at least makes it fun to get up on somebody and bash them like a cave man. Darius plays around 5 stacks before he has his steroid and his Q outer range and R resets. Illaoi fights around her tentacles. Aatrox fights around his sweet spots. Yorick is pretty mindless bashing but he has to PvE for half a minute before he can throw E at you and go full chimp on your head. \r\n\r\nMordekaiser gets his passive up with any 3 instances of damage from his kit, and then his passive aura is up for as long as he's fighting. In addition to that his primary steroid is completely passive and permanent, and only requires gold to scale it further.\r\n\r\nIts not that he's almost Garen levels of simple, but I just don't really feel *satisfied* by the gameplay pattern I'm given; he doesn't have enough visceral satisfaction through stimulating visuals to make this simplicity work the way Garen does. And I asked my friends who also have PBE and they agreed that he feels very simple and statchecky.\r\n\r\nI like a lot more about Mordekaiser than I thought I would -- him having a pure defensive tool and good utility is fantastic change of pace and a direction I hope continues -- but currently the sum of the kit is offputting to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-05-31T01:45:15.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Main damage comes from 2 abilities that are skillshots but hes a statcheck?

Mundo scales insanely well while building full HP and can regen to full through grievous wounds with his ult. Also His cleaver is short CD and if he lands it once, you're basically dead if you are overextended. If you dodge Morde's E(24 second cooldown at rank 1 btw, compared to mundo's 4 second at all ranks cleaver), he cant catch you unless you're playing unmounted Kled.

All Juggernauts are balls of stats, but that doesn't necessarily make them stat checks, especially not Aatrox who you can outplay in many ways. \n\nNow Trundle, he's a statcheck: \n\n* No potential to outplay him\n* Ult steals your stats while letting him 3 hit you with q\n* W literally just gives him stats while he's in it, and lets him stick\n* Pillar is on Trundle to missuse, though it's not an amazing ability \n\nCompared to New Morde:\n\n* Q is missable\n* E is missable\n* His w and e cooldowns are long 15+ seconds at low levels and if he misses e he cant stick and loses a lot of kill potential\n* Passive requires 3 hits to activate, so you must hit q and e to proc quickly, considering his low attack speed\n* no way to stick without passive, and sticking isn't the best even with it\n* Morde's ult has statcheck (statstealing) elements(for some reason riot put it on cast and not just as the reward), so I'll give him that.\n\nBut otherwise, Morde is not a stat check, he is actually less of a statcheck than current Morde(and I main current Morde).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-05-31T08:40:47.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Darius plays around passive and Q, a skillshot that can be dodged by moving directly towards it.

They have an enjoyable payoff to their pattern that makes them feel good to play. That is the complaint. Mordekaiser is missing that feeling of payoff because the bulk of his damage is not doled out in an enjoyable way, is acquired too easily, and after the rework his skill ceiling is much lower.\n\nCompared to old Mordekaiser who had a more complex W especially factoring in its ally uses and the management of his ghosts, I'm left wanting when I play the new one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-05-31T01:52:16.381+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"No it doesn't.

With his passive up, he’s dealing 85% of his AP as DPS, and that’s without factoring in his base damage (which seems lower than live Morde).  You could potentially just build him with speed ups and slows to the point where you press a couple keys then right-click once to win, like Mundo or pre-rework Aatrox.\n\nNow compare that DPS with his Q and E.  Yes, he is an immobile auto-attack based melee champion.  Q is more for poke/CS than as DPS, while E is engage.  His win condition is simply getting in range.  At least, that’s all they should be for - but they also stack his passive!  I say Morde’s base attack speed should be slightly higher, and his passive only stacks on autoattacks.
