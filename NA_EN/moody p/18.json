There are more than this but not many.\n\nWhen you look at most carries, especially recent ones, just about all of them have a condition to unlock it or have a meaningful cooldown on it. Fiora has to hit vitals, Darius has to stack his passive, etc. Most marksman have cooldowns on their button steroids that matter quite a lot.\n\nThe champions I&#039;ve listed above do not have that. Most of them have either completely passive damage steroids that are always on, or have cooldown that is negligible enough to not really be considered. Mundo and Cho&#039;Gath have button tap steroids that get to 100% up time later on. Vayne is mostly only as limited by how many times she can attack one person. Jax has no meaningful gating to his offense, only his defense. And so on.\n\nEssentially these champions tip fights in their favor by virtue of just existing. Their win condition is simply to outlast or deny your power ups; they have all of the counter play tools for you in their hand but you are not given the same courtesy. This is IMO a frustration point that isn&#039;t talked about enough. Its an interaction that does not fit into the current League philosophy and is one I think strongly deserves to be looked at.\n\n\\* I&#039;m tempted to give Yasuo a pass because while his direct damage may not have a real limit, he is at least conditioned on needing minion waves or a knockup to reliably close a gap.","replies":[{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-01-30T21:55:44.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Letâ€™s not put Jax in here.

Things move a bit more slowly, and there's no pressure to get a kill within a strict time limit or be useless. Not only that, but burst steroids warp everything else around them. If a champion has a 3-second burst window followed by 10 seconds of being a lot weaker, not only do they have to get a kill in those 3 seconds, but the sustained damage champs they face now also have to be able to get a kill in that 3-second window before the burst champ disengages.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-01-31T02:24:14.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"non-burst and windowed are not mutually exclusive. having a point in time where you may be weaker does not mean you are not a DPS champion. likewise just because you have a le permanent steroid doesn't mean you can't nuke \n\nchamps who have no window to hit back shouldn't exist in the same game as champs who give ample room to fight back\n\n calling jax and cho'gath non burst ?XD","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-31T02:57:37.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k8zk4fO7,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-31T02:24:14.131+0000)\n>\n> non-burst and windowed are not mutually exclusive. having a point in time where you may be weaker does not mean you are not a DPS champion. likewise just because you have a le permanent steroid doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t nuke \n> \n> champs who have no window to hit back shouldn&#x27;t exist in the same game as champs who give ample room to fight back\n> \n>  calling jax and cho&#x27;gath non burst ?XD\n\nIsn't this whole complaint about being killed over a long period of time by non-burst?

Jax is every bit a dose AND a burst champ. Have you never seen him jump on a fed adc or assassin and absolutely annihilate them in about 1-2 secs? He does it all the time. He even shreds juggernauts like my poor darius. But the point is, as OP states, windows of opportunity. When is Jax weak? After he blows helicopter of course, except he's not really that weak and that's only if HE messes up, he otherwise passively beats the crap out of anyone with jumping range in most matchups besides champs like illaoi. Jax and vayne. Sustained dps is fine, but completely suffocating opponents due to a kit and not due to player decisions and playstyle is not ok. Take darius. Massive ad buff...after 5 stacks and only until the stacks are down. Has no mobikity and can only heal IF he lands a mediocre range q. He has tools to help him do that, but only if enemy is already in range of pull. Without ghost/flash (which anyone can take) or deadmans plate (subpar tank stats) or righteous glory (good for chasedowns, but scales poorly for fighting and not good on defensive) he can't force himself in range of enemy or escape. Jax and vayne can initiate, Jax and vayne can escape/self peel, both have otherwise good mobility, both insane damage, one can juke anything with her q, the other has tanky stats in ult and damage reduction/auto attack blocker stun on E. Both have insane and ungated damage that requires no true strategy other than hit the enemy as often as possible and kill them with burst per second. Neither has to aim anything to land it (if vayne doesn't hit you into wall with condemn, it's still good peel and MUCH better than darius missing Q). Both can AVOID damage. The only tankiness a champ like dar gets is by healing it up after taking it on a very dodge able ability. If champs like dar can have so much inherent counterplay, so can champs like vayne or Jax. That's really the issue here after all. Counterplay and champs who lacks anything other than \"meh cc or ban them\" because that applies to anybody but tanks, not just Squishies. If a tank eats cc, it's probably a good thing for team, if a jugfernaut or bruiser does, they will be kited tlor chain ccd to Oblivion, if an adc does, dead, if an assassin gets cc'd...they will probably escape if they survive. The problem is vayne is incredibly hard to cc because of liw cost and low CD tumblers, and Jax has both ability to jump out of harm's way AND tank damage. Champs like Darius or trundle, etc have to be able to eat a crap ton of damage to even merely function, and in this meta that can't be counted on without in-kit defensive steroids","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-31T16:32:32.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kingDeDeDarius,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k8zk4fO7,comment-id=000400000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-31T13:57:11.090+0000)\n>\n> Wrong on at least one count.

The concept of steady DPS rather than burst is healthier for the game, because burst builds need to have enough power to kill someone during that burst or they're useless (assassins, and pretty much any carry these days). An extended fight means more time to play and react, which is a good thing. If Jax's windows of weakness are too small, that's not an inherent issue with his design; he could just get some longer CDs, require more passive stacks, that sort of thing.\n\nVayne's Tumble is unrelated to her always-on DPS steroid. She has no poke outside her auto range, so she needs Tumble to avoid skillshots when approaching and remaining in that range. The only other marksman with no poke outside her auto range is Trist, and her auto range increases with level.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kingDeDeDarius","date":"2019-01-31T00:32:38.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think MoodyP has a pretty solid post here","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-01-31T01:39:32.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as usual","replies":[{"poster":"kingDeDeDarius","date":"2019-01-31T13:36:32.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k8zk4fO7,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-01-31T01:39:32.232+0000)\n>\n> as usual\n\nWell it's not everyday... ;)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2019-01-31T02:42:09.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would argue windowed defense is the issue.
