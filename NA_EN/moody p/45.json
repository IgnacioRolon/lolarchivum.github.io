Her windowed power gave you far more time to handle her, especially in lane, compared to her no-downtime new passive that stays up for as long as she's touching you, which on top of her much-improved burst potential (IMO the real problem of the rework, nice 500 base damage on her R and spammable Q) is just a little too much killing power. Yeah, the old stun was annoying, but it was entirely a numbers issue and could be tweaked many different ways. Old Irelia was slippery through tenacity when outnumbered; new Irelia is just as slippery without the condition thanks to Q resets while also having a huge % DR soak as an emergency button. You can't really address new Irelia's issues with numbers changes, you'd have to start taking stuff out of her kit and I think we're going to keep seeing Irelia on the patch notes until Riot realizes this.\r\n\r\nAlso it doesn't help that her 2 skillshots are so ridiculously wide, especially her E which can stun you at least 3x as thick as the visual indicator might actually suggest.

They kept her Q and changed her E everything else is new on her . I wouldn't mind if Riot pulled a Rengar on her (in a bigger scale ofc) and reverted her kit back to the old one while keeping the new model . Now ofc it won't be just snap with the fingers and bam its good to go the model design just won't be able to do the same animations so they will need to update it .\n\nThe current Irelia as it stands for me isn't a champion that is fun . I mained the old Irelia (call me a salty ex irelia main if you wish :P ) and I enjoyed her old kit duo to the factor it relied on timing and situations . For example her E stun depended if she had more health than her enemy or not so against a squishy it would be a slow while against a tank it would be a stun . On top of that how you maxxed her abilites impacted your lane quite a bit . If you were against a lane bully like Renekton you'd max q or e first depending on how aggresive he is while if you were against someone ranged like Kennen you'd max W first to sustain and play passive in the early level , while on the other hand if you were against someone like Shen you'd start Q and go looking for a fight with him in the early levels or at the very least deny him cs while using your Q reset to farm . One more thing that I loved about Irelia was her ult . If you timed it right you could get 4 sheen procks off which is quite a bit of damage especially if you have a trinity built . As it stands the current Irelia has nothing that keeps her as fun as the old one . Sure she's THICC (praise the lord for that) and I love her voice and animations but its just not enjoyable to play her . You go into a fight ya get your ult off (which is easy to juke just dash or flash before it hits ya) q once then q a second time because you ain't pulling that E stun off boy theres a 50% chance it will somehow miss or the enemy will have a qss or a mikael's or heck cleanse (does anybody even take that nowadays o_O) and then your last option is to W and praise the sun hoping ya live somehow because while you do get damage reduction you know that theres going to be a pissed off yasuo that you tried to kill a second ago waiting with a tornado , ult and ignite combo to just hasakey you to the earth's core . On the old Irelia you'd go in with your q on a minion or enemy (depends on the situation ofc) use your E to slow the enemy (its still a yasuo I ain't changing it) then use your W for the true damage and start whacking at the dude while using your ult to get off Sheen procks and if all else fails by the time the enemy is ganging up on ya your Q and E will be up again for either a harder engage (preferably on the enemy's ADC) or a good disengage ya gonna be low enough to stun pretty much anyone if they focus you down fast enough so you can easily pull off a stun on their bruiser/damage dealer and then you can easily Q to the farthest target or if your team follows up you can easily finish the job duo to the factor you got 1 of the enemies already low and they had their focus on you so theres a high chance they won't change it till they kill you and you are the goddess of sustain in that case cuz Spirit Visage + active W + BoRK = Am I getting attacked with tooth picks ?\n\nEdit: O yea ima just put this here GBay99 the ''Irelia OTP'' that would have in his top 3 spots Irelia with around 1k games Jax with like 100 games and whatever was busted for 2 patches in third place with like 30 games on him/her now has Jax in first place and Irelia in second with a roughly 60 to 70 game difference .

This is doubly problematic when we take into consideration the poor state of runes and itemisation. I'm probably going to take a lot of flack for this but, I firmly believe the game was much easier to balance when all we had to worry about was overtuned stats.

New Irelia completely changed Irelia's kit and build from an AA based champ to a bursty bruiser.

I also prefer Irelia's old Q even though it was harder to cs with, it felt a lot smoother. I don't entirely have an issue with the skill requirement changes or build paths but I do have an issue with how they completely changed her kit/gameplay. Yes, they did keep her Q but they completely changed her damage output, ultimate, and teamfight/laning phase. . Old irelia was more controlled with the sheen powerspike and could acutally be abused in lane but new Irelia has a W that basically negates damage and CC and your entire goal is to stack up conqueror on minions and to hit level 2 for firstblood all-in. Even though new irelia has skillshots that debately take more skill, I still think old-irelia took more skill because the Q damage against minions wasn't amplified so chasing/kiting/procing sheen took more risky decision making. New irelia you just all-in whenever your E and Q are up and just reset, and missing combos doesn't really hurt you in lane, especially since Q damage is amplified on minions as a handicap wheras old Irelia didn't. Just my 2 cents, not everyone might agree with me but I did main old irelia. It's also a lot easier to play successfully as new irelia than old irelia and this is proven by players picking her up and winning games with almost no experience as a top laner or irelia player in general. Basically I feel the rework removed the uniqueness of being an \"Irelia Player\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-09-18T13:41:01.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old irelia's kit, though very fun, is much more toxic. I don't think her ult is an issue at all. Her stun is fine, it can be baited or just flat out dodged. I do think a way to fix her Q would be to give it a yasuo-e type ramp up, while also promoting switching targets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-09-18T09:15:47.687+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"No","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-09-18T09:50:36.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-09-18T10:01:19.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yesn't","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Laçez","date":"2018-09-19T13:04:37.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer this Irelia, you can actually put her behind by beating her unlike the last one where essesntially if yo're winning she gets a stronger kit.

Remove that and all you would have to do as either a tank or bruiser is build Adaptive Helm, Tabis, and any armor items you need/want and she'll just do less. This can be said about almost every other champ that can use and uses the rune: Darius, Fiora, Jax, Renekton, Udyr (if he goes AD Tiger), Master Yi, Kled, Draven, Tryndamere, Olaf (Top Lane Olaf), and Riven. If there is anything to learn from Conqueror, its a balancing error waiting to happen. \nConqueror needs the true damage to be changed to something else if you want a healthy balance of tanks and bruisers in top lane. Long as the true damage exists, bruiser champions (and Draven) will be hard to balance. If you want a reason why armor just seems \"not worth it\", the true damage is where the fault lies.","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2018-09-18T21:32:42.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try playing Irelia with anything except Conqueror (like grasp, pta or fleet) and see how she fails to do anything.
