No &quot;MUH SKILLSHOT&quot; garbage that keeps worming itself deeper into the game. Just a simple, beautiful niche spell. Finally, a rework that actually encourages strategy over mechanics and niche but strong value over bland generalism - getting back to LoL&#039;s roots but 10x better.\r\n\r\nI could not be more eager to see this work out well.

Reworks are much larger scale.\n\nAlso removing her potential to be played in a solo lane.\n\nSo the wrap it up she will be the least played she has ever been. She still doesn't feel like the old Karma which they said these changes were supposed to bring back old Karma a little bit more like old Soraka. Lastly, she has lost her lane diversity. So these changes in all are awful.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-10-24T21:56:41.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Niche is good, far better than every generalist iteration of Karma that's existed prior and thus couldn't ever be justified unless her numbers were better \n\n>Also removing her potential to be played in a solo lane.\n\n? nothing about her has changed to nerf her solo lane potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-10-24T22:43:49.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes they do. These changes will not just be added to her and then forgot about. There will be nerfs to other aspects of her kit and that will be her solo lane potential.

The new part of her W requires her to be in cast range of her ally. So 675 away from you ally that if this change is supposed to incentivize mages bot as Carrie's which it seems to be that way means that you are 675 away from you ally that is 500+ away from the enemy, so you are about 1100 away from the enemy. That is pretty safe in my book.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-10-24T22:57:29.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf are you even talking about?\n\nW has nothing at all to do with any allies.

I didn't at the time I responded to you. I did shortly after.\n\nI'm at work now, so can't type much....\n\nBut it looks like they want to solidify her as a jungler now. (Passive now affects large monsters too) (I'm ahead of the curve..... been jungling her since Season 6)\n\nHer Micro play is going to have a lot more complications - Heal self and Root,...... or Enable another champ to kill...../restore their mana/CDRs. That means..... you're going to have to pick what teams you play Karma on.\n\nYou probably need a Jhin or or something with a strong CC to stun/root if you're going to use the support mechanic of her W as a support rather than mid/jungle. I wouldn't use her with Lucian, since he can't CC. It'd help his CDR, but there'd be no hard cc in that lane, unless she went for the root and played as normal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-10-24T21:06:32.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"new rework or are you talking about the karma we currently have?\n\nim so confused\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ã†theist","date":"2018-10-24T20:56:59.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides the part where Riot basically ignored seven years of people asking for the shield-bomb mechanic to come back and are just continuing to tack things nobody wanted onto her.\n\nAlso, that mana/cooldown restoring mechanic should've been saved for a Zilean rework if anything.","replies":[]}]}
