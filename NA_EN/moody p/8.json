Truth is, its almost entirely buffs, either in flat power or in usability. \n\nBut there's a reason - a few in fact - that these are well received by Garen players.\n\nI'd like to start on the thing I see most repeated; that Garen is having defense nerfed for damage. No; he is losing 20 of his defensive farm stars because his passive is being buffed quite enormously. His up front defense has been shifted to superior sustain and lastability, because its more visible and more satisfying. He will be the same if not better into ranged matchups because of his better lastability. \n\nSpeaking of his damage, the reason its going up is quite simple; Garen's damage sucks. With a large part of his damage being tied to Villainy and an isolation mechanic that nobody really notices or cares about, removing it means that his general damage is going to go up. This is not damage creep; it's normalization and rational changes. It makes perfect sense that a champion who has his damage entirely limited to melee range scraps with no hard CC to lock you down in that range should have frightening damage when he gets you in that range. You can say whatever you like about that, but that's just how it is. \n\nAnother big and under stated reason these changes are excellent is because they give Garen *synergy*. The way his E works now (applying onhit, scaling off of AS) actually *opens* more bot lane combos than Yuumi where Garen is the carry as he is meant to be, because supports can now actually contribute to raising his damage threat as enchanters are supposed to do for their carries. Lulu with Ardent  stacking buffs onto a Garen is a very scary thing, and this alongside his passive changes are likely two enormous boosts to his high elo viability in any lane.\n\nI think my only concern here is that there's too little consideration for low ELO in these changes. I don't care about it, and I don't think riot should either, but Riot does, and none of these changes have moved his skill expression around at all; he's still very low floor and with how volatile a champion like him can be at low rank play, I think he might be too strong with these buffs. \n\nThat's all.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-08-17T02:06:09.560+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"I'm scared tbh. The Buffs are really scary:\n\nJudgment applying up to 10 INNATE On hits to targets less than 50% HP? WTF? Garen could build a {{item:3153}} and literally shred someone to death without even using his ult. (and the Botrk would increase the ticks to 11). Also, keep in mind life steal is an on hit effect! This change is going to make him life steal from spinning.....\n\nAlso, Non Epic Monsters are never going to disable his Life regen?\nDoesn't that shift his role from top to a jungler, since he can just {{item:1039}} + passive and sustain better than any jungler in the game? (His sustain per second is greater than Mundo when it's active).\n\nThe rest just looks like tweaks. But these two changes look HUGE.\n\nI'm not saying the changes necessarily will change the Garen meta to build {{item:3153}}  or meta him to jungle; I'm saying that the scalability is there and it will be abused and people will not be able to adapt to it fast enough when it happens. It'll snowball a game when players aren't ready for it.\n\nThe change arguably makes Garen one of the best users of {{item:3091}} by far, since it is a pure on hit mod, and once it's scaled up to level 18, that's 80*12 = 960 extra damage a spin...... and if Garen gets low enough it'll almost auto heal him up to half HP. How do you feel about a guaranteed execute basic skill that heals a juggernaut to half HP on a low cooldown ready for the next target?","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-08-17T02:20:24.684+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"You've misread it.

With Dance, he can't even be damaged....\n\n#And yes. I know. Professor Akali.... always off meta sensationalist. But this is real. It's on a simple champion with no real learning curve, no mana costs, where the only real decision you have to make is when to go in and when to back off. In other words, this WILL be the meta. I even forgot about Tiamat/Hydra procs.\n\nThe only difference between High Elo and Low elo will be:\nLow elo: Goes 20/4 in 20 minutes, because they make mistakes and hesitate at applying pressure (so they won't get 2+ kills a minute, unless a smurf, who WILL get 2+ kills a minute)\n\nHigh elo: Goes 18/4, because someone will rush early Grievous wounds, and while killing 2-3 people, he will die not to mistakes, but to overwhelming teamwork. Team will capitalize on the death, take turrets, and end the game faster than low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2019-08-17T13:42:06.590+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"So let’s see, a diamond and past really high elo player kicks ass on the pbe.

Did you open your eyes while watching the video? His opponents basically ran it down so many times. Dying the same way over and over while not respecting their lane opponent in the least.\n\nFor the kit to be that “op” you need to be full build or have multiple items. For that your opponents need to be r%%%%%ed enough to let you get fed in the first place. It’s just not going to happen. At the end of the days all that will really change is you’ll see garens running lethal tempo and getting titanic hydra. Literally nothing else has changed.

For me and my playstyle that thing will be beautiful. Can't wait. Should notch my lane win rate up 10% or so. can't wait.\n\nYea I've no idea why some one think Garen is a tank. It clearly says he is a fighter in his bio.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-08-21T03:24:42.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fighter isn't a term in league anymore though, he's a juggernaut.\n\n>Juggernauts are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp.

Pre rework Darius was literally the simplest champion in the game; at least Garen had/has to time his W well to get the most out of it. Reworked Darius is much much more popular and shows up in pro play occassionally without warping it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lukáš Mrákošlap","date":"2019-08-17T12:45:26.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1416}} + {{item:3153}} +{{item:3124}} +{{item:3091}} \n\nSounds legit to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Danyoja","date":"2019-08-17T07:11:36.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, once the rework comes out I can see the forums begging for nerf (I mean there are actually plenty already). Unfortunately with a kit as simple as Garen if it's made to do okay in high-elo it will stomp in lower elo. I think for changes they will increase the cooldown of his ult and maybe move it back to magic, but time will tell. I be happy for a base move speed increase. I know it just got nerf, but til now I thought it was weird that Tahm was faster than Garen via base if they have to take some damage away because he's too strong I hope they give him a little speed or something to compensate.","replies":[]}]}
