Correct usage of Volibear's E entirely determines how successful you will be and makes the difference of whether or not Lucian/Vayne kite you forever or whether you lock down an enemy Tristana and kill her. It's the same way for melee matchups; beating Irelia, Tryndamere, Riven, Jax _hinges_ on you correctly interrupting their dashes or you will get body bagged. \n\n>what becomes the point of playing harder champs \n\nBecause \"\"\"harder\"\"\" champions still bring far more to the table.\n\n>And additionally, the “run at people and auto attack people until he dies or they die” niche is already hard over saturated. Garen, Olaf, Skarner, Voli\n\nAll 4 of these champions hold more distinction between each other in their roles to fill than almost every rework or new release in years. You don't substitute Olaf for Garen when you're vsing a Juggermaw comp. You don't pick Volibear for the lockdown that Skarner provides, and you won't pick Skarner for the disruption and AOE potential that Volibear brings. They're already different enough from each other and they've never pushed each other out of viability simply because they were good themselves. Ever.\n\n> Even possibly Illaoi at some points.\n\nDon't talk out of your ass.\n\n>only Olaf has not been a complete and chronic balance problem. \n\nWhat? Olaf has been the biggest balance problem; what are you on about? There's a _reason_ he got gutted so hard in the past that they called it an Olafing. Volibear has been able to go under radar for most of his existence and be at least passably good to doing great. It wasn't until the end of season 7 that his performance started nose-diving and Riot _needed_ to acknowledge him. \n\n>Hell, even old Darius had to get reworked away from that play style because there’s simply no more room in that niche for any more champs to be viable. \n\nOld Darius got reworked because he was trash. Plain and simple; he was a troll pick at any respectable ELO and needed far more AD through items than his limited kit would allow.\n\nYou could have just said you don't like it when champions run at you because you and most of Boards have come to the ridiculous decision that that's somehow a bad thing, because that's really the crux of your argument. I'm sure you'd prefer it if Volibear was an epic super-dashy boy because that's immediately cool and awesome if a champion just doesn't have to even consider being kited or peeled. \n\nVolibear is being kept down because he stomps all over bad players and because his kit isn't marketable. He does not have the visual 'wow' factor that makes Riot money, so they keep him weak until he gets bad enough that people start calling them out for it.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf36083462","date":"2018-11-25T17:44:49.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) You mean to tell me the ONE thing that distinguishes this champion is a tiny aoe knockup around him?\n\n2) So the only thing that makes these champs unique is slight differences in their damage output/cc? \n\n3) Illaoi, other than some tentacle plays, legit just runs at people and tries to bonk them to death for the whole game.

All those other champions have literally been meme level their entire lives.\n\n5) So do you know why they didn’t just buff Darius back then, like you’re trying to do for Voli now? Because then he would completely invalidate every single juggernaut and make them outright unplayable because his stats would easily outclass them in every way. They had to rework him so he would play different from other juggernauts so he couldn’t completely outclass them with nothing but better numbers.\n\n6) I don’t even think a champ needs flashy mobility to be cool. Taric, Poppy, Jhin, Xayah, Urgot, and Darius all have proven themselves to be capable of pretty cool things (and possibly now Neeko). Voli, on the other hand is actually nothing but bargain bin Garen, and cmon, GAREN of all champs. Let that sink in.\n\n7) If you buff Voli, Garen and some others become 100% worthless. Why play a champ who plays just like this other champ, but with worse stats?","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-11-25T18:02:20.360+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You literally have no concept of what you're on about. Please don't bother me after this response. \n\n>1) You mean to tell me the ONE thing that distinguishes this champion is a tiny aoe knockup around him?\n\nAnd his ult. No other fighter is able to affect multiple people to the extent Voli is with auto attacks. His goal is to get into the thick of a fight and AOE people down with R and keep disrupting with Q and E with the added bonus of getting to burst a squishy; he also has easily the best engage of any Juggernaut. Olaf gets picked to counter comps that put all their focus on one champion to do all their damage (Kog'maw/Twitch meta). Garen's an anti-snowball champion with a *bit* of anti-caster in his silence. Skarner is for lock down and target isolation.\n\nThey all do different things. Far more variant in their roles than most fighters, especially the new ones who are all complete generalists who are bad at nothing; ironic that you're prattling about them making anyone irrelevant but then singing Urgot's praises when Urgot and Aatrox are better than every other juggernaut at almost everything and are _actually_ making other champions irrelevant.\n\n>So do you know why they didn’t just buff Darius back then,\n\nBecause Darius would still be garbage, because you can buff numbers all you want, his kit would still be trash. Volibear does not have that issue; he's been relevant all the way up to the pro scene multiple times and it's almost always indirect changes that end up shafting him. He has a great kit, he's held back by terrible numbers. \n\n>Illaoi, other than some tentacle plays, legit just runs at people and tries to bonk them to death for the whole game. Like every. Other. Brain dead. Tank-thing.\n\nFirst of all, no she doesn't. She's designed specifically to be dog shit at chasing people down. She builds a nest and tries to get you to come into her reach while she advances and then blows you up if you misstep. Illaoi easily takes more skill to play to a high level than anyone you play. \n\n>So the only thing that makes these champs unique is slight differences in their damage output/cc? \n\nThat's exactly how niche works. Stupid shit gimmicks don't matter at all if the outcome is the same thing that everyone else is doing. This is why Irelia is a stupid rework; because her niche qualities are completely obscured by the heaps and heaps of things that make her an always good champion. Why every \"modern\" tank is completely interchangeable with each other because they have NO NICHE. They go in, and they CC you, and that's it. They lock you down. How they do it does not matter; what CC they're hitting you with does not matter if it's still all hard CC. \n\nAkali is the only recent update that comes to mind that can truly qualify as a niche champion; she is not and will never be an 'always good' pick by nature of how her kit works and has not been bloated with add-ons to make that different.\n\nSo I'll reiterate; these 4 champions already stand out from each other far more than anybody you'd sing the praises of.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf36083462","date":"2018-11-25T18:37:40.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, tfw the only difference between Voli and Skarner is 1.5 seconds of CC and about 600 units of distance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf36083462","date":"2018-11-25T18:27:32.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fact, for tanks, it’s the OLD tanks that are the brain dead ones, I think you have your nostalgia glasses on too tight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2018-11-25T06:55:46.849+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CasterGilgamesh,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9BM6x4ds,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-25T06:52:52.160+0000)\n>\n> voli is a stat stick.....\n\nAll champions are stat sticks....","replies":[{"poster":"ankoanko19","date":"2018-11-25T14:48:18.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Velasan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9BM6x4ds,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-25T06:55:46.849+0000)\n>\n> All champions are stat sticks....\n\nUh no dude.

Definitely understand he's not the best champion in the game by a mile, but he does what he needs to do and does it well.  What primarily makes or breaks him is just access to HP especially at early levels when he's strongest between early and mid game.\n\nNeeds a visual update for sure though.  There are tons of things they could do to make him look more bear like and his armor stand out more.\n\nYou are probably right that they will rework him anyway.

Lee's also got one of the most rabid fan-bases who snarl and screech whenever he's nerfed in any meaningful way so really his buff nerf cycles are much different than Vi's.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-11-25T21:48:35.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMårvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9BM6x4ds,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-11-25T03:10:15.358+0000)\n>\n> Last I recall, Volibear was up there for a Tier 1 VGU.\n\nAs long as they don't let CertainlyT or Riot Jag do the VGU.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-11-25T22:00:46.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"certainlyT is literally the only person to make good VGUs","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-11-25T23:48:29.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9BM6x4ds,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2018-11-25T22:00:46.454+0000)\n>\n> certainlyT is literally the only person to make good VGUs\n\nAkali VGU is good?\n\nlmao.\n\nBest one he did was Warwick.","replies":[{"poster":"AbyssmalHydra","date":"2018-11-26T00:33:50.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Antenora,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9BM6x4ds,comment-id=0003000100000000,timestamp=2018-11-25T23:48:29.781+0000)\n>\n> Akali VGU is good?\n> \n> lmao.\n> \n> Best one he did was Warwick.\n\nand even warwick was busted. for like a full year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-11-26T00:21:54.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes. objectively a good rework","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2018-11-25T15:44:26.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Volibear really needs a rework\n\nThe one that gave him the mini knockback on E is useful and his Q is definitely better, but as long as his W scales on health and his R is an onhit steroid he's going to be this weird midgame statcheck champion that isn't allowed to scale because of the fact he's tanky.\n\nLike he should probably have a different ult and/or W.
