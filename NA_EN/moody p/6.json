Its actually infuriating how poorly Tahm can play into any melee and still efortlessly win any fight, and you are just expected to be cool with that and hope your team wins for you.\r\n\r\nRiot you need to do what you did to Poppy preVGU until he gets a full kit overhaul. This champion should not be considered acceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2019-06-04T21:42:50.826+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Did it ever occur to you that Tahm might actually be a good champion?\n\nMaybe let that probability sink in.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-05T02:12:40.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baron Barian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1YYupxLH,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-06-04T21:42:50.826+0000)\n>\n> Did it ever occur to you that Tahm might actually be a good champion?\n> \n> Maybe let that probability sink in.\n\nHe's very good at winning top lane. He's not too good at winning games. He's far from good as a support. He's incredibly far from good for the health of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2019-06-05T06:52:21.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1YYupxLH,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2019-06-05T02:12:40.534+0000)\n>\n> He's very good at winning top lane.

His early dueling is strong, but his presence in team fights is very weak, so he falls off late game.\n\nHe's basically a frog Darius or Renekton. Strong early 1v1, poor late game potential.,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-06-05T02:06:30.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2019-06-04T20:47:14.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"yes","replies":[]},{"poster":"NY64","date":"2019-06-04T21:52:27.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you considered not fighting him, kind of like how you deal with juggernauts.","replies":[{"poster":"MMMMM SQUIDWARD","date":"2019-06-05T01:15:02.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What a great solution, why don't I just sit in my fountain so he can never touch me?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"koshkyra","date":"2019-06-04T21:03:08.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although its not yasuo/lee sin level, tahm kench has a large playerbase (probably top 25) and is therefore recieving the yasuo treatment (being extremely problematic for years with no changes because popularity.)","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-06-04T21:22:03.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Tahm is worse than both of them","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MMMMM SQUIDWARD","date":"2019-06-05T01:11:56.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can they please nerf that fucking brain dead fucking champ, acutally so disgusting how strong he is","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-06-04T20:46:00.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i would keep his W ability though make his E take 2x the damage instead of a 2nd life bar.
