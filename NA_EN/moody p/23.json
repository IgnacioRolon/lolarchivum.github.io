Ok sure, Darius will obviously win the 1v1 and maybe even smaller skirmishes, but in a 5v5, darius would be blown up, kited, and cc'ed way faster than the tank, considering how high damage is rn. \n> \n> I've gone 6/0 against a Nautilus as Darius once, in team fights, by the time I broke through his shield I was already at 30% hp. and cc'ed.\n\nDarius has a scaling heal, passive armor penetration, a humongous stat steroid, one of the strongest melee slows and synergies with Trinity Force for split pushing and teamfighting all in one, and an ultimate that ignores all defenses and resets on a kill. In other words, tag a couple of people with Q, Eautowauto and he's already roided up and if your ADC's aren't completely braindead they'll help the darius shred through the enemy tank as the ult lands and he can snowball the rest of the fight.\n\nThe only reason he hasn't seen play is because aggressive mobile bruisers (like a good Fiora/Jax/Trynda/Renekton and even a high caliber Riven) that shut him down in lane early have been strong. The moment early burst damage in lane gets nerfed and he can get back to extended trades he runs over the competition.\n\nDarius is one of the biggest counters to Yorick and Irelia and goes even against a lot of other bruisers while completely annihilating tanks and being a better teamfighter than Fiora/Tryndamere/Jax could ever hope to be. Jax also has the distinct drawback of taking forever to get up to speed if he doesn't get fed in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-03-15T04:58:03.927+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick is one of Darius's worst match ups.\n\nDarius is only a lane counter to tanks, which is why he seldom appears as a priority pick in tank metas because he's incredibly easy to lock down and kill or disengage and deny his passive; he actually does best in durable focused bruiser metas such as early season 7 when every fighter was running Courage of the Colossus.
