{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-12-02T17:38:03.448+0000","title":"Skillshots are boring, overdone and they are a direct contributor of power creep","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":19,"body":"First: skillshots are boring. They are a very safe and plain way to design a champion but they have had the effect of making most matchups incredibly reductive to how well your champ can avoid or negate the other&#039;s skill shots. &quot;Move to the left or right&quot; being the main way to outplay most of the roster isn&#039;t interesting. To add, most skillshots have a strong anti-melee effect because they travel directly outwards from the caster; this means that someone in close proximity or who is trying to close the gap will have a much harder time avoiding it than someone who is staying at range. I&#039;ll add to this in the power creep section.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, because skillshots are already variant by nature of being missable, the opportunity to create real strategic value in them is heavily limited; you cannot add &#039;niche&#039; things like very specific debuffs and empowerments because they are skillshots and lack deliberate targeting. Instead, any tack-ons to a skillshot will always be very general so as to not feel &#039;bad&#039; about hitting someone you didn&#039;t want to. Examples include armor/MR shred (universally useful), soft or hard CC (universally useful), vision revealing (universally useful). We are denied a huge portion of potential gameplay because Riot&#039;s philosophy (and player ideals) have shifted to every champion always being useful in most/all situations rather than champions being specialized for specific goals.\r\n\r\nSecond: they&#039;re overdone. Not everyone champion should be designed to have a skillshot. They&#039;re not terribly offensive but the overuse of them leads me to feel like the roster is becoming more homogenous. (Semi-related, I feel the same way about fighters and attack resets; I really fucking want it to stop). There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with all-melee champions or targeted damage. It&#039;s entirely in the way that Riot has implemented them. There&#039;s plenty of ways to lever-tune targeted effects. \r\n\r\nThird: power creep. There&#039;s a sense of deliberation with targeted spells that simply don&#039;t exist with a lot of skillshots in LoL. Choosing who you want to hit vs just throwing your rotation out where it&#039;s most likely to hit someone or where it&#039;ll hit the most people. Because Riot wants skillshots to be more rewarding than targeted spells usually, most skillshots come with multiple effects, as listed before. They&#039;ll be AOE, they&#039;ll be more spammable, and/or come with CC attached, and you can see this trend in a _lot_ of recent designs.. Because of this, and the aforementioned anti-melee bias that comes with straight-line projectiles and the general mayhem of teamfights nowadays, melee champions simply cannot afford to wade through a fight anymore. Thus, they become more mobile to dodge the slew of skillshots, or get packed with more tank spells so that if they DO caught they don&#039;t immediately die to the handful of massive AOEs that weren&#039;t even directed at them, or they themselves get more skillshots - and thus, more range to hit YOU from a distance before they have to put themselves at any meaningful risk. Champions who are mostly melee-focused or short ranged who have to commit to going in and have difficulty getting out have been struggling for years now because of this. This is also why Vi has such a difficult time measuring up to Camille despite being at a respectable power level; Camille can poke before she goes in, she can dodge incoming damage better, _and_ she can easily escape if she needs to. \r\n\r\n I know that most of you have a bizarre hatred for all things targeted and anything that is obviously biased towards stats and numbers more than your &quot;epic outplays,&quot; but I&#039;ve been mulling this over for a while. Skillshots are not innately bad, but they&#039;re certainly too common and I would say their frequency and their sheer power has been a net negative to the game&#039;s integrity.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2018-12-03T02:08:07.600+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know what just screams fun? targeted point and click dmg/cc","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-12-03T02:11:59.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not an argument.

The problem is that targeted abilities are, on the other hand, harder to balance. If you have an ability that has a 100% chance to land and you want to put a nifty effect on it, then you're limited on what \"levers\" you can manipulate to balance it.\n\nTargeted abilities are basically balanced like skillshots that have 100% accuracy or 0% ability to miss. Targeted abilities also don't really do any favors to melee champions either since you can possibly dodge a skillshot while you're on top of an enemy by sidestepping or going behind the place they aim but you can't dodge a point and click at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-12-02T19:24:07.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Historically the opposite is true. Skill shot champions occupy most of Riots hardest to balance champions with the exception of Kalista (who still has skill shots)\n\nThe reworked champions like Sion, Poppy, Taric were problems for reasons separate from being targeted. \n\nTargeted abilities have just as many balance levers as skillshots, if not more. Whether or not Riot ever thinks to use them is a different conversation, but you can look at other MOBA games for clear examples. Dota has very few true skill shots in comparison but they have targeted spells that can fizzle out if you outrun them, only deal damage if you're running away after it's applied, etc. There are many levers, they just aren't immediately obvious to the eyes of a League player.\n\nThere is far more application for unique effects and strategy in targeted spells than skill shots. LOL has forsaken that in favor of generalist, mechanical play, but given that players \"want\" strategy back, they should pay attention. \n\nThe main difference is that targeted spells don't discriminate. This is why they are fairer to melees outside of a vacuum scenario; I cannot do anything about it if im targeted, but that is because they specifically targeted me. On the other hand, I only have the illusion of choice when I'm simply being dogpiled by multiple AOEs from people who didn't even have me in their crosshairs, all for the trouble of being a melee champion.\n\nThe gist of what I'm saying is that a skill shot should be a skillshot for a specific reason and not for the sake of it. Ashe R is a good example of what I mean to be a healthy skill shot. \n\nRiot has at least gotten better about it partially. Zoe and Neeko are shaping up to be some of the healthiest mage designs in the game provided Neeko is balanced correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-03T04:24:23.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VVXP62UE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-12-02T19:24:07.498+0000)\n>\n> Zoe and Neeko are shaping up to be some of the healthiest mage designs in the game provided Neeko is balanced correctly.\n\nZoe was released specifically to be unhealthy, and make people angry.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/96922n/ghostcrawler_is_moving_off_of_league_of_legends/e3yw1p9/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-12-02T19:40:36.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:14}}","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-12-03T00:37:13.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ignite is overrated.
