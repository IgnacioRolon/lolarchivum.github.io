Additional procs within Z seconds boost the healing by Y%.\n\nSomething like this gives Akali clear incentive to go for longer trades to max out her healing, which gives opponents more time to do their own damage or back off and deny her the healing altogether. It would be a nice nod to her old passive, too, which I think is always nice.
