And so writers cater to this demand.\n\nIt sucks, but what can you do?\n\n.....\n\nThis isn't to say Riot never managed to write good stories that make good use of a conviction for something grand and a well-purposed use of strength, I mean we at least have Yorick to show for it (and is it a coincidence that the champ is so unpopular and so low on the priority list he is virtually forgotten from skin releases? Who knows), but many do fall into the really \"meh\" category of just shamelessly catering to edge-lords.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2019-01-25T13:07:35.305+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But magic users are\n\n_Mage_ -stic.","replies":[{"poster":"iron4playa","date":"2019-01-25T14:15:56.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Untitled King,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mc0vU46t,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-01-25T13:07:35.305+0000)\n>\n> But magic users are\n> \n> _Mage_ -stic.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-01-25T13:20:09.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sylas is the Magneto of Runeterra.\n\nThe comparison only work when considering Demacia, as unlike the 616 Earth where mutants are generally feared because of people like Magneto all over the world, there is an entire nation just across the way which would welcome you with open arms as long as you prove your power/worth (Noxus).\n\nWhat we lack is an Xavier to counter him.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-01-25T15:34:11.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaspers,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mc0vU46t,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-01-25T13:20:09.718+0000)\n>\n> Sylas is the Magneto of Runeterra.\n> \n> The comparison only work when considering Demacia, as unlike the 616 Earth where mutants are generally feared because of people like Magneto all over the world, there is an entire nation just across the way which would welcome you with open arms as long as you prove your power/worth (Noxus).\n> \n> What we lack is an Xavier to counter him.\n\nAnd Ryze just returned from one of his Infinity Sto-- I mean, World Runes, gathering.
