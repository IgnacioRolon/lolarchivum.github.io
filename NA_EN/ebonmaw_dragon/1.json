Now i can see why he has the \"Soraka\" influence, combined with \"Chronos\"/\"Saturn\" and \"Death\" \n\nIts very interesting that, when creating champions, the \"team\" that creates the champion looks for different \"possibilities\" (reminds me to the hextech shield woman that was concept for Braun)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-22T07:21:36.772+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our current champion creation process pretty much always includes a bunch of different possible directions for a character.
