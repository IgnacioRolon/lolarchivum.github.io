I have updated my client to the new one. And it was a while ago when it was possible. With old client I used to get many key fragments, not too often but a few a week. And now with new client I get none. NONE :(. I can win games, with my friends, with good score and still nothing. Is there a possibility that my game is bugged?\r\n:&lt;","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T04:57:22.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure the Beta Client has any play in this situation. It's important to remember that your key fragment droprate is a *curve* rather than a line. This means that with each fragment that drops, it exponentially reduces the chances of the next drop. This continues until your droprate resets, which happens approximately 30 days after the first fragment dropped.\n\nI'd say wait a few days, or weeks (if you earned a ton of fragments in a short period of time) until the droprate rests. Continue to play with the Beta client during that time and you should see some fragments soon. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
