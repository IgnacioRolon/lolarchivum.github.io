I even had one of the most recent techs place all my router ports to the specifics of league ports and it doesnt help.\r\nPlease if anyone has any information regarding these issues please comment","replies":[{"poster":"iamacrook","date":"2016-09-13T06:29:03.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS IS A SUDDENLINK issue.

For example, are you receiving any error messages and what does it say?  Crashes in general could be due to a few reasons like outdated drivers, bad game files, or third party programs like play.tv.  High ping would be more of a network sisue having problems maintaining a steady connection.  For this, I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide as your first step.  Let me know if you have any questions and additional information!","replies":[{"poster":"Sàlty King","date":"2016-08-31T00:19:32.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get an \"error message\" or anything like that, the League client randomly closes without giving me any warning/reasoning/error messages. I do mean the client crashes, since it closes the client with me still having to go to task manager to force close or reopen another client to force close the previous client. and this happens at random quite a few times a day at different times during the day.\nAs well as i have have seen the connection issues guide and i tried most if not all and nothing has helped.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"p00nSL4Y3r69420","date":"2016-08-30T17:46:56.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the exact same issue with suddenlink ^ and it is very frustrating.","replies":[]}]}
