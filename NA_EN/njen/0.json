Im leaving league after long time of playing it, i guess i never was that good, but hey, whatever, i only tried to play it for fun/rank. I must admint that on start i was rly toxic, like everyone else, right? After years of playing it, i learnd to calm down and chill out, cuz you know, blaming or flaming anyone for anything, like a bad k/d/a or something, wont make him play better or have better k/d/a, but there is a lot of people who does not understand that, who are still flaming every game. I try eveytime to explain them &quot;hey guys cmon, game is not over, we can still outplay this if we work as a team&quot; and they answer with &quot; no f*ck you, look at this troller Teemo 0/8 , f*ck this game i wont play&quot;. Riot said they will be more rigid about these players, but they are not. Think that they need more workers who overwatch games and ban those guys, cuz i want community to be purged from these guys, i know that there will be a lot of you to say that there will be always toxic players, i know but we should try to get less and less of them. I&#039;ve had great time over years playing this game, but it&#039;s too much now and i just can&#039;t stand it anymore. Want to say thanks to all the guys that i played and had fun with, who were nice in games and rly polite. And for the ones who are toxic, who are flaming, guys pls try to calm down, every game can be won, u just need to outplay it with your brain and most important, as a team. Hope you liked my post, and hope you understand some things and learn even more. Sorry for bad english if there was mistakes, 4ever Vayne addict, signs out. {{champion:67}} {{item:3153}} &lt;3","replies":[]}
