A Garen needs to be concerned with when to engage, how to engage, applying Map pressure, etc. \n\nMicro, Garen's Job is to Run onto people, Q, Spin, Ult.

The skill floor being the minimum skill required to make something function, while skill ceiling being the maximum skill needed to get the most potential from a character.\n\nSkill floor there is no comparison, Akali requires a higher mechanical skill floor than Garen.  \n\nSkill ceiling?  I honestly am not that sure who's higher.  Yes, an Akali needs to move in and out of range constantly.  Yes she has some neat tricks.  But her abilities actually allow to do her job directly.  While in high level play a Garen needs to be on top of everything just to get to the enemy team once you get to Master rank, while Akali was pick/banned for awhile.  You don't get pick/banned if your character is so complicated that people find her hard to play.  You get pick/banned when, once the character is figured out, they have an easier a time fulfilling their function than similar characters.  Which is exactly what Akali's mobility and true invisibility allow her to do.\n\nNow you can argue that Akali's complexity may be higher.  And yeah, that's why she has a high skill floor.  But I'm going to be honest here.  I come from Starcraft and fighting games, I really don't think any character in this game is actually that complex to get the hang of.  You could maybe make a case for someone like Riven's animation cancelling requiring some pretty precise timing, but even that's a pretty pale comparison to the canceling done in competitive Smash Bros or Guilty Gear.\n\nI'm just not convinced her pattern is so complicated it overrides all the clear advantages she gets to perform the necessary actions in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-11-05T06:53:25.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'm just not convinced her pattern is so complicated it overrides all the clear advantages she gets to perform the necessary actions in this game.\n\nAnd that's a perfectly reasonable argument to make.
