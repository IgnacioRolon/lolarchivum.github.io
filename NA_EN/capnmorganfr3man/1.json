The first one (the one which triggered the restriction) involved telling my bot lane I wasn't going to gank their lane because they were behind in lane (the worst I said being 'bot lane bad' and 'I'm not going to gank a losing lane, that's jungling 101.') The second was me asking my teammates and the enemy team to report a thresh top after he aggressively insulted his teammates for accidentally banning his first choice for top lane (I op.ggd his account to make sure he didn't have actual experience with thresh top lane before drawing conclusions,) the most toxic thing I said in this chat probably being 'im not ganking a troll lane.' The third game I will admit I was a griefing with my teammates because I was convinced we couldn't win the game and said so outloud ('our backline is trash'/'I'm glad you guys lost this game'/'you didn't deserve the win,') however they proved me wrong and we came together and won the game (which I did congratulate them for in the lobby following the game.) With the last game I was admittedly a little toxic, however are tactical disagreements and asking others to report a player who is definitively being toxic to others actually reportable offenses? I have my chat record attached if anyone wants to sift through and judge the situation a little more.","replies":[{"poster":"Maratsune","date":"2017-10-30T04:14:35.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Asking for people to report a player is in fact a punishable offense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T04:30:19.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Disagreements are absolutely *not* punishable. However, once those disagreements turn into attacking someone for not taking your advice is where it gets iffy. On top of that, it's never the best idea to hold the threat of reporting someone over their heads or try to push buttons to get others to report someone. Those actions can be viewed pretty negatively and could be reported as well.\n\nIf you need more context on why this punishment was placed, feel free to hit up our player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-10-30T16:14:24.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others already said, you should never ask for Reports. Your own Report is enough to trigger a review, and asking for Reports, especially in /all chat, makes YOU look bad, it appears that YOU are working against your team.\n\nBut for what it's worth, I personally feel it's important to say when you report someone, because even before the first punishment, it's the first round of feedback telling them they are doing something bad. So what I do is I state \"X reported for Y reason\". I don't ask for Reports, I just say I did it myself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-10-30T07:11:56.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's really no reason to tell other players to report someone, the system doesn't take into account how many reports a player gets, one report (your one) is enough to have his chat logs checked :)","replies":[]}]}
