I have been playing for 2 years and have never once had issues until now and there is nothing that should have caused this issue. So my question is are there other people having issues with connection recently? Because i know several fellow players having the same issue","replies":[{"poster":"Gen Martok","date":"2017-01-21T08:40:42.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have run repairs, i have changed many windows settings, adjusted firewall. Ever since last patch I have been laggin constantly, sits at around 200 then spikes as high as 2050ms and it is unplayable. I am not the only one, everygame there is a few laggers and I havent seen any posts from riot explaining what this might be. I know this game has suffered lag but this is ridiculous, a game based on quick precise casting and Im limping through games with auto attackers and just praying. Cmon rito, help us","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-18T19:29:48.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something with your network may have degraded, so the first step is to troubleshoot and rule out any local possibilities that would cause you to have a bad connection to the game server.  Networks can go through wear and tear like most things, so it's important to make sure it's tune up.  I suggest running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to work towards fixing that up!  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
