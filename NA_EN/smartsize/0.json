What Exactly IS Your Stance on DoTs?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":40,"down_votes":4,"body":"\"Brand’s spells come all at once. Like we mentioned earlier, Brand’s all about the combo.\" - Riot Nakyle, from the Dark Horse series.\n\n*Quote edited for accuracy; my response at bottom.* \"Cassiopeia had good AoE damage, but she wasn't the AoE mage. She also had good control, but she wasn't the control mage. She used damage over time, but she wasn't the DoT mage-- Brand, Rumble, Swain, Zyra, Malzahar, and even Mordekaiser compete in many/all of these fields.\" - Riot Stashu, from the thread \"[On the Future of Cassiopeia (Also, Some Background!)](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gFME3v51-on-the-future-of-cassiopeia-also-some-background)\". Thanks to Elphrihaim for the link.\n\n---\n\nThis quote pair DEEPLY concerns me, and this is why: it seems that nobody at Riot knows exactly what a DoT mage is, or at least that they cannot agree on it. The first quote shows Brand's true identity: a combo burst mage, correctly identified. However, Stashu's post, which was posted roughly a month and a half ago (correct me if I'm wrong), says that Brand was instead a DoT-centered mage on the same tier as **Swain and Cassiopeia, and furthermore, that Cassiopeia was not a DoT-centered mage.**\n\nI've played almost entirely DoT or long-fight, \"suicide\" characters since I began playing 3 years ago; characters whose strategy is to do their rotational burst over a period of time or dive in the middle of a fight to disable the enemies before dying themselves; characters like Swain, Fiddlesticks, Morgana, Lissandra, Anivia, and before the rework, Cassiopeia. I love being able to disable enemies or do large amounts of damage drug out over a long period, and it's the only playstyle I've really ever been able to play consistently.\n\nRiot Stashu's initial post on what exactly makes a DoT mage a DoT mage was worrying enough; classifying Mordekaiser, who is known for his insta-lane pushing death wave, and Zyra, known for her great disables and high supporting burst damage, on the same level as Swain and old Cassiopeia, the League's 2 premier \"Crippler\" Champions, was more than a little disturbing. But this new post shows an even more awkward trend, in that the members of Riot's team don't exactly agree on what exactly a DoT is. What's even worse than THAT is that somebody on the Champion Reworks team believes that Zyra and Mordekaiser **(A champ who, bye the way, is coming up for a rework himself)** are on this same tier.\n\nI'm confused. This isn't a hate thread on Riot Stashu. In fact, I really do think that he has his best interests in mind with every Cassio change he makes, whether or not it turns out well, and that he will keep trying until we can reach a compromise on how Cassiopeia plays. This isn't a Cassiopeia thread either, as there are already plenty that describe perfectly our feelings about this passive that NEEDS to go.\n\n**I am legitimately confused as to how Riot trains their employees to look at DoTs as a damage source.** The fact that somebody who works so closely with a team designated to redesigning champions, AND who has worked so diligently on a champion whose ENTIRE POINT was DoT damage for the last 4 months, does not know how to correctly identify a DoT pattern from a Burst Damage pattern, is worrying.\n\nIs Riot training employees at all as to what they think a DoT pattern is? If so, what is that pattern? If not, why not, and why don't you think it's important to have all of your balance employees working under the same set of assumptions? In short, **What is Riot's stance on DoTs, and what are they doing to address it?**\n\n**Edit:** In response to my misquote, the quote has been updated to accurately reflect what Stashu actually said. Here is my response, full credit to Ephrihaim for finding this. I was only looking on the Boards, not old GD:\n\n\"Your ideas for her as a champion may well suit her better, but I also fear that they would be stepping on Brand's toes. **In the future, im sure we'll do more work at differentiating dot based champions in our game (malz, morde, brand, cassi, etc)** and id definitely like for one of them to more closely hit on your ideas here.\" - Riot Stashu, from [Let's Talk Cassiopeia.](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=49853850#post49853850)\n\nI think this post speaks for itself. I don't have a problem with hearing things like these as long as you can explain your thinking behind it, which you did, although I'd still like to know how Riot as a company treats these things. Is it at all, or is it mostly up to employee discretion on how to handle these things?\n\nAlso, please do not attack Stashu in this thread. It's not the point and it's unfair to him. I want more Rioters to respond; I want to know how Riot handles this as a whole. I don't want to scare them all off.","replies":[{"poster":"Fed by Snu Snu","date":"2014-11-29T09:21:47.498+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/j8jqH.jpg\n\nI'll just leave this here.","replies":[{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2014-11-29T22:58:01.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get a link or a source?","replies":[{"poster":"Fed by Snu Snu","date":"2014-11-29T23:13:20.623+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been quite a while since I found it and kept the image bookmarked, I'll try to find the source again.\n\nEdit 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/zeo0z/what_one_riot_games_employee_thinks_of_the_company/\n\nI'll keep looking cause \"leddit\".

Brand is defined by many things, including his combo system, not just by his dots, and in that sense he is not an archetypal 'DoT Mage.'\n\n**That's strictly a misquote.** Please don't do that. Here is the original quote directly from the post you linked:\n\n*Hence, our planned changes primarily revolved around identifying and clarifying her identity. Our results: Cassiopeia had good AoE damage, but she wasn't the AoE mage. She also had good control, but she wasn't the control mage. She used damage over time, but she wasn't the DoT mage-- Brand, Rumble, Swain, Zyra, Malzahar, and even Mordekaiser compete in many/all of these fields. However, it was quite clear that compared to other mages, Cassiopeia stood nearly alone when it came to consistent DPS output.*\n\nMy claim here is that Cassiopeia, Rumble, Swain, Zyra, Brand, and many other mages in league of legends have powerful DoTs, zone control, and AoE damage on their kits all at the same time, not that Brand is the premiere DoT mage. More specifically, in context, my point was \"Mage that has good zone control, AoE damage, and DoTs is not a unique and interesting identity, because so many people already do that.\"\n\n-----\n\nI really just wanted to clear that up, but I'll take a stab at answering your question. \n\nAt a base level, damage can be applied all at one (burst) or over time (DoT). Zyra's plants raise an interesting question, do they periodically deal burst damage, or do DoT? I would argue strongly for the case that they are DoT spells, as the loose description of 'periodically bursting' could apply just as well to a traditional DoT spell, and also that the description references any span of time ('periodically,') it is by definition a DoT. Similarly, Mordekaiser's W (\"Creeping Death\") deals DoT damage, as does Malzhar's W (\"Null Zone\").\n\nSo, that's what a DoT spell is, strictly, and that's how I use the term. However, I think there is a more colloquial definition of a DoT which makes classifying \"Creeping Death\" as such feel a bit weird. I think it goes something like this, \n\n\"A DoT is a spell that, once it hits, will unavoidably do periodic damage to the target.\" \n\nThe poster children for this type of DoT are spells like Malzahar's E (\"Malefic Visions\") and Swain's E (\"Torment\"). This is why \"Miasma\" feels more like a dot than \"Null Zone\" despite the spells being extremely similar, because you can just step out of \"Null Zone\" to stop taking DoT damage, but once \"Miasma\" hits you, even if you step out you are still DoT'd. \n\nThis is not to say that most people won't define Rumble's Ultimate as a DoT, but really just that some spells feel more DoT-like than others, even when all of them technically do damage over time. Again, I use the stricter definition of DoT when talking about DoTs, but I can understand why \"Miasma\" feels more DoT-y than \"Null Zone,\"  though ultimately they are both DoTs.\n\nI'm not sure if that answers your question, but that's how I think of DoT spells.","replies":[{"poster":"exe3","date":"2014-11-29T22:47:10.805+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"> More specifically, in context, my point was \"Mage that has good zone control, AoE damage, and DoTs is not a unique and interesting identity, because so many people already do that.\"\n\nThe problem I have with this and the original quote is that if so many champs do DoTs to make Cass's DoTs not a unique identity, maybe those other champions should have been changed instead because unlike Cassiopeia whose DoTs were strongly tied to her thematics (poisons don't kill you instantly) these other champions don't have strong thematic ties to their DoTs. I mean why exactly does Swain have DoTs (his ult kind of makes sense but that Q seems like DoT for the sake of DoT)?

Cassiopeia was a mage with **good zone control AoE damage that IS DoT**! And most other DoT's you've described, Cassiopeia's DoT is the most pure of all. It sticks onto you even if they leave the zone. It's pure DoT and not attached to any immediate burst damage.\n\n\nI hate being a self-plugger, but, [**THIS is what your rework is doing to her.**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/E1kLKJaz-stashu-have-you-ever-considered-making-cassiopeia-not-revolve-around-twin-fangs-e)\n------------------------\nBy going all out on her E, you literally took away everything that made her enjoyable.

(dot and burst)\n\nIf this were the case then what would adc's dmg type be? burst? or dot? Sure a draven crit can feel like a burst spell, but when he can crit you 3 times in 2 seconds, isn't that stepping into dot realm? But the amout of dmg is so high that it can't in good conscience be called a dot.\n\nRather, I argue that there are 3 dmg types: dot, burst, and dps. Burst is a one time instance of instant dmg, generall a nuke. Even if you fire 3 nukes, in 2 secons, it's still considered burst. dps is what all adc's do, they generate consistent damage over time. The damage dealt is too high to be considered a dot in the true sense, but too consistent and often too low to be considered burst. True dot dmg is where you take the raw dmg of a burst spell and apply it in tiny increments over a long duration. This can take the form of aoe spells or single target fire and forget spells. But the main aspect of dot spells is that they deal dmg 1 sec, .5 sec or .25 sec intervals. And it is these very short intervals that give dots that dot feel. DoT players play dot champs because we love that sensation of melting enemies due to having 2 or 3 spells that deal dmg in .5 or .25 intervals going on simultaneously causing the appearance of the enemy's health bar to quickly shrink rather than being chunked down in bite sized pieces.\n\nThis is why Zyra's plants are not dot dmg. Her plants to sustain dmg yes, but not dot dmg. They fire off at consistent intervals doing chunk dmg for each hit, this classifies it as dps. Likewise, swain's ult is dps, not dot. His ult has travel time and chunks the enemy rather than doing quick dmg in tiny intervals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waffl3x","date":"2014-11-30T03:11:02.387+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zyra's plants do neither DoT or periodical burst damage, they do sustained damage. DoT's by principle are things like sunfire where the longer you are in the fight the more you contribute. Also, before someone who thinks they can be \"smart\" comes at me and says DoT's are sustained damage, they can be, but they also can not be. Malefic Visions is not sustained and despite being a dot, I would classify it as a burst, the thing with Malzhar is that he does such heavy DoT in a short time, it is in my mind classified as burst. Obviously this is also based on his cool downs. Brand is not a dot hero at all, he has a passive that does very small amounts of damage and does not benefit from being in the fight longer.

So here it is again cleaned up and shortened.\n\nDamage Over Time and Damage Per Second are fundamentally not the same thing. Damage Per Second is a champion metric and can incorporate multiple casts of the same spell/multiple autoattacks as well as survivability. It is about output over a fight. Damage Over Time, along with Burst, are Damage types, how Damage from a single spell or autoattack is delivered. Burst-type damage has a single proc of damage. Damage Over Time has multiple procs of damage. I hit Swain E, I will do x damage every y seconds over a certain period of time t. I use Caitlyn autoattack, I do z damage once. That's it. X is generally smaller than Z, but that is because the total damage of Swain E is x/y*t. The total damage of a Caitlyn autoattack is just Z. Both Swain and Caitlyn can have high Damage Per Second based on how much cooldown reduction/attack speed they have, but that has nothing to do with the nature of damage of their spells. Not all autoattacks are Burst, the total damage of a single Darius autoattack does not occur all at once. Azir and Zyra are both High Damage Per Second champions, but they are not Damage Over Time. Zyra's plant attacks and Azir's soldiers' attacks deal damage the same way as autoattacks do. One attack from a Zyra plant will do x damage all at once in a single proc. Multiple attacks will do more damage but each attack still deals all of its damage all at once. In reality, Damage Over Time and Burst have nothing to do in principle with the amount of damage dealt, but how quickly the single spell or attack deals the damage. All of Leblanc's spells could deal their damage over 4 seconds. She would then be Damage over Time. A lot of damage, to be sure, but still damage over time.\n\nYes, Morde W, Sunfire Cape, Malz pool, Morg pool, Rumble ult are all damage over time. But the fact that their Damage is more conditional is just an extension of the skill needed to force someone to stand in a certain area and is not indicative of a different damage type. Malz pool is technically a skill shot. It isn't hard to hit; the real skill is forcing someone to stand in it for the full duration. A single cast of Malz pool will still only do x damage every y seconds and there is nothing Malz can do to speed up how fast the damage ticks off. Morg pool is fundamentally different from Xerath W, even though both are circular skillshots. One delivers a smaller amount of damage at a rate over time; the other deals all of its damage at once. Both Xerath and Morg can improve their Damage Per Second with cooldown reduction, but this doesn't have anything to do with how fast damage from a single spell is applied.\n\nThe difference is vital to understanding what Cass players want. Having high Damage Per Second is a fine thing to focus on for a champion. But you are creating that DPS by changing the type of damage she mostly does. This is not what Cass players want. Cass certainly needs DPS, she needs to be able to survive a fight and continuously cast spells and do damage. But the way those spells do damage matters to us. The damage from a single spell needs to be spread out over time for her 'poison' feel to mean anything.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you would explain your thinking if you don't follow what I'm trying to say here, since I think it is important that we are all on the same page for you to produce a rework that is satisfactory to her playerbase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DayVGaming","date":"2014-11-30T08:26:41.862+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> \n> **That's strictly a misquote.** Please don't do that.

Brand can at least trigger every spell of his on Blaze. Cassiopeia is left with minion-level-of-damage poisons in half her kit that only trigger a single spell of hers. This is the problem with her kit. You wanted to make her unique, but you only made her a very, very bad and very very dependent combo mage that is outclassed in every respect because she no longer has raw potential outside of her debilitating passive and a single spell in her kit, which, again, hoses her in every game mode that isn't Summoner's Rift.","replies":[{"poster":"PatMcGroyn","date":"2014-12-14T18:04:03.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yw4eegOF,comment-id=0009000c,timestamp=2014-11-30T20:53:14.030+0000)\n> Brand, as you pointed out, is a combo mage; His spells apply an insignificant effect from his passive that allows his other spells to trigger bonus effects.\n\nBrand's Passive is nowhere NEAR \"insignificant.\"  8% of enemy's max health from just 1 spell is insane, it makes his lane trades & seiging so potent.

Again, I use the stricter definition of DoT when talking about DoTs, but I can understand why \"Miasma\" feels more DoT-y than \"Null Zone,\"  though ultimately they are both DoTs.\n> \n> I'm not sure if that answers your question, but that's how I think of DoT spells.\n\nFrom what you said, Zyra's plants are not dots since you can avoid the damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-11-29T21:32:22.042+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":18,"body":"It's not a misquote when that's exactly what you meant.

Magic Damage.\n\nIt's not a very visceral poison, but the reason why it's easier to appreciate is because **Singed is a tank.**\n\nWhich doesn't make **any sense** right\n\nBut it's because a tank is expected to deal constant, but low, damage. Singed's poison covers that. Thus, he doesn't perform basic attacks, thus his AA can afford to be a bit weaker (iirc he has low ad/level) since he never really relies on them. Because Singed is so tanky, he isn't expected to deal tons of damage, thus his low-damage poison remains appreciated and understood (Tank does damage to you... but kinda slowly).\n\nCassiopeia, on the other hand, has a powerful poison that marks on YOU instead of on the ground. Noxious Blast is this green ring that looks very poisonous.\n\nIt did 240 (+80% AP) Magic Damage over 3 seconds.\n\nBut you didn't get to as easily feel that it did that much damage, because it was high damage over time. So it can feel like a permanent-ignite effect.\n\nIt was kinda OP seeing as it had a 3 second cooldown. But it was definitely a really nice spell because it had appreciable damage (unlike now!) and because it was nice alone, even if you knew that playing out of E range wasn't ideal for your damage it was much better for your safety.\n\n---\n\nimho people that think that DoTs aren't appreciable and/or low in satisfaction are idiots because killing somebody that you can't see is the damn best feeling.\n\nIt's why, in Aeon of Storms, there's a guy that has something vaguely like Kog's ult... It has about twice the blast radius, deals quite a bit more damage, but has a much higher cooldown and three charges. (It also reduces enemy MR)\n\nBecause DAMN IT'S FUN NUKING THINGS YOU CAN'T SEE AND KILLING THEM. But it SUCKS if you miss. That's why it has three charges and shreds MR; the former so that it has both utility and finish potential, the latter because it makes it a strong move... when combined with allies that deal magic damage.\n\nIt makes you FEEL GOOD about yourself. It makes you able to contribute a lot.\n\nNoxious Blast is the same way, just to a lesser extent. Miasma does too. They both had damage and utility and the mix made it fun.\n\nSinged's Poison Trail is fun too.\n\nTeemo is not fun unless you are Teemo and it is never fun to fight a Teemo... but not really because he has damage over time. It's because the DoT is appended to his AA (Shrooms don't count as a DoT because they are usually encountered while **not** fighting, thus taking damage over 4 seconds is about the same as being hit by a random skillshot; 'I took damage').\n\nAnivia is fun because her DoT combines with her kit very nicely, creating a very powerful zone mage.\n\nBrand's DoT gives him better poke/siege. It's not really part of his kit (since we're looking at the DoT aspect).\n\nUdyr's DoT is over 2 seconds.\n\nAlistar's DoT is strong and punishes enemies for being near Alistar which allows Alistar to protect his team by being near them. I personally like this one from a gameplay pov and Alistar plays a lot like a defender so it works.\n\nTalon's DoT is great because it makes him feel even more badass and assassin-like, even though it lasts for 6 seconds.\n\n-\nI can't say for the rest of the DoTs because I've never seen them significantly enough in a game / don't recall them well enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Smartsize","date":"2014-11-29T09:20:20.054+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's my point though; I would easily argue that all of the characters you named except Anivia and Singed ARE NOT DoT characters.

Teemo's DoT doesn't have the feel, especially his ult. Brand's DoT supplements something his kit lacks as well as making a clear way for his opponents to know some of what's up. Udyr's DoT barely counts as a DoT. \n\nTalon's DoT feels really nice so while it isn't core to him it's really nice if you know that it will kill somebody to hit them with it and then laugh away as they fall dead. There are plenty of ways to accomplish a similar goal and a DoT is the simplest and imo cleanest. See: Killing things you can't see is damn fun.\n\nThe hero I was talking about (Rancor with the three nukes) has the clear optimization for it-- You want to use a nuke and then have your magic damage dealers fight and weave in the nukes with your team's magic damage.\n\nBut it's way more fun to blindly nuke a spot after an enemy runs away and they just die. You **know** you're not using it optimally, but it's just so fun you don't care, and I think that that's what made Cassiopeia both balanced and enjoyable.\n\n#[Gidor](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/yw4eegOF-riot-so-what-exactly-is-your-stance-on-dots?comment=000200000000)\n> Your choice of words was bad.\n\nWhose? The OP's? I don't think so... \n\n> On a serious note Riot doesnt seem to like DoT based champions. I believe they gave a reason that is something like its unsatisfying because you dont get to immediately see how much damage you're doing. \n\nWell, anybody that thinks that (a DoT is unsatisfying because you don't get immediate damage) is welcome to that opinion. Just as I, as well as numerous others (probably over half of Cassiopeia's old playerbase), are welcome to the belief that DoT is more satisfying because you get to see the enemy healthbar trickle down despite their best efforts.\n\n> Honestly i would not consider Cassiopeia to be a \"DoT champion\" even though she has 2 DoT spells. Its important to make a distinction between DoTs and just sustained damage. Cassiopeia used her DoTs for poke and for wave clear, but in truth her primary source of dps has always been her E. Shes more of a hybrid champion whos main damage source is her E while also having a fallback pattern of poking with DoTs. \n\nBut the point is that the people want to not have to push E because they always felt that it was, though the optimal button to be pushing, a very boring and unsafe one. Thus they wouldn't want to have to get in range to use it-- because it wasn't very safe to use.\n\n#[Rockman](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/yw4eegOF-riot-so-what-exactly-is-your-stance-on-dots?comment=00010001)\n> @Eli\n> \n> Singed has low base AD because of towers.

In fact you can even count his Voidlings as DoT... their damage is done per basic attack, seen a different way it could be damage per tick/second, or DoT :D.  \n\nSwain is another good example with his Q,E, and R, specially since he relies on his Q for cc, E for extra damage, and his R for lifesteal and damage.  \n\nCass is a DoT mage... not a very strong one but still... her E is similar to Brands set-up and her Ult is just a straight up attack. \n\nFiddles is somewhat a DoT mage, but i personally think he relies more on his CC ability rather then his DoT.  \n\nMorde is not a DoT mage, he has a DoT ability but its more for just extra damage during his burst, not so much reliant on it. The same applies for Morgana, Anivia, Brand, Darius, and Talon.
