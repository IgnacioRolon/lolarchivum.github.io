Unable to load at 33% and always says \"Unspecific error\" ???","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why my Patcher doesn't load anymore. I mean it loaded to 33% and scanned about 217 files then it stopped and said \"Unspecific error occurred. Please check the logs for more information.\". The last time this occurred was 2 days ago , i've tried the method that is to delete the solutions files in the  RADS . But now i'm encountering the same problem, and i used the same method but it did not work. I've tried to delete the game and install it and do the same method but it did not work out ! Can someone really help me out ? \r\nP.S : I'm not a very good at speaking English so apologize for my bad English.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T00:59:22.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Errors at this point in patching are an indication that your connection is unable to our patching servers.

I was able to patch 7.4 just fine before I had to uninstall the game.  However, my patcher isn't even reaching 33%. I've tried using the Hextech Repair tool and following everything in this guide from Wukz: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/qGY56UB4-comprehensive-troubleshooting-your-patching-issues\n\nRepairing doesn't really do anything. Before I get anywhere near 33%, it says \"Update failed. An unspecified error has occurred.\" This is pretty frustrating because I was able to patch just fine a few days ago. I've also been researching this problem and I've tried every single method I've found so far.\n\nEvery once in a while, it'll give me the launch button after patching for a while. When I press it, the client crashes and says I'm missing some .dll files like bugsplat.dll.\n\nI'm on Windows 10. If you do end up seeing this and need any more info, please let me know!

The game works now so thanks for the helps Rioter.
