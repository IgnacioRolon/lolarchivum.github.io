This is the request in it's entirety:\r\n\r\n> Hey, how's it going?\r\n> \r\n> I seem to be missing some skins from my account. It's been a few months since I played, but I recall playing Project Leona fairly clearly, but it's gone. Iron Solari Leona also appears to have disappeared.\r\n> \r\n> Could be that I have a Leona sized hole in my head, but Star Guardian Lux seems to have found her way into a black hole, whereas Star Guardian Janna continues to clear the skies.\r\n> \r\n> I also vaguely recall having more than 4 bucks in riot points -- but that is where it's at.\r\n> \r\n> Please forgive me -- many of the more desirable skins (such as Elementalist Lux or DJ Sona) are still there, but I swear I remember leading a cybernetically enhanced knight directly into the enemy -- often to the chagrin of my allies.\r\n\r\nI did get a response later that day, specifically:\r\n\r\n> Hey Tintelpe,\r\n> \r\n> I did some investigating on your account and it looks like your account showed signs of unauthorized activity. Rather than risk your credentials from being compromised, I went ahead and placed a protective suspension on the account to prevent any changes from occurring. The good news is that we can take you through the account recovery process!\r\n> \r\n> For security reasons, though, we won't be able proceed while you are logged into a League of Legends account on our Support Site.\r\n> \r\n> In this case, if I could have you provide me with a different email (one that is not associated with a League account), that'd be awesome! Once you do this, I'll be able to create a new ticket for you using this other email where you can reply and, hopefully, proceed with recovering your account! :3\r\n> \r\n> Thank you!\r\n\r\nMy account then got banned!  I changed my password and checked my account, and it seems fine from outside the game.  (I'd check it inside the game, but it got banned!)\r\n\r\nThats sort of bad, but what's really confusing is this:\r\n\r\n> In this case, if I could have you provide me with a different email (one that is not associated with a League account), that'd be awesome!\r\n\r\nI mean, sure, but why?  Either support is actually talking to me, or I'm a m4d h4ck3r and I can give them whatever email I want.  It seems to be not a very useful security check.\r\n\r\nThe worst, though, is then the ticket was marked \"solved\"!  My problem with missing skins was solved by banning my account!\r\n\r\nThe entire experience has been super un-fun.  I responded to the closed issue, but I don't really get any of this.\r\n\r\nHelp please!  Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T21:41:47.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh gosh, yea I can understand where that could have left a bad taste in your mouth, but I should be able to clear things up a bit. \n\nI know that asking for a different email might not seem like the smartest thing at first, but we do so for one very specific reason. Sometimes when accounts are hacked, they ended up being hacked in the first place because they had access to your signup email. By asking for a different email, it helps us make sure that we're dealing with the original account creator. \n\nNow I also went ahead and looked over your account history to see what might have happened there, and I did see some evidence that your account could still currently be compromised. We placed that suspension to help ensure that no further harm comes to your account, and as long as you work with them in your tickets you'll be back on the Rift in no time!","replies":[]}]}
