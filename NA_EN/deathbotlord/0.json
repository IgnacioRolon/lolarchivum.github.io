It may take a while, but I feel simply letting it run unless you run into any errors is the best choice at this point.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"nººb","date":"2016-11-17T03:41:46.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seriously ? it will take how long for it to download at this speed ...... any ideas on what the issue is or how i could make my download speed faster ? its never this bad for any patches why for the beta update","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBotLord","date":"2016-11-17T03:47:43.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ay calm down. There's always tomorrow. The issue with this is it could be so many things that it's hard to troubleshoot. Just try the stuff you find online and if nothing works than just wait it out i guess.

Just find it strange that it's doing this. Not that great of a computer guy but could it be server load on your end? Maybe a bunch of people requesting the download at the same time. Only explanation i can think of for my bouncing download speeds. It's like I'm getting bumped from being prioritized to being at the bottom of the waiting list. Regardless I'll just wait it out.","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2016-11-17T03:48:30.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeathBotLord,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=6Vs44lrV,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-11-17T03:46:09.844+0000)\n>\n> Hey thanks for the reply.

Regardless I&#x27;ll just wait it out.\n\nA bunch of other threads were made a couple hours ago for this.  Try running the client as admin (apparently it might work better if you run the .adim application file manually, too).  You can also try disabling Windows Defender or Norton.  It might also work if you just try restarting your computer first.\n\nI let mine just run as it was (30-100KBps for like 90 minutes..........).  It finished almost immediately after it hit ~30%.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBotLord","date":"2016-11-17T03:51:36.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I tried all that stuff and it's the same.
