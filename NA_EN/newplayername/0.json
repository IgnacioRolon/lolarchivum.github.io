This would decrease the randomness that is inherent in it, but still force you to be more flexible than normals.\nNeed to own 5 or 6 champions for each role at a minimum to play ranked. 30 or 36 champion minimum (5 assassins, 5 fighters...etc)\nNo more weekly free champion rotation. (Looking at you, Ivern.)\n\n(Also, I wouldn&#039;t mind the ability to sell champions back to the store, so you have a specific roster that you can adjust, if you want.)","replies":[{"poster":"Lemme c da money","date":"2018-08-22T20:37:19.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM exists just for screwing around. Too much depends on random assignment, anyways, it wouldn't really make sense as a ranked game, as it wouldn't really represent skill. Maybe it could work; I don't think they should do it. People already take the game too seriously.\n\nEDIT: interesting idea though","replies":[{"poster":"newplayername","date":"2018-08-22T20:43:51.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I definitely agree that ARAM is a more laid back form of the game, and i'm in the majority, i'm sure, that only plays arams. Also, to combat the randomness, Riot could try to give balanced team comps by assigning each champ in the game a value based on the win rate, and make both teams' additive values similar. It would still appear random to players, but would reduce the huge swing-y games that arrive because one team has a massive champion advantage.\n\nEdit: May I ask how this would make people take it more seriously? There would still be normal ARAM, where people who want to just mess around, can still go. But the people who take arams super seriously would have a place to go, ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-22T21:03:27.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do not want.\n\nARAM is basically random, it would be pointless and just a giant pit of toxicity.
