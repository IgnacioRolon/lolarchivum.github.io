These are the ones i know of the top of my head that causes the fps drop for me.\r\nAlthough I'm on an old computer (Mac 2008) it still runs the game fine. There are other people dealing with this problem too. Again my computer is not really the problem because it was running the game fine until this patch. Don't believe me?\r\n\r\nWatch this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8KUpKVYC3Y\r\n\r\nThis is another forum post of the exact problem I'm dealing with:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/2ZxvU0R8-fps-drops-and-weird-pixely-vfx-since-716\r\n\r\nWith this patch and the performance update, this make the game nearly unplayable.\r\n\r\nEdit: I had gotten this thing fixed in patch 7.16 by doing a software update but this crap came back unexpectedly a couple of days after 7.17\r\n\r\nThis is from patch 7.16 and it explains about improving game performance in team fights\r\n\r\n\"We've made a bunch of performance optimizations! You should experience better frame rates across the game, particularly during teamfights and around giant herds of minions. More improvements to come over the next few patches!\"\r\n\r\nI honestly think this is why others people are dealing with the same thing.\r\n\r\nIve made a support ticket about this and I've done everything ranging from using hex tech repair tool to changing my system settings.\r\n\r\nAny solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T20:46:39.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry you've been dealing with this for so long.  :(  If you have a ticket number, I can check on the status of it for you!
