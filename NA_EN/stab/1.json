These are the ones i know of the top of my head that causes the fps drop for me.\r\nAlthough I'm on an old computer (Mac 2008) it still runs the game fine. There are other people dealing with this problem too. Again my computer is not really the problem because it was running the game fine until this patch. Don't believe me?\r\n\r\nWatch this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Bjp8hMPUDw\r\n\r\nThe pixel VFX crap is whats making my fps drop no matter how low my settings are.\r\n\r\nThis is another forum post of the exact problem I'm dealing with:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/2ZxvU0R8-fps-drops-and-weird-pixely-vfx-since-716\r\n\r\nWith this patch and the performance update, this make the game nearly unplayable.\r\n\r\nEdit: I had gotten this thing fixed in patch 7.16 by doing a software update but this crap came back unexpectedly a couple of days after 7.17\r\n\r\nThis is from patch 7.16 and it explains about improving game performance in team fights\r\n\r\n\"We've made a bunch of performance optimizations! You should experience better frame rates across the game, particularly during teamfights and around giant herds of minions. More improvements to come over the next few patches!\"\r\n\r\nI honestly think this is why others people are dealing with the same thing.\r\n\r\nIve made a support ticket about this and I've done everything ranging from using hex tech repair tool to changing my system settings.\r\n\r\nAny solutions?\r\n\r\nEDIT: WTF IT HAS BEEN A WEEK AND THERE IS STILL NO HOT FIX FOR THIS FREAKING BUG. MY MAC CAN RUN THIS GAME WELL AND IT HAS THE MINIMUM SPECS. DO A FREAKING HOT FIX FOR CHRIST SAKE. I FREAKING MADE A TICKET AND THEY SAID \"There is a game bug going around that are affecting both Macs and PCs with older specs, and it needs to be patched from our end\". IM NOT HAVING THIS PROBLEM ON THE PBE BUT FOR SOME REASON IM HAVING IT ON THE LIVE SERVER. IF IT IS GOING TO TAKE ME SPAMMING THIS CRAP ON THE FOURMS SO I CAN GET THE ATTENTION FROM RIOT PATCH TEAM THEN FINE. FREAKING FIX THIS SHIT. DONE GIVE ME THAT BS OF MY COMPUTER CANT HANDLE THE GAME BECAUSE IM NOT HAVING THIS PROBLEM ON THE PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-07T16:10:24.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any bugs, but we're not part of the QA team.
