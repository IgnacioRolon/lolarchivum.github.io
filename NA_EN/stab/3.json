These are the ones i know of the top of my head that causes the fps drop for me.\r\nAlthough I'm on an old computer (Mac 2008) it still runs the game fine. There are other people dealing with this problem too. Again my computer is not really the problem because it was running the game fine until this patch. Don't believe me?\r\n\r\nNote: I had the thing fixed by doing a software update in patch 7.16. Now fast forward to patch 7.17, Days after this patch, That bug came back and i can't freaking fix it.\r\n\r\nWatch this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Bjp8hMPUDw\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pixel VFX crap is whats making my fps drop no matter how low my settings are.\r\n\r\nThis is another forum post of the exact problem I'm dealing with:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/2ZxvU0R8-fps-drops-and-weird-pixely-vfx-since-716\r\n\r\nWith this patch and the performance update, this make the game nearly unplayable.\r\n\r\nEdit: I had gotten this thing fixed in patch 7.16 by doing a software update but this crap came back unexpectedly a couple of days after 7.17\r\n\r\nThis is from patch 7.16 and it explains about improving game performance in team fights\r\n\r\n\"We've made a bunch of performance optimizations! You should experience better frame rates across the game, particularly during teamfights and around giant herds of minions. More improvements to come over the next few patches!\"\r\n\r\nI honestly think this is why others people are dealing with the same thing.\r\n\r\nIve made a support ticket about this and I've done everything ranging from using hex tech repair tool to changing my system settings.\r\n\r\nAny solutions?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I DID A SOFTWARE UPDATE TO FIX IT ON PATCH 7.16 AND DAYS LATER PATCH 7.17 CAME AND THE CRAP CAME BACK . WTF IT HAS BEEN A WEEK AND THERE IS STILL NO HOT FIX FOR THIS FREAKING BUG. MY MAC CAN RUN THIS GAME WELL AND IT HAS THE MINIMUM SPECS. DO A FREAKING HOT FIX FOR CHRIST SAKE. I FREAKING MADE A TICKET AND THEY SAID \"There is a game bug going around that are affecting both Macs and PCs with older specs, and it needs to be patched from our end\". IM NOT HAVING THIS PROBLEM ON THE PBE BUT FOR SOME REASON IM HAVING IT ON THE LIVE SERVER. IF IT IS GOING TO TAKE ME SPAMMING THIS CRAP ON THE FOURMS SO I CAN GET THE ATTENTION FROM RIOT PATCH TEAM THEN FINE. FREAKING FIX THIS CRAP DON'T GIVE ME THAT BS OF MY COMPUTER CANT HANDLE THE GAME BECAUSE IM NOT HAVING THIS PROBLEM ON THE PBE.\r\n\r\nAnother Update:\r\n\r\nif you think I'm the only one who is dealing with this shit then think again\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/t12bEJOH-gameplay-pixel-vfx-drops-frame-rate-2008-mac-read-whole-thing-please\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/OBBq53ZV-gameplay-pixel-vfx-drops-frame-rate-2008-mac-read-whole-thing-please-help-me-please\r\n\r\nThere are people who are dealing with the exact same thing and because of this bug making this game unplayable, my rank is decaying....","replies":[{"poster":"Stab","date":"2017-09-22T04:21:23.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And it not being widespread? Most mac players have updated mac computer like Mac 2013 and up. Not many people play this game with older macs. This right now is the only computer i have and I've been playing this game for almost 4 and it has been running very smoothly for me.

This specific kind of issue doesn't seem to be widespread unless people just aren't coming to us with it. \n\nFrom the way you describe it, you've been able to perform software updates on your Mac to get things running smoothly again. Most of the time these fps issues are caused by other programs eating up resources in the background or possibly just a lack of driver updates (which is sounds like the issue you've had over and over). \n\nDo the system updates you've done in the past that fixed this issue, and also run through the steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684#section-mac) to make sure your Mac is running at it's best.","replies":[{"poster":"µwμ","date":"2017-12-03T21:28:34.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It´s not only him.
