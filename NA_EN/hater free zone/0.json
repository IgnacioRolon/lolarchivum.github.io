I just came to vent that and I really hope that Riot won&#039;t allow verbal harassment like this to pass. \r\n\r\nI genuinely believe calling people a &#039;retard&#039; is a particular kind of hate speech and I just hope action is taken.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-31T04:56:48.857+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That kind of behavior is definitely punishable (though probably not treated the same as racial/homophobic slurs etc.) so just make sure you report it. As for telling them you work with disabled people, that's just making you a target and letting them know what kind of ammo to use; simply mute them instead.","replies":[{"poster":"hater free zone","date":"2017-03-31T05:06:20.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't tell them my work, but I just let them know that I take offense to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-31T18:40:03.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are calling you a retard specifically to offend you, and you just confirmed that's an effective strategy.
