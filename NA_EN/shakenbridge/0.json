I click on the Facebook button and I get no pop-ups, no re-directs...nothing. There is no option for me to connect my Facebook account anywhere and I don't know if it already is or not.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to find any help articles on this and any thread I see posted are from roughly two years and a few client updates ago.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.
