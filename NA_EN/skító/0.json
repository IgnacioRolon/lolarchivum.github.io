Even if your team pulled through without you, you being out of the match for so long could have ended up making them lose since they were trying to 4v5.","replies":[{"poster":"Skító","date":"2017-10-23T07:52:51.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No , this is a bug , I dont want this to happend this way , i was afk 7 minutes max in early game because of lol errors this is a massive bug , dont tell me that I was afk all match and helped 0 and came at the end because its not true, you guys have the ability to look on the match , do it and make things right , I know tons of players who trolled , afk all game , came to the last 4 minutes , won and got theyr lp so you blame me somehow?? This is a horrible bug  fix it  coz its simply a bulshit , perhaps you dont see this from a players point of view but when I saw this was shocked for 5 minutes, not figuring whats wrong! And on that game players flamed each other and I tryed to make them understand each other so we can win , this was horrible... and if I get this right , I played more then 25 minutes after the disco to help team , and still I lose lp , what the hell is the point in coming back if I lose game for about 5 minutes afk ?? In ranked I never troll or go afk , only if its a very serious reason a bit afk or bugs that disco me , so ye thats very  frustrating ....","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T20:22:18.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody said you were afk the entire match, just long enough to have been marked as being afk at some point. Based my answer on the fact that you admitted to having been afk for 7 min, which can make you forfeit any LP gains since you weren't there for the full game. On the other hand, you may not have gotten the LP due to a recent issue with EUNE servers, be sure to check the [**status page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#eune) for that info. Overall, either one of these could have been the reason you didn't see that LP.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
