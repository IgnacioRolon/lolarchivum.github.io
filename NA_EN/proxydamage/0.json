He is a gravedigger, and even more on the shadow isles, he is helping people. He helps people to go from  life.. to another kind of life xD \n\nMaybe he could remain a lane bully, but he could be relevant lategame with more strategical values that would support his lack of aoe damage by covering his team, and isolate high priority targets once the battle has started. Like : ok early on he is a strong 1v1 character, able to apply a lot of pressure on his lane opponent. But when it comes to midgame and lategame, he would not be only into damage. He is not renekton or riven this is not his identity in my opinion. \n\nWhat if his passive could make him interract with dead minions, monsters, or champions, giving them a second, undead, life? i see a \"revenge like\" use on ally champions, working as the reverse of his actual ultimate wich doesn't make a lot of sense. \nInstead of \"okay you're dead, be target that ennemy champion won't focus but will still do more or less the job for a time and die again after\" (not really a gravedigger's way to act, and this is i think really frustrating for the ally who will not do much most of the time, and also for the ennemies who never really understand how they have to deal with this) it could be more like \"stand up and get a second chance\" : when an ally dies, you can choose to bring him back to life for a short duration with bonuses : if he successfully kills an ennemy champion before the end of the effect, he gets back to life for real, and yorick's huge passive's cooldown is reduced. If not, the target's dead time is increased a bit and yorick doesn't get the cd reduction. It would give him a really special power, a really \"gravedigger\" power : litteraly taking ally champions from their grave, with this extra shadow isle bonus  known as second life.\n\nIn lane it would work like his actual ultimate : you killed me ? ok now this is my turn! But when it comes to teamfights, it would be totally different! No more \"Yorick ultied him - ok, kill him first, then kite/ignore his clone until it disappears\" The bonus granted by the effect would be there to make it a real threat, a real objective to deal with in teamfights. An high risk/high reward move for each team. Yorick would have to chose wisely which ally to traget, when, and his ennemies would have to be aware of his position, and when he does it, to decide what is the priority : focus it first because it's too dangerous, or rush to the ennemy team and try to kite it, taking the risk to fail and let it revive. There couldn't be any situation where they could chose to just ignore him, unless yorick brings back the 0/24 ad {{champion:16}}  from the grave. \nIt would also bring a \"fun part\" to teamfight, where the ennemy would have to prevent Yorick from getting to the tombs, playing hide and seek or just chasing him. Map awareness (wich is important a loooot for a someone supposed to look after a graveyard) could be the funny part of his kit, like having the opportunity to send undead minions/monsters/summons to a place, to cover, attack, distract, while going another to unburrow an ally! \nYorick would become a living threat if i can say this :3 It could also be another funny starting point to build his kit : after all, summoning characters, no matter what kind of game you plays, are made to cover a very large part of the battle field. If yorick could become a teemo like lane bully (with a lot of single target damage, map awareness and map controle over a resttricted area), it would really fit a him :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2015-08-12T23:25:31.247+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like his whole \"revive someone... but it came back wrong\" with his ult.\n\nIt would kind of be hilarious to make it so that he can never really die, but instead has a different much weaker kit when dead.

This is a very unique place he holds as league has struggled to make another summoner like character. Sure we have Malz with his passive minions, Azir with his soldiers, Morde with his pets, but Yorick makes it feel like you have a level of control over your minions actions before they cut loose trying to rip your opponents apart. \n\nSo for comparisons sake, the two other big names in MOBA right now, Heroes of the Storm and Dota 2, have their own summoner types. Now Dota 2 is hard to compare to cause every champion is OP in their own way and has a lot of programed in RTS mechanics to manage large amounts of characters.\nHeroes is a bit closer though, in Heroes the best comparison i can make is Azmodan. He takes control of a lane by adding more minions to the field, making his opponents have more to deal with, they arent much stronger than a regular lane minion but it adds preasure.\n\nI don't think his skills should change to much in the sense of \"these are my minions i must choose who to call\" and keeping the utility he gains with them, namely the life steal summon to keep his lane pressure up. As for his ult that is questionable, I kinda think it would be cool to have a \"wake the dead\" type ult where he summons several minions to swarm his foes.\n\nI am super excited for this rework as i have love yorick for years but have felt for so long he needs worked on.

My attempt at redefining Yorick.\n(A reminder, do not judge based on numbers, clearly they are no where near balanced but please consider the aim at functionality instead)\n\nThe new Yorick goes in a different direction than the current selfish solo lane bully he is. This kit still has lane bully potential but has higher reward when coordinating as a team.\n\nPassive - Unearth the Party: every 10 sec (reduced by cdr) Yorick unearths a random Ghoul (red, yellow, blue) that hangs around him until he has all 3 (one of each). They empower Yorick's Q and E depending which Ghoul is next in line.\n\nYorick also gains 10% more health from items, and takes 5% reduced damage for each Ghoul he has attacking or latched to an enemy (not while waiting for Q or E use) [max 15%]\n\nRed Ghoul: big rampager, big hits and always attacks target Yorick uses basic attacks against.\nYellow Ghoul: short and fat, slow hits, randomly attacks with ranged (400 range) basic attacks.\nBlue Ghoul: medium skinny, fast moving and fast attacking, attacks closest enemy.\n\n[Ghouls can take 4 basic attacks to be killed (like wards)]\n\nNotes on Passive: the idea here is Yorick effectively has an additional resource: his ghouls. I wanted him to have an Olimar-like feel. Also, ghouls have more personality and clear distinction aside from color.\n\nQ - Unholy Covenant: (check each skill) fuses energy with one of his ghouls to perform an attack based on the Ghoul. When the ability finishes, that Ghoul begins to attack a nearby enemy for 8 sec before dying.\n\n\t* Red: (on-click non-targeting cast) gain massive movement speed for 2 sec and cause the next basic attack to deal % of enemy's max health.\n\t* Yellow: (on-click non-targeting cast) shield Yorick for up to 250 (+10% Yorick max health) health for 3 sec. When it ends, shield all nearby allies within range for half this value for 1.5 sec.\n\t* Blue: (fixed directional skillshot, 700 range) send Ghoul out towards location. At max range (1 sec to travel) it'll pull Yorick towards it, dealing up to 250 damage and knocking all enemies in the path up for 1 sec.\n\n50/55/60/65/70 mana, 8/7/6/5/4 cooldown.\n\nNotes on Q: the strength is the skill has 3 strong options, the downside is not having too much control (could bunt one away with E to line up the one you want)\n\nW - Corpse Bomb: (ground-targetting aoe, 850 range) After a brief delay, rupture a green Ghoul from the ground that deals up to 260 magic damage and slows all enemies by up to 60% that decays over 2 sec.\n\nThe ghoul remains half in ground, attacking enemies within range, lasts 8 sec.\n80 mana, 8 sec cooldown.\n\nNotes on W: potentially has more damage than old W, gives opponent much better time countering the spell. To counter the enemy's counter, Bash the Ghoul towards them! Profit!) Combos fairly well with blue Ghoul Q when timed correctly for nice surprise burst.\n\nE - Cryptic Bash: (direction cast / click-hit directional if targeting green ghoul) Hits one of your ghouls with shovel towards a location, dealing up to 200 magic damage to first enemy hit and latches on for 8 sec, causing basic attacks from allies to trigger bonus effects.\n\nCan hit corpse bomb Ghoul (green) to trigger bonus effect.\n\n\t* Red: after 4 basic attacks the Ghoul leaps off and becomes enraged for 4 sec, dealing % of Yorick's health as bonus damage with each attack against the nearest enemy (or whoever Yorick is attacking).\n\t* Yellow: after 4 basic attacks the Ghoul pops, stunning all enemies around the target for 1.25 sec.\n\t* Blue: after 4 basic attacks the Ghoul bursts into 8 little ghouls that seek out enemies, blowing up for up to 200 magic damage (10% damage after damaged by one)\n\t* Green: after 4 basic attacks the Ghoul explodes dealing up to 260 magic damage and slowing all enemies hit by 60% that decays over 2 sec.\n\n40/45/50/55/60 mana, 6 sec cooldown.\n\nGives Yorick a \"batter up!\" feel and helps cycle through ghouls to get to the next one for Q. Still gives him range but added incentive to be more of a team fighter rather than a selfish solo by introducing  the 4 attack triggers mechanic.\n\nR - Ghoulpocalypse:\nPassive: whenever Yorick dies, after 6 seconds he comes back (ruptures from the ground) as a massive reanimated version for 10 sec with 40/50/60% of his health. [Only access to Q and each use provides all three functions at once but no ghoul is needed nor created. The spell costs no mana during this state]\n\nActive: Yorick buries a near-death (25/35/45% health) ally (cannot use on self) for 2.5 sec, making them immune to all damage but cannot move or perform any action. Once ended, the ally ruptures from the earth with a shield equal to 50% of Yorick's total health for 5 sec.\n\nThis unearthing also spawns 3/6/9 random ghouls that begin to attack nearby enemies for 8 sec.\n100 mana, 140/120/100 sec cooldown.\n\nFantasy behind the new ultimate: still preserve that \"protect a teammate\" while still feeling powerful if Yorick dies in combat.\n\nEach of the ghouls spawned this way function like unearthed ghouls and are randomized (you could theoretically have up to 9 spawned red ghouls) and causes mass hysteria in team fights, but can only be triggered by saving an ally (can't just initiate a fight with it)\n\nAdditional notes on ult passive: unsure how \"free skills\" will work without ghouls, would like feedback to explore what the skills could do or just default to Red Ghoul skills","replies":[]},{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2015-08-14T00:49:35.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mana Sustain.

It would also be cool, as many stated in the \"let's talk about Yorick\" thread, if playing Yorick you feel like you are commanding an army. I don't know what you have on his kit now, but the latest iteration of Xelnath's kit looked really cool (the one years ago). I think Yorick's abilities should control his Ghouls.

And that's why they promoted his riptide instead.\n\nBut in Yorick's case, all of his abilities combined a ghoul summon with a passive steroid. And I wonder if it has the same effect. That Yorick is too powerful when his ghouls are up, and useless when they are down. If they keep the combination of his ghoul summons and steroid. I should think that the steroid duration should be independent of how long the ghouls last.","replies":[]}]}
