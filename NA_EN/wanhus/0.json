I always shorten a lot (like nega, hara grief instead of negativity, harashment and griefing) and I type fast ingame  so i also make a lot of typos and I don't correct them as i want to play more type less. So be warned you might get banned for nothing just telling the flamer you will report him. This is the game log they sent me back where I was apparently racist:\r\n\r\nWanhus: kha muted reported enga grief =(\r\nWanhus: im 32 you are the one flaming now muted =/\r\nWanhus: help us in reproting kha for toxic nega hara =/ no fun having players liek him =(\r\nWanhus: you flamed adn ajsed me to ulti while i cnat move as fast as yo uand iwas level 5\r\nWanhus: also you are the one sitll flaming me =/\r\nWanhus: type fast play mroe stop afk please and spam in global kha =/\r\nWanhus: ww 5 times top all fails, but still he lives at top\r\nWanhus: well good thing is even thou i have never won a flamed gmae in 7 yeras atleast this is a free win unless we got grief =)\r\n\r\nNow I'm trying to get my account restored but it does not look good... =(","replies":[{"poster":"DrFish14","date":"2017-09-24T18:00:33.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot programmers are not the greatest in the world.

It doesn't look like anyone was calling you racist, but pointing out which parts of the other chat logs that were more negative towards your own teammates. If you'd like to reach back out to them in a ticket you're more than welcome, but it looks like the final answer was already given.","replies":[]}]}
