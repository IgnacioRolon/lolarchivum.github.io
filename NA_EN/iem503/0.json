For example, I just got the star guardian rakan border set but my duo partner only has the regular xayah skin. To have the skins line up in loading screen, I'd love to be able to turn off the skin border.\r\n\r\nMaybe in our collection under the skins tab, you could click on the skin and down on the bottom right where chromas and other skins in the set are available to see, you could turn off the border for the time being with just a small check box. Just seems like it would be a nice addition to the client and loading screen.","replies":[]}
