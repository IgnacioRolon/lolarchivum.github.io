I forgot my password after taking a break from the game, and once again I can't get an email from the LoL site. This has happened before,years ago, and the first time LoL support sent me an email manually and I was able to reset my password and get to playing again. This time they told me that the information I sent them was incorrect.... I gave them everything I could and they said they couldn't confirm it was originally my account and they said the matter was closed. The email address contains my first account's name but apparently they don't think it's mine. I asked the person helping me, if it was a person, what information was incorrect and they didn't acknowledge my question at all.\r\n   I know that my email is linked to SOME account, because I cannot create a new account using my email address. When I enter my email address into the forgot username box, I still get no email. I can't get a forgot password email sent to the address linked to CGSmij, or a forgot username email sent to my email address.\r\n   It is absolutely infuriating not being able to use my account for this reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T23:52:48.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point, the best thing you can do is reach back out in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and do your best to go back over the recovery questions and answer them to the best of your ability.
