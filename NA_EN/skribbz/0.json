This can happen either by directly getting the CS myself or just accidentally weakening a creep to a point that it dies too quick and the ADC may miss the last hit. This also causes the lane to be more pushed than it should be.\n\nWhat I think Zyra needs is a little bit more control over her plants. This could be as simple as adding a way for you to stop your plants from attacking creeps. I do know that if you auto-attack an enemy champion the plants will stop attacking the creeps, but sometimes this means getting too close to the enemy champions and could possibly lead to a death, which just isn&#039;t worth it. \n\nIn a perfect world I would like something similar to Kindred&#039;s marking system. It could have all the the enemies and even a slot that cancels all plants from attacking. I seriously doubt that Riot would implement something like this and it might even call for some balancing work to the plants damage, but I think something needs to be implemented to help Zyra supports from hurting their ADC&#039;s.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are there any other Zyra supports out there who also have this issue? If not, are there any tips you could pass to me? Also, are there any ADC&#039;s that have this issue when their support is playing Zyra? \n\nThanks for any insight, in advanced!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-06-25T21:08:17.804+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I attempt to put my plants decently behind the minion wave to zone off the enemy. I also die a lot when I play Zyra. So there's a tradeoff.  \n\nDangerous strategy: if you legit think your lane partner is going to miss the CS because your plants are aggro'ing them, pick them up for yourself. Zyra is good with money. :)","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2016-06-26T20:15:05.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"skribbz","date":"2016-06-27T04:24:00.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is all we need.

You can limit your use of deadly spines and mainly use grasping roots in order to root the enemy and the vine lasher slows them for a higher possibility of making a kill.\n\nI switched to ADC main now and as far as CS being taken and the occasional kill taken from me, it happen. It isn't ideal but I won't be bothered as long as we win lane. Some adc get really annoyed no matter how well you control your CS and taking kills, but most of those I have encountered weren't great adcs to begin with.\n\nAfter looking at your match history it looks like you're not going overboard and taking kills or a lot of CS.
