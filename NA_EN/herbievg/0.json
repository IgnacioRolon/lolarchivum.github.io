My ping is almost always at 115-130 MS since 6.14, and when mine is at 115 his is around 60. But after a game or two his will be at 115-130 and mine will be at 60 ish. Sometimes we'll both have 115-130 so it won't even matter. We've tried everything including re-installing, and I even invested in an ethernet cable which only made my ping a stable 160 ms. Any answers or tips would be great, thank you so much for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T17:28:56.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network might be experiencing packet loss which is causing delays in your games.

This means you experienced high ping during this game, which is likely where you were seeing issues. See below for a few recommendations to help out with this.\"\n\n\"Your average percentage of packet loss for this game was 0.00%.\nOverall, this means you had a low amount of packets lost during the game.\"\n\nAlso, I tried wired connection and it only made it worse. 113 ping was just one of the logs I pasted, almost all of the ones I tried had 110+ with 0.00% packet loss. I don't understand what the issue is.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T15:06:42.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for following up on this!
