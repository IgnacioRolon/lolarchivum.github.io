So where I work, we&#039;re doing a competition for worlds. It&#039;s sort of like a fantasy league so if someone can give me their opinion on the best players for each position? I only really know a lot about NA esports. Any help would be appreciated (:","replies":[{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2016-09-19T18:08:08.072+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smeb is hands down the best top laner at worlds.  If Rox wins worlds, it will be because Smeb just outclasses his opponents too well.  \n\nI'm not incredibly well versed on junglers at worlds but I would have say best jungler would either be Trick or Clearlove.  \n\nMid is weird.  Mechanically, Faker is the best (although you can make arguments for Scout).  Bjergsen is up there as well and I think from a team synergy perspective might (I say this cautiously as I'm not sure it's absolutely better) be more impactful than Faker.  Faker is the king of the solo plays and that's great and can solo carry SKT.  However Bjergsen is so good at playing around his team that he can help his teammates carry pretty hard.  So I guess this one comes to what you look for in a mid laner.\n\nThere are a lot of good ADCs.  Uzi, Doublelift, Bang, Pray, Zven, even ForG1ven.  This one is too close to call imo.\n\nSupports are tough to categorize and to be honest I don't know that much about support players at worlds.  I think Mata of RNG is solid, as is Gorilla of Rox and Wolf of SKT.  Mithy from G2 is pretty good and has great duo synergy with Zven.  Aphromoo is never someone you can count out, although I don't know if CLG will be in a good enough place for Aphro to be able to be the playmaker that he is.","replies":[{"poster":"HerbieVG","date":"2016-09-19T18:19:02.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much!

Deft is obviously the best ADC in the world, no contest. Bang is the only one who even comes up close, and even then he is left in the dust in comparison. When it comes to support, Gorilla and Mata are peerless, but then you listed Wolf, Mithy, and even Aphromoo before meiko. Still, I guess I shouldn't have expected much insight from a Team Liquid fan, XD.","replies":[{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2016-09-27T06:57:54.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't looking at a full list of everyone there when I answered, forgive a guy....also I don't really follow LPL to be fair so I don't know as much.

As far as I know Mata is the shot caller, and those calls have been pretty bad lately. Meiko on the other hand has the best ADC in the world to work with in Deft, while PraY hasn't looked the most consistent at times, giving Gorilla a lot more slack to pick on his end.
