It'd help tanks since they would take less damage overall, and make the sustain from the machete passive more effective.  Speaking of the machete passive they should put a bit more mana regen on that passive, for all those mana heavy junglers out there (Skarner, Hecarim, Amumu, Sejuani, etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-02T00:34:06.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The main two problems with Juggernaut are cost effectiveness and the stats it's giving compared to the other items.\n\nMagus is giving 80 AP and 10% CDR for less than the cost of a Needlessly Large Rod.\n\nWarrior is giving 10% CDR, 10 armor pen, and 20 AD for 1337 off the Brutalizer, so it only costs 163 gold to get it to 40 AD, gaining 20 AD for half the cost of a 10 AD Long Sword.\n\nStalker gets more cost efficient the more stacks it gets.\n\nBut Juggernaut? You're losing money. It's 850 for the Kindlegem, 400 for a Ruby Crystal, so 1250 for 400 health and 10% CDR. It's costing you 250 for the combine cost to get to the full Juggernaut enchant, which gives you the tenacity and another 100 health. Only problem is, you're paying for 5/8ths of what could be another Ruby Crystal and only getting half of the health you would get otherwise. The tenacity is nice, but it isn't all that needed so early in the game when most champions in the lanes are having some mana issues and can't afford to spam abilities anyways. All in all it's cheaper to just spend 1200 gold and buy three Ruby Crystals to get 600 health. \n\nThe health itself is part of the issue. The other items are giving damage right where people need it, one of them is giving magic damage on hit, which means it's going to hurt more since you don't have any MR yet, and one is giving both AD and armor pen, meaning it's going to do the same. Even if you were to walk out with a Juggernaut at the same time as say, a Vi shows up with a Warrior, you have no hope of defeating the Vi because she's doing so much more damage, and you haven't built up any armor to mitigate any of the damage she's doing to you. You may have more health, but against Warrior or Devourer you're taking more damage than you would if you had any amount of MR or armor, and against bursty caster/assassin type AP junglers, like Elise or Diana for instance, they've got a massive boost to their damage output and can burn through your 500 health. It's just going to take them a few seconds longer.\n\nThe item isn't giving you the mix of stats that a tank needs to do well in the early game, and that's the problem. Between how inefficient it is compared to the other three, and that the other three can make it seem like that 500 bonus health is worthless, it's a massive detriment to tank junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"Talamare","date":"2014-12-02T04:52:40.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The main two problems with Juggernaut are cost effectiveness and the stats it's giving compared to the other items.\n> \n> Magus is giving 80 AP and 10% CDR for less than the cost of a Needlessly Large Rod.\n> \n> Warrior is giving 10% CDR, 10 armor pen, and 20 AD for 1337 off the Brutalizer, so it only costs 163 gold to get it to 40 AD, gaining 20 AD for half the cost of a 10 AD Long Sword.\n\n\nMagus is basically a weaker Morellonomicon for basically same price\nWarrior is basically a crappy cheap Black Cleaver","replies":[{"poster":"youngjake93","date":"2014-12-03T00:39:18.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > The main two problems with Juggernaut are cost effectiveness and the stats it's giving compared to the other items.\n> > \n> > Magus is giving 80 AP and 10% CDR for less than the cost of a Needlessly Large Rod.\n> > \n> > Warrior is giving 10% CDR, 10 armor pen, and 20 AD for 1337 off the Brutalizer, so it only costs 163 gold to get it to 40 AD, gaining 20 AD for half the cost of a 10 AD Long Sword.\n> \n> \n> Magus is basically a weaker Morellonomicon for basically same price\n> Warrior is basically a crappy cheap Black Cleaver\n\nThat's if you ignore the befits of your machete+upgrade in the cost calculation.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2014-12-01T22:42:36.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Think maybe the extra gold should only be tied to the Tank Enchant then?\n\nYes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2014-12-01T20:25:46.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks need Juggernaut to be buffed big time.

It's about jungler vs laner balance.  Junglers were falling too far behind in gold.\n\nYou can't address tank versus damage jungler clearing with items.
