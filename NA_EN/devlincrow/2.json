Fair enough.\r\n\r\nBut looking at the leaverbuster FAQ, it says it starts off at a 5 min waiting time, then 10 mins then 20 mins.\r\n\r\nMy question is, after say hitting the 5 &amp; 10 min waiting times, is it always 20 mins every punishment after?\r\n\r\nNot moaning if it is, I'm just wondering. \r\n\r\nI don't remember getting previous LeaverBuster punishments (never once rage quitted) but I have played for years so my memory might just be foggy.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T20:55:47.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you play enough games without getting flagged as a leaver, the length of the LPQ should be lowered back down to 10 and then 5.
