I didn't say that's what the text said. What I said was: it's what the text _implies_. I was a bit thrown by the idea that was a Watcher, and it made me unhappy to consider that it might be (so this new revelation on the boards is a good thing in my eyes), but it isn't just about what the text says.\n\nWording is definitely important here, as is implicature; the average reader is going to be going on and on about how it was a Watcher for ages because of this. It just reminds me of the Kai'Sa confusion—players get confused, things aren't communicated clearly or in proper course. If this isn't a Watcher, although it looks like one given the concept arts we have of them before, then adding an extra line of clarification doesn't break immersion. Look at the other comments in here. You aside, and your positive response being the only one a Rioter responded to, **people are confused about this**. My problem isn't the content. It's the confusion stuff like this causes. It seems so foreseeable. I don't know what else to say.\n\nI dunno. As a huge lore person, misconceptions drive me really crazy—and they're probably going to continue to show up for a while because of this.\n\nAnyway, the cinematic's great, thoroughly enjoying watched it, excited to see what's next!","replies":[{"poster":"Robertsmash","date":"2018-07-26T18:34:35.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what you're saying, but I didn't see it that way.

It is the reader's prerogative to infer something that wasn't stated and to accept that their inference might therefore be wrong. That's not the author's fault. Since the text is still technically correct, even if the creature the Watchers sent is not an actual Watcher, then the false inference on the part of the reader was just that: false. Maybe I've dealt with localization and foreign translations of games and other media for too long, but I read things with extreme discretion regarding \"what was actually said\" vs \"what I want it to say.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, I do think that if it's confusing a lot of people, it should be reworded. I'm just saying why I didn't think it was a Watcher.\n\nYeah, it was a great cinematic.

It is the reader's prerogative to infer something that wasn't stated and to accept that their inference might therefore be wrong. That's not the author's fault. \n\nWith all due respect, I strongly oppose that view. I have to write for a living (scientific papers, not fiction, as a matter of fact), and when a reviewer misunderstand what I wrote, my paper is still rejected, even if what I wrote is technically correct and the misunderstanding is entirely on the reviewer. Barring a reader obviously arguing in bad faith, ANY misunderstanding coming from a non-interactive medium is ALWAYS the fault of the author, never the fault of the reader. It's the author's job to communicate clearly, and that includes anticipating and avoiding what readers will imply and infer.\n\nThat doesn't mean as an author you can avoid 100% of the ambiguity. Sometimes you keep it for suspense, sometimes being totally unambiguous would just make the text tedious to read and not flow properly, it's a trade-off to find, there is no perfect solution. But blaming the reader? You should absolutely never do that. Even when there is no perfect solution, that's still not a reader's fault.\n\n(And the fact that you, personally, are a careful reader, does not exonerate an author to be mindful of all their other less careful readers.)","replies":[{"poster":"Robertsmash","date":"2018-07-27T00:26:53.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I have to write for a living (scientific papers, not fiction, as a matter of fact), and when a reviewer misunderstand what I wrote, my paper is still rejected, even if what I wrote is technically correct and the misunderstanding is entirely on the reviewer.\n\nI think that if something is difficult to understand or misleads most people, like the Watcher line, it should be reworded. More to the point, scientific literature is meant to be as direct, instructional, and unambiguous as possible. The Watcher line isn't subject to peer review and doesn't serve the same purpose.\n\n>Barring a reader obviously arguing in bad faith, ANY misunderstanding coming from a non-interactive medium is ALWAYS the fault of the author, never the fault of the reader.\n\nI disagree, and don't understand the need for such a staunch defence of the reader. In fiction (not science), expecting the reader to be critical and shrewd when given information is a form of respect from the author. Having lines that require a bit of mental chewing and breakdown to see what's really being said is part of the fun. All of the supplementary information we have on the Watchers hints that the entity Ryze faced couldn't be one. If the reader can't pick that up, that's on them imo.\n\nJust out of curiosity, what kind of papers do you write? Your own research?","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-07-27T23:52:48.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to imply (but correct me if I'm wrong) that my opinion is different only because I'm talking of a different context, but I believe what I said is true for both fiction and scientific papers. A good fiction can have mystery and suspense, but it shouldn't have ambiguity and vagueness without a clear purpose.\n\nBasically, if you have a question, and when you ask on these Boards, a Rioter just comes by and tease you even more, that was good writing and suspense, they wanted you to wonder. But if they come and answer your question, it's a sign there was an issue in the original medium, because they didn't want to create suspense, they are OK with you having the information, but they just weren't clear enough.\n\nAnd again, I want to stress that it's OK to have some issues in your text, you can never reach perfection, and some misunderstandings *will* happen, especially since there are many competing problems to solve at the same time (the more common being: respecting space constraints). It's not an irredeemable flaw. But still, when it happens, an author/creator should own it and acknowledge it, not blame the reader because \"the clues were there\".\n\nAnd I have such a strong stance because this issue is one of the many facets of a more pervasive and important problem: people not taking their responsibilities and refusing to admit fault. Admittedly, this is one of the less important facets, and I won't make it my hill to die on, as Ghostcrawler says, but it still connects to a topic important to me.\n\nAs for what I write, well I'm not working alone, we are a team, but yes I do write original research.

The entity Ryze fights isn't labeled. It doesn't have to be, because that's not what the line is trying to do. Text next to a picture in science can't just \"hint\" at anything, everything must be explicitly labeled and the meaning fully described. Seems very different from fiction to me.\n\n>people not taking their responsibilities and refusing to admit fault.\n\nI would agree with you, but I think that if some people can get the real meaning of the line (definitely not just me), then there was no fault on the part of the author. The line is decipherable, not false or utterly incomprehensible.\n\nIn this case the people not taking their responsibilities and refusing to admit fault are the readers who read \"Watcher\", saw the picture, and thought no further imo.\n\nFrom your other reply\n\n>But when first the author creates an only then a receiver \"consumes\", then the fault can only be on the author, not the receiver, in my opinion.\n\nBut readers make mistakes all the time interpreting text. Look at test questions: \"Which organism does not use photosynthesis?\" And some miss the \"not\" and pick one that does. \"Order the following from greatest to least\" and some order it from \"least to greatest\". People don't see what's _actually_ being said.
