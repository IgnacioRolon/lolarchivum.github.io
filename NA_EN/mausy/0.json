Can&#039;t we just have a nice quiet launcher that sits in the background and only makes notification sounds when queues hit?\r\n\r\nIt could just be me though.

Within that, there's \"Enable SFX,\" which includes \"Play Ambient Sounds\" (like a slight breeze that continues at all times including during games and didn't originally have an option to disable but now it does), \"Play Pick Quotes,\" and \"Play Ban Quotes.\" Individual sound effects like accepting a queue would be part of \"Enable SFX,\" so if you wanted to disable that sound, it would take with it ambient noise, voice lines (within the client, not the game itself), and all the other little noises the client can make.","replies":[{"poster":"Mausy","date":"2019-01-10T14:45:56.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The annoying background sounds are lumped together with the notification sounds under the general term \"SFX\" turning off \"Ambient Sounds\" takes care of most of the 'wooshing' and other headache inducing noise, but it doesn't get rid of the \"Accept Button\" after sounds which are totally unnecessary. That is, unless you want to turn off all sounds and just miss your queues when the launcher decides to not jump up in front of your face every other time someone dodges.\n\nEdit: Also, every time there's a launcher update, all these settings are reset.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meredith Stout","date":"2019-01-10T12:59:27.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No headache here, but upvoted because sound is too \"hyped\".","replies":[]}]}
