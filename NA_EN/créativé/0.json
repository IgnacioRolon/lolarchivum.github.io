Big hikes in latency are often caused by either local network configurations or ISP routing problems. I'd strongly recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if those changes helped.","replies":[{"poster":"forty two 42","date":"2016-11-18T13:26:04.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please help us. I've been having the exact same problem since 6.22. My internet is totally fine. I NEVER in years of playing with this PC and through this provider had any ping spikes. 6.22 makes LoL for me and many others unplayable. There IS a problem with this patch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlphaZero","date":"2016-11-14T19:06:46.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've also encountered lag spikes after the pre-season (the patch) and especially more AFTER THE alpha client. It's maybe because it's a new season and it's supposed to be more.. how do I say.. \" Get used to the new huge patches and the reworks of champions) I'm not really good at this but try to shut down unnecessary applications in the background during a league of legends game, I'm pretty sure that lowers the lag spikes, (Has worked for me so far).. I wish you the best!\n\nBest wishes, A Kat Main {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
