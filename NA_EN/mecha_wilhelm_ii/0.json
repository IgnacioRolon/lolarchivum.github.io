At roughly noon EST I entered in a game as Karthus top lane.\nAt about the 21 minute mark, I was stuck reconnecting, which rarely happens to me.  It was not resolving, so I decided to exit the client so I could reconnect.... Except when I logged back in, I wasn't given the option to reconnect.  As I type this, I am now connecting to a new game.  It's as if the one I DC'd from didn't even happen.  I have no loss to my LP, nor do I currently see match history indicating I was even in the game.  What's so confusing is that the client didn't give me the option to reconnect and now, as I type this, I'm in a lobby doing bans before champ select.  My previous game could still be going.  I am so confused.  Can Riot look into this and see what the heck happened?  I would provide a link, but I've got nothing to indicate the match even existed at this point.\n\nEDIT: I just completed that next game I mentioned and won.  I have no record in my match history of the other one even happening.  My LP also has only increased.  Riot, you may have a slight issue on your hands there.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-05T18:07:11.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up!  I was able to locate the Karthus match you're reporting and it looks like a disappearing game.  This could have happened from a server issue, if the match essentially lost connection to the game server.  It's super rare, but it can happen.  The good news (or bad if it was a really good game) is that the match will act like it didn't exist.  I'll pass this on just in case, though!","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha Wilhelm II","date":"2017-07-05T21:23:31.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well hey, I'm okay with that as long as I don't suffer for it :) It was really strange.  I've never encountered it before in my years playing League, so I'm not concerned of an abrupt epidemic of disappearing games.  Thanks for getting back to me.","replies":[]}]}]}
