I think Ninja Tabis wouldn&#039;t be bought as much and the choice of boot would matter more.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-13T03:26:40.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game has too much apen already.\n\nRemember pre-nerf lethality meta?","replies":[{"poster":"Wolf and Gun","date":"2018-05-13T03:45:50.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We are hitting the -everyone- now has true damage meta.
