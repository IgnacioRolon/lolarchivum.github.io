The ULT where Riven transforms into a godly being, should be Kayle&#039;s ULT. The gold bubble is old and meh. How cool would it be if Kayle&#039;s ULT brought out the &#039;god&#039; form of every champ or Kayle for a few secs when used. It might be a lot of work, but well worth it. I&#039;m not even a Kayle main... or a Kayle player really. So not really biased. But I look at this new Riven skin... which I think is cool and amazing. Then I think... you know who this would of gone better on... who this -really- looks like? It looks like an updated Kayle, not Riven. Just my thoughts. Love you Riot. But you might of missed an opportunity here.\r\n\r\n(Lastly I can&#039;t post in the right board due to my &#039;level&#039;.
