It doesnt matter if there is huge teamfigt or just peaceful lane phase... And I also got 1-3 lags per game, the game lags for about 1minute (only mouse works, but when I click somewher nothing happends), my chamipion stays on place where I left him, so I usually die :/ Any ideas what to do? thx","replies":[{"poster":"Smoking Aces","date":"2016-05-26T18:25:57.420+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue after i updated the patch 6.10. My Ping stays intact but FPS drops drastically from 100+ to 2-10 after every 2-3 minutes and stays like that for 1--2 minutes and this keeps on happening repeatedly, atleast 4-5 times in a normal 25-30 mins game. Literally the game is unplayable for me, i even tried reinstalling but no improvement observed.\nThings that i have tried without any results:\n-Defragment LOL  folder\n-Reinstall LOL client\n-Force repair LOL installation files\n-Uninstall my antivirus software\n-close down all other apps while running LOL\n\nI am at a loss as to what to do next. I even got myself a 5 match low priority queue {{item:3070}} just becoz the game is damn unplayable. I believe this is something to do with the new patch and not my PC or internet as they were working fine few days ago. **I hope someone finds a solution to this problem or riot releases a new patch to sort this out.**","replies":[{"poster":"Dopendope","date":"2017-05-27T04:19:15.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i also tried to delete somethings off my computer and i also reinstalled the game, i tried everything i could, i use to get 150fps and stay with that all game but from the recent patch every minute i drop frames to 4fps even if i just stand there with nothing on my screen going on. i have rage quit due to dying from this and i just got a recent low priority ban because of it. please fix riot. i know it is not my computer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rust Coin","date":"2016-11-03T04:14:22.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im with you man this is bullshit and im sure your pc is also good i thaught i was only one with this problem let me know if you find a solution cause ive tried everything i could think of","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T20:17:52.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are a number of very weird things going on here it looks like.

Stop flipping blaming it on our devices. I have been playing this game for 7 months on end and I haven't had a problem like that once. This came absolutely out of nowhere. To say that groups of people are having this issue at the same time after a patch update means that you all screwed up somewhere. So instead of sending us to FPS troubleshoot, admit that it could be on your end instead of having us run around clueless because we cannot fix the issue no matter what we try.  This is annoying as hell and I haven't been seeing true responses from you all yet. This has been going on for almost 2 weeks. There's no way all of our computers broke at once. So stop all the bull crap and find the issue please?\n\nI even freeze when my ping and fps are at decent areas.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Rust Coin","date":"2016-11-03T04:22:44.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here man i feel the same","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rust Coin","date":"2016-11-03T04:12:54.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its bullshit i have same trouble as these guys after patch 2 weeks ago ive tried everythinjg fix your game riot \ni seriously think about just perma delete my LOL as do most people at this point with your fps sure its hard cause with so many patches it screwes up the game and give so many problems","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rust Coin","date":"2016-11-03T04:20:15.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 weeks ago after that shiit patch LoL fps trouble kicked in immediately not 1 full min that the fps doesnt give a drop i was usually full graphics and 100+ fps now for 5 years now all of sudden this bullshit..... ive tried all your trouble shooting nonsense on webpage and went to youtube and tried everything but game is unplayable now ........wtf riot you are killing me and used smurf to login  cause i lost my other main few years ago becasue of login into LoL for these chats ps i cant handle this fps ive tried but im done let us know when you found a real solution please","replies":[]},{"poster":"PePWoD","date":"2016-05-27T17:06:17.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your ping stays intact and your FPS drop guys thats maybe visual bug or Low RAM or Processors .
