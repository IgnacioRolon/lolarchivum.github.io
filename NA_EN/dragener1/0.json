If it was removed, everyone would be forced to stay in their lane and the jungle would be rendered useless, as well as you teammates. Without being able to change lanes, the game would essentially become 3 different games centered around each lane (if that makes sense).","replies":[{"poster":"KillroysKolt","date":"2017-06-18T02:54:01.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine the game would might as well be considered a three way one on one if the river or jungle were taken out of the equation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dragener1","date":"2017-12-06T12:34:16.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok I ment remove the ability to gank lains for a surtent amount of time like not being able to frikin lvl 2 gank someone","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KillroysKolt","date":"2017-06-18T02:30:54.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of roaming is to give an extra kill/siege opportunity to the team that has the roamer(s). If this were to be removed, it'd defeat the purpose of essential map elements such as the jungle and the river (especially the river). My suggestion is that you use wards and check the map to always keep an eye out for an incoming gank, or pay attention to the enemy missing pings that are signaled by your team. That way you can counter attack the ganker or have an idea of when to flee in order to avoid a death. **But removing the ability to leave your lane is rather unnecessary and would completely change the way the game is played by all parties.**","replies":[{"poster":"Dragener1","date":"2017-12-06T12:34:46.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok I ment remove the ability to gank lains for a surtent amount of time like not being able to frikin lvl 2 gank someone","replies":[]}]}]}
