The dump file error can happen if bugsplat fails to get you logs, but there may have been another error message.  The glitchy sound and audio sounds like something may have corrupt with your game files.  My suggestion for this case would be to download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and ruin a repair just in case.

It seems like it happens when the screen changes (for example goes from lobby to champ select or end game screen to home screen). I then need to close the client from the League of Legends not responding pop-up, after which the League client pops open again and after a moment of blank client, I get the champ select or home screen that failed to load at first.","replies":[]}]}]}
