This is why disconnections are all treated equally and why penalties cannot be removed or modified.\n\nDisconnections from queue are often the result of your client not establishing a stable link to the servers. As a first step, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as it commonly resolves these issues.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
