I am not bringing a 5 paragraph essay talking smack about the game. \r\n\r\nFirst of all the reason why I said this is because I WILL BE HONEST I used to rage A LOT. I got banned from the chat and I started to tone it down, as games passed by I noticed I did improve on my attitude, I did used to say bad things and that got me a 3 day suspension and a 2 week one. Obviously we all know that the 2 week one is your last chance. So for 2 months straight I DID NOT EVEN talk on the chat, but we are all humans and sometimes we lose our cool. On this particular game I had a brand intentionally feed and a yorick flaming us. Throughout the whole match I just kept asking brand WHY wast he pushing and as Yorick kept harassing everyone I did say to him &quot;you talk a lot for an 0/2 top&quot;. I threw a couple of F bombs in the chat but there were GENERAL F bombs, none of them directed to ANYONE in the game. Upon going into a new game the client says &quot;a penalty has been issued&quot; and bam my account is permanently banned.\r\n\r\nI tried to get this sorted out with customer service and they tell me that &quot;because your past behavior was negative this contributed to the permanent ban&quot;\r\nSo what was the point of the previous bans ? You can&#039;t come at me saying that the OLDER GAMES who i already was punished for contribute to this one match. I will copy and paste the whole chat of why I got banned. Honestly I am just disappointed at the way this situation was handled with the ban system. I personally believe this wasn&#039;t a permanent ban worthy offense, all I ask is for a review on this situation since I believe this is an unfair ban. I can guarantee Riot if my account gets unbanned I will never even say a word in chat unless its &quot;GJ&quot;, &quot;GG&quot;, &quot;Nicely done bro!&quot;\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, brand admitted to say he didn&#039;t wanna play, and they started to say it was my fault that they died. When in the game I was at least trying to win. You guys can give me your opinion im\r\n\r\nChat Log from the game:\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nKing Money: wow\r\nKing Money: PUISH\r\nKing Money: PUSH\r\nKing Money: DONT GO BOT\r\nKing Money: ahri is out of control\r\nKing Money: brand isnt putting any pressure\r\nKing Money: whatsoever\r\nKing Money: ???\r\nKing Money: how is taht my fault\r\nKing Money: what ??\r\nKing Money: l;mao\r\nKing Money: so ahri roams top and thats inting ?\r\nKing Money: oaky bud\r\nKing Money: ???? im waiting for riven to get near you we kill her\r\nKing Money: im not expecting ahri coming at us\r\nKing Money: muting you\r\nKing Money: brand bro stay fucking mid what are you doing moving everywhere after they get kills\r\nKing Money: yorick saying im inting look at brand\r\nKing Money: this brand is just a complete troll\r\nKing Money: udyr what ?\r\nKing Money: lol brand joins a game to say that he doesnt wanna play so he trolls\r\nKing Money: right\r\nKing Money: obviously riot wont do anything about it\r\nKing Money: ????\r\nKing Money: afk when ?lol are you delusional yorick ?\r\nKing Money: you talk a lot for an 0/2 top\r\nKing Money: its gg\r\nKing Money: lol\r\nKing Money: brand admitted in our chat that he doesnt wanna play so he is just refusing to fight\r\nKing Money: gg\r\nKing Money: lol okay. report me for having a bad game bud","replies":[]}
