I just listened to the piece you referenced. Quite frankly I don't get the comparison. I'm not going to speak about Morton Feldman's music (I'm not a fan of post modern music myself), but I can shed some light on the harmonic vocabulary used in Kindred.\n\n> what Riot has done completely defies the meaning of music theory and is the reason that this genre of music is considered \"experimental\" in the first place.\n> \n> Constant tension by random chords and random add ins of instruments is not meaningful.\n\nKindred has nothing, and I repeat, _nothing_ to do with aleatoric music. There is a theme, the music is fully tonal, and uses very common Western harmony. Pretty much every dissonance gets resolved, and, with very few exceptions, the chord progression goes through an immuable staple of standard harmony, namely subdominant -> dominant -> tonic (or variations on that). There is nothing random in here.\n\nMore specifically, Kindred largely uses Romantic harmony (and doesn't even really venture into \"late\" Romanticism). The only oddity might be the B minor chord (we're largely in the key of D minor throughout the piece), which is more along the lines of modal interchange, a common harmonic device used since the 60ies in popular music. \n\nWould you say that musical devices that have been around for nearly 200 years and are still used to this very day across a wide variety of styles are \"experimental\"?\n\nIf I wasn't so busy working on our next project (which doesn't include aleatoric music, nor unusual harmony!), I'd be tempted to provide a full harmonic analysis of Kindred. Off the top of my head, every single note in this piece is justifiable from a music grammar standpoint (which is not to say that they sound good - just that they're part of the Western music vocabulary).\n\n\n\nAgain, **I'm not trying to sell you on the idea that you should like Kindred**, but the Morton Feldman reference was really far-fetched, and quite frankly, I wouldn't want our players to be led to thinking that we're just putting random notes on paper. \n\n\nThanks for voicing your concerns!\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2015-10-15T14:39:35.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nuclear Braum,realm=NA,application-id=aAJWt2b9,discussion-id=3u5TFhPm,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-15T02:57:16.050+0000)\nAnd you guys will slam the downvote button yelling &quot;But it&#039;s thematic and symbolic and so important for the champion design!&quot; because that&#039;s what you guys do.
