I never thought I'd see the day where Liftlift wouldn't get the vote, but this season doesn't seem too good for diversity. When TSM is dominating every fan vote and the fanboy fanbase grows more and more, there's not too much to expect.","replies":[{"poster":"Jelubi","date":"2015-03-27T16:30:17.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean Fanboy-ing TSM? One team will always have the most fans and in this case it is TSM. Also you didn't mention the part where TSM also has the most haters.\n\nThey are hated, cause they are a popular team, they are hated cause they had a bad history internationally and people thought other NA teams could have represented better but didn't have the chance. And they are hated because their players aren't exactly the coolest to watch, where as Doublelift, Aphromoo, Zionspartan, Lemonnation and Meteos etc.. are all more fun to watch. TSM plays really slowly, they dont close out games quickly and it makes people think that they are bad.\n\nBut at the end of the day TSM always proves to be the top of NA. Sometimes 1st, sometimes 2nd but always at the top. They are just a really good team, and if TSM fails internationally then so would have all the lower NA teams that didn't make it that far. Get used to how they play because it works, its not all about diving for every kill and having all of your lanes be \"star playmakers\" that can't decide who the Ace of the team is and thus fall apart in team fights (CLG). \n\nI like TSM, they feel like the main attraction of NA, they are the slow paced team that gets taken advantage of early game by a team of \"playmakers\". And because of their slow paced calm collected style they often find those comebacks that other fast paced slip-up teams just can't find. They make those comebacks that make you want to watch them because they aren't all trying to make flashy plays, they know their roles, Dyrus takes the hits, Lustboy finds the picks, Bjergsen gets the kills. And they rarely lose leads when ahead because they aren't always trying to rush a quick end to the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-03-26T04:01:34.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TSM is the best team that is why.  They beat CLG in head-to-head and twice.\n\nPeople go where the winners are.   Although DoubleLift *may* be the best ADC in game (even in SOloQ) the rest of his team is bad, and doesn't have the support to be absolute dominate.  Also CLG's Mid-laner isn't anywhere near TSM\"s midlane.\n\nIndeed CLG is very easy to bait in matches... case in point Dyrus/TSM top lane.  They focus on only one objective... forgetting everything else.  Smart teams play around this.\n\nIn summary... it is TSM's time.  If you want other teams to \"get the spotlight\" they just need to play better... simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-27T15:14:26.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Douchelift isn't even the best ADC NA. (And no Neither is Wildturtle).\n\nLift is carried by Aphromoo.\nWildturtle is carried by Lustboy.\n\nKEITH is best ADC NA (jk). If we go by game impact and not just points (stupid fantasy) the best is Apollo. Wildturtle and Cop both have better fantasy scores but they are less impact-ful to their team winning. Bjerg/Lust are the reason Turtle has such a good score. And SV/Keane are the reason Cop has a good score.\n\nNow when you look at TiP, if Apollo goes off, they just explode. XWX is another force, but from the bot lane, Apollo is the dominating force.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-03-26T10:04:21.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget how bad they are in teamfights.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PoisonedTea","date":"2015-03-26T10:39:07.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all-stars are not happening until after worlds.","replies":[]}]}
