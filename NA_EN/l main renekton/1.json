I felt like stealth wards weren't really impactful compared to the trinket upgrade, and it was kind of a money sink if you kept on buying stealth wards instead of just upgrading your trinket and never having to buy wards again.

Because of this, there will, overall, be less vision from new warding totem and more from sightstones.\n\nAlso, recently as an experiment, I've been taking the farsight alteration for my split pushers, because wards last infinitely, don't have a cap and it recharges at a similar rate to the previous upgraded trinket.","replies":[{"poster":"Westonbirt","date":"2015-11-12T07:14:54.816+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new trinket is pretty garbage.

With the current warding totem it starts at 60 second lifespan 180 recharge and goes up to 120 lifespan 120 second recharge. AKA worse at every stage in the game.\n\nCombined with the fact that you can no longer purchase sight wards people simply lost access to vision in season 6 unless you are buying a sight stone item variant. Once again warding is put mostly on the supports and now they can't even place more than 3. \n\nThe only real reason this could be happening is that Riot is making a conscious decision that there was to much vision control in League and are actively attempting to bring it down, this is alright and a choice about game health and all. But don't pretend that this is somehow an improvement to vision because people don't have to pay money for it anymore.

Though in reality it was probably a passive-aggressive move on their part.\n\nMaybe they figured people would appreciate wards more if they took them away?\n\nIn reality this is putting supports in a tough spot prone to receiving toxicity again.\n\nSightstone wards start off with 150 seconds (as opposed to the original 180. Again, why change this AND nerf the charges on sightstone?) which means a support rushing sightstone has much better wards than a bot lane that relies on their trinkets. Sightstone charges were changed from 4 to 3, meaning once you put out three wards you need to go back to recharge them otherwise you can't put out anymore.\n\nSo what does this mean for the support? Riot wants to think positively and say that it encourages other players to ward more. If you're with friends that care then that's certainly true, but for most solo queue players at average to lower levels (Bronze/Silver and probably Gold too)?? It means the support is still the only one warding AND their wards were nerfed AND the charges were nerfed AND they'll still be blamed for the lack of vision because--and I know this is hard for Riot to understand--_people still won't ward_.\n\nIt's nice that they did that big article about how people don't buy wards. The 60% of people who don't buy wards also don't put down wards in general. Did they wonder why? Let's go over the reasons.\n\n1. \"I don't have the gold!\" Well Riot tried to fix THAT for us.\n2. \"I forgot to upgrade my trinket!\" Okay Riot fixed that for us too, that's good.\n3. \"I don't care.\" Well that's...um...\n\nThe problem is that the majority of players who don't ward also _don't care enough_ to ward in the first place. They **don't** notice it, don't _care_, don't _want to_ and just simply **WON'T DO IT**.  This is something that RIOT CANNOT CHANGE.\n\nSo taking away wards from the few people who ACTUALLY DO CARE and ACTUALLY TRY TO WARD does not change the fact that a lot of people DON'T CARE. And those that don't are idiots, don't get me wrong. But we can't do ANYTHING about them. Trying to rewrite how the game works to force those people into doing something only hurts the players who _actually know what they're doing_.\n\nPhew okay I ranted sorry I'm done.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fatalitý","date":"2015-11-11T22:31:56.450+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't enjoy them is a little bit of sugar coating.
