When is the truth not toxic? When are we allowed to address the stupid mistakes our teammates are making? I have literally donated hundreds of dollars and countless hours into this game only to get banned when I explain to someone why they are ruining the game for me with their inexperience? I could have all the 20/5/20 matches in the world but if your own team refuses to correct their bad positioning or map awareness or even play with you, how can a win be coordinated? I can not wait until the day when league introduces 1v1 ranked, it will probably be the day after never. Tired of getting reported by snowflakes that haven&#039;t been playing since season 1, like me, and know next to nothing about the game. Can we please have a veterans Que? A Que where only accounts that participated in season 1 can play? A server for Veterans who don&#039;t want to deal with people on their teams not knowing what they should be doing and so vindictive when you correct them that they get you banned? I will be spending my automated technocratic 14 day ban critiquing the idea of people telling you the truth being toxic or verbally abusive. #TruthisAbusive","replies":[]}
