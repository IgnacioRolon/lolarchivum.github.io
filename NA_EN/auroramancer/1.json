Can we talk about her?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":144,"down_votes":9,"body":"TL;DR - There is no way to TL;DR this. I&#039;m going to be covering what Riot did to significantly change her, provide some context on those changes and how it negatively affected her, and comparing it to today&#039;s landscape. At the end, I have provided a summary as well as some proposed changes. \n\nRiot Balance Team, I hope you guys would be willing to work with us Elise fans to bring her back up to par again. As a former Elise main, particularly in Season 2 and pre-nerf Season 3, I enjoyed her primarily in the top lane, but I also played her in the jungle a few times. Let&#039;s recap some significant changes to her...\n\n-Rappel range reduction + Rappel mechanic change (explanation to come)\n-Cocoon stun duration change\n-Spiderling health reduction\n-Neurotoxin and Venomous Bite damage change\nAnd most recently...\n-Healing removed from Skittering Frenzy and added to passive spider form attacks\n\n_**Just to be clear, these changes were good during the time when Elise and Lee Sin were strongest in the jungle. In the current landscape of League, Elise has almost nothing to work with in terms of viability or not being outclassed**_. \n\nLet&#039;s cover some of the above points...\n\nReducing the health of spiderlings made them about useless during skirmishes and combat. _Even though_ they take reduced damage from AoE abilities, it is precisely AoE abilities that kill off spiderlings so easily. People don&#039;t even bother targeting them because they die too easily to the damage type that they are \"buffed\" to resist. \n**The underlying problem that Riot was trying to solve with reducing spiderling health was to nerf spiderling tanking the jungle. _What they should have done instead was keep spiderling health the same, but make them take increased damage from jungle monsters_**\n\nRappel&#039;s mechanic was changed because players had a fundamental misunderstanding of how it worked. Players thought that Elise could not land outside of her Rappel circle because they viewed the circle has her landing range, _as opposed to her targeting range_. So she could land on a target who is visually outside the circle because she targeted them while they were in the circle and the delay made it to where she landed on them outside the circle. \n**Because of this misunderstanding, Riot nerfed how far Elise can travel with Rappel. And then they nerfed the cast range of it. The problem with those nerfs is that Rappel only works on enemy targets, making escapes difficult but possible with a skilled Elise player, and gap closing was easier. _The top tier junglers right now (Rek&#039;sai, Gragas, Sejuani) have gap closers and dashes that are independent of targeting anything. So why does Rappel have to remain nerfed?_**\n\nNeurotoxin&#039;s %current HP damage was nerfed because Elise was able to \"chunk\" her victims during a gank. This hurt her solo laning in the top lane an incredible amount, as mostly bruisers and tanks were up there. But Riot decided to compensate her by increasing her Venomous Bite&#039;s damage. Too bad you can&#039;t make much use of that \"buff\" to Venomous Bite because Neurotoxin is dealing less damage to begin with, so her target does not have as much missing HP for Venomous Bite to benefit from. Riot also made it to where the execute damage cap on monsters will increase with rank.\n**Top tier junglers have %MAX HP dmg that is reliable to land during ganks. That %max HP damage of those junglers has a cap that is static through the spell ranks against jungle monsters, but Elise doesn&#039;t benefit from a static cap. _The damage shift to Venomous Bite really doesn&#039;t amount to much because of the damage nerf to Neurotoxin, and top tier junglers shove out Elise because of her scaling %missing hp cap against monsters, while they benefit from a static cap_**\n\nCocoon&#039;s stun duration was changed because Riot wanted her to have to rank up the stun duration. Which is alright, some champions have hard CC duration increase with rank too. But compared to top tier junglers like Gragas and Sejuani, whose hard CC durations do not change with rank, Elise falls behind in that category. And many top lane bruisers/tanks have hard CC that does not increase duration with rank either, so Elise is outclassed here. \n**Top tier junglers and top laners have hard CC duration that does not increase with rank, but Elise has to rank up for it. In addition, these junglers and top laners have damage tied to their hard CC, while Elise doesn&#039;t. _So double whammy for having to rank up a zero damage hard CC to get more duration out of it_** \n\nPotential counterargument about the Cocoon point is that it is a ranged hard CC, with a decent missile speed. I&#039;d make a rebuttal addressing how Gragas and Sejuani, top tier junglers, get to gap close AND stun/knockup with a single spell, while Elise has to use 3 spell casts in order to do the same thing. \n\nSkittering Frenzy&#039;s healing was removed, and instead placed onto her passive spider form attacks. There are several problems with this. You aren&#039;t able to appreciate the healing because it&#039;s so minuscule and spread out over time, instead of in an appreciable burst. It also forces you to stay in spider form for awhile to get some good healing, whereas before, you could max out spiderlings, use W and get a good burst of healing right away; so, you have to invest more time to get a decent amount of healing done. This also means that you can no longer let your spiderlings heal you when you are running away from a target;  you are required to attack that target yourself in order to benefit from the healing, which feels bad compared to before.\n**Elise&#039;s new healing mechanic is not appreciable, consumes more time to reap considerable benefit, and has removed healing from spiderling attacks only**\n\nRappel&#039;s damage boost to Spider Form attacks is near useless. When Elise&#039;s playstyle was optimized, you only used Rappel to stall out a duel/fight, chase down a fleeing target, or to jump to a jungle camp/enemy target for a tricky escape. And even then, the most optimal use-case for Rappel during duels/fights is to wait for your Venomous Bite or Human form cooldowns to time out a bit so you can fight again. If you&#039;re using it to chase down a fleeing target, at most, you can get off a Venomous Bite and that&#039;s it; you go back into human form for more spell combos. \n**The only real benefit to Rappel&#039;s damage/healing boost is for when she is Rappeling onto a jungle camp in Spider Form, _which is already not optimal because she starts out camps by casting Volatile Spiderling and using Neurotoxin on the large monster. Riot is discouraging her best combo order for jungle camps by encouraging starting camps with Rappel_**\n\n_**So to summarize, the reasons why Elise is really weak in the jungle and top lane is because:**_\n-She has to invest much more into her zero damage hard CC than other top tier junglers/bruisers/tanks have to\n-Her target-dependent escape/gap close was nerfed because of player misunderstanding, and is outclassed by target-independent gap closing junglers/bruisers/tanks\n-She has to invest more into monster execution damage cap compared to other junglers\n-Her most recent change to her healing is not appreciable, requires greater time investment, and removes some previous trick cases of skill\n-Rappel&#039;s damage boost is mostly useless, and even then, it&#039;s best case use is actually worse for her when it comes to jungling\n\n_**Easy for me to complain about these things. What would I propose to change about her to bring her up to par?**_\n-Standardize her Cocoon&#039;s stun duration again\n-Restore Rappel&#039;s cast-range again, but keep the drop-range limiting factor\n-Standardize her monster execution damage cap across all ranks of her Q, and up to par compared to other junglers with the same execution damage\n-Put her healing back onto Skittering Frenzy, reduce her base HP regen/growth stat\n-Put Rappel&#039;s damage boost onto Skittering Frenzy, not buffing her spiderlings damage output though\n-Increase spiderling health again, but make them take increased damage from jungle monsters\n\n_**What goals would the above changes work to achieve?**_\n-Bring Elise&#039;s gank potential/hard CC capabilities up to par compared to other junglers\n-Bring Elise&#039;s jungle monster execution/objective security up to par compared to other junglers\n-Re-establish some of Elise&#039;s former gap closing to then compete with other junglers who can gap close independently of another target unit\n-Make Elise&#039;s healing more appreciable and visible, without making her always topped off in HP wherever she goes\n-Apply her damage buff to a more logical/thematically sensible part of her kit\n-Make spiderlings relevant in fights again, without increasing their jungle tanking capabilities.\n\nThanks for reading","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-06-29T06:33:57.945+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll have to get back to you about Elise tomorrow once I've had a chance to get some thoughts from the balance team.

When you return, perhaps we can discuss further, depending on what's brought up. \n\nSome things I'd like to know from the balance side are:\n\n1.) We know that Elise is in a not-so-good place. Has the Balance team identified the _why_ of her current state? Not necessarily \"well we nerfed her a lot in the past\"; rather, \"these are the factors we feel are making Elise very weak right now\". \n\n2.) Is she so far gone that she will need a Gameplay Update in the future?\n\n3.) Is the Balance team dedicated to keeping Elise as a jungler and shoving down her solo lane potential, or are they attempting to preserve a jungle/solo lane potential with her?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-06-30T06:39:15.165+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Elise's power curve's been one of the big issues. Her E rank up's always been weak, which has led to a weak late game. Combine that with a really strong level 3 (something we see consistently from form swappers as a side note) and she can be extremely dominant early while falling off very sharply late.\n\nAnother issue is that her ability to provide pick potential from the jungle, without having put herself at risk (Cocoon), tends to be much more valuable in co-ordinated play than solo queue. That's made it hard in the past to find a balance point where she's 'viable' in solo queue without being oppressive in organized play.  \n\nSome form of gameplay update's certainly conceivable at some point, Elise does have some issues that it's proven difficult to address purely through balance changes. Very unlikely that'd be this year though even if we did conclude that was the appropriate course.\n\nWe feel Elise's kit's a natural fit for the jungle, so balancing around her presence there's the starting point. Wouldn't be opposed to seeing her in lane again if that both resulted in healthy play (so not just human Q spam) and didn't require she be massively overtuned as a jungler in order to be viable in a laning position. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Auroramancer","date":"2015-06-30T13:59:09.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding, these are great answers to the above questions; I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me/us. I did forget to ask another thing, _**what is the current state of her Spiderlings? Does the Balance team agree that they are too weak/easy to kill, and they would be too strong to buff in the jungle?**_\n\nI've also got some ideas to run by you, and maybe you or the Balance team can give your thoughts on these ideas, either individually or as a whole? (wall of text, sorry)\n\nSo Cocoon is identified as a problem area, particularly in competitive play, as well as her 3-spell power spike. I have a few grievances with how she feels to play right now, and maybe we can address these grievance areas to then allow some space to strip meaningful power from her in the problem areas listed above?\n\n**Grievances/feelsbadman**\n1.) If her Cocoon's stun is holding her back from power elsewhere, I'm willing to change the CC type on it to strip some power from it and give power to other places in her kit.\n2.) Skittering Frenzy feels very weak now with its healing mechanic stripped from it.\n3.) Venomous Bite's pseudo-channel time is a usability issue for me, it REALLY sucks to have the animation and sound go through to completion, but the target ducks into brush or I get hard CC'd and the damage doesn't apply (Venomous Bite doesn't go on CC though).\n4.) Her Rappel's drop location mechanic feels really bad. Because of the drop delay, her opponent has a large window of time to increase the gap, sometimes too far to where she can't use Venomous Bite to close the gap anymore. It has more to do with what location she drops to as opposed to the drop's delay time.\n\n**Proposed changes, TL;DR-**\n1.) Turn her Cocoon stun into a very high % slow (maybe decaying). Increased rank extends the decay duration like Lulu Glitterlance. To strip power off Cocoon while preserving a core part of \"I want to immobilize my opponents to close in\" as opposed to fully stun them. \n2.) Move Rappel cast combat bonuses onto Skittering Frenzy. To help Skittering Frenzy feel better and give it a feel similar to Olaf's Vicious Strikes for brief, in-combat bonuses. \n3.) Make her Neurotoxin %current HP damage increase with rank (maybe up to current values?). To then remove the _scaling_ %missing HP cap against monsters on Venomous Bite, and remove the brief pseudo-channel cast on Venomous Bite. \n4.) Have Rappel drop Elise on her target's current location on drop, not their location when she cast the spell. If we move Rappel's combat bonuses to Skittering Frenzy, I feel we can add this power back to Rappel without changing its range. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Context-**\n\nI'm glad that we're able to identify Cocoon as one of her issues. I can say from extensive experience, I use her Cocoon for the sake of immobilizing my opponents. Sometimes I use it for the stun, and interrupting enemy spell channels is very clutch, but seldom. I'd have to estimate that I use Cocoon offensively and defensively for the sake of _immobilizing_ my opponent, about 80% of the time. \n\nSo because her pick potential is so strong in organized play, and I can assume that most solo queue/non-competitive Elise players also use their Cocoons primarily for immobilizing (this is probably different for competitive play), _**perhaps we can change her Cocoon's effect to a very high % slow (90~%)**_? I wouldn't mind if the slow decayed either, and as the duration increases with rank, then the decay time extends (kind of like Lulu's Glitterlance). I'd be willing to have Cocoon's power stripped in this way so that she can get some power in other parts of her kit. \n\n_**Also, how feasible would it be to move Rappel's combat bonus/steroid onto her Skittering Frenzy?**_ IMO, Rappel's combat bonus/steroid feels bad to use, and placing this bonus/steroid onto her Skittering Frenzy would help with the feel of \"this is my healing spell, and it boosts all of my melee combat factors for a brief period\". It'll give her a kind of Olaf's Vicious Strikes feel, where you have a brief period of time to stay in combat and heal up or dish out extra damage. \n\nRegarding her Q, maybe we could make Neurotoxin have it's %current HP damage also rank up? _**In exchange, remove the scaling damage cap on Venomous Bite against monsters, and also remove the brief \"channel\" time on Venomous Bite?**_ The biggest thing for me is the pseudo-channel time on Venomous Bite, I've missed out on so many kills when an enemy ducks into a brush or I get interrupted; the damage doesn't go through, but the animation and sound still play to completion. \n\nNot much to say about Rappel's drop mechanic. I'm still convinced that the drop-location change was due to a misunderstanding on the part of Elise's enemies, and it feels really bad to drop to where your target was ~0.75 seconds ago, outside of Venomous Bite's range. I didn't think the drop mechanic was overpowered before, and it just feels bad to use because of the inevitable thought in the back of my mind \"if I use this, they're still going to be out of range anyway, why bother using it\". \n\nThanks again Meddler!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chairs","date":"2015-06-29T08:14:19.018+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am of the strong opinion that a Sheen item is not good on her.

The AP is negligible and she's never had problems with mana sustain in the jungle anyway. I think that Cinderhulk is a better item for her, the extra HP's just better than the small amount of extra damage that you get on Runeglaive, although I think Devourer in its PBE state is better than both.\n\nI think she needs real kit buffs, the last changes weren't buffs, they just shifted some power around on the kit. Her sustain is lower than it was before, 4/6/8/10 base heal per attack is just a joke and 10% of her AP isn't much better, you need 400 AP to get a 50 HP heal on auto, which just makes you way too squishy. \n\nI'd prefer the old heal to what she has now, 4+4% is better assuming you have at least two spiders. Even with the E bonus healing it's still weaker than the old 5 spider healing which gave 24+24% heal per hit compared to 20+20% with her current heal. \n\nHer heal was ninja nerfed right before she was released from the PBE, on the PBE she had a heal value of 5/10/15/20 + 15%. I don't understand why it was decided to hold back so much on Elise's buffs. She clearly needs help and you guys just went against actually helping her.","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-06-29T13:28:18.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't like the idea of the new devourer on Elise as it gives no really good combat stats on her when you buy it. You also have to invest very heavily in the item to get the most out of it. You would end up being a melee dps squishy carry by lategame (if you can make it to that point because it will take you 25 minutes of farming to get to the point where you can actually make an impact). It really doesn't cater to Elise's ability to create pressure early as she doesn't get offensive stats that heavily benefit her. The Sated state of the Devourer isn't very strong until Elise has a meaningful amount of AP and Nashors Tooth to make the passive on Sated strong enough to warrant having it over either Cinderhulk OR Runeglaive. \n\nRight now I feel the best item for Elise is Cinderhulk. Getting Liandry's, Rylai's, Abyssal, Void Staff, or even IBG (possibly Zhonya's) as possible offensive items. Get one or two of these items and build tank for the rest of your items. Some of these items are getting buffed next patch so we will see if this helps her at all. Runeglaive does give her a little bit extra burst in the early game, but it doesn't really help her beyond that point. It really makes her kit front loaded as you are trying to get a lot of burst damage out quickly, but it doesn't help you in the more sustained fights in the later parts of the game as you have less AP than if you bought a Liandry's, and you have less defensive stats to keep you in the fight for another round of Sheen procs. That along with the lack of burst healing from her spiderlings make her MUCH squishier in a fight than if built tankier with Cinderhulk. \n\nThe old heal values on the PBE 5/10/15/20 on hit were probably making her much too sustain heavy in the jungle (WW level) and that along with her E bonus would have made for a really tanky spider in a fight with 40 +.3 AP on hit probably hitting 80 hp each hit by late game if she jumps into a fight with a tanky build. However, I think these changes would have been really strong on her and would probably not be game breaking as she STILL clears the jungle at full health so that wouldn't change, and she simply gets run over by tanks right now and this would at least put her closer to par with them when playing as a tank for her team. Right now, the only thing that her new heal is good for is sustaining in the jungle. It really doesn't help her in the span of a fight that is shorter than 12 seconds of her auto attacking. \n\nTLDR: Devourer won't be very good on her despite her having an on hit effect in her kit; Runeglaive isn't that good on her (or is it just Runeglaive?); her healing isn't great right now when compared to her old heal, except for clearing the jungle healthy (which she really didn't need help in).","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-06-29T13:58:33.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I really don't like the idea of the new devourer on Elise as it gives no really good combat stats on her when you buy it.\n\nIt does give an effective boost to combat, 30 on-hit magic damage is effectively 100 AP worth of damage on her ult that doubles up to 200 AP's worth, obviously it's not the equivalent to 100 AP overall, but I'd say it's at least comparable to Runeglaive. One other thing that most people don't consider is that it allows you to use your human form AAs for something. \n\n>You would end up being a melee dps squishy carry by lategame\n\nIf you go for a Nashors/Deathcap build with it you will, there's nothing that says you have to do that though.

Since you get stacks on kills/assists and get +5 whenever you take Drag/Baron you wind up stacking it just by doing whatever you'd normally do anyway. Also 25 minutes is a hella long time to get 30 stacks power farming, if you do power farm you can get them in about 17-20 minutes, 17 with a drag, 20 without.

Elise has very poor health already so you will end up with around 2600 HP or 2800 with HP/lvl seals, 150 armor, and 110 magic resist with no CDR. I would hardly call that bulky for a full build (my current tankier Elise build is 4000 health 250 armor and 110 magic resist with 30%+ CDR for the same price and that is barely enough to keep you alive in the lategame). In addition, what would be your build order with this build. Are you going to rush your Wits End and Liandry's to make the most out of your DPS when you complete Sated devourer, or do you work on your defensive item(s) to make sure you can survive a fight?

If you do not succeed in your early ganks, you are going to be very weak when teamfights start as ALL you will have is some damage on hit and a 1.25 second stun to contribute as you will have nothing behind your Q or W in terms of bonus damage.

This pretty much assures that you will either have to power farm or fall behind and you will still be lacking in combat ability. \n\nAlso if the opposing jungler/team KNOWS you are building devourer they are just going to take control of your jungle as you will not be able to defend yourself when they invade.

Yes, you can probably get more damage from going the Devourer route than getting another jungling item, but because you are hurting your strongest point in the game as Elise, you will probably not do well with that glass cannon-ish build unless your team is already winning the 4v5 handily. Elise needs to be effective early if she is going to do well, and Devourer does not help her excel in that area.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-06-30T04:43:39.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue that by the time you actually complete a jungle item as Elise you're already starting to fall off.

But yes, this build is squishier than Cinderhulk, it also outputs around 3x as much DPS. I think personally I'll take that trade, Elise isn't Sejuani, she doesn't get more powerful by just stacking tons of durability.\n\n>Are you going to rush your Wits End and Liandry's to make the most out of your DPS when you complete Sated devourer\n\nBasically.

Most champions outside of Veigar and Cass take a FULL build with the NEW items to get 1k AP. You'd need closer to 30% for it to be noticeable at any point of the game. Mid game, a mage usually has 1.5kish health and 400 AP. You'd be doing 180+70% AP and about 120 extra damage, totaling 300+70% AP. Say you have 400 as well, that would mean you have 580 base damage. Comparatively, 400 AP on, say,  Morde's E who has the same CD on it, but a slightly smaller width and no slow, but about the same concept there, does 250+60% AP, doing 490 base, mainly because it base is 70 higher.\n\nI should probably also note that while his E has the stack requirement, it does have a 6s CD and in a team fight, you usually have the stacks before you have the ability ready to be casted because of the CD. \n\nOverall! His 9s CD E would be best suited since it's the longest CD and is used last in his combo, more of a finisher ability as well as to gain mana back after using your combo.

What they should have done instead was keep spiderling health the same, but make them take increased damage from jungle monsters**\n\nThey did nerf it quite hard, but the spiderlings were next to unkillable back then. After that nerf, they did bring their health back up some, and I'm not particularly sad about where it is. Elise is opportunistic, and if her spiderlings are crushed that quickly, that gank wasn't meant to be anyway.\n\n>**Because of this misunderstanding, Riot nerfed how far Elise can travel with Rappel. And then they nerfed the cast range of it. The problem with those nerfs is that Rappel only works on enemy targets, making escapes difficult but possible with a skilled Elise player, and gap closing was easier. The top tier junglers right now (Rek'sai, Gragas, Sejuani) have gap closers and dashes that are independent of targeting anything. So why does Rappel have to remain nerfed?**\n\nGenerally good point, but it's 1/6 of her kit (or less), and she gets invuln out of it. I think Rappel is fair, too.\n\n>**Top tier junglers have %MAX HP dmg that is reliable to land during ganks. That %max HP damage of those junglers has a cap that is static through the spell ranks against jungle monsters, but Elise doesn't benefit from a static cap. The damage shift to Venomous Bite really doesn't amount to much because of the damage nerf to Neurotoxin, and top tier junglers shove out Elise because of her scaling %missing hp cap against monsters, while they benefit from a static cap**\n\nHonestly, another good point, and I'd be on board with it once again if she didn't already have a plus clear.\n\n>**Top tier junglers and top laners have hard CC duration that does not increase with rank, but Elise has to rank up for it. In addition, these junglers and top laners have damage tied to their hard CC, while Elise doesn't. So double whammy for having to rank up a zero damage hard CC to get more duration out of it**\n\nExcellent point. Her CC is tremendously bad for someone as reliant on burst as she is, but she shouldn't be anywhere near the crazy utility freak that Ekko is. I personally think her stun should be changed into a stun-into-slow or a slow-into-stun so that it can extend the CC duration to something that may finish the kill (plus a slow-into-stun can give a window of time for her to transform back into Spider Form). I'm also on board for her CC changing in some greater way. Linear skillshot CC like that tends to be more defensive than offensive, as it's far easier to hit a chasing target, and then suddenly Elise is OP for being untouchable when all we wanted to do was give her a sniping window.\n\n>**Elise's new healing mechanic is not appreciable, consumes more time to reap considerable benefit, and has removed healing from spiderling attacks only**\n\nI really hope Riot's regretting that decision by now...\n\n>**The only real benefit to Rappel's damage/healing boost is for when she is Rappeling onto a jungle camp in Spider Form, which is already not optimal because she starts out camps by casting Volatile Spiderling and using Neurotoxin on the large monster. Riot is discouraging her best combo order for jungle camps by encouraging starting camps with Rappel**\n\nAside from that, it's bugged (and been bugged for a patch or so) to where Spiderlings don't attack during that exact same duration (though less time). You'd think a playtest would clear up that little problem. But yeah, very sub-optimal buff, especially for a champion who has issues hitting her targets through CC and instant mobility in the first place.\n\n>**Easy for me to complain about these things. What would I propose to change about her to bring her up to par?\n-Standardize her Cocoon's stun duration again.** *I find it's an underwhelming enough point. Not a terrible idea, though.*\n**-Restore Rappel's cast-range again, but keep the drop-range limiting factor.** *I think old range was too much. Maybe a little bigger wouldn't hurt, but the darn thing appeared to nearly be a global at times.*\n**-Standardize her monster execution damage cap across all ranks of her Q, and up to par compared to other junglers with the same execution damage.** *Again, the power is already in her kit to jungle, I don't see that part of her kit needing help.*\n**-Put her healing back onto Skittering Frenzy, reduce her base HP regen/growth stat.** *She does need her sustain back. She already has to build tank, damage, and movement speed in order to be sub-optimal, but if she needs to rely on items for sustain, she can't work with that much dependence.*\n**-Put Rappel's damage boost onto Skittering Frenzy, not buffing her spiderlings damage output though.** *Far more logical location*\n**-Increase spiderling health again, but make them take increased damage from jungle monsters.** *I don't think this one is necessary... I actually like where her spiderling utility lies, and save Ravenous Hydras being all too common, it's really not that easy to kill them.*\n\nSo yeah. Some good points, but she doesn't need a complete revert from season 3. Season 3 taught us that she has to have sub-par skills to make her viable and healthy, and then whittle away with those skills. That's generally the transform vision, actually, as these champs get two kits in one, and the key is interacting well together.
