None of this whole controversy was about personally attacking DZK or getting him fired/making him leave the company. It was about denouncing a sexist employee&#039;s public statements, and he dug his own grave when he retweeted that the male playerbase should kill themselves. Even though I strongly believe that someone&#039;s spoken statements are strong reflections of their core ideals and attitudes, I don&#039;t want to project DZK&#039;s inflammatory statements onto his ENTIRE character and past history. I&#039;ve had times where I&#039;ve worked myself into leadership/authority positions, did well for a long time, had a moment of overreach/misuse of that power, and I had my position revoked. The one moment doesn&#039;t invalidate my entire past. \n\nSo when you guys see Rioters sending sentiments and reluctant farewells to DZK, remember that he is a human. Who has co-workers, friends, and family (literal and figurative) that care about him. His recent behavior should be denounced, but it probably doesn&#039;t comprise his entire past, and those who are personally familiar with him probably know him as someone different than we do. That said, don&#039;t harass or target other Rioters for their farewells to him.\n\nI didn&#039;t even want him to be fired or leave. Yes, he did violate company policy and was regressing Riot&#039;s new cultural points, but I would have rather he recognized what he said, apologized, and enrolled in some inclusivity/anti-bias training. That didn&#039;t happen. So whatever. \n\n#Regarding Riot\n\nRiot still needs to answer us. We already know what happened to DZK, so we shouldn&#039;t demand that they tell US what happened to him and other Rioters. \n\n#We need clarification on where Riot stands in all of this.\n* They say they want to re-evaluate what &quot;meritocracy&quot; means. _**How is their definition of meritocracy going to differ from the actual definition?**_\n* Do they see the exclusion of men _**as necessary for**_ the empowerment of non-men?\n* Do they recognize that they can empower non-men _**without**_ excluding men?\n* Do they recognize how _**demeaning**_ it is TO NON-MEN to segregate them from men _**in professional/career-related environments**_?\n* Do they enforce the _**actual definitions**_ of sexism, racism, and other discrimination-based words in their culture, or do they adhere to the _**faux-definitions**_ created by far left-leaning bigots? \n\n#Riot wants to be a leader in culture and inclusivity. PAX was an example of going forwards in some ways, backwards in other ways\n\nThe playerbase needs answers on these kinds of questions, and comments on Riot&#039;s stance toward remarks put forward by DZK. \n\n_**The only information we should be asking Riot for with regard to DZK is their stance on his remarks. NOT comments about DZK&#039;s character, or his position with the company, or the recent circumstances with the company. **_","replies":[]}
