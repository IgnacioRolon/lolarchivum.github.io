When Shifting Sands is cast in this \"deadzone\", Azir automatically dashes to the nearest \"active\" soldier (this does imply a soldier count greater than one). Shifting Sands will not go on cooldown when this occurs. \n\nThe deadzone is slightly smaller than a semi-circle, with the same radius as the soldier's attack radius, and is aligned in such a way that its tangent forms a right-angle with the tether that Azir maintains with the soldier. In this way, the deadzone is always facing toward Azir. ***Attached to this post is a crude visual representation of this 'deadzone'.*** \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Incident with 1 soldier:** When Shifting Sands is cast in this deadzone while the soldier is outside of the cast range, Azir will not move toward the soldier until its body is in cast range. Instead, Azir will either stand still or stutter step one time. \n\nRepro steps:\n1.) Cast Arise! to place a soldier\n2.) Walk away from the soldier so that the soldier's body is outside of the cast range of Shifting Sands, but not so far that the soldier disappears\n3.) Cast Shifting Sands into the 'deadzone' as shown in the attached 'leaguebug2.jpg' picture\n4.) Watch Azir either take no action at all, or stutter\n\nThis is demonstrated in the video provided here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faQpbBoXCk4\nFirst action test shows the incident with 1 soldier. Second action test shows the appropriate action without incident. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Incident with 2 soldiers:** Suppose two soldiers are out on the field. 'Soldier 1' is in the cast range of Shifting Sands, but 'Soldier 2' is not in the cast range of Shifting Sands. 'Soldier 2' has the deadzone within his attack radius. If Azir casts Shifting Sands in the deadzone of 'Soldier 2', Azir will automatically dash to 'Soldier 1'. If 'Soldier 1' is either out of the cast range as well, or is inactive, Azir will dash to neither soldier and will stutter forward one time.\n\nRepro steps:\n1.) Cast Arise twice, spacing out the soldiers a fair amount\n2.) Position yourself in such a way that one soldier's body is in the cast range of Shifting Sands, but the other is not \n3.) Cast Shifting Sands in the 'deadzone' of the soldier who is outside of the cast range\n4.) Watch Azir dash toward the soldier that is in the cast range\n\nThis is demonstrated in the video provided here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo8w9JQXoyY\nFirst action test shows the incident with 2 soldiers. Second action test shows the appropriate action without incident.\n\nIf both 'Soldier 1' and 'Soldier 2' are outside of the cast range of Shifting Sands (therefore, both have a deadzone), when casting in the deadzone of either one, Azir will stutter toward the nearest of the two without actually dashing. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Incident with 3 soldiers (1/2):** Suppose three soldiers are out on the field. 'Soldier 3' will be standing outside of the cast range of Shifting Sands, but 'Soldiers 1+2' are in the cast range. 'Soldier 3' will have the deadzone in his attack radius. If Azir casts Shifting Sands in the deadzone of 'Soldier 3', Azir will only stutter forward.\n\nRepro steps:\n1.) Cast Arise three times, spacing out the soldiers a fair amount\n2.) Position yourself in such a way that two soldiers' body is in the cast range of Shifting Sands, but the body of the third soldier is not\n3.) Cast Shifting Sands in the 'deadzone' of the soldier who is outside of the cast range\n4.) Watch Azir stutter and not do anything else\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Incident with 3 soldiers (2/2):** Suppose three soldiers are out on the field. 'Soldier 3' will be standing outside of the cast range of Shifting Sands, 'Soldier 2' is inactive (but slightly closer to Azir than 'Soldier 3' is), and 'Soldier 1' is active. 'Soldier 3' will have the deadzone in his attack radius. If Azir casts Shifting Sands in the deadzone of 'Soldier 3', Azir will dash to 'Soldier 1', who is active.\n\nRepro steps:\n1.) Cast Arise three times, spacing out the soldiers a fair amount\n2.) Position yourself in such a way that two soldiers' body are outside the cast range of Shifting Sands, but the body of the third soldier is inside\n3.) Cast Shifting Sands in the 'deadzone' of the furthest soldier who is outside of the cast range\n4.) Watch Azir dash to the active soldier instead\n\nThe difference between these 2 instances with 3 soldiers is that Azir's behavior changes depending on how many active soldiers are out. When 3 soldiers are out and you cast Shifting Sands in the deadzone of the furthest soldier:\n1 active soldier = Azir will dash to that active soldier\n2 active soldiers = Azir will stutter and do nothing else\n3 inactive soldiers = Azir will stutter and do nothing else\n\nThe video provided here shows the incident with 3 soldiers when 2 are active: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXJGuXD7wJI\nFirst action test shows the incident when casting Shifting Sands in the deadzone. Second action test shows the appropriate action without incident.\n\nI currently do not have video of the incident with 3 soldiers when only 1 is active, as the custom game ended when I was in the middle of recording this instance and didn't capture the incident. I'll add the video when I get the chance to do another custom with Azir.\n\nLet me know if additional information is needed regarding this bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-24T02:52:47.131+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.
