{"poster":"Auroramancer","date":"2015-07-06T13:43:43.030+0000","title":"Why I'm losing interest in League after more than 5 years of playing","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":317,"down_votes":13,"body":"The point of this thread is because I saw a Rioter post on the forums, saying \"I'm interested to know what causes long-time players to lose interest in the game\", so this post is an answer to that. It is purely a feedback post for Riot, and maybe some other players can attest to the things I'm seeing here.\n\nSome background for myself, I started in late January 2010, right around when Mordekaiser was the newest champion, and I&#039;ve been playing pretty religiously since then, except for the past 2 months. I placed in Silver tier in Season 1 when we were still on the ELO system, and I&#039;ve hit Diamond for Seasons 4 and 5. \n\n**I want to start off with some things that Riot has been good at:**\n-Identifying good in-game balance issues and concepts\n-In--game clarity+art is awesome, better than all the other MOBAs I&#039;ve tried\n-I&#039;ve seen the company grow and learn from its mistakes\n-eSports scene is great\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Here are some of the things that are causing me to lose interest in League right now (here is your TL;DR):**\n-Lack of lore development\n-Lack of company transparency and adequate player interaction\n-Lack of/slow relaunch of Tribunal; Player Behavior feedback issues\n-Poor Player Support communications\n-Lack of compensation for unfair ranked matches\n-Lack of item diversity\n-Slow champion release cadence\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_**Lack of lore development**_\nI greatly enjoyed the lore of League. When I first started on the game, I would immerse myself into the lore of the existing champions. I got to learn what the champion was about, and learn about their background; that was awesome. The Journal of Justice and League Judgments were great supplements that gave the champions even more depth and kept me hooked on their story.\n\nThen the massive retcon happened. Let me be clear, I don&#039;t mind the retcon. What I do mind though, is the void that&#039;s now left. What am I to believe about the champions now? Now that the Institute of War is no more, what are my champions like? WHO ARE THEY?\n**I am starving to know more about the champions that I play**. It feels strange to play them without them having the backstory that I learned while meeting them\n\nSo with that said, there hasn&#039;t been on-going lore development for champions beyond their release lore as a follow-up. I&#039;ve read posts from the lore team saying \"_we have a lot of things ready, and we&#039;re so excited to show them to you guys! But we&#039;re also waiting on some specific tech in order to get started_\". I sort of understand that, but not really. How come the lore department didn&#039;t make sure that the tech was ready to go BEFORE retconning everything?\n\nWhy was the lore retconned and changed so drastically BEFORE the replacement/upgrade was ready to go out? It&#039;s been way too long for the Foundations Team to get stuff out to us players. I feel a bit cheated in this way, that I&#039;ve lost the identities of the champions that I&#039;m playing. I feel like I&#039;m just playing with hollow bodies now.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_**Lack of company transparency and adequate player interaction**_\nRiot has been kind of on-and-off with player interaction and how transparent the company is on certain things. I remember one instance of good transparency was with the Fnatic scandal not too long ago, involving the coding of Recall and Homeguard enchanted Boots. The published article addressed what was at hand, Riot took accountability for the issue, and didn&#039;t beat around the bush. Excellent!\n\nWhat&#039;s been bothering me lately has been transparency issues on terms of Game/Champion Balance and forum posting. When Riot says that the company goal is \"to be the most player-oriented/focused company in the world\", I expect frequent interaction with players on the forums that is meaningful. It&#039;s great to see Rioters have fun with players on the forums.But it grieves me to see players have some outcry on the forums, and have it go unanswered. \n\nThere is a difference between responding to players in a generic way, and responding to players in a meaningful way that directly acknowledges and addresses their concerns. It&#039;s one thing to say \"_we are aware of what you are saying, even if we aren&#039;t posting_\". It&#039;s another thing to actually post frequently, acknowledge the particular outcry/problem DIRECTLY (not vaguely or in a general way), and communicate what is being done, beyond just \"_we are working on this as best as we can :)))) _\" Players WANT to know what you&#039;re going to do about things, not just that \"we&#039;re working on it\". And there is a way to go about that, without divulging company secrets/spoilers. \n\nAn example: some threads about Sightstone enchantments. Even if the Gameplay Team has zero plans for Sightstone enchants, at least send a Rioter in to say exactly that, \"_we don&#039;t have any plans for Sightstone enchants, but we do feel there is room for specializing the item in the future_\". However, if you you aren&#039;t able to adequately respond to the issue, then at least acknowledge the concern with something like \"_Hey, we are aware of how you guys feel about this issue, and we feel the same way. We have several ideas floating up in the air, but we haven&#039;t decided on one yet. I can&#039;t reveal exactly what ideas we have in store, but I can assure you that we&#039;ll eventually arrive at something_\". THAT would be great communication and transparency on something that can&#039;t be spoiled!\n\nAnother grievance I had was the lack of communication on the Veigar/Cassiopeia changes compared to the rejected Lee Sin changes. Lee Sin changes were put on the PBE quite a while ago, and great community backlash was stirred, and SO THE CHANGES WERE PULLED. But when Veigar/Cassiopeia changes were put up, and the community lashed against it, Riot was silent to respond to players about it, and the silence rang this sort of \"_we&#039;re going through with this whether you like it or not. We&#039;ll only discuss with you players within the scope of what we are reworking here, not whether the rework should happen or not. Deal with it. Read up in the future patch notes_\". Such a poor time of player communication.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_**Lack of/slow relaunch of Tribunal; Player Behavior feedback issues**_\nAgain, this comes back to the idea of pulling down a system BEFORE a replacement/upgrade is ready. I don&#039;t understand why the Tribunal had to be taken down, as opposed to developing the upgrade on the side (ahem, transparency). I like that some of the systems are now automatic, and I understand that there has been a lot of \"machine-learning\" for these Player Behavior Systems, but again, transparency on progress has been minimal. Would love to see a checklist of things that are going into the new Tribunal, something akin to \"_Automatic LeaverBuster/chat banning: Completed! Team Builder Draft: In Progress_\", etc.\n\nPlayer Behavior feedback progress has been very slow. Seemed like the gap between the release of the Tribunal and having in-client feedback telling a player that their reports got a player banned, was TOO LONG. It&#039;s taken so long to get things going for this, given the supposed resources that Riot has accumulated over the last 5 years. I&#039;d like to be able to view a history of the players that have been banned by my reports, such as looking back at the particular report I sent in, and seeing chat logs of the game involved, just to jar my memory and to remember how toxic that individual was.\n\nBut also, as the forums have shown over time, that feedback for punished players has been poor, which leads into my next point...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_**Poor Player Support communications**_\nMy biggest grievance with Player Support is that punished players do not automatically receive chat logs for their punishments. Instead, they have to send in a ticket through Player Support, where they are greeted by uniquely named bots that send out generic messages.\n\nI was punished at some point, I believe about a year ago, and I had to send in a Player Support ticket for my chat logs. I was met with the bot SlumberJack, and was given the same generic copy-paste response to Player Punishment tickets, SEVEN TIMES OVER SEVEN DIFFERENT TICKETS. My two-week ban has ended by the time a real Player Support Specialist got to me to give me my chat logs.\n\nIt was deplorable that it took over two weeks and seven different support tickets to be able to talk to a real person and get my chat logs. And that is one of the biggest slaps in the face to a player. **The company that claims to want to be the most player-oriented/focused company in the world, has Player Support primarily operated by bots, who give out generic copy/paste responses, instead of consistently having actual Player Support Specialists writing out unique responses to address the various kinds of tickets from the playerbase**. It really makes a player feel bad, and I totally sympathize with the rage threads on the forums where players say \"Player Support is useless, they&#039;re just bots\", because it really does happen.\n\nAnd then this tackles something of product-consistency across the company. I understand that generic ticket responses from bots helps to \"blanket-answer\" many tickets that are sent in, but it&#039;s not a perfect solution. Tribunal wasn&#039;t a perfect solution either, and it&#039;s being upgraded now. So we have cases of Riot implementing products that are not perfect solutions, but then failing to release any solution at all for other issues. Which leads me to the next point...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_**Lack of compensation for unfair ranked matches**_\nThis topic is very important; not only is it a whole new topic on its own, but it also touches on company transparency. There have been countless suggestions for compensation in ranked games in which a player disconnects: Mercy, Leaver LP loss, LP loss reductions, etc.\n\nWhat I fail to wrap my head around is, when players are making hot forum threads about these topics, why is there radio silence from Riot in those threads? What is so hard for a Rioter to say \"This is a great idea, but there are several ramifications that we don&#039;t enjoy, and thus, are preventing us from fully implementing something like this\"? Like, at least acknowledge your player base! Acknowledge that they are trying to help solve a problem, and give a meaningful response on the matter. \n\nI know many things aren&#039;t going to be a perfect solution to the issue of ranked leavers either. And that&#039;s okay, _**we don&#039;t need a perfect solution**_. Sometimes a temporary band-aid will suffice until a better solution comes around, like how the first Tribunal was imperfect and is being upgraded to something better. Your playerbase doesn&#039;t need perfect solutions, but what matters is an effort of transparency on these issues, trying a good (but maybe imperfect) solution, and communicating what you think would be a better solution and how you&#039;re working towards it. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_**Lack of item diversity**_\nI see a lot of threads on the forums about \"why does &#039;X&#039; item have to be reworked? Why not keep BOTH?\". I have to partially agree with them too. I understand that some items are just obsolete or don&#039;t fulfill the intended fantasy for the target champions, but I believe there is too much time spent on reworking/removing items instead of creating new items.\n\nAnd it&#039;s true, we have had more items reworked/removed than added. The item pool feels stale.\n\nWhat if I want a Health+Armor item? Only TWO options: Randuin&#039;s Omen and Sunfire Cape...\nWhat if I want a Health+MR item? Only THREE options: Banshee&#039;s Veil, Spirit Visage, and Aegis of the Legion (not counting Locket of the Iron Solari as unique, because it&#039;s nearly a required upgrade for Aegis anyhow)\n\nLet&#039;s just admit it, item diversity is stale for non-supports/junglers. The options for certain stat combos is sorrowfully low, and it makes for repetitious games and item builds. The replay value of the game decreases substantially when item diversity is stagnant.\n\nAnd while we&#039;re on the topic of in-game products, how about tooltip consistency?! One of my greatest pet peeves is insufficient explanatory information. Other MOBAs suffer from this as well, so when clarity is one of Riot&#039;s primary company philosophies, I hold League to a higher standard than other MOBAs. What I mean by tooltip consistency is, when you look at different champions&#039; spells and kits, the formatting for their tooltip varies even though some should convey similar information. One example is Syndra, whose Q and W tooltip explicitly states \"_can be cast while moving_\". Other champions have spells that can be cast while moving, but I haven&#039;t seen that in their tooltips! Little features like those. \n\nStandardize your tooltip formatting for in-game things, clean them up, and take a player suggestion that was popular on the forums: toggle advanced tooltips. Yeah, if you standardize all tooltips, they may get a bit overcrowded, so implement \"toggle advanced tooltips\" and see how well it works. Detail-oriented players like me sure will enjoy that!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_**Slow champion release cadence**_\nI can appreciate a slower champion release cadence, contrasting the period of Talon/Riven where a new champion came out every 2 weeks, and they had such stale features for their kits. But after that time, the cadence has slowed down a LOT.\n\nThe releases that really stuck out to me, as far as cadence goes, was Jinx->Yasuo->Vel&#039;koz->Braum->Gnar, who had nearly 3 month gaps between them, and Rek&#039;Sai->Bard, which was over a 3 month gap. A LONG time to wait for new champions. And I&#039;ll be honest, I feel very unsatisfied with how long we waited for Ekko: 2.5 months. I liked the _Seconds_ trailer a lot, but Ekko in-game is honestly just a mobile gadgeteer...BORING. Out of the last 10 champions released, Ekko is by far my least favorite, but the other 9 are fantastically made. I&#039;m glad that Champion Design is taking their time to make great champions, but I think a bit TOO much time is being spent on them.\n\nAnd since we touched on the topics of champion release cadence and company transparency, let&#039;s go to champion relaunches. Lemme just say, most of the champion relaunches have been successful and great. You know what would be really cool though? Having a timeline/progress bar for champions being relaunched. Identify key things for a champion like \"Ideation\", \"Backstory\", \"Gameplay Kit design\", \"Art assets\", and \"Bugfixing\", then show on the progress bar what has been finished and what hasn&#039;t. This gives older players something nice to look forward to, seeing older champions getting updated/relaunched and we know EXACTLY where they are at presently while getting excited over new progress!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHopefully, Riot, you take these thoughts of mine to heart, as I have been a loyal player/consumer through the years. Maybe we can have a discussion about this.

I haven't been playing for nearly as long as you and still enjoy this game quite a bit.  I actually started playing Starcraft II around the time you started playing League and went through a similar experience to your own in early 2014, which was when I started up League.  I got sick of the SC2 developers in particular, noted their lack of community interaction and unwillingness to fix the obvious and major problems with the game.  Just lost all faith in Blizzard completely, tbh.  I won't even touch a Blizzard game anymore and that holds true today.\n\nI think part of your issue is that when you get really involved in a game and start to love it, play it super competitively, and follow it daily you start to hold higher expectations for it.  As a casual league player I can step back and note all the issues with the game, but I'm able to overlook the shortcomings because I recognize that it's just a fun hobby for me.  In SC2 I sort of went off the deep end competitively, was highly ranked master league and just got way too immersed in the game and it backfired because I started to realize that I couldn't put up with all the shortcomings for the game and its developers.\n\nSince then I've been able to take a step back and appreciate games in general for what they offer, rather than what they're lacking.  Though I still think Blizzard is an overhyped company that has insulted the intelligence of gamers with their releases since 2008, and it's only getting worse if you look at Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch compared to LoL/DoTA and CS:GO.  And then there's Diablo 3.... blech. \n\nAnyways don't want to derail your thread with my own rants.  I do agree that a lot of things you've pointed out are issues I see in the game (though I'd disagree with you on developer communication which I think is quite good relative to competitors in the industry).  I'd tell you that the secret is to just let go and enjoy the game for what it is, but I know that's impossible because I've been in your shoes before.  I'd say you should give other games a shot and maybe come back to LoL later.  You may just be getting burned out because you've invested so much into the game with little variety for such a long time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"551202","date":"2015-07-06T16:42:07.142+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":5,"body":"**Here is my only reason why im losing interest in league: **\n\n- **Extremely, EXTREMELY slow champion rework/relaunch/visual update cadence**\n\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:25}} \n{{champion:20}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:26}}{{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}}  {{champion:36}} <- **Will those last outdated champs (from 2009, so 6 years OLD now) ever be updated (reworks, visual update or full relaunch) ...**\n{{champion:78}} **relaunch was announced last year, and still nothing yet...**\n\nOtherwise everything else is \"fine\"","replies":[{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-07-06T17:59:47.201+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm waiting for Poopy's artwork update and VO...\nthe rest not so much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-07-06T19:05:07.454+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem with the balance team is that they hold some champions to different standards than others, particularly their champions on release compared to the rest, but some older mobile champions evade work as well.\n\n{{champion:64}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:245}}  all took too long to get addressed, most of which still are toxic in their gameplay.\n\n{{champion:69}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:26}} sat in the trenches seemingly forever *before even getting tweaked*, at which point it was decided an overhaul was necessary.\n\n{{champion:83}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:60}} had abusive gameplay (to their own degrees, and which *could* be balanced) which kept them from meaning anything realistic in the League, and therefore kept in stalemate for extended periods of time.\n\nAnd I've not even gotten to the issues of old, which shows how little progress really gets made in the game:\n\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:117}}\n\nI don't see why champions can't get mere tweaks when their kit seems out of whack.

That way it's out and replied quickly.\n\nOne thing I don't really understand with rank competition is how it would be given out. If people leave a rank match should everyone be compensated? What if it was friend who left so their buddie can get compensation? There is just too many factors that goes into something like this. To be fair they have talked about compensation granted it been awhile, but they are there. They just can't response to everyone complaining about it with the same answer!","replies":[{"poster":"Auroramancer","date":"2015-07-06T14:11:49.811+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree with the support ticket thing. \n\nI think when it comes to ranked compensation, at the very least, Riot needs to implement something to the effect of \"if someone does not connect to the game, then enable Loss Prevented for the suffering team\" or \"if a player did not connect in the first 5 minutes of the game, then enable Reduced LP loss\".

If you put people in a situation where dodging is okay it becomes a lot harder to play games when 5 games later you've had 5 disconnects because nobody wanted to play support.\n\nPerhaps a better way would be to run champion select after everyone has connected to the game, so that players weren't locked into to playing until they had already connected.

Events like the Freljord event were awsome, but there is to little going on besides those rar big events, and the champion lores are quite lackluster aswell.\nI also really would to get more information not about the champion background, but also the world background, more information about the different regions, cultures and races, what are those little animals in Summoners Rift? What are the jungle monsters exactly? Some encyclopedia style entries about the runtera and it's creatures with some concept arts would be awsome(the diabolo games are great examples for what i mean)\nI also really miss the Jurnal of Justice, and removing the insitiute off war still was one off the darkest days in league's history so far...\n\n----------------------\n\n**Lack of company transparency and adequate player interaction**\n\nSadly, i have to agree again. Riot still has a good transparency and comunication compared to many other companies, but it was better in the past and still has alot room to improve, especially when Riot says that the company goal is \"to be the most player-oriented/focused company in the world\"\n\nThere is often a lack of clearity in terms of patchnotes, and the responses to forum users are very rar and often to generic with ittle to no valuable information.\nThe upcoming patch is a great example. Many probably don't keep track off PBE changes, so a brief update on two things: Xins W-heal ap-ratio gets nerfed and Runeglaive won't proc spelleffeckts any more.\nSo whats the problem here?\nNo one does know why Xin's ap-ratio is nefed, there is not a single reason stated form riot for why this is done, even though many players have that question both on the PBE forums as well as on the normal boards.\n\nAnd for Runeglaive: The claim that the change is a bugfix.\nHowever, there were multiple posts on the PBE forums concerning Runeglaive procing spell effects at the very day it was first releast on the PBE.\nSo if it really wasn't intended to do so, why didn't they fix it back on the PBE befor reeasing it on live? By releasing it the way it was despite knowing that it did proc spell effects, the aknowledged that as a feature.\nNow claiming it was a bug afterwards as it is abused by Runeglaive EZ(still don't think he'S a big issue though) is flat out lieing to the players, unless they actually dind't know about it befor it hit live, in which case it means that they didn't read any PBE feedback, which would be really poor player-interaction from them.\n\nMy main problem with their comuunication however concerns champion aswell as Item reworks as well as removed items.\nI feel like there is a very onesided flow of information, if any at all.\nIn the past, atleast for eu-players, you usually did find out about reworks oficially in the patchnotes, or a couple of days befor that( I'd still like to get an real explanation on why my beloved madret's bloodrazor and force of nature were removed) .\nThat has changed for the better, especially with the arival of the boards that are accesible for EU and NA alike. Now we usually get informations about reworks, lately even with some reasoning for why the rework is done and whats the aim of it.\nWe even often have big threads with a huge discussion about the rework, includeing rioters.\nHowever, and this is a massive problem, it never feels like those discussions ever lead to anything. it mostly feels like riot throws in their rework concept with some reasoning statement, then even commits to an discssion, but in the end the push through theit initial concept no matter what. The whole discussion feels like a farce, as it doesn't seem like riot actually listens to the players and actually takes their ideas and opinions into consideration, and that really is bad for an company that claims to be player-focused.\nI can undertstand why they don't really listen to player feedback concerning new contend as they have little experience here to base their opinion on, but it's totally differnt when old content is reworked or even gets removed. Many player's have alot of experience with old content by playeing the game, especially the 'mains' of reworked champions. They do have competent knowledge to base their opinion on.\nI'm not talking about balanceing or powerlevel, I'm talking about the feel of a champion. There is a reason beyond the powerlevel for why people deside to main a champ, ther is something apealing in the character and playstyle, the core identity of a champion. \nOn a rework, that core should be preserved as good as possible, while flawed mechanics around that need to be removed/reworked.\nIt's on riot to figure out the flawed parts of the kit **and comuunicate that to the community**, but ideally, the would listen to the comunity in order to preserve the identy and the specific feeling of the champ.\nThe players might not give very usefull feedback for balance, but they can tell how a champion feels, how the kit feels, why they like it, and they also can tell why they don't like a rework, why it doesn't feel good, and therefor riot really should listen to their feedback.\n\nOne of the more recent examples of a massivly failed rework: Cassiopia.\nEver since the rework, the majority of the old cassio players complained that the passive feels bad, it feels like shackles that constrain you and have to be broken rather than a growth of power.\nThey also complained that she lost her identity as a cunning poison mage and instead became a lategame-machinegun that soley is focused on her E.\n\nIn many discussions, Riot actually did respond, did aknowledge that her passive feels bad, they nailed down the reasons why it feels bad together with the comunity, they said they would try to solve the issue, and they also wanted to put back a bit more focus on her poison identity rather than the twinfang spam.\nHowever, those just there hollow words.\nNothing changed to the cassio rework, they just shifted some numbers to fix her powerlevel, but the passive still feels bad and her poison-identity still isn't their, it'S all about the E spam.\nSo all the discussion with the cassio playerbase, the promisses that were made, are void...\nThis isn't a specific cassio issue, it's the epitome of the core problem. Nearly all reworks have had similar issues in a smaller scale.\nVeigar for example, everyone complained that his W feels bad in his kit, it didn't feel great befor the rework, and with a less reliable stun it's even worse. At some point riot did agree on the W problem and said they would keep an eye on it and think of posible solutions.\nNothing changed about veigars W since he was released other than numbers, they did the same as with cassio, buff something on him till his powerlevel is ok rather than working to gether with the comunity till his kit 'feels right'.\n\nAnother problem with many reworks is that they actually don't help with any of the identifyed issues of the previous kit and thus change little about how healthy/toxic those champs are. This is a differn't issue though, but still a problem.\n\n----------\n**Lack of/slow relaunch of Tribunal; Player Behavior feedback issues\n**\n\nI never put much though on this, so not much to say on that matter, but your thoughts seem very reasnoable.\n\n-------\n**\nPoor Player Support communications**\n\nThis is the first time i catually disagree on you based on my exerience.\nI did send in support tickets 2 times so far, both times i got an response from an rioter that directly helped me with my issue.\n\nHowever, it was a more specific problem both times, and chances are that i kinda was lucky, so you might still be right here.\n\n------------\n\n**Lack of compensation for unfair ranked matches**\n\nThis is a important point.\nI just recently had a 3v3 rankedwhich we dominated, but after we took their first inhibitor, we had a big lack, followed by a disconnect from both my teammates, whil i and all 3 enemies remained in the game.\nAparently, it was an server issue and many other players disconnected as well, so there was a massive login que, so my mates couldn't join the game(thy actually couldn't log in for the rest of the game)\n\nWe lost the game and with that LP, no loss prevented...games like that really hurt, and even if my mates would have been able to login in again, we wouldn't have played another ranked match that day cause of that very frustraiting experience.\n\nI'd like to add thetechincal issues here even though it has nothing to do with sompensation for unfair rankeds.\nI think it's un bearable that you disconnect dureing a match and then end up in a login que while the match still is going. If you are in a running match, you should bypass the login que.\nAnother problem is how bad the client deals even with short disconnects. If my internet goes down for just 1-2 sec, which sometimes happens, i need 2+ min to reconnect as i have to go in the taskmanager, kill all LOL-processes and restart the client till i can reconnect, followed by quite some time in the loading screen.\nAnd the worst of all is that if i loose a game cause of a disco and can't reconnect in time, I get flamed by the damn leaver-buster afterwards.\nThat usually massively pisses me off to the point there i quite playing lol for atleast the rest of the day...\ni can imagine(and understand) that some people quit playing lol at all if something like this happens to them more often in a short time frame.\n\n----\n-,- why is ther still a limit to the post length...","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-07-07T18:55:57.112+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"...when i can just reply to my own post to continue it, thats just unneeded inconvinience.\n\n------\n\n**Lack of item diversity**\n\nI have to agree once again. Unless an item creats tocic play patterns, there is no reason to remove it.(ahri killing you 100-0 without landing a single skillshot with just a small advantage, Sword of the Devine Rengar...)\nEspecially the stealth remove of items is something i really dislike. With stealth remove, i refer to items that switched from one niche to another due to an rework, usually leaving a gap in their previous niche.\nA great example is The Black Cleaver. In the beginning it was a AD/AS item building out off dagger+bf-sword, giving a string flat armor shred on-hit. It was awsome as first item on AA-focused champions like XIn, Nocturn or Tristana, as the combination of high AD, solid AS and good flat armoe reduce made it a very potent single dps item.\nIt was reworked into a cdr+ad+hp+%armoeshred on physical damage+flat pen item. Rather than beeing focused on AA-reliant champs, it shifted to AD-casters. While ad-casters really needed a new item at that time, there was no replacement for the old BC in it's previouse niche(high ad+as) till today.\nThen BC was reworked again, less ad, no flat pen, more cdr, more health. It went worse for agressive ad-casters and focused on ad-caster-bruisers, again with no replacement for damge focused ad-casters... \neverytime tBC was reworked, it switched it'S niche and left an unfilled gap in it's previous niche. That way, it creats no item deversity in gnerall, but shifts item deversity from one group of champs to another.\n\n----------\n**\nGame clearity and consistence**\n\nWhile LoL really is the MOBA with the best clearity, especially in terms of visualls, it still can improve here alot.\nThe tooltips really need to get cleaned up, and many small things need to be made clear:\n\nWhy does nasus Q hit towers, but mordes doesn't?\n\nWhy does Jax's ult proc spell effects, but twisteds E doesn't?\n\nWhy does fizz W use spell effects, but Kog's doesn't?\n\nWhy does Dianas Passive hurt towers, but not inhibitor's, while Akalis passive hurt's both and Jax's ult hurt's neither one ot the other?\n\nWhile many of those things make sence for game balance, they are terrible for consistancy and therefor for clearity, especially as nothing of that is mentioned in any tooltip.\n\nAditionally, why do i have to go to 3ed party websides to recive any usefull informations about Champions and Items or stattistics?\nThe lasted changes to Elise for example are still not updated on the official lol page...\nProviding some insight on riot's stattistical data concerning nerfs/buffs to champions would really help peope to understand some decissions and improve transparency.\n\n-----------\n\n**Slow champion release cadence**\n\nI Have to disagree with you regarding this point.\nI think slowing down the release cadence was a very important thing to do. \nWe already have a massivly big rooster in league, which is pretty hard to blance, and new players have a masive task in learning all the different champions, aswell as earning the IP for them.\nIf champions would get released more frequently, the game would probably reach critical masses sooner or later and implode, beeing incredible hard to balance and very hard to acces for new players.\n\nInstead of releaseing new champs, they frequently rework old once, which is the right approach.\nLike mentioned earlier, the quality of those reworks is kinda questionable, but goiing for the reworks rather than frequwnt new releases is the roght decission.\n\n------------------\n\n**The community**\n\nTo be honest,  a huge reason for why i don't play league as frequently anymore is how the community devlopt.\nBack then i started, ther was no meta focus, you could play any champ on any position, and no on comlained.\nAfter a while, jungle+sololane became a fix meta, but that was ok.\nAfter S1 worlds, adc+support was estaplished at botlane, however, you could still play differnt botlanes without anyone complaining in normal matches(and succed with them ).\nPeople were more friendly, more interested on a fun game rather than winning at all costs, they where curious about unusuall picks and off builts, but rarly condemned them.\nThese days, it's enough to play a champion that generally is deemed to be weak in order to get flammed...no off built, not an unusall position, just the champion pick it self.\nIt's nearly impossible to play a game without the current meta gods left and right.\nI understand that tryhard attitude in ranked games, and that's why i rarly play rankeds, but sadly most players have the very same attitude even in normals, and this really sucks.\nYou can't really play the game just for fun anymore, it's always tryhard, win at all costs, even in fun maps like aram.\n\ni'm not sure if the reason for that is in the growing LCS popularity that kinda implements a competetive behaviour, or if it's just me reaching a higher MMR(usually plat-diamond in my normals).\nMaybe the community always was that tryhard and hostile in higher elos and my great memories from S1 and S2 are mostly based on a lower MMR....\n\nBut non the less, i call out the community to only go try hard in rankeds and finally play for fun rather than victory in normals.\n\n--------------\n\nThanks  a lot to anyone who read through that wall of text.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daniy","date":"2015-07-06T16:22:21.750+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel the same about tranparency. so many forum posts with over 300 upvotes dont get commented by riot. they just stay silent and we dont even know what is going on. i would really wish they would at least acknowledge us like you said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bunny1102","date":"2015-07-07T07:37:45.772+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the points i'd like to piggy back on in this thread is how slow community problems are solved by riot. \n\nI can't speak for all gaming companies but generally speaking it seems that if something is an issue to the players, it should be a priority to game makers (riot in this instance).\n\nWhen I first started playing this (fizz was the first new champion I experienced to date myself). I remember a \"priority\" in the community was a replay system. **We are still waiting on that. With literally zero response.**\n\nAnother big one was the removal of the tribunal system. One of the big ironies about the tribunal was there was an article by riot \"explaining why they felt a community based approach to player punishment was ideal talking about crowd sourcing etc\". Then you guys trash can it. How is the community in anyway supposed to be happy about that.\n\nThe last big ticket has been leavers, disconnects, and all the general trolls in ranked. Literally weekly we get a thread that has **meaningful** dialogue on possible solutions. It's all over reddit, all over the boards, and the only thing we've heard from riot about ranked is that you will be releasing a team builder version of ranked.

I still stand by the fact that I'd rather have the blank slate we have now than the dead end we had before, but I do wish they'd work a bit faster on this. We don't need perfection, we need content.\n\n- Lack of communication/transparency\n\nWhen compared to some companies, I disagree with this. Blizzard is probably their closest competition and they are miles worse. Look at the Legacy of the Void beta. For months now people have been telling blizzard how bad some of their decisions are - EVERYONE, not just the people playing the race affected - and they aren't even commenting.\n\nRiot is doing very well in terms of communication and transparency. It's not perfect, but they're NOT bad on this front. The scale of the company has just grown to the point where regular meaningful 1 on 1 interactions are no longer faesible.\n\n- Player Behaviour\n\nThis is a touchy issue for me as the PB team is the reason I quit LoL. Not that I was punished or warned or anything, but I just disagree with some of their decisions on a fundamental, moral level and no longer have any desire to play as a result of that.\n\nBut they HAVE said that they are working on reform cards being automatic and including sample transcripts of the problems.... so that should be soon. And the scale of the problem they're tackling is unbelievable so I can understand why things are taking time.\n\n- Player Support\n\nRiot's player support is probably the second best of any company I've dealt with. Way better than Ubisoft or EA, miles ahead of SquareEnix, light years ahead of Valve... they're only really beaten by Blizzard, whose customer support is just the best there is.\n\nI've never been unsatisfied witha  response time or a response from Riot(except in their first year of business, but the company's changed a lot since then)\n\n- Unfair ranked matches\n\nThis point is just people trying to scapegoat, and is something Riot can't change. The system CANNOT SUPPORT a method of making it so that people do not lose LP for leavers - well not without making unintentional leaves too punishing(how would you feel if you lost a full ranked division because your ISP had an outage because that's what it would take to act as a balance). It would completely destroy the ranked system because it means that everyone gradually floats towards Master. There is no solution. None. Not unless they want to remove the zero-sum nature of the ladder system and make it inflate in an absurd way.\n\nThe only edge case that needs to be dealt with is if someone doesn't connect to the game AT ALL the game should simply not count and the person who didn't connect should receive a dodge penalty.\n\n- Item Diversity\n\nThis is a tough issue. I don't think it's that bad really, but I can see the issue. The problem is solving it is an almost insurmountable task without completely breaking the game to a point where they WOULD suffer financially. The game is relatively balanced as it is, so destroying it in order to make it SLIGHTLY better is probably not a good business decision. So while I agree item diversity is a noteworthy issue, and it's something that I'm sure Riot's aware of. It's not really solvable... so I see why it is like it is.\n\n- Slow Champion Cadence\n\nI stopped playing sort of about halfway into the slow release cadence... but I loved the slower release schedule. It felt good to not have to learn to deal with an entirely new champ every 2 weeks and it was awesome that the champs were becoming more distinct and special. From my perspective, I think the ideal would've been for them to have two release periods per year(pre-season and between LCS splits) and release 2-4 champs at once during each one. I don't necessarily like the 'one champ at a time at random intervals'... but I think I may be in the minority here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-07-06T13:54:29.575+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":23,"body":"What I don't really understand is how any of that would make the game itself less interesting to you.

An interesting character can bring interest to a champion regardless of kit (like with the whole Draven shtick).\n\nIt basically boils down to individual preferences and motivations. \"Using your champion's mechanics to outplay the other team\" is only one part of the game.

I had the same problem you did: after five years of playing, I just kind of wanted to stop. Now, my reason was different, as I was just kind of getting bored of it. So here is my idea on how to get back into League with a new spirit if you really want to:\n\nStop playing. Completely drop the game for about one to two months. And I mean, *completely*. Look around, and play some other MOBA's. Play some Dota 2, Smite, and uh... I guess Heroes of the Storm. Also play other games, such as shooters and some real time strategy games. (I play Total War: Shogun 2.) Then, after a two-ish month period, start to slowly introduce yourself back into League. And I do mean extremely slowly. Do about a game or two a week if you can help yourself. Then, begin to play more and more until you reach a frequency of play that you are happy with. If you did this correctly, there is a good chance you might have gotten a new spirit for playing League. You probably won't play at the same frequency as before, but you can still play at a reasonable rate. Split your League time among a wide variety of games, so you can learn to respect each game type for it's own uniqueness. Now am I saying that what worked for me will work for you? No. But I'm saying that if you really feel that you are at a breaking point with League, then try what I have suggested. If you really feel like you don't miss League that much then don't play it again. But if you really did miss League, like I know you probably did, then start playing it again.\n\nThis way worked for me, and I really do hope it works for you if you are feeling up to doing it.

Riot is not a company for the community, they are now a company for the pros. They care more about the LCS and forgets that it is the rest of the community that made it possible. For the love of god, the pros care more about their viewers and followers than Riot does for the <Diamond community. It may just be an illusion since Riot never comments or interacts with any players unless a pro has said something regarding the same topic or it is during an AMA, which is a bunch of lore/thematic questions and not questions regarding in-game issues.\n\n\n2. Riot has no interest in improving the ranked system. I just started climbing and I'm not having a particularly difficult time, but the fact that I can be 9/5 and be losing a 13-30 game and still lose a substantial amount of MMR and LP tells me that Riot expects you to be completely  pro and carry your games to climb. There needs to be some sort of performance attribution to soften the lp and mmr losses. Also, all 3 promos I completed, S4, S3, and S2 I had full silver teams going against gold 4 or gold 3 teams. Ya, I managed to push objectives and win, but I still don't understand why I'm proving I can compete with Gold players in order to get into Silver 3?\n\n\n3. Riot is getting better at this; Riot has ignored a lot of core issues with game such as broken champion kits, unloved <40% win rate champs, and overall poor thematic context in champions in favor of pumping out tons of new champions and nerfing champions that the pros said were OP. They are really getting on top of this, started in season 4 and seems to be picking up speed, but I still think there are obvious things that need to be taken priority over. A quarter of the champion pool is sitting below 45% win rate, which I consider to be the \"there is a problem with this champion\" point.\n\nPS: I'm not crying because ranked is too hard to climb, it isn't. You just have to play the objectives and not the kills. But there are very obvious issues with the mmr system and division system. Having to spike your winrate to 66% to climb a division makes no sense...(2 out of 3 games for promos).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2015-07-07T11:18:01.000+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lore is a very unimportant part of game such as LoL.

There have been countless suggestions for compensation in ranked games in which a player disconnects: Mercy, Leaver LP loss, LP loss reductions, etc.\n\n>What I fail to wrap my head around is, when players are making hot forum threads about these topics, why is there radio silence from Riot in those threads? What is so hard for a Rioter to say \"This is a great idea, but there are several ramifications that we don't enjoy, and thus, are preventing us from fully implementing something like this\"? Like, at least acknowledge your player base! Acknowledge that they are trying to help solve a problem, and give a meaningful response on the matter.\n\nRiot has gone quiet on this because they've stated their reasons for not going through with it so many times. You think every time a person cries on a thread here it's a whole new suggestion? No. It's not. It's the exact same thing they've talked about so many times before, and after a certain point you don't want to keep repeating yourself, so you stop addressing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iMaB3AST","date":"2015-07-06T19:29:12.639+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's my thought on league in a nutshell: I begin to think league is getting worse and then a play a game of league.

I feel champions are following a trend of gapcloser + meet certain requirements = stun and AOE damage. They're making champions that are jack of all trades in a sense with hard cc and gap closer. Champions should specialize in certain roles such as burst damage dealer... a lot of peels...movement or heavy CC. Champions like Ekko make me sick because he has everything in 1 overloaded kit. Look at blitz, it's simple, pull CC them < cc champion. \n\nADC's are the most balanced role we have, other roles have some champions that are just jacked up. I think last well balanced champion they made that i saw was Darius, a Damage dealer with a very weak CC and a pull.","replies":[]}]}
