I love riot games dude they know how to deal with bad players you can feed your ass off and then afk but if  you swear in their game they literally lose their shit like what is riot doing?","replies":[{"poster":"J6vV2un2c8","date":"2018-06-28T04:35:34.317+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You told someone to kill themselves. Just think through the implications of that. Someone did something on a video game you didn't like, and so you suggested that they need to die now. You deserve the ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-06-28T06:41:37.910+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Afking is punished by the leaver buster, if they left they got their punishment. Doing poorly is ok, if being bad at the game got you punished then nobody would play the game, they would all be banned. Everybody has a bad game eventually.\n\nTelling someone to commit self harm is never ok. Quite frankly, if that is how you act in your games then I don't want to play with you. Not because I think you are serious or because I will actually consider it, but because it is obnoxious and shows poor sportsmanship.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheFakeHero","date":"2018-06-28T06:21:28.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol you told them to kill themselves","replies":[]}]}
