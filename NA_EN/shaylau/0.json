However, if you go into them with the same design goals as you did with KDA, it'd only be a matter of designing a male set of outfits that convey a togetherness while also giving them their own style. While not pop by any sense, KISS is a perfect example of an all male group that has a unifying theme that also has unique looks for each member.\nTo make a look for these guys, you'd have to pick something more sleek and fashionable, probably metrosexual for most.
