You can check all the tickets i opened prior to may asking riot support for help and nothing was done ,","replies":[{"poster":"DerMangoJoghurt","date":"2018-05-25T10:26:37.913+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, I'm not saying Riot is run by reptilians, I'm just saying that there have been reports of a lizard being seen near their headquarters **multiple times**. \nWhen I asked them about it they dismissed it, but in the next game I played there was a toxic Renekton.

I question the success of it but people do try it.\n\nAs for the others yes they also exist but we consistantly see those accounts banned. They aren't banned on detection because that would make it easier to determine what got them caught. They are banned in waves instead.\n\nAs for Riot protecting, starting, or profiting from these things, no we don't see that. I will go over each of these and why they would not be financially advantageous for Riot, because I assume that is why you think they are doing it. If that is not why you think they are doing it feel free to correct me.\n\nScripting is not financially advantageous for Riot because it undermines the competitive nature of the game and causes customers to leave. We consistantly see accounts permanently suspended for this on first offense.\n\nBotting is not financially advantageous for Riot because it causes grief for new players and lowers new player retention. If Riot wanted to sell level 30 accounts then they would just do that. It wouldn't be hard for them to generate an account at level 30 instead of 1 for some money if they wanted to make that an option. We consistantly see botted accounts being banned.\n\nBoosting is not financially advantageous for Riot because it both undermines the competitive nature of the game and encourages multiple people playing on the same account. Multiple people playing on the same account is bad because it puts people in the wrong mmr which causes stressful games where someone ian't performing nearly as well as expected and also because if two people use the same account they only have to purchase things like skins once for both to use it.
