Also, if this team win i think they should be able to gain more lp. Another idea, losing a game with afk players shouldnt count for demotion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ad Vitam Aeterna","date":"2017-01-03T18:13:37.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be abused easy. I'd use a smurf  with my friend and anytime the game looked like a sure loss I'd afk so my friend would lose less LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Decim√∫s","date":"2017-01-03T18:15:45.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And how about they made AFK player lose double the amount of LP , if at 0 he gets demotion and if in promo automatic X or fail promo all together ?","replies":[{"poster":"dkw","date":"2017-01-05T04:59:58.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple, just make it so that if people duo together and one AFK the entire party gets punished.\n\nThe abuse you mention is Riot's excuse since S3 or so to not implement such a system, but punishing the entire party fixes that problem. \nOther abuse they mention is that premades would bully someone into quitting. Don't see who in their right mind would actually leave the game, lose double the LPs, and get flagged by leaverbuster when they can just type /mute all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ad Vitam Aeterna","date":"2017-01-03T20:49:26.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, why would we care about that on our smurfs?
