I always have the yellow warning on ranked tab on profile, tho, above my rank on overview, sometimes the yellow warning appear and for some reason he disappear sometimes while the yellow triangle on ranked tab still appear. Also, even more weird, when the yellow warning is above the rank and i hover my mouse over the rank i see that the warning is red instead of yellow and both show at the same time, what does this means, and, also, how much more games may i need to win for being safe from demoting?","replies":[{"poster":" Th3 Rift Hero","date":"2017-10-30T02:47:19.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no i dont think so in other queues than solo duo  im mid bronze not silver but anyway i won enough games to remove the warning","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T00:12:47.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you're ranked in all three queues so that notice might actually be from a different queue.","replies":[]}]}
