Her gameplay devolved from roaming the map helping your team into being a decent teamfighter with dps into just one shotting people with W E combo, and this just makes me sad.

I'm mainly speaking in terms of Vayne, and more recently, the decision to move a boatload of damage from Zed's mid-to-late game into his pre-6 game when his pre-6 game was already his strong point. But there are plenty of other examples...if I went and listed all my technicalities, you'd stop reading by the end of this sentence. >.>\n\n- The majority of tanks (and especially support tanks) feel very undertuned. Champs like Sion, Zac and Maokai are handling decently well, but some such as Nautilus (who for some reason got nerfed???) Leona and Taric feel very unrewarding to play. It's to the point that people are seeing players picking champs like these in the bot lane and believe those players are trolling them. This is partially due to the damage issue, and admittedly it's partly a coordination issue (good luck getting anyone to consistently follow you up in solo queue!) so this will be addressed in a large part by fixing a different issue.\n\n- Speaking of teammates...my friend and I had an IRON 3 in my friend's SILVER 3 -> 2 PROMOS...so yeah, the matchmaking is more than a little bit off. This needs to be addressed ASAP, because this right here is a **nightmare** for competitively driven players and communities...\n\n- Shutdown gold from CS...get. that. ***OUT!*** Even if the comeback potential is lower without it, there are *so many things* already that cater to people who are behind. They're not worth as much gold already, they gain exp a little faster, the shutdown gold from takedowns is huge, and honestly, all this comeback potential boosting stuff almost seems to me like a cover-up for placing lower-tier players into higher-tier games they don't belong in because \"with all this, they should be able to come back!\" What happens instead is, those lower-tier players are lower-tier players for a reason, and they then feel like every aspect of this game is against them...because the most important one - matchmaking against people of similar skill level - definitely seems to be.\n\n- Last one: I would like to look into the implications of our current LP system vs a more flexible, score-based LP system. In short: whether you win or lose right now, you gain X for a win or lose Y for a loss. Even if you're 23/6, have 200+cs at 25, and double the vision score of your support, and lose, and your top lane was like 0/15 with like 70 cs at 25 and a vision score of like 8, you lose the same amount. Even if you're the one who went 0/15 with a vision score of -6, and your team managed to carry you on the back of your 23/3 mid laner, you still win the same amount. Why not make your overall contribution a factor in your wins/losses on an individual level outside of promos (where a win is a win and a loss is a loss) Going back to my examples, the scenario in which you lost above would drop you by a lower amount (say...-10?) while the guy who performed poorly got a higher amount deducted (say...-19?) and Vice-Versa for the other example? You still lose for a game lost, and gain for a game win, but your contribution helps determine the gains and losses individually for instant feedback, instead of checking your MMR over the entire time and getting to the point you're earning +13 and losing -23 after enough poor runs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OHminus","date":"2019-04-08T20:21:52.767+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"-jungle xp being nerfed to oblivion along with long camp respawn timers that enforces a permagank meta instead of a balance of ganking/farming\n-{{champion:142}} {{champion:517}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:555}} \n-damage is high but sustain is even higher to compensate","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChrisBrownze","date":"2019-04-08T18:45:09.384+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Smurfing problem in silver/gold elo of epic proportions.

Also siege minion was too valuable to miss the last hit.\nThe client is laggy and full of bugs, and I really hate this cash grabbing loot crate system.\nRune system has problems and rito change them a lot. I stopped caring long times ago. Don't want to go through all the trees to figure out each ones' use.\nThe overall damage from everyone is a bit too much. Also they should not did massively changes on every champions basic values.\nOverall, these problems can all be solved by simply revert to Season 3 4 5 versions. However rito is greedy, stubborn and arrogant. I doubt they will listen at all. Maybe I should just say beacuse rito games, it is boring and f rito.","replies":[]}]}
