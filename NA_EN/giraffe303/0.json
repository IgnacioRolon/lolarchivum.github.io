Then, a few files down is \"lol.launcher\" click that and it should run to the client, hit the LAUNCH button then it will do it's update.

Open \"My Documents\"\n2.) On the left panel click \"This Pc\"\n3.) Click now on the main menu \"Local Disk C Drive\"  (That's where games usually auto install unless when you originally installed your league you moved it into a different drive in that case find that drive.)\n4.) Open the \"Riot Games\" folder\n5.) Open \"League of Legends\" folder\n6.) Scroll down until you locate the file called \"LeagueClient\" this is where my fix works, if the symbol beside that file is an \"X\" or when you right click on the file and \"Error\" pops up then this WILL help you. If not I'm not entirely sure. \n7.) DELETE THE \"LEAGUECLIENT\" FILE\n8.) In the same folder, a few files down click \"lol.launcher\" and it should run the client. \n9.) From the client hit the LAUNCH button and voila!","replies":[{"poster":"Vyab","date":"2017-06-21T16:47:11.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Liam Corleto","date":"2017-06-01T17:12:07.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this works","replies":[]},{"poster":"isotropic","date":"2017-05-19T16:32:22.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sir, thanks so much!

My suspicions that this is a security setting is further affirmed by that 0xc000012f error that can happen when it fails to locate or read a file.  I suggest going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure nothing is blocking you from properly installing and launching League.
