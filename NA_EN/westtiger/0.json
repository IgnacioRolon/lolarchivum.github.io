Because contrary to what people think, originally Noxus wasn&#039;t purely on the &#039;(physical) might makes right&#039; maxim. It was, for better or worse, a social darwinistic meritocracy. It&#039;s why they allowed Morgana to _live_ in their city, to just open a fucking bakery so she could survive, while Demacia and Kayle turned her away.\n\nIt&#039;s why {{champion:50}} was respected despite being crippled. Did any of you new Riot writers, or the supporters on these boards, actually read his backstory at all? \n\nIn Swain&#039;s backstory, he was crippled since he was a _teenager_.\n\n> The doctor gawked in horror as the young adolescent answered questions about his health and age with a calm, even stare. Even behind the echoing crack as the sand counterweights reset his tibia, Swain&rsquo;s measuring gaze never flickered, nor did his eyes twitch from the pop of his fibula.\n\n> Normally a crippled boy would be turned away in shame from Noxus&rsquo; proud legion\n\nHe was respected by his men for his ability to lead.\n\n> The men who&#039;ve served under him (and survived) have remained in his charge with unshakable faith and loyalty. He leapt through the High Command&#039;s hierarchy, often ascending when superiors requested demotions to join his unit. \n\nHe was legitimately going to become Grand General in due time without political maneuvering, but Darkwill used his position to sideline him out of fear of being usurped.\n\n> His rise to power seemed unceasing until he was suddenly relegated to inactive status prior to the Ionian Invasion - a bewildering decision which reeked of bureaucratic subversion.\n\nEven then, the most bewildering thing is both Rioters and who supports their mindset, thinking that somehow old age and magic powers means that person is &#039;scheming&#039; or &#039;weak&#039;. Holy heck, are you guys still watching Disney? Did we not move past the Brawn Good Brains Bad trope from the freaking 80s and 90s!? \n\nIn Runeterra, EVERYONE has magic powers.\n\nhttp://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/509/everyone2.jpg\n\nGood, bad, ugly, sexy, skinny, fat, human, Yordle.\n\nYou, Riot Waargh, make fun of Darius for understanding what&#039;s best for **the greater good of the nation and his people**, that Darius himself knew he was made of strong physical stuff but not smart enough to rule. Because surprise surprise, he is wiser than you, RiotWaaargh, in knowing it takes more than muscles to rule a nation. So he will support the one with the literal years of distinguished service and experience and the cunning and ruthless to rule a nation like Noxus.\n\nAnd the real kicker. All this griping from champs about Swain not being &#039;strong&#039; enough.\n\nFine. Have them challenge him in-lore.\n\nThat&#039;s the Noxus way, isn&#039;t it? It&#039;s the way you yourself Riot says is the Noxus way. They have to challenge him and win, to prove themselves right. Otherwise, they are hypocrites and cowards. In fact, the very kind of person they (and all the IRL new-Lores) think Swain is.\n\nOh on new-lores. If you so much as say &#039;derp derp old lore isn&#039;t canon no more derp derp&#039;, fuck you. Because the &#039;Evil Chancellor&#039; stereotype you&#039;ve constructed in your heads that is the sole trait of Swain is false. And makes you hypocrites, because for that stereotype to be true, means you&#039;re specifically picking and choosing bits of old-lore to support it while trying to ignore the bits that don&#039;t.\n\nFrankly, I think you guys jumped on the lore binge only when it got easier to follow. None of you actually read the _Journal of Justice_ did you? You didn&#039;t see the fake reader letters, the hidden messages, the cues and timeline through the League Judgements. There was a writer or writers who worked for over 3 - 4 IRL years at Riot, to detail the entire plot behind Swain working with LeBlanc and Darius and every other subtle hint and actual DEPTH OF STORY to Noxus.\n\nI don&#039;t blame you for not following it. Not everyone knew how much detail was actually locked in the Journal of Justice, and by the time people noticed, it as too late. It&#039;s not an ideal way to convey information or story.\n\nBut I&#039;ll be damned if you will be that flippant about the effort and writing of whoever was in the lore department for Riot.\n\nIf Riot&#039;s going to reduce its backstory for Noxus (and Demacia to an extent), which was a wonderful near-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire level of gray and intrigue and sacrifice, into a 1980s Saturday Morning Cartoon archaic story structure meant to be palatable and easier to understand then a modern Disney movie - then I wish you luck. \n\nYou wasted a good plot. You wasted good characters. You wasted the Riot writers before you who tried to elevate a story beyond being just another MOBA plot.\n\nI'm going to guess you're going to reduce Swain to the Evil Chancellor stereotype in his VUG/remake, which is the real pity. I was looking forward to it, but now I realize it'll only be a downgrade for his lore character. He'll likely not be Swain anymore post-VGU; he'll just be Disney's Jafar with a League skin on top.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-08-01T14:50:33.458+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"Duuude, whoa.
