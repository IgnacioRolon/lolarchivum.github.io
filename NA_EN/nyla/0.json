It is instead replaced with \"Shadow swap\" sound. \n\nZed's Project skin has the shadow creation sound swapped with the shadow swap sound. \n\nZed's Project skin does not wind-down normally after emotes. His model just kind of \"slips\" back into the idle stance rather than using the wind-down animation.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-12-01T18:32:29.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This I dont know how to fix, but will forward to the right people","replies":[]}]}]}]}
