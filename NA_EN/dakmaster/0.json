I've seen all of the things it does and I think its wonderful, except that the fact.. That his R are still mushrooms. Teemo is no doubt known for his mushrooms, but we're talking about a legendary skin, change the model for the actual mushroom to something that matches the skin. Idk, a landmine, a nuke, something to match the skin other than those goofy mushrooms. If you are going to use shrooms, make them look more detailed.
