Same people on the forums saying the same shit. No variety in the game. No way to be \"unique\" just spend cash on skins that riot is constantly increasing the price of (regular skins used to be like 300-500 rp, now they are 1k rp...) no rp sales. No ip sales, no way to grind runes or champions. No opportunities. No way to escape an elo... Same people saying the same redundant things on the forum \"elo hell doesn't exist blahhhh blehhh\" yes it does lol. Placement is EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\nIt's just boring. Same kids acting childish in games (especially at my elo) same people building stupid shit and arguing. No way to stop it or avoid it.\r\n\r\nChildish community, boring community. Boring responses. Boring riot staff. Boring system..... Just boring.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitching to WoW. It's been fun boards. WoW is geniunely way funner and a more enjoyful, innovating experience.\r\n\r\nShout Outs- \r\n\r\nShout out to-  Bac0nstr1pz for always being chill and repping that gangplank proud.\r\n\r\nShout out to - Darkvolcan, you keep it real man. You're the only one aside from myself who knows the truth about this game and stupid company(riot).\r\n\r\nShout out to lesbianlesbians- You're kinda  a weeb, but at least you gave me advice when i asked for it (some of the time) i appreciate that.\r\n\r\nShout out to kuronii lumiira (however its spelled) - Sike. Weeb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it. Feel free to post here whatever you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nINB4 downvotes \"bye\" \"can i have your account\" \"downvote and move on\".\r\n\r\nPeace!","replies":[]}
