Especially to jungle.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Half the buff bonuses are completely unviable. The other half are OP. I mean truesight and ward detection. Worth. Stunning minions? Lol. Only worth maybe in early game for weak clear junglers.\r\n\r\nThe changes are barely in english as well to top it off. \r\n\r\nThen when i asked what they meant half the higher elo people came into my thread and tried explaining it to me... MESSING UP THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THEM AND WERE JUST SPEWING BS.\r\n\r\nI like the new map. But the new changes are unnecessary and just threw the game some more.\r\n\r\nLiterally the best and completely broke thing to do right now is just ff farm.\r\n\r\nChampions got buffed early game. Making it harder to get level 2-4 kills.\r\n\r\nSo, why gank when you can just completely power farm as udyr/ww? There is basically no better option right now.","replies":[]}
