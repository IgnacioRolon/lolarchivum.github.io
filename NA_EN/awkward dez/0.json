Understand that league is absolute, Based on the geometry and numerals the game is built on, everything is set.\r\n2. Accept your weaknesses and learn off of them.\r\n3. Don&#039;t get offended or upset when I tell you like it is. I don&#039;t curse or become toxic with my sessions, I do however tell you when your wrong and have you understand it\r\n\r\nThose are my rules, Pretty freakin simple.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, understand the way I coach and my strengths, I coach off of information of your playstyle, background and your strengths/weaknesses. I&#039;m not here to 1v1 you or play with you, I&#039;m here to give you the information you arent aware of. And before all you plat 5 players come at me like trolls, You&#039;re in the same boat. No one knows everything in this game and if your looking to improve and get better you have to understand this.\r\n\r\nNow, If your interested post below, do not add me dear god I will not accept under any condition. I will contact you based on your response. In your response to my post explain to me why I should coach you and why you need coaching, \r\n\r\nMy coaching session will last for a maximum of one month, or when I feel you are past my limits.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that have read over my post and found it interesting, thank you and I&#039;m excited to contact anyone. For those of you who believe silvers can&#039;t coach, {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}  Have fun being stuck in your elo.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-27T23:17:31.667+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am curious.. \nYou look like a totally average low-elo player, what amazing secrets do you know that a plat player does not?\n\nLooking at your post history, it looks more like you want to find someone to coach/boost _yourself._","replies":[{"poster":"Awkward Dez","date":"2016-08-27T23:25:23.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=ViTukp0V,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-27T23:17:31.667+0000)\n>\n> I am curious.. \n> You look like a totally average low-elo player, what amazing secrets do you know that a plat player does not?\n> \n> Looking at your post history, it looks more like you want to find someone to coach/boost _yourself._\n\nInformation, a huge majority of every player that is stuck in there elo is lacking information, yes my mechanics might be that of a low elo player, but my information is not. What to do at specific times in laning phase, certain rotations, even things as simple as last hitting and masteries. All in all, I may not play the game at a serious level, but my coaching is something I take very seriously as a passion.

As a player that coaches in the KR server from players of all ranks. \n ** Nothing is wrong with this post ** \nAll of you guys complaining BS and asking him \"Why, oh why, is a silver trying to coach me?\" \n\nYou may as well ask yourself why you would even bother posting. \n ** You already have a poor attitude ** and coaching won't help you with that. \n\nBack to the point, and why I find this post **not** BS. \n\nThere are three things that separates a professional gamer and the norm.\n1) They have the attitude for it. They have a strong mindset and will ignore any negative comments. And, not just **act like they are ignoring**, they actually don't care nor have the time for it. These players are too focused on their own mistake and reflecting on it.\n2) Game Knowledge (Intelligence). This is really important for players wishing to achieve higher than platinum. Although just strong mechanics can get one to platinum. But, after that, what separates Platinum from Diamonds/Masters/Challenger is Game Knowledge and Experience. \n--- Game Knowledge goes hand in hand with Decision Making.\n3) Mechanics. This comes from Gameplay and A lot of Practice.\n\nKyukimon is offering #2 , and it is true, a silver player **CAN** be more knowledgeable than Bronze-Platinum; but not Diamond+. \n\nAnd don't take this as me saying Kyukimon is a good coach... because I've never had him coach me before. I am just saying, He may have the knowledge that you guys need and why not try him out? its free.\n\n-- Your fellow Sexy and Grill Hot KR Coach - Felix.
