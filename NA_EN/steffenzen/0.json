I had a break, came back to the game and after we all picked our champs, and it was about to go to loading screen... It literally was all black, i tried to do commando - option/alt + esc... And tried to reconnect, it`s still the same, It shows me the game crashed after pushing those magic buttons.... I even at last tried to delete LoL, and reinstall it all. Still same trouble.... I haven`t installed anything to my mac recently, so I have actually no clue whats up. \r\nAny suggestions ?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-02T04:20:49.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds an awful like there's a *poor connection* to the servers going on.
