BOOTS OF MOBILITY! YAHHH FUN.\r\n\r\nI hate the way he's designed. Doesn't have to commit to anything, if his ult won't kill you he just shadows back out because the ult MAKES A RETREAT POINT FOR HIM.\r\n\r\nAlso, good luck itemizing against him, zhonyas only works once, if he's ahead he can kill you with w-e-q auto ignite bork proc alone.\r\n\r\nThen he gets lw, and well, yeah have fun.\r\n\r\nRiot please make his w cost more energy or something, he should be able to do the w-e-q combo once and then have to wait a couple seconds before using w again to annihilate you. That way if the person is low, they can be like \"oh hey he just took me down to a quarter of my health! let me leave!\" and actually have time to back off before he switches with the shadow...\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're going to make his ult cost nothing, at least increase the cooldown, he's able to use it after you come back into lane...\r\nOn that topic, why the hell does his ult cost nothing at all? Yasuo has a resourceless ult but he has to hit you first before it's usable.\r\n\r\nMaybe make his ult cost 30-35 energy so after he w-e-q point blank and somehow misses he has to wait like a couple seconds before shadowing out, because he fucked up and he deserves to die at that point...just a suggestion i don't know...\r\n\r\nTl;dr Zed is cancer, thanks, Riot do something please he's ruining my life.","replies":[{"poster":"2pudge1cup","date":"2015-01-05T05:29:42.450+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frankly, his problem really boils down to having an easy wave clear on a manaless, burst assassin.\n\nWaveclears in this game are out of control to begin with, but it's just awful design to put them on any assassin let alone one who doesn't even need to worry about mana.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ellimiist","date":"2015-01-05T07:25:27.972+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true.

No melee assassin should be able to have that much ad and so little commitment to their targets.

The only way he can shorten it is CDR(which you usually don't build any but yomuu's and maybe blue every once in a while) or hitting somebody with your E, reducing it by 2 seconds.\nThe best and easiest way to counter that is to bait his w, run away, poke, repeat.\nHis w has a long cd, use that to your advantage, the same way you would if a fizz wasted his E.\nBut he does have some absurd strengths in several areas, such as his safety, roam, and farm.  And compared to a lot of other mid laners, he outpokes them to hell and waits till they're low to ult them and pick up the kill.\n\nThe thing is, he actually does have a lot of counters.  Orianna, Syndra, Fizz is a skill match up, Azir is a skill match up, Ahri is a skill match up, and probably a couple more that I can't think of atm.\n\nReasons they counter him:  \nOri can ulti him when he gets out of his ult, wasting his ult, as well as being able to zone him and shield his poke.\nSyndra can E him, or even stun him during his ult and waste it, q, w, q, and pick up a kill on him, as well as being able to zone him with constant q's as well.\nFizz can just E his ult, usual fizz bullshit.\nAzir can ulti zed's ulti, as they're on similiar cd's, while also being able to zone and reposition soldiers pretty quickly.\nAhri can usually land her charm on zed as soon as he comes out of his ult if you actually know the positioning on his ult, and land a full combo as well as waste his ult time, and she has superior poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Star Of Love","date":"2015-01-06T10:41:02.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Father Cthulhu","date":"2015-01-06T13:47:03.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GaiaGaurdian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fdnjuLz1,comment-id=001a0000,timestamp=2015-01-06T10:41:02.222+0000)\n>\n> I get what you are saying but most of the time you are near death when he uses his ult, so orianna ulting zed afterward usually doesnt happen.

You can't just constantly use your abilites and go oom, you have to be ready for things like this.  If you get ganked, dived on, making sure you can full combo, etc...\nThis is a strategy game, and like any other, it still has resource management.

Granted, if you all you use is your Q and nothing else, then you won't usually have much of a problem with your energy.\nBut using your W or E as well, and doing it consistently, will take most of your energy away.\nNow, if you're in a somewhat extended fight as Zed, you don't have usually have enough energy but for one or (if you hit two abilites with your shadow) two wombo combo's.  So if you're fighting a bruiser, who has the health to sustain most of your damage, you're not gonna have a fun time.  Cause now all you have is your passive and aa's.  And your passive is on a long cd as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Star Of Love","date":"2015-01-10T00:26:05.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Father Cthulhu","date":"2015-01-10T02:40:29.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GaiaGaurdian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fdnjuLz1,comment-id=001a0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-10T00:26:05.586+0000)\n>\n> Im not saying zed doesn't run out of energy but compared to mana users he doesn't have the same problems with pokes. You're saying that a Zed player has to worry about mana (made me laugh)  and that someone like orianna can poke just as often as zed does without having to worry about mana? That's just ridiculous. I'm done with this pointless arguing.\n\nAnd now YOU'RE the one misunderstanding.  I didn't say she could poke as often as Zed in lane.  That'd be absurd.  You said that he doesn't have to worry about it at all, which is incorrect.  Late game, energy users fall off, while mana users generally have plenty of mana almost all the time.  So, at that point, she'll probably be able to poke just as much, if not more, than Zed.","replies":[{"poster":"Star Of Love","date":"2015-01-10T04:53:06.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Father Cthulhu","date":"2015-01-10T06:52:46.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GaiaGaurdian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fdnjuLz1,comment-id=001a000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-10T04:53:06.507+0000)\n>\n> He doesn't use mana so he doesn't worry about mana, period.
