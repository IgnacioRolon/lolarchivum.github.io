Which means that intermediate bots just aren&#039;t preparing newer players well enough. Expert bots would be needed to bridge that gap. If Riot ever does make their expert bots they should have a wider roster to choose from, better last hitting ability, contest objectives such as dragon or baron and utilize their 5th player in the jungler role. It would really help newer players get better acclimated to the PvP environment before actually playing PvP. I just don&#039;t know why Riot scrapped making expert bots since naming their second tier bots &quot;intermediate bots&quot; leads one to think that a third level was in the works but never got followed through on.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/pdolua802d6.png","replies":[]}
