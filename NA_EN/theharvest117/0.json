EVER IT NEVER CHANGED! last season it went to gold 4 at some point.\nif more than 70% suddenly climb 1 entire division, shit is clearly fucked up.\nthank god riot accepted this themselfes and didnt turn a blind eye as they always do. so yes now everyone will place at least 1 division lower. unless maybe they go 10/0 lol.\n\n2. if youre really mainly a gold player, iron will be such an easy time for you lol. and im speaking from experience, im plat and i played on a silver acc before (this one actually) and even with cait jungle i went 17/2. \n\n2.1 ITS THE START OF THE SEASON you got 1 year time to  climb. its not like you start in iron and are unable to climb.\n\n\nriot FOR ONCE does what a majority of the community agreed on: fix the fucking mmr system so the average elo for 70% doesnt go up by 1 division. that is not healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-01-12T01:51:41.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something to add here , if someone really wants to climb , then he never has to play at first week or a month , until the wave pass by.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-01-12T04:05:01.556+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I found the best way to consistently get Gold was to stop taking this as a life or death scenario.\n\nI don't have to be good to win games, I just have to be less bad than my enemies.
