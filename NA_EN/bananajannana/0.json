Flash, ignite, and smite are the core of the game for the most part, not letting them get those because they're \"hard to use\" just means they're going to have to re-experience the game learning process at level 8-10, and also be told that most of the spells they had at low levels were actually not useful for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-07-16T12:43:32.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of that is well and good, but isn't it a problem that you balance a necessary role (the PvE aspect of it) on players having access to an optional customization system with high levels of variance? \n\nEvery other role can CS without fear of dying with a blank rune page.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-07-16T13:28:44.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you prefer, we could always go back to, Season 4, was it?, where everyone could jungle pretty much forever without having to go back.\n\nIn any case, I think the fact that jungling takes some durability is a good thing.
