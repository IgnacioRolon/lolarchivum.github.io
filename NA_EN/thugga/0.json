I asked a friend and he said I should message support but I do not know what it would go under as well as how to stop this. I'm not really sure what to do as this has never happened before and I'm hoping a mod will see this to possibly help me. Any ideas from you guys?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T23:46:45.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go ahead and hit up our account team by picking the option \"I need help recovering my account\" in your [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
