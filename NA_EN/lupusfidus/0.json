I dont get disconnected i just stand there and I am unable to move nor see movements. In a competitive game I can't waste a second or 6 seconds just standing doing nothing. Please riot or someone if there is something I can do to help. I have been using the hextech repair tool.

Typically that kind of jump is caused by some kind of hiccup between your network and the game servers, but it could also be happening due to packet loss.

That small window of 10% packet loss could be what was causing that absurdly high ping.
