In Varus' case, Varus, the Darkin, isn't gay, but the two men who's body he stole is. But you don't play the two men, you play Varus. This is the entire issue with Riot's approach to LGBT characters - they have never actually given us a legitimate character, just hazy guess work and reach arounds.\n\nNeeko is the first absolutely confirmed LGBT character in the game.
