No, it&#039;s not it. I just wanted to leave it here in the beginning to avoid people with a close minded point of view.\n\nSaying that I see a big issue in the current League punishment system. We live in a society in which you cannot say a word without offending people. You cannot say &quot;you&#039;re bad&quot;, you cannot say &quot;don&#039;t play this champ because it requires a lot of mechanics and at the current moment you dont posses them&quot;. \n\nRiot is acting like the too soft parents that cannot let their child/children fight for themselves. However, at same time they don&#039;t protect players from being bullied. Want an example? If a streamer bad-mouth their teammates, there&#039;s nothing that Riot will do to punish the player.\n\nI know there&#039;s no solution for the current community issue, but Riot should start really evaluating each case, and stop following thigns by the book. One of your behaviour support staff was clear &quot;you&#039;re welcome to come back, but not in this account&quot;. It clearly said I had improved my behaviour, but they&#039;re not going to change their decision about the permanent ban. \n\nThere are great example of game communities that don&#039;t let bullies get unpunished, but League is not allowing players to say &quot;fuck&quot;, |&quot;Shut the fuck up&quot;, and so on. We are losing our own identify in order to be able to play the game. We are not allowed to swear or use harsh words towards people that clearly cannot play a champ. For example, I would totally be fine if someone said I suck as Zed because I do. \n\nStop overprotecting and start looking for ways to find a line between being too strict and too soft.\n\n**P.s None of the comments addressed the fact that streamers can trash talk without being punished**\n\nMancer.","replies":[{"poster":"PIMPSMOOTH","date":"2016-01-10T20:54:52.227+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"How to not get banned: \n\n- Don't be a dick. \n\n- Don't be a dick in response to someone you believe is being a dick, that doesn't excuse your behavior. \n\nEnjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"Guto Mancer","date":"2016-01-10T21:56:58.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Define being a dick.

We get to use my new favorite example.\n\nIt's not that I'm offended by insults. I quite understand I'm a far better person than the other. I'm annoyed by insults. I'm annoyed that I'm trying to play while someone is harping on every minor mistake. Don't tell me I don't have to skills to play a champion IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME WHERE I AM CONCENTRATING.\n\nThere are 5 players in a room. One of them is a tiny yappy dog. The shrill annoying kind. Four players on the team are trying to concentrate. The fifth is a yappy dog. He's playing, but he's also yapping. I do something wrong. Maybe I give up first blood. It happens, nobody is perfect, and the dog comes over to me and starts yapping right at me as I'm trying to concentrate on playing.\n\nIf they eventually go away, I won't report them. But if that dog keeps yapping and yapping and yapping, attacking my ears like the sting of bees at every moment while I'm trying to make up for the mistake I made, it detracts from my play. In fact, I've had a jungle so on my case I ended up giving up two towers trying to wrest blue from him because he wouldn't give me blue or come into my lane because of a single missed gank. At a certain point, the yapping gets so distracting I can't play.\n\nSo I ask the management to come over and remove the yapping dog. League of Legends is a game after all, I'd like to play it and enjoy it and relax without yapping dogs. Most players don't want a yapping dog.","replies":[{"poster":"Guto Mancer","date":"2016-01-10T21:55:40.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"1.

At all. \n\nIt is not your place or right to tell people they don't know how to play. Even if they don't. After a game, sure, you want to suggest another champion, that's fine. But in the middle of a game, there's no reason. It's aggravating and it has no place. There's nothing a player could even do if you said 'stop playing Yi, you are bad at yi, but I love you and hope we can be friends'. They still have to play Yi for another 30 minutes.\n\nAs for 2, while 2 out of my 4 jobs are shit, Newspaper Carrier, if you are bad for long enough, they kick you out, yes. Except that's not applicable. It's an analogy that doesn't fit with League of Legends, which is a video game. It is a game used to test skill and relax.

It doesn't actually help, probably will start an argument, and it clutters the discussion with nonsense nobody wants to read (aside from pure entertainment value). The easy way here is not a proper or useful way.\n\nAlso, the way I've approached this at some point irl is irrelevant, but since you brought it up, my interactions with toxic players in the League community has helped me learn how to deal with abusive people elsewhere. Being the better person works everywhere in the long run. If you teach everyone to take the high road, then eventually everyone *is* the better person.

I could have crawl in my bed and cry and hope someone would bring me a hot chocolate or I could soak it up like a normal person and take this criticism as a way to grow. \n\nLeague, currently, punishes any kind of negative interaction regardless of the outcome or intent. If I am telling you that you don't have the mechanics to play the champ after you died 10 times and missed your combo another couple of times, I am not saying that because I am jerk, I am saying that because I don't want people to shit on you later on. \n\nThere are different ways to display leadership and sometimes being the guy who is always nice isn't necessarily the right approach. Sometimes, people need the iron fist. \n\nI understand nobody likes to read \"you're bad\", \"you don't have the mechanics or skills\", but at some point someone has to say it because some players are going to hide into their holes and deny their lack of skills until the very end.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-01-10T21:53:37.742+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Guto Mancer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ntAy0bwb,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-01-10T21:52:29.107+0000)\n>\n> This statement shows clearly why this community is too soft.
