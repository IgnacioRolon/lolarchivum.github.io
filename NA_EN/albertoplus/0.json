It&#039;s much better to pair to gameplay and visual updates together when possible so we don&#039;t redo a champions visuals and then redo their gameplay which makes us need to redo their visuals and spell effects again, **that&#039;s why they&#039;re focusing on Yorick and Warwick first**.

But that's because they're just not playing him optimally. It's maybe not such a massive deal in higher elos, but in lower elo, players are incredibly unorganized.

Mind if i drop some thoughts?\n\n1) It has a lot of emphasis on **objective taking**. I am a bronze sloth in matter of mechanics so my best is when i start planning around the map, denying camps and keeping myself healthy and steady for a gank.\n\n2) I like his E, for how much passive and uninteractive it is, and i love the feeling when i pull off a good gank thank to it ( mostly pre-6. yes, pre-6 ganks with ww are a thing). **Making it more interactive however**, maybe increasing his team-vision utility might be intresting both because you have much more levers to put hands, because it has the potential to become really something.\nOnce i asked to Feralpony ( on ask.fm) how much of a balancing hell would be giving WW a \"smell sense\" similiar to Tremor' s but based on enemy health loss. I am not sure if he was more amazed or worried :D But something on the lines of that would be intresting, so he has a fallback team utility pattern unique ( sorta) to him.\n\n4) **I just don' t like his W**. Like, i press it once in a while in fight and i just hope to get it right. probably there are better times to use it, but once i notice i have the carry nearby and ready to fight i don' t care much more.\n\n5) I like his Q. it' s simple, but effective. It' s both an utility that allows WW to heal back once he reached the front to start draining with emphasis on target selection ( i target the squishy, which is far but so i wrekt it, or i go to the more approchable tank that might also heal me better?) and a **call to action** so he is not immediately pushed back without hope to do anything meaningful, always lured back to the frontline. It can get a lot better thought\n\n6) I am the only one who does not like much his passive? I don' t loathe it but it overall means that WW has to build Wit' s End or similiar attack speed items. Which might be cool aniway, but probably can be done better and with **less item bond**?\n\n7) I find his ultimate **unremarkable**, I like it only because it gets along with my bronze mechanics ( and sometimes i feel offended when i think about it ) and i would like to have a tad more impact over it, maybe not necessarily with a different targeting paradigm but with more decision making; for example making the enemy soppressed longer the more i have attacked it already? makes you decide between instant suppression or delayed but more powerful one to allow your team to catch up. just to give you the idea of what i mean.\n\nphew. that' s it.\n\nnoooooow i have a question for you if youdon' t mind :3 eazy peazy\n\nhow do you see ww, thematically? i don' t mean lorewise, even if it might be included, but more about feel. he is a lone wolf, he is a leader of the pack? he really dips into the psycological and sociological meaning of the werewolf and \"showing up the visiousness of a man\" or you have other plans, maybe a more unique vision?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karma Deified","date":"2016-05-08T21:45:47.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Now's a great time to discuss what parts of Warwick really resonate with people.\n\nDon't give them false hope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VVolfsong","date":"2016-05-08T21:31:14.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta be honest and say that I'm not really a big fan of Warwick's current kit at all.\n\nNot because it is simplistic, or because of how dated it is compared to the kits of new champs today, but because I just don't think it meshes well with his fantasy and thematic. I mean, when I think of the core concepts of a werewolf, I picture a furious killing machine filled with rage, ripping things apart. If not for his current kit, drain tank would not enter my mind at all.\n\nI once did sit down to try and design a kit for him myself. I still wanted to keep him mainly a jungler, but rather than a tank I wanted him to be more of a fighter/diver.\n\nI wanted to keep some of his old aspects, like howling to hunt and being good at chasing down prey, but I also wanted to give him more moves to use in combat. I also really wanted to have him running on all fours during the chase... So the first thing I did was make his W swap between two and four legs, with different abilities on Q and E depending on the stance. Standing upright would be for combat, and down on all fours would be for tracking and chasing.\n\nI figured he'd need to be able to pounce while chasing, so I put that on his Q, and for tracking I put his howl as an active ability on E. Then I stepped back to look at how my attempt at a kit was progressing, realized I had pretty much just unintentionally copied Rek'Sai, and lost all motivation to continue.\n\nI really do hope he gets to run on all fours somehow in the new rework though, as I think it would look absolutely awesome! And I think Warwick is a great candidate for a stance swapping kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valexfor","date":"2016-05-05T00:58:50.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hoping I'm not late. Also sorry but there's no tl;dr. That said I think that WW can really become a great champ, he's got a lot of potential in his concept but his kit just doesn't deliver well right now.\nWhat I like about him is summarized in: \"the Blood Hunter\" (his title) and \"Eventually the beast catches up with all of us.\" (his phrase in his lore, meaning that he's slowly becoming a mad, bloodthirsty beast).\n\nHis actual kit does a poor job of delivering his fantasy of blood hunter and also whatever he can do, there's someone that can do more and better throughout the whole game, even when he's supposed to reach his best performance there are champions that are just better than him under every aspect and circumstance and all of his kit is either too binary or it's useless 90% of a game.\n\n\nTo name a few problems of his kits and some solutions (this is obivously just my humble opinion as a WW player):\n\n- His passive doesn't feel like he's a \"blood hunter\", IMHO a blood hunter is something that gets stronger the more blood his prey spills but he's not like that right now, he just feels like someone who likes to slap people and gets happy when he can do it (to quote and older thread I read about him).\nHow I would deliver this fantasy withouth changing him too much? Make his passive's damage based on a small % of the enemy's missing health. It might feel too strong like this so the passive should stack like the live one, it would still scale per level and the heal would be based on the extra damage of your passive, also give it more stacks (maybe 5) this way he actually needs to survive a bit before reaching his full potential. If it still feels too strong you could just add this as an extra effect for the live one when he reaches full stacks: his passive would stay the same but would get more stacks (with a bit of power rearrangement), like I said before 5 seems like a good example, and when he reaches 5 stacks he does a % of the enemy's missing health asextra damage and heals by the same amount (this is a buff, but he kind of needs one imo);\n\n- His E is weak and lackluster. Having it work only on opponents with less than 50% hp is actually a HUGE condition: players with less than 60/50% health, unless they are playing tanks or champs with high sustain or both, play more passively and safe so most of the times you will have to engage on an enemy with more than 60% health and this E will not grant you any advantage once you burn your ultimate since the movespeed bonus is far too weak, to make an example of this: today a yasuo outrun me in the jungle wth no monsters and he was under 50% hp, a yasuo with no monster nor slow outrun a ww with a level 3 e active... this goes to show that all you need is a 1 sec 30% slow to fuck up a level 3 E and sometimes even that is unnecessary if you have a ms item like statikk shiv. Most slows start around 20/30% at level 1, meaning that WW needs a level 4 E to follow a champion with a slow on a level 1 skill, by the point you have a level 4 E the enemy will have a level 5 slow with at least if not more than 50% on a usually low cd;\nAlways on his E: moving faster near an half dead enemy, while cool in itself, it's a secondary aspect of the fantasy he should deliver, an aspect that should be looked at and added only AFTER the real deal is added: he should get STRONGER when there's blood spilled around him like I said before. If you skip the most important part, it's useless to make him move a little faster, especialy when this skill is the only one that delivers his fantasy in the right way;\nHow to change this? With the passive change I suggested as an example the stronger part is taken care of, now the problem is that the skill feels and IS lackluster for what it's supposed to do, especially now that cc's and mobility are all around the place and are quite strong so to address this the skill should make WW's attacks against low health targets work like rengar's jump passively when the skill is toggled on: when warwick attacks a low health champion his attacks become lunges (with an internal cd on the same target) with a range of about 400 units (a flash's worth), no extra damage involved but maybe some kind of execute mechanichs, something like more range if the next attack kills an enemy or the ability to get one extra free jump in the next 2 seconds after killing an enemy to escape or something like that;\n\n- His W is too anonymous, it's just there, useless 99% of the game, just an extra button to press when you're fighting, you don't even feel the difference after a bit, also the fact that it doesn't delier on his fantasy AT ALL doesn't help;\nInstead of it giving attack speed to his allies, this skill should slow nearby enemies IMO, WW is a lone hunter he's not a team player, so why not double up on his ability to kill people by himself?. Also make the slow become a fear if they are marked by the E;\n\n- His R... IMHO this skill it's good but isn't delivered the right way. Instead of an instant blink and suppress, this skill should be like a Vi ult with a small delay: lock on the target marking it and, after a small delay (0.2-0.3 seconds), rush to it by ignoring terrain and everything in between you and suppress him, you can get hit and die mid animation but you can't get cc'ed out of it, also the damag starts at your arrival so if you die before the enemy will be completely safe. Why? simple: the enemy will have ways to outplay you if you use it poorly, but at the same time you can use it to follow badly timed dashes (specially those tristanas and ezreals, I always feel cheated when they escape, it just doesn't feel right). Also this should have a passive interaction with his E: gain more range when the enemy has 50% health or less, this would make it so that WW, in the right circumstances, can actually gank a far away opponent and can actually pressure the map, most times even if they are in range you are just too far to reach them in time before they go back. For how fast he moves it would get some high base ms (not as high a sion's ult) that ramps up the more he travels, I think that 4 seconds (empowered recall) should be enough to reach an opponent from max range (maybe it's even too much) this way near enemies will have time to reposition a bit and while far opponents wouldn't get too much time to completely save themselves. This is obviously a nerf but with the other changes I've suggested untill now it's needed to create a more balanced and healthy kit;\n\n- Now for his Q: this skill, beying the only trading skill he's got, should feel like a high moment right? It doesn't. It feels like: press this to deal some damage and heal a lot. Nothing to work around, just as simple as that. Some might say: then vlad's q is the same right? X champ's skill is the same right? Not entirely! take Vlad: his q actually feels like a high moment when empowered, especially in close situations where a normal q wouldn't be enough. Trynda's Q? It feels like you are trading damage to survive so it implies a choice to make, it's not always the best thing to do and using it at the wrong time might either get you killed or lose you a kill, or both. WW's q it's nothing like that. I would change this one in 2 fast aoe hits, weaker than the live one with the same effect (healing him). This might seem not that much other than making it an aoe with the same range but if we think about it: 2 hits means 2 times on-hit effects, both hits would obviously get mitigated by defenses, overall the power would be the same but this actually feels what a mad beast would do: throw huge swings with its claws in front of itself, not precisely hit a single target.\n\n- Gets completely shut down by two item that're bought only on the two classe he's supposed to counter (ad carryes and ap carryes) so he gets useless as fast as the 10/15 min mark usually.\nQss and Zhonya would still be strong agaisnt him, but with these suggestion he would have the tools needed to still work if his ults gets shut down, also the enemies will have some form of conterplay to him other than hoping he can't catch up and murder them to death;\n\nAlso I remember someone once posted a rework that got iceboxed: while I didn't really like it at first, after looking at it with a less biased eye I understood that it actually delivered a lot more of his fantasy than the current one. I won't say it was perfect or anything like that but it really was a nice step in the right direction.\n\nI know this is quite a long response (and is a \"bit\" late too I guess), but I think this just goes to show how much I love the champ: he was my first played champ and untill I reached level 30 I almost ONLY played WW and he's still one of my top favourite champs (ties with Thresh for first place) so I really want him to be both strong, viable AND healthy, so I hope that this post will, in some ways, help you guys understand what makes WW himself and on what to focus when working on him, even if he gets a little bit more complex (the changes I suggested do make him a tiny bit more complex and as you can notice they all revolve around his E, meaning that he's stronger when his enemies are marked by his E, weaker when they are not). I also know that this is not the only fantasy he can fit and it's just the one I pictured him to fit when I first read his lore.

Now&#x27;s a great time to discuss what parts of Warwick really resonate with people.\n\nAs a fellow Warwick main, I think Warwick is a great champ even as is, however there are a few things that I would like changed.\n\nI would like to see Warwick's Q deal AD, AP just feels wrong for him. Also knocks enemies back.(Gives him something to aid in pre 6 ganks).\n\nWarwick's W is great for getting assists and taking objectives but it really just feels out of place. The way I see it, Warwick is all about chasing low opponents down and finishing them off.\n\nA great way to aid in his mobility would be to give him a Dash type ability that, when activated, gives Warwick(just Warwick) additional attack speed just like his current W. The Dash can be used to get over obstacles like Ekko's also should deal AD when used on enemy champ.\n\nWarwick's E feels tacked on and while the passive is essential to keeping the spirit of Warwick that doesn't mean it couldn't be altered a bit for the better. I'm thinking Warwick's E should be just about the same as it does now except instead of just giving Warwick movement speed when an enemy champ is low, how about vamping movement speed from low enemy champs, much like Chilling Smite works now. (Only activates on nearest low champ.)\n\nAnd now we come to Warwick's R, something just feels wrong about Warwick's R being so easy to perform. The payoff is too high to just be a point and click ability. I don't want to alienate current Warwick players but I think replacing the blink type R Warwick currently has, with a skill shot lunge will really make Warwick much more satisfying to play. Also instead of dealing AP, Deal AD.\n\nThis also gives Riot a chance to make the R animation look better, instead of Warwick just magically appearing on an enemy champ he would now lunge towards them and have a tackle like animation. The Suppress has to stay of course but as balance to his added mobility maybe have the suppress end even sooner.\n\nWith these additions to his kit there will undoubtedly need to be some adjustments but I think in the long run it will be worth it and Warwick will become a much more satisfying champ to play. \n\nSummary:\nQ: Deals AD instead of AP. Knocks enemies back.\nW: Dash, when activated gives Warwick additional attack speed (No longer gives nearby friendly champs attack speed). Also deals AD when it hits champion.\nE: Passive: Vamps movement speed from low champs instead of just giving Warwick movement speed.
