His legs were moving sparatically and his picture on the mini map and tab screen was a white box. In chat it didnt say (Ezreal) like it normally does but instead just (). The white box took up a large portion of the bot lane so it was impossible to see who was near him (enemies or allies). It started happening around 5 minutes and continued for the rest of the game. Looking at the mini map was difficult/impossible during team fights because we couldnt see who was next to him.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-25T20:34:37.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! \n\nAre you referring to live or PBE?\n\nIf so, PFE is currently disabled due to the issue you're describing.
