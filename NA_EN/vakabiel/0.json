From further review of your logs, it appears that your drivers for your Nvidia card are out of date.  Since this may very well be the root cause to your issue, I strongly recommend that you update your drivers, by downloading the latest ones here:\n\n\nhttp://www.geforce.com/drivers/results/73780\n\n\nNow, if you are still experiencing issues with these crashes, we will probably have to go pretty in-depth with your information in order to determine the root cause. In this case, please [submit a new ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to us here in Player Support!  If you do submit a ticket, make sure to include the following latest and most up to date information:\n\n1) Dxdiag information: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq5\n\n2) Your most recent r3d log where you experienced the problem (You'll notice that the file name starts with the date/time and ends with r3dlog.txt): https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq7\n\n3) Process List: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq3","replies":[]}]}
