For awhile I just decided to play on the old legacy client but today I tried the new client again. It asked the same thing but I decided to input in a new name because I figured that it would make a new account and then I could just log out and relog in and it would put me onto my real account. I tried doing this but now whenever I log into the new client it always puts me in this new account which is not what I want. I can still log into my real account using the legacy client using the same username and password which is strange. I have a lot of skins in this game and I don&#039;t want to have to be stuck in the legacy client forever but at the same time I obviously don&#039;t want to start off new in the legacy client because then I would lose all my progress and all the money I put into the game","replies":[{"poster":"chupaacabra","date":"2016-12-05T23:49:22.606+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Milo221, how are you launching the League client update? Its very strange that its not bringing you to the login page initially.","replies":[{"poster":"milo0221","date":"2016-12-11T16:59:50.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can login from the old legacy client fine, but when I login through the new client is when I get problems. Instead of just putting me through into the game after putting in my username and password it makes me login to a different account","replies":[]}]}]}
