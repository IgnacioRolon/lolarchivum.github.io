The Screen kept on saying Trying To Reconnect. Then the game logged me out. I logged back in and I try to get back in. For some reason it didn't show me and reconnect button. There was only an Exit Game Button. I would like to see if there is any way you can remove my AFK ban, because it is not fair that i get a ban for bad wifi. If i could reconnect i would, but there was no option.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T02:26:57.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, there's no way for us to modify or remove Leaverbuster penalties, as doing so would compromise the integrity of the game. Regardless of the reason for the disconnection, it still negatively impacts *everyone in the match*. This is a key reason for our inability to make changes to these penalties and why the system treats all disconnections the same.\n\nI recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to  ensure your network settings [like [moving off WiFi](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/ethernet-vs-wifi-ping-packets-playing-better)] are compatible with League.
