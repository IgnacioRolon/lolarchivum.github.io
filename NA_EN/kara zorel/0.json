In addition to this my key bindings were removed on many of my items in those sets; for example I set redemption to 3 and warding items to 2 and five and when I looked at my remaining item sets all of those bindings were gone and had to be redone.  \n\n**How to Reproduce:** I'm not sure.  I've never launched Legends of Runeterra, I didn't play during the previous day although I was logged on as I was spectating my girlfriend's games all night.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Curo Arcane","date":"2019-11-18T08:30:29.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing here.
