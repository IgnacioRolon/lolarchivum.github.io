Not immediately sold on it, but I guess it could grow on me. I like the idea of a green Shyvana skin. I like the idea of it being ethereal-looking. What I don't think will make sense is if it's ghost-oriented. Maybe it could be element oriented, or some other incendiary-related skin. Shyvana is a dragon, after all.\n\nI like the current color palette. The human form might need to have solid bones with surrounding light-green special effects, the same way the dragon form has the darker bones with the lighter green surroundings.\n\nAnother idea: what if it's ghostly armor, instead of a ghostly Shyvana?
