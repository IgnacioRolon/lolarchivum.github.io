The OnHit damage Kog gets from W right now previously took 160ish AD to reach.  At first Kog was actually weak early game, but then Riot gave him no scaling damage and all base damage and wondered why his mid-game was suddenly so daunting.","replies":[{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2016-09-20T06:55:02.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did say with a little effort.
