Quite the opposite, of course. Is there some kind of bug where if your teammates leave your games too many times back to back you get locked out as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-29T02:44:19.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Were you talking about this account specifically? If so, I'm honestly not entirely sure what must be going on. I'm not seeing *any* left or AFK games on this account right now, nor do I see any low priority queues or a history of punishments. Are you still seeing low priority queues? I'd like a screenshot as well if possible, that way we can dig in and really figure out what's going wrong there.","replies":[]}]}
