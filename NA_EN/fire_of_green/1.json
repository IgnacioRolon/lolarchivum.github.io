The team's carries, Tristana and Lux, do basically nothing before dying. Lux used Q and W, (No E, ult or passive procs) The W should still be at rank one, and the shield it provides isn't that good at any point in the game. Tristana literally healed Illaoi instead of doing damage to her, and Wukong went down soon after because of baron, then Pantheon because he's level 10 and has no armor.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-09-20T07:19:00.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But damage!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roit Gums","date":"2016-09-20T05:21:58.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I swear i have been playing and she destroys games more than Darius, my top laner feeds to her and she gets instant triple / double kills when people gank her","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-09-20T05:42:06.368+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roit Gums,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=85NnMfTN,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-09-20T05:21:58.474+0000)\n>\n> I swear i have been playing and she destroys games more than Darius, my top laner feeds to her and she gets instant triple / double kills when people gank her\n\nbecause theyre trying to dogpile on her in melee, and then she just ults. people dont seem to realize that she spawns tentacles for every enemy nearby when she hits r. \n\nive had this happen in an aram, shit was hilarious. the enemy team thought because i got a couple kills ahead theyd focus me and engage on me all at the same time in melee without having much by way of cc, while i already had 3 tentacles around. i just hit r, and destroyed them all while healing through the pain.\n\nmorale of the story. cc her, or just disengage and kite her out of her tentacles when she ults. illaoi **wants** to be in the middle of the enemy team, since her ult gets stronger the more enemies are around her. all you have to do is just not to let her walk up to you or group up in a pile around her.\n\nshes also fairly dependent on having tentacles around and is almost useless without them. means if you simply walk away and she tries to follow, she fights you on 30% of her power.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DemainaNyx","date":"2016-09-20T08:35:30.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is a window based damage champion.  She does a shit ton of damage in a very small and telegraphed window, and does moderately well outside of it.\n\nKilling her tentacles cuts out a lot of her damage.  Running when she ults negates most of her damage.  Dodging her tentacles negates basically all of her damage.  She is based around her tentacles, which take time to spawn (outside of Q and ult, which again are telegraphed) and are visible to everyone even if they are in a bush.\n\nIn the clip you posted the entire team walked into an unwarded bush that they at least knew might have Illaoi in it, and then proceed to stand directly on top of her to fight.  In what universe does the ADC and APC face check a bush that they know has a fighter champion in it and expect to live?  Unless she was at 10 hp, you don't walk into that bush without your tank first.  If that was a Darius he would've done the same thing and gotten free passive stacks from Trist or Lux and an ult resets to finish the rest of the team.  \n\nBetween Shen Taunt, Pantheon stun, and Wukong Ult (which we'll never know if they had any of those abilities up), they had enough CC in their to kill her if the two carries hadn't died 1 second after facechecking a bush.  I think the Shen taunt and Pantheon stun hit at the same time, possibly Wukong ult as well cause it appears like she is knocked up for a second.  All of the CC is layered instead of chained, which would've been the same if only 1 CC ability had hit.  And, the CC is used after both carries were killed and during her ult animation when there is a spirit already out, meaning the tentacles automatically strike the spirit once spawned.  If it had hit a few seconds after the tentacles were done swinging or if it had been properly chained, she wouldn't have been able to use E or W to get the tentacles to attack again and heal her.\n\nYou can even see her in her champion highlight that her ult does minimal damage on it's own.  It's only because she has a spirit out already that she survived that fight at all even though the enemy CC'd her.  If she had ulted without the spirit grab first, she would've died.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFkCDRlb9FA&t=3m49s","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-09-20T08:36:42.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are we talking about that same champion who was totally ignored since the first 8 months of her release?\n\nTook you this long to figure out wtf she does, huh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-09-20T04:50:27.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AAAAAAAHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOO *fart*","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-09-20T05:54:28.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://champion.gg/champion/Illaoi\n\nShe deals a fuckload of damage but she's otherwise average.\n\nWhich is, ya know, her thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Roit Gums","date":"2016-09-20T06:22:34.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Her damage dealt in the chart is over the max lol","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-09-20T06:34:55.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, they should fix that.\n\nBut anyway, she deals the third most damage in the top lane.
