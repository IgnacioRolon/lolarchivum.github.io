Azir is doing the animation of auto attacking(when he gives an order) but the soldier doesn`t respond. The soldier are always in range of an auto attack and ready but do not respond. It might be only on my side but since the patch doesn`t say anything about that i guess nobody as noticed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Xou","date":"2015-10-28T20:52:43.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm, this has happened to me way too many times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-10-28T21:01:37.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a reproduction steps of this?
