No frame lag at all. Last week my Windows 10 and league updated, windows anniversary update + league 6.17\n\nI've tried the DVR xbox fix, I've tried resetting Windows 10, running Windows updates for drivers... Anything that seems to work is short lived...\n\nI get constant hiccups in FPS, drops from 60 to 20~ FPS, happens I noticed especially during a fight, spells + effects, and during announcements. Announcements I mean the announcer sound + the scrolling in the UI.\n\nIt seems so random, for example, I turned sound off, started a new game. Everything seems to be working _better_ but not as great as before. So I turn sound on during the game to test, and yes it was worse. So I turn it off again thinking it'll be better, and it made no difference. And I'm wondering do I have to just start a game with sound off and don't even try ticking it on and off or what...\n\nAlso turning my settings to \"Very Low\" aka blob mode, doesn't even matter. Like it's ridiculous it still spikes when League is this bad looking, lol. Compared to me being able to run on Medium High with no issues 2 weeks ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T21:41:00.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your windows update may have forced some of your drivers to go out of date, so as a first step I'd suggest checking those.
