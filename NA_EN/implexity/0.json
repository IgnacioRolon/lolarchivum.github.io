Please check your internet connection and try again.\"","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So recently I've experienced this error quite a lot. It only happens when the game begins to load. I usually have to click on reconnect multiple times before it launches me in to the game. I arrive in game after everyone else. Now before you say that I might've a problem with my connection, I would like to say that my ping is usually around 45 ms . And it's not really my laptop either, because I can play the game without lag on highest settings. I've tried searching around the boards, to see if someone had found a solution. I found this old one from 2015, and the problem was solved by disabling p2p transfer...https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Q4lErMuJ-you-have-disconnected-please-check-your-internet-connection-and-try-again\nI searched for some recent ones, but they didn't really have any answers for why it happens or what the solution is. I made this discussion in hopes of receiving actual help and I hope we can get this problem fixed...\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}\n\nEDIT: Sooo I think I found out why this error happens. This problem began after the latest update, which may explain it all. So I was looking around on the support site, and I found this program called \"The Hextech Repair tool\" which I thought wouldn't really help me. But I gave it a shot anyways, because I really wanted to play some League without this stupid bug. Turns out I had installed League of Legends on my on path C/Games, when I should've just let it download at C/Riot Games/ League of Legends I think. I searched around the net for why this was necessary, and I found out that without this directory, you would be in trouble every time League gets updated\nI don't know if this is true or not, but I am gonna try to put the League folder into Riot games folder and update this post to confirm is really is the solution\n\nTLDR; If you experience this bug, and you have league installed on anywhere else but C/Riot Games, then you should put it back there. If you don't have the game on /Riot Games folder, the game's new update won't really be installed properly. This is only a theory, but I am trying it out for you guys {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\nEdit 2; Found out that wasn't the case. Still experiencing this error and I can't even use the practice tool because of  there being no reconnect button there...{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n\n\n\nSOLUTION: Uninstall League of legends and then delete the \"Riot games\" folder stored in your C/ drive. Then reinstall the game. It fixed the game for me! I did it guys!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"king julian27","date":"2017-07-31T05:32:14.287+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"same Problem:(((((((((((((((((\nlost my promo game because of that:( now i cant Play lol anymore...","replies":[{"poster":"Implexity","date":"2017-08-01T07:29:54.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Delete LoL and then delete everything from your computer related to LoL (\"Riot Games\" folder etc) and then reinstall the game.
