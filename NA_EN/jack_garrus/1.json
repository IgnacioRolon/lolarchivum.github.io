I had several games with a support like that, so I was just thinking ahead.\nDue to my wrong judgement I had a bad match. Is my fault, I know it and I am not looking for being pet or\nbeing blamed. That match just made me learn how biases based on bad games could effect negatively further games.\nI just would like to know what do you do when, as adc, you have a support that makes you wasting almost an hour of your time, nothing more.\n\n**Little story time**\n\nSome days ago I wanted to play mf adc after weeks of support playing. \n\nIn the lobby pre-match the one that should suppose to be my support starts to be exuberant and a little aggressive. He was chatting with another team mate, so I supposed that when this guy took Darius he would swap with the other one and gg, but he didn't: his premade took yi jng, so I had Darius supp. \n\nThat wouldn't be a problem if he didn't wrote 'at least I would feed as Darius' and generally being aggressive (but not toxic) about his opinions in the lobby. \n\nOfc, I had a lot of supports playing a non support champions (like a Shaco) but not very often they were  toxic on purpose tu make me tilt but from this Darius I didn't really what to expect. \n\nWould he  last-hit all my cs? Would he let me die and take kills? Would he flame me for no reason? \nMaybe, or maybe not.\n\nSo, to be provident, I took {{item:3308}} as first item, in order to get some gold if that Darius wouldn't make me farm.\nTurns out that he wasn't trolling, but' just' very salty.\n\nI was farming very bad because of the fear I had everytime he went close to the cs I was aa, so at 5 min I had about 16cs while my opponent had 40. \nHell.\n\nThen Darius asked me why did I take {{item:3308}}, but on my answear he just said 'oh, poor kid'.\n\nHaving 26 yo I felt very stupid. My 'mistake' was to not to trust my team mate remembering similar past experiences.\n\nSelling  {{item:3308}}ofc didn't make me take over the match and be more useful, so I had one of my worst matches with mf since I got her the 7 mastery, but I can't blame me completely.\n\nOr should I?\n\nAnd you how did you manage a troll support as adc?","replies":[{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2018-03-30T11:57:19.495+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a midlaner when the support \"troll picks\" I usually switch to support gameplay.

You should blame yourself because that is what you have control over and according to you, you made yourself miss cs because you worked yourself up over a guy venting in chat and tilted yourself instead focusing up on it to get the cs.\n\nAs for how to deal with a \"troll support\", just play as the situation presents itself.

And as I touched on, troll word is generally tossed about too liberally.  The point is:\n\n  Jack _himself_ said he did not and would not consider the Darius to be a troll otherwise, it was only after the Darius made a venting comment in chat that he started to make mistakes because he was too distracted with worrying whether or not he was a troll.\n\n> You can&#x27;t control pressure or feelings like you say you can, it&#x27;s not gonna be mentally willed out of existence.

Then I and others would have to be marked as a kind of _Homo superior_ for exercising some amount of self-control and emotional stability.  And I should tweet McAvoy about setting up some School for Gifted Youngsters...\n\nBut seriously, writing exercises aside, not only is it possible to control that, in many scenarios it should be a basic expectation for people","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jack Garrus","date":"2018-03-30T12:21:24.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sona Ping,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7ZLANId7,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-03-30T10:40:15.233+0000)\n>\n> Sorry but the correct answer as well the best thing to do for yourself is that you should.

But here's what you do:  you take that feeling of not wanting to waste the game and you use that as motivation to focus up, to make yourself make you hit those CS, it makes you perform and not make the mistake in this scenario, and gives you a chance in others.  Additionally you stop caring about that idea and that outcome and those \"past experiences\" as well,  realize that they are just single games among the many.     Use the circumstance to learn, do what you are supposed to, and go to the next one.
