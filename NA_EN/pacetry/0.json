Now we all know that riot changed the lore and removed the iow and the LoL, and i would be perfectly fine with it if the game wasn&#039;t still named goddamn League of Legends! The LoL isnt a thing anymore so why is the game named after it? If i made a game about futuristic gunfights and called it &quot;Warlords Revenge&quot;, warlord being nothing, not in the lore, not in the game nothing about revenge na ah, just gun fights in the future but still its then name of the game written EVERYWHERE, how much hate would i have to deal with? A lot right? My games name wouldn&#039;t make sense, same thing is happening with league right now, how can they completely remove the League of Legends and still let the game called LoL? Riot please just make something that is named League of Legends in the lore or change the name the name LoL MAKES NO SENSE, im not hating on the old lore scrap or the new lore, im totally good with it, but its just stupid for a game to be named after something that has nothing to do with it.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-11-26T17:01:31.700+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"The brand is tied to the name League of Legends.  You can't just change that now or even back then the game had already grown way to much to be able to change the name.  Also IMO the name still fits.  During the lore update they removed the lore from the actual game so in that regard the game didnt change and thus you shouldn't change the name.  It is still very much a League (ranks, fights, battles) of Legends (legendary heroes, warriors, entities, gods and champions).","replies":[{"poster":"PaceTry","date":"2017-12-02T11:33:44.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is true, and i dont want them to change the name ofc, just saying its weird","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cetri","date":"2017-11-26T17:04:05.688+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eh, it's just a more metaphorical name now.
