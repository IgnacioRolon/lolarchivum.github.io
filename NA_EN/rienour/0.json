I understand that he actually does take skill to play, but when laning or trying to face him otherwise it&#039;s hard to beat 100% crit chance. When it takes most characters 4 items to do so, but him only two. His kit really isn&#039;t an issue, just the raw damage with two crit items (incomplete crit items). Tryndamere has to build 3 and every other character has to build 4. As an ADC it&#039;s hard to beat that except to flash when he e&#039;s to you. As well as mid laners who are on the squisher side who don&#039;t build a lot of resistance. Granted there are items like phantom dancer, deaths dance, randiuns, ninja tabi, zhonya&#039;s hourglass, and more that help, but still having 100% crit chance is extremely difficult to handle. And a lot of people will hate me for saying it, but he really isn&#039;t op, personally I give props to people who can play him well. I just think, instead of doubling his crit chance maybe making it scale as he levels and make it where at level 18 he gets 25% crit chance or something along those lines. Just something to change it from being double to something that scales and makes him maybe have to get that third crit item to reach that 100%. And yes I know that his crits only do 90% damage, but I just don&#039;t feel that offsets it enough. Any thoughts and comments are welcome, but no &quot;You just suck he is easy to beat.&quot; or anything along those lines","replies":[{"poster":"DontTouchMyBall","date":"2018-01-12T11:14:29.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rienour,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vEAcE9Og,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-12T08:36:57.830+0000)\n>\n>  I understand that he actually does take skill to play\n\nStopped reading right there. He doesn't. Else he wouldnt need hand-holding-baby-mechanics like his \"Turret-Ult-Protection-Stay-Out-Of-Turret-Range-During-Ult-GetAway-From-Jail-Free-Card\" Like you dont see Vi Ulting and diving under turret and having that Hand-holding-baby Yas mecanic. :^) \nNow for real, I did real all your post. xdd\n\nI do admit he requires skill, but I cant simply respect a Yasuo players. They are so inconsistent, its an absolute conflip of either good or garbage. No middleground.  It doesn't help the fact that he also seems to bring up the most toxicity in when behind and surprisigly when ahead too. I don't like having Yasuos on my team if not for a premades","replies":[]},{"poster":"Honest Neos","date":"2018-01-12T08:49:31.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, my only problem with yasuo is his shield. It's annoying and literally all he needs to do is walk to have it up, sure yeah I can auto it and it's gone but if I'm melee that's way too risky, and it wouldn't even matter because again, he just has to walk to get it up. \nI think that instead of just walking, they should make it his e that builds up flow. He still gets his shield, just that it's harder to obtain. Sounds fair to me, he gets that, free armor pen, double crit, Windwall. I think he can spare taking a little more harass in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2018-01-12T10:30:47.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"no he cannot spare to take more harass.\n\nthats why he is aweful in a lot of people hands,\n\neverything you just callled \"free\". i want you to take a look at his base stats and scalings.\n\ncall it free again\n\n( also WW is like a 25s CD yasuo doesnt build CDR and at the early levels it takes about 20~ seconds of walking with no boots to get shield ) \n\nchaing his E to be the only way to get flow would make yasuo auto push the lane every time its there making him get camped even harder.\n\nnot to mention his shield will only ever be useful when he is ahead because then can he dash mindlessly to get it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-12T09:05:45.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Bruh skilled lol that's hilarious, you mean easy EZ, I swear I played this guy like every solar eclipse, feed super hard like crazy after cheesing lvl 1-2 first blood,meals on wheels having a blast panic dashing through the minions as I confuse the jgler and top/mid/bot, oof go 1/33/7 hit no of that ff button because it's 30 mins and I've hit 300 cs, full build bb, and destroy their team\"outplayed\" barely lifting a finger.
