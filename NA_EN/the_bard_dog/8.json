Best thing to do in that situation is shove your lane and then roam.

Should clarify this. I've had too many games where an ally would come to  my lane for a gank or a tower, then take all the farm on the way out when their own lane was being pressured. Even worse if I'm behind and need the farm. This mostly comes down to \"Always be doing something.\" If you're standing still, you can even start to back while you decide. Just in case. But always be doing something, while keeping in mind the other players of the game needing their own farm.\n\n2. I think most people understand this but don't care. Mostly because far too many people enter ranked with a normal game mentality and are just there for fun, not for a competitive game. Which is the reason to enter Ranked. Not saying don't have fun, but you should be there for the challenge. Not your personal score. \n\n3. This one I have to somewhat disagree with. If you're meant to be taking damage then yes you need the tanky stats. But if you're behind and you put off building damage then you're going to stay behind. Doesn't matter if you can live 50% longer if they still out damage you that much. Don't be afraid to grab a Cloth Armor along the way. But don't ignore damage in favor of defense.

And yes I include the enemy even if they win. If it was a boring win then their time probably feels wasted.\n\nWhile I understand where you are coming from, I'm not sure that I entirely agree.  I used to have the same attitude, and tried to learn every lane and multiple champions for each lane.  I won some and lost some, and got to silver 3 a couple times but kept going on losing streaks and dropping.  I frequently got very frustrated, feeling like I was playing great but my teams just were never any good.  I always had a great KDA, but I couldn't carry games.\n\nSince then, I have started trying to play a single champion as much as possible, only switching up when overall it seems like a good idea.  I feel like, by doing this, I am able to push small edges a lot easier and take advantage of opportunities that I might have let slip by if I wasn't as familiar with the champion.  This is very hard to quantify in game, but it seems like I've been able to improve my win rate this way, climbing back up much faster than I previously did playing lots of different champions.\n\nFor example, the original poster is 44-18 with Vel'koz in ranked, and 8-8 with Leona.  Personally, if I was queued with the OP, I would want him to play Vel'koz support, even if objectively it seemed like we needed more tankiness.\n\nThat is just my recent experiences, however, so everyone's mileage may vary.  Just food for thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2014-12-12T22:01:54.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting higher MMR/ranking means you need to understand more of the game.

But you will hit a wall at some point because that's all you know. If you get even a little bit out of your comfort zone you will start to drop off.

You can still master one champion. But at least have some flexibility.\n\nOverall your post is everything my #7 pointed out. You keep talking about personal record. \"My KDA this\" \"Good score, couldn't carry\". This is often said by those who focus on the wrong things. Are you following the OP's #2? If you did well in lane, do you pressure other lanes or just keep in your own lane?

You suggest that my comment about not being able to carry is focusing on the wrong things, but then suggest that Ashe is tough to carry with.  This leaves me confused as to whether you should focus on being able to carry or not.\n\nAdditionally, I note that although you suggest playing a varied champion pool, in your ranked career you are 50-26 on Zyra, and 91-99 on everyone else combined.  You certainly seem to have had by far the most success on the champion you have played the most.  This is a pattern that I suspect is somewhat common among players in gold and plat.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2014-12-13T12:02:48.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't enjoy SR all that much when playing solo so I just get to gold and quit. \n\nFor the Ashe comment I'm stating you have the skill to get higher as an ADC main. But you're picking a lacking champion for the job(in solo Q, it's different if you're with people you know on Ashe). \n\nThat 91-99 record is mostly from when i started playing ranked. Mid was my first lane so I do well on it and Zyra isn't a common champ at mid so people in silver didn't really know how to handle her. I got S3 gold by cheesing it basically. But that record was mostly from my lack of skill in other lanes that held my team back. I have gotten better, but playing too much ARAM/Dom has left me a little careless with my mana early game. Could probably easily get to plat if I took the time to fix that problem. Maybe. I was the same problem I pointed out in S3.\n\nIt took me that many games because I lacked skill in other lanes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Bard Dog","date":"2014-12-11T22:14:01.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cindikle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=di5jmUMW,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2014-12-11T22:06:09.703+0000)\n> 1. Should clarify this. I've had too many games where an ally would come to  my lane for a gank or a tower, then take all the farm on the way out when their own lane was being pressured. Even worse if I'm behind and need the farm. This mostly comes down to \"Always be doing something.\" If you're standing still, you can even start to back while you decide. Just in case. But always be doing something, while keeping in mind the other players of the game needing their own farm.\n> \n> 2. I think most people understand this but don't care. Mostly because far too many people enter ranked with a normal game mentality and are just there for fun, not for a competitive game. Which is the reason to enter Ranked. Not saying don't have fun, but you should be there for the challenge. Not your personal score. \n> \n> 3. This one I have to somewhat disagree with. If you're meant to be taking damage then yes you need the tanky stats. But if you're behind and you put off building damage then you're going to stay behind. Doesn't matter if you can live 50% longer if they still out damage you that much. Don't be afraid to grab a Cloth Armor along the way. But don't ignore damage in favor of defense. It amounts to nothing if you don't do any damage while living, just as you don't do damage while dead. Damage is also much more helpful if you're making picks to catch up. It's situational though. \n> \n> 4, 5 & 6. I have nothing to add. \n> \n> But I'm adding:\n> 7. Bring more to the game than one roll and one champion. Flexability and teamcomp are more important than you going 5-0-2 as Riven only to lose because you don't fit the other 4 champions that were picked before you. This applies more-so if you're playing in Ranked. There is a reason you're required to own at least 16 champions. Don't waste 9 people's time for yourself. And yes I include the enemy even if they win. If it was a boring win then their time probably feels wasted.\n\ni proabably should clarify on 3. i kind of meant for bruisers/ people who synergyze with tank OR damage items. it does not work for tryndamere, or riven, for example, but say you're behind as jax. just become the team's dedicated tank, or lee sin, or xin zhao, that kinda thing.  im just tired of seeing the darius or shyvana or jax or whoever getting dominated all game and continue to just build damage. the same goes for a few mids, like mordekaiser, lissandra, and galio. also applies to many junglers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vertanium","date":"2014-12-13T00:35:41.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I somewhat agree with the tower point, Almost every other game I have played mid, bot complains about how I \"lost lane\" because they got my tower first even though I firstblooded them, killed them again, and then roamed to push my lead to snowball the rest of the team or shutdown their fed whatever, because I knew I wasnt gonna kill or take the turret of a passive (insert waveclear  mage here).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bandaged Bandit","date":"2014-12-12T20:54:46.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't give away the secrets to the game!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2014-12-12T17:13:47.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JacktheRustler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=di5jmUMW,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-12-11T10:36:52.495+0000)\n> 1. you can never have enough farm- seriously. \n\nI play support.\n\n> 2.
