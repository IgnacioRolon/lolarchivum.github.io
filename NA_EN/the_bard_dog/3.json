As long as the enemy jungler doesn't come through there or if we get pushed back to the tower allowing the enemy support to safely check the tri-brush, it will stay up for a long time.\n\n\nif i am red side i will pink the river brush and use my green ward in the blue side tri-brush. however i will use the green on our tribrush(behind our turret) if i am going against a mid assassin or jungler that loves to gank through there like {{champion:238}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:120}} and {{champion:64}}. \n\n\n\nonly time i will get sightstone first is if i am going against early ganking junglers like {{champion:64}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:421}} and {{champion:79}}. or if we managed to get one or two kills in lane and we are ahead. the second reason may seem counter-productive but, i always expect the enemy jungler to have enough sense to know that you should try to stop lanes that are slightly ahead from snowballing as early as possible.

So what could I possibly know?\n\nMaokai Support is real! His peel is on par with Thresh, his vision is almost as high as Teemo's (best vision pre 6 - as he scales with HP so early sightstone actually improves his build too) and his in lane sustain means that with any decent mana item, he can actually NEVER return to base. From around level 4 to level 8 you can stay in lane and maintain an advantage. If you can get {{item:3010}} and sightstone, you have endless sustain as support Maokai, and only need to go back when you have enough gold for your next item. \n\nAnyways, as a main support, I rarely get sightstone first unless I am Braum or Leona. As mana hungry supports like Taric or if I'm lulu (and the team is especially squishy) i prefer {{item:3010}}  ASAP and just buy wards, as I'll earn more gold from my masteries and staying in lane longer, plus always have enough mana for Ulti's and e's. \nAs Vel I might go an early AP item, usually to maintain an advantage or deal with a lane where my adc isn't very damaging early. If i have Vayne adc, getting early damage I can completely zone out the enemy while Vayne farms, and once she's ready to go back, I'm ready for sightstone (though in most games i get sightstone first with Vel, recently i've gotten {{item:1028}} + {{item:1052}} or {{item:1026}} ) and I've recently started having a lot of success with Anirva support (yes I get flammed every champ select, but I ALWAYS get appologises in game when I am frequently landing double stuns or stopping that gank with an easy W. With her I'lll get {{item:3010}}  first if I can (like if we get first blood) or {{item:3070}}. Either way I get sightstone afterwards, because we normally start getting ahead once I reach 6 and I want to ensure decent vision, but I put mana before even my gold item in these cases. \n\nI know most argue sightstone or Gold item first, but while gold is always my starting item, I often go another item tree altogether before building either gold or sightstone items, because I know I can be more efficient with just one item, so I don't need as much gold with my utility picks, then I get vision, then i build up my gold item. It's less efficient for late game total gold income, but I have a stronger early game, which also means more gold (either by staying in lane longer or securing kills)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aych Pii","date":"2015-06-12T13:14:59.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It always seems much more worth it to me to upgrade my support item to tier 2 first and get a pink+a green or two.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-11T23:42:10.230+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"The sad thing is that most ADCs probably have no clue what you are talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-06-12T05:29:32.009+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:432}} Ok, Vayne.

If you have yellow trinket you can probably get away with it, but if you an early ward is still useful, since even if a support DOES get sightstone first, they might not get it before you get ganked (which could happen multiple times since the first one denies gold for sightstone), but this is if you like shoving the lane.\n\nHere are some scenarios\n - You are being pushed, but avoiding damage, this often leads to staying in lane \"longer\" which means the support may have run out of wards, and leaving lane might leave you open to dives. I've played as braum or leona, or even vel with 100 hp for almost 5 minutes straight, because i know I will land that cc if the enemy dives, and give my adc a kill, but if I leave and they don't want to, the enemy might get a kill. On the other hand, if you get that kill when they dive, you want some quick farm while you have the chance, if you've been in lane a while, that extra ward might just save a life.\n\n - If you are pushing early or if the enemy controls the wave quite well, an extra \"early\" ward can help you stay out long enough for that BF or level powerspike, as some lanes just stay out longer, and the first to back can be the first to start losing (or second to back depending).\n\nAfter that early rush, I agree that the support should handle warding from now on, but there's still other possibilities.\n\n - If you're losing trades and you have an AP support, letting them buy a damage item and one ward, while you buy a damage item and one ward (instead of you buying BF or something and they only get sightstone), means your \"team\" will be stronger. If you share the power and weight a little, you can be SO much more threatening in lane, especially if they have a decent utility champ like Thresh, who can lock down one champ while supporting their adc. If you only have ONE damage dealer, zoning the support makes for an easy kill. When I play braum, I often let the enemy dive my adc, then use unbreakable to lock out the other enemy (do same with ganks). You can cast stand behind me and Q, giving your adc the advantage, while blocking out the enemies backup. I can't do this is the enemy has two damage dealers as opposed to one significant damage dealers, situational game my friend. \n\nthe above is about communication, I wouldn't advise both champs building damage, but if you agree it's for the best. Same goes for if the enemy has a troublesome jungler, or a gank happy mid, deep wards might give you more warning. So if as the Support I can ward enemy jungle, river and drake, then my adc just wards the lane brush, we have MUCH more vision, for half the team, not just our lane. I only do this with adc's that naturally buy wards, I wouldn't force it on them as it's a game about teamwork not bullying\n\ntl;dr there are times where buying wards as adc (before mid game) gives a strong advantage, and I'd usually recommend buying ONE ward on your FIRST re, just because it'll really help your support \"build\" into something useful early, instead of forcing them to build sightstone or buy only wards cause they can't afford anything else yet. In those situations you're usually losing and that tactic only maintains your disadvantage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-06-12T04:54:47.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"outside of extremely unconventional supports (teemo, shaco, gangplank) most combos are pretty good. most combos have their strengths and weaknesses (some just have more obvious or easy-setup strengths).\n\nfor an example i had a lot playing ranked, I would choose Zyra and my ADC would choose Kalista. it doesnt seem too good on paper, but its easy to proc Kalista's W passive with a ranged support, and Zyra's Root + Zyra Ult + Kalista Ult combo can keep teams locked down for a long amount of time (since Zyra's ult knockup requires some setup).
