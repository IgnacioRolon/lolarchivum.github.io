Now with the talk of a Ranked Team Builder I can't help but laugh. Riot had made the jungle unfun for the last 6-ish months (until recent patches) so a lot of people, myself included, walked away from the jungle. And the set up of supports is very similar to jungle in this; both the jungler and support have to play a TEAM game to win while each other lane/role tries to play hero/carry to win. \n\nJust like in World of Warcraft, some roles many people do not enjoy.

You pick one champion you want to play and you never look back. You can't look back! If you get matched with a team, see their picks and think \"you know, this champ won't work so well with them, but this other champ would be awesome!\", you can't change to make a better team. All you can do is stick with it or abandon them and home the matchmaking gods replace you with someone playing that champion. \n\nTheir plans for ranked Team Builder is to just have you call a role and go from there. You can actually pick based on what your team is doing. You can see that your team needs a tank and your ADC picked Graves and go Leona. You can be a *team*. \n\nI've pretty much written off YOLO Builder for my own use. Between the adjusted match making (no, I'd rather not be in a mirror matchup with someone who's far better at the champ than me, thanks), the inflexible nature of picks, and the queue time, Riot pretty much has to bribe me to use it (see handing out shiny Summoner Icons, early access to the SR Update)","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-04-02T14:33:42.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it better?
