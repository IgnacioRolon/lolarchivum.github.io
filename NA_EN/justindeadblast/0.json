Each time I log back into League of Legends the game crashes, with a message saying something about Pvp.Client not working. This has started happening since Patch 6.14 and every other day I have to repair the client just to access it. I'd like to know how I can get it fixed, or if someone at Riot Games can fix this bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T23:57:07.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen in specific areas of the client such as Hextech Crafting or the store, or will this happen if you just let the client idle?","replies":[{"poster":"justindeadblast","date":"2016-09-08T03:43:53.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply, haven't logged on the website in a while. It seems to have stopped happening, but there's another bug that concerns me. Maybe two actually. The first one being after a game, for some reason when i reenter the client the screen is completely black. I can't see anything but I can still interact with the client as if it were there. The issue can be resolved by just logging out of the client and then relogging back in. The second bug that happens might be more common, but either when I'm in the home screen, or when I'm in champion select, the client just freezes. I can't interact with it in any way whatsoever and I'm forced to use the Task Manager to close the client. This is happening in Patch 6.17, however it may still occur in Patch 6.18 so please look into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T17:37:36.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is having a hard time keeping a stable connection to the servers. Since patches only change local files in your League directory, it's *extremely unlikely* they'll be affecting your connection. I suggest working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in resolving this.\n\nLet me know if you continue to see these issues after working through that guide.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
