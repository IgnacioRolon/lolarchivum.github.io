Grab WinMTR and run a traceroute to OCE 103.240.227.5.  Run it for a few minutes so we can get a good idea of how your're reaching the game.  If possible, run one during off hours too so we can get a comparison.  If something is indeed going on with your ISP, you can give those logs to them for further investigation.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2017-02-04T20:27:45.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks but,\n\n>  now (post patch) I'm lagging all day, everyday.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T21:04:02.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha, sorry for missing that.  My suggestion in this case would be to run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide as it does sound like your network is pretty unstable.  The steps in that guide should help resolve any local factors that might be causing this.\n\nIf it doesn't work, then proceed with grabbing [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)and let me know the results.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
