It wouldn't affect out-of-game lobby since the launcher-specific would apply, but when you get in-game, the game now has two setting files to apply, botht he old and new one. \nI seems to behave as a \"OR\"; basically if either one of the launcher has a setting ticked, it is enabled. \n\nI hope it helped","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2017-02-21T01:32:11.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tried.\nSwitched to the new client, ticked it off.\nSwitched back to the old client and YAY!\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} \n\n\nI played this song(  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lyb_NM0XeA  ) In my head all game long while me and my friends had  curse/dirty joke war in chat.
