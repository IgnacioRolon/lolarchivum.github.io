He&#039;s always wanted to create, initially setting his sights on game design, specifically the 3-D aspect. He later found he wasn&#039;t a fan of the entire process but still wants a career that revolves around creating. And so has now set his sights on, idk how to phrase it XD, lore writing?\n\nReally want to help him kick start the process before he stagnates and would greatly appreciate any insight you can offer into these questions:\n\n1. What motivated you to get into writing?\n2. What qualifications did you achieve and do you feel they were essential to your career? \n3. What did you do before RiotGames?\n4. How did you come to work at RiotGames and what does your role/roles involve?\n5. What&#039;s your workload/schedule like? \n6. What other writing roles are there outside of lore at RiotGames?\n7. What&#039;s your favorite food?\n8. If there is one, what food will you never try even if your life depends on it?\n9. If there is one, anything you dread having to do, find to be irritating, aggravating in your line of work? \n\nThanks to anyone who answers for your time and I&#039;ll try to get my mate on here","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-07-13T16:29:40.413+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.  I kinda fell into it as graduate student at USC film school— I discovered i liked it more than the rest of the process (esp for TV)\n\n2.  Well grad school was useful, and being in TV writers rooms really accelerated it— but also just writing a lot, reading alotta fiction books, and carefully observing human behavior.   I think writing is a place that requires some innate talent and a lot of work.  You have to really, really like: reading books and scripts and writing more than anything else.\n\n3. I worked in television, as a writer, producer, and editor.\n\n4. I was recuited.  A rioter-writer (say that three times fast!) was looking for a new writer - he asked a friend i had worked for names.  My name came up.\n\n5. Generally about 45 to 50 hours a week but it can ballon to a lot over that when deadlines swing around (ever couple weeks.).  I tend to work in bursts too—. So i might work three 14 hour days - then just come in for a couple hours the next two days for meetings.  Riots pretty good about flexability.\n\n6.  There is no “lore” deptartment. So writing short stories, bios, comics, animations, VO, dialog trees etc...  is all part of the job— though different people specialize in different things.\n\n9.  I used to end go to alotta meeting, many of which were a waste of time, designed to be convient for the Devmanager rather than the team. (Mine, riots etc)  less so these days.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-07-13T18:46:25.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are there shows or movies you really liked/loved the writing in?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-07-14T01:13:54.899+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"_The Wire_ is a classic esp the first season. _The Shield _ is amazing esp final season. _Breaking Bad_ has the best pilot I've ever read.  _Seinfeld,_  esp later episodes, is super tightly structured- it was a mega hit for a reason.
