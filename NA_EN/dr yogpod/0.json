I usually see the League logo around 2-4 seconds after the champ select closes and then I get into the match and load in fairly quickly. However today I did all that and nothing popped up, no logo no nothing. So I waited patiently for a while but still no logo, so now I obviously think my game has crashed, so I task manager it and end all the processes and try logging in again and I hit the reconnect button. Still nothing. Well okay that's no big deal I'm patient. So now I've restarted my computer, tried logging in but by this time my team agreed to a remake and I suffer the consequence of being AFK when I simply had troubles loading in. This isn't a complaint and I honestly don't care if I get a Leaverbuster warning about this. So wondering if this was all on my end or if anyone else has this problem. (I've also tried loading into custom games with bots and still no logo, no screen popup, nothing.) \nHope to hear from someone soon as I would love to get back on the rift! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T23:34:25.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After champion select, your network establishes a connection to the game server.
