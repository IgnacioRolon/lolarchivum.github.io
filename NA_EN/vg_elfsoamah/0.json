I have been playing LoL for acouple years now, I always keep up to date on the LCS and updates for LoL, and I love the competitiveness of LoL.\r\n\r\nI'm only a junior in highschool, so I wouldn't be a shout caster for a while, but I wanted to start younger so I can have more time to learn. I was wondering what do you do to become a shout caster, what do you memorize, what do you look for, etc.. And is there any \"training\" I could get for some LCS shout caster like phreak or Kobe or whoever.\r\n\r\nWorking for Riot and working as a shout caster has always been a dream of mine, and i wanted to get some insight so I could have a better chance of making it happen!\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\nelfsoamah","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-01-29T02:27:53.765+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best advice I can give is to get started.\n\nCast tournaments. Host your own or partner up with someone who already does. Stream it. Watch your recordings. Watch current casters and learn from them.\n\nThere's not a lot of training out there right now. It's something I'd like to create at some point, but it's mostly self-driven.","replies":[{"poster":"Menzador","date":"2016-10-26T04:44:21.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(I know this was from 2 years ago; Riot, please don't eat me for gravedigging this. Also, get ready for a text wall. But...)\nThanks for the advice Phreak!\n\nIt does kinda blow that there isn't some sort of \"School of Shoutcasting\" or any real formal training in League of Legends commentary. As an aspiring shoutcaster myself, I've watched you all on Twitch and YouTube and picked up some valuable pointers on things like equally balancing LCS patch meta discussion and the way professional teams integrate that into their gameplay with a play-by-play of what's going on in real time. I, for one, say it's as much an artisan skill as, say, being a TV commentator for an athletic sport such as the NBA or the NFL.\n\nThat being said, I might venture forward a few tips not necessarily from experience so much as garnering nuggets of knowledge from watching professional League of Legends matches mixed with my own gameplay experience (I started playing in the end of Season 2, back in 2012):\n\n* Play the game ... and keep playing the game. That way, you know what's current, what's meta, and what both general and position-specific (top, mid, bot, etc.) experience is inside and out.\n* While playing the game, rotate positions (preferably in normal!) so that you can begin to gain a general mastery of what the meta is like across lanes, and choose your champion carefully (check the patch notes!). If Azir's sand soldiers got nerfed in a patch, for instance, take a jungle position if your mid-laner wants to pick Azir. That way, you don't necessarily miss out on mid-lane action because you still have the possibility of assisting via a gank there. How is this relevant to shoutcasting, you ask? If you narrate your own matches, you'll get a better feel for your champion by talking through your own moves. (NOTE: If your opponent(s) can hear you, this may not be a good idea.)\n* When you're learning to shoutcast, if there's a professional shoutcaster that particularly stands out to you, watch him or her closely and note his or her style of narrative. For example, I tend to take after Deficio over in the EU LCS, because, like my own style of public speaking I've come to know and refine as I give presentations in my college courses (I'm a college student as I write this), he tends to sound really excited as a big play mounts up, for example, whereas some of the others may only raise their voice a little bit. Whomever suits your personal style of speaking, listen to them and note where they place their emphasis (is it on patch integration? turrets? objectives? champion kills?).\n* Get a job as, or volunteer as, an announcer for a local sports team! (This requires very little sports knowledge, by the way; I speak from experience here.) Because professional shoutcasting tends to be similar to sports commentary, knowing how to announce, for example, a basketball game, comes in REALLY handy. It also helps you know the lingo (going with our example for basketball, what a violation is, what a personal foul is, what the penalty is for each offence, etc.) of the sport. Then, immerse yourself in League of Legends lingo. (What's a Baron Power Play? What are the bonuses awarded on the next Drake and how will they affect the objective-winners? etc.) Note where these things occur in your games, and be ready to give 30-second spots to answer those questions.\n\nNow obviously this is just a partial list of suggestions, but I would hope any Rioter reading this would agree with me on at least one of them. But take these suggestions to heart, budding shoutcaster, and get ready to launch an amazing experience! Happy shoutcasting! {{summoner:4}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"HandheldBrandon","date":"2015-01-29T04:26:18.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have a question as well.\n\nWhen you guys Shoutcast what goes on in preparation for the shoutcast?\n\nLike are you guys given a list of players and their roles or do you already know ahead of time?","replies":[{"poster":"VG elfsoamah","date":"2015-01-29T04:37:12.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya thats a good question that I want to know as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VG elfsoamah","date":"2015-01-29T04:36:34.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Phreak!
