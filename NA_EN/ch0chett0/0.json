The annoying part is that it seems to be fixing itself at random. Sometimes when I delete the \"gameflow-patcher-lock:\" it works, but sometimes it does not. Sometimes when I open the launcher like an admin it works, sometimes it does not. Or when I log in in here. It seems the problem appears only when I am at home. Because from monday to friday I am using a different internet connection and the launcher is fine, but when I come back home and connect to my WiFi the messege appears.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-26T00:13:05.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your router or firewall settings are likely creating blocks from reaching the authentication server.
