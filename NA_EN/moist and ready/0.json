Maybe just to promote epsorts hype. Either way. Not the best example. Most 975 skins with animation changes or sound changes have it on like 1 skill in particular, such as Popstar Ahri having her Q make sounds, but the rest just having a pink hue to them.\n\nI think it would be nice, still, and I think it's a possibility that they would do it, I just wanted to point out the PT Draven thing mainly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"weihe123","date":"2014-12-29T03:39:05.480+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, it's not a guitar, more of a synthetic keyboard flash riff, i guess?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2014-12-30T00:41:18.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As nice as it would be. \n\nI doubt it'll happen because it's hurts the clarification of her spells by sound. \n\n\nAlthough I don't think much actually changes with her overall.
