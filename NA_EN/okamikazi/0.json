I feel like (NO Proof) that it just earns you way less money through the game.  So many times mid-late game I don't even get to LOOK at the minion line before the mid laner blows it up.  This is fine if you're Coin or Spellthief, but Relic shield is just ... so bad for money I feel.  I sit there with 3 - 4 orbs (depending on how far it's upgraded) 75% of the time, where coin and thief are constantly genearting you money still most likely","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-06T23:57:15.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why riot needs to replace relic shield line with a modified [murksphere](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Murksphere) line.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-11-06T22:56:15.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is why ancient coin is better then relic shield. so what your losing 300hp but to gain mana regen and better hp regen and better gold income and 10% cd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2016-11-06T22:30:05.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wish zzs allowed executes procs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2016-11-06T21:10:57.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mid- late game its enough to pretty much 100-0 a minion with it, Id say the bigger problem is people just clearing the wave before you even get to auto a minion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-11-06T21:06:49.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This and also let Thresh's autos execute if he walks into melee range, I've seen so many people struggle with getting the minion kills with him even with his e damage","replies":[]}]}
