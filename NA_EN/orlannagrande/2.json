I guess he disconnected again because he just afk’d at his tower. \n\nOf course I’m gonna be greedy and dive him instead of getting a free tower. On any other day, it would have been easy. Somehow this Level 4 afk Pantheon took an extra 2 seconds to die despite me being Level 8. He was just too tanky for a level 4.  I flash out after killing him because I ate too many tower shots but didn’t get out of range before the last one caught me. \n\nAnyway we lost a 5v4 in the end.","replies":[]}
