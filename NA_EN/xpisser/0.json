It is like the game didn't finish as my client keeps trying to reconnect me to the game but I keep getting a message \"Failed to Reconnect\" \r\n\r\nWhat is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T22:00:51.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been seeing an abnormal amount of these ghost games over the past two days, but they do seem to be clearing up after enough time.
