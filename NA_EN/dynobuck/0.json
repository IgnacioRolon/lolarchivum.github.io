My internet cuts out and DC me from a game, I join back a minute later and finish the game. I play another match where the power goes out in a storm for literally one second in my area. I have to wait 8 mins for the internet to reboot and I finish the game from there, we even won. I get a notice that I am placed in low prio because of \"Leaving that game\". Riot needs to create a better system for this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T21:50:27.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The leaverbuster system will place players in a lower priority queue after multiple leaves, and not just a single game.  You can be placed in an LPQ regardless of intent because all leaves causes others a negative experience.  Even if you returned to the match, there's still a period of time where the match was down a player.  More information on this can also be found in our [Leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)FAQ.  \n\nI know some things like storms are out of your control, but if you are having any other issues I'd be glad to help.  \n\nOtherwise, I hope that gets some ducks in a row.\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"WynnCat","date":"2016-07-28T22:18:25.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for posting this I totally feel you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-07-28T21:54:14.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is this Riot's fault?
