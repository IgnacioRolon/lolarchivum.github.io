The thing is that after installing, when it comes to the client update part is taking forever, with an ETA of near 3000 minutes. I checked my internet connection to see if it was going slow or something, but speed was ok (4.5 - 7 Mbps according to the test). Also, if I interrupt the download, the next time I try to start it the panel says that data is corrupt or something and I'm forced to uninstall and start over again. This is starting to be frustrating, is there something I can do to solve this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-06T18:42:30.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grats on your new rig!
