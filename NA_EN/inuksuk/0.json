I myself have every little tolerance of any kind of verbal abuse. Yes I consider &quot;gg ez&quot; as verbal abuse since it degrades the other team and is unsportman like. \r\n\r\nLook at it this way: In real life you would not go up to the other team and say to their faces &quot;good game, that was easy&quot;. Doing that would get you in a instant confrontation. When you play games online your conduct should not be any different. \r\n\r\nYou should always show the other team respect (even if they may not deserve it). By showing respect we can all work together to build a stronger Community.","replies":[]}
