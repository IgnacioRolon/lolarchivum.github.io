I was placed in lower priority queue for 5 games because of this. I'm confused, do we have a 'No Emergency Policy?'\n\nNote: I was forced to evacuate for safety reasons, and this was a normal blind pick match.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-07T21:12:14.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}} \n\nWow that really sucks, and we definitely don't want anyone to get punished for needing to tend to an IRL emergency. Hopefully, everyone was okay and your neighbor didn't lose anything too important!!!\n\nThe system shouldn't punish you for leaving a match for the first time and you won't get any type of LPQ or leaver penalties. That should only happen after the system starts to notice a trend in left games.","replies":[]}]}
