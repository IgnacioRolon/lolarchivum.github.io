I'm still very new to LoL and very inexperienced with Xayah but I thought it'd be pretty cool to see them fight together. I'm still playing vs AI just to get my bearings so if you play with me, just keep in mind I have no idea what I'm doing. If you're the type of person who takes newbies under your experienced and supple wing, I could use some guiding too. I just mainly need someone to play with. Like I'm so lonely, guys. I don't really know this community yet so I don't know if this'll blow up in my face or something like that but just thought I'd throw this out there.\r\n  {{champion:497}} {{champion:498}} Pls... call me...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T21:26:24.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically this kind of post would best fit under Player Recruitment or Gameplay, but it looks like you already found someone to partner up with ^_^!\n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phatmage","date":"2017-10-16T21:13:13.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there summoner!
