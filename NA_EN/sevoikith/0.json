The best thing you can do to help stop botting is to make sure you report anyone you suspect of it in the post game lobby. That will alert us to look into the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SweatyCahckMeat","date":"2017-07-10T06:08:36.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play coop vs ai to learn new champs rather than just jump into a normal game, and at least ever game besides maybe one or two every now and again there is at least one bot maybe 2-3 running it down mid non-stop and its infuriating. Usually you can come back or just snowball but then it comes down to having to fight a 13/0 mid laner and it sucks. I don't know why this is a thing but it pisses me off trying to learn a new champ and having to deal with a 0/21 bot that has just fed out their ass all game. I hope riot does something to fix this soon especially seeing as it ruins the game for new players who have to play coop vs ai.","replies":[{"poster":"Bloodtime","date":"2017-07-11T05:17:54.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bloodtime","date":"2017-07-11T05:16:46.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen dude, In every co.op. game it seems. They pretty much always run mid. Obviously do not talk. They just auto attack and feed the hell out of the enemy bots, making the games like 5 mins longer because the fed bots are a pain in the ass. When you look at the account its obvious too. Not to name shame, but this guy i just reported was level 30. Went Sivir mid, and fed to all hell. Went like 0-20-1, I really doubt any level 30 is going to have that KDA on a bot match. Then when I searched him up on lolking he's been doing the same thing for days. Doesn't have any runes or masteries. I assuming this is just an account that is going to be sold. {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]}
