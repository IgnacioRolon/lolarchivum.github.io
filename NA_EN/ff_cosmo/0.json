I think this has been around since 2-3 patches, not sure exactly. Basically, when Aurelion Sol uses Q and manages to hit an enemy champion (or dunno, generally when it detonates to enemies, being minions or champs), all sounds near that spell become really, really low in volume (even quotes !). All enemies spells have lower sound, while ASol&#039;s W becomes soundless. It&#039;s 100 % reproducable, at least in my games.\n\nIs this an issue that happens only to my game? If so, how can i fix that :P","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-12T19:26:07.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ff CoSmo, thanks for the report! \n\nThis sounds familiar, so I don't think it's something that's just on your end.
