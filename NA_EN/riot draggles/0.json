(Team Jam Packed - Thunderdome XI)","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**tl;dr Vote on the themes below. The top 3 will be used to make minigames in 48 hours!**\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/yrTISMY.jpg\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nEvery so often at Riot, we run an internal 48-hour hackathon called [Thunderdome](http://thunderdome.riotgames.com/). Last year, Team Player Voted Content (PVC) built and shipped an unofficial minigame, [Ziggs Arcade Blast](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/thunderdome-team-pvc/niZ1zuNk-shipped-ziggs-arcade-blast-an-arcade-themed-2d-platformer-made-in-48-hours-with-your-input). We were super excited to see many of you participating in the discussion, giving your input during development, and ultimately enjoying the game!\r\n\r\nThis year, we’re getting the gang back together—plus a few more—for one last hurrah, and to mark the occasion… we wanna go bigger.\r\n\r\nPresenting **JAM PACKED**: 3 teams. 3 minigames. 48 hours. And we need your help.\r\n\r\n(Almost) anything goes. No restrictions on engine, platform or genre. Discord shitposting. And a whole lot of caffeine.\r\n\r\nWe’re gonna take you along every step of the way, but first, we need your input! Below you’ll see a list of themes in the League universe. Vote on your favorite, and the top 3 will be used to make the upcoming minigames. Voting will close on March 9 @ midday PST.\r\n\r\n_Big disclaimers so I don’t get in trouble: Typically the goal of Thunderdome projects isn't to ship something to the public, and it's important to note that this isn’t the team’s main goal either. We want to focus on openly sharing the dev process with everyone. This will likely be the last time we ship something directly from a Thunderdome team, so let’s go out with a jam._\r\n\r\n_These games, unlike League of Legends, Blitzcrank’s Poro Roundup, Mechs vs Minions, etc., are NOT official Riot products. When and if we get them into your hands, they’re probably going to be buggy, janky and unfinished, but we’re aiming to share them anyway. We cool? We cool._\r\n\r\n* **You can follow us now on: **\r\n* https://instagram.com/teamjampacked\r\n* https://twitter.com/teamjampacked  \r\n* … and we’ll have a Discord server set up closer to launch!\r\n\r\nVoting will close on March 9 @ midday PST, and development will officially begin on March 14 @ 12pm PST.","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2018-03-02T22:08:02.202+0000","up_votes":100,"down_votes":2,"body":"PENTAKILL RHYTHM BASED ACTION PLATFORMER PLEASE","replies":[{"poster":"Catarina","date":"2018-03-02T23:06:46.807+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"THAT WOULD BE SO RAD, I LOVE PENTAKILL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Nekomaru","date":"2018-03-02T22:06:01.278+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":1,"body":"SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK\n{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2018-03-02T22:05:21.378+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":2,"body":"Woah, back already!?

Pretty easy.  But the team might decide to go with the platform rhythm game (like Doozku mentioned) instead.  Or a dating sim.  Or a clicking game.  Or something ENTIRELY different.\n\nUnlikely they'll be able to do, like an MMO, or a giant multiplayer FPS, or a deep and nuanced RPG in the time.  That'd be... challenging.\n\nThere are *a lot* of options right now.  Just keep in mind mini game, and 48 hrs, and you shouldn't go wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"StarGuardianWeeb","date":"2018-03-03T22:39:31.247+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=iGEBjVEQ,comment-id=0015000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-02T23:48:54.440+0000)\n>\n>  But the team might decide to go with the platform rhythm game (like Doozku mentioned) instead. ** Or a dating sim.**  Or a clicking game.
