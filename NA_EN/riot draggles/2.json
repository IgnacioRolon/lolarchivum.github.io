They better make you say oh god and oh yeah when watch and play them.\n\nBecause thats what I feel makes LuL an awesome game, I often find development when given the choice to do what ever they want, tends to become lazy and then focuses on a gimick or concept as the reason to their \"awesome\"ness, resulting in the achivement of a different word. This often is due to trying to be \"PG\" in a work place environment, yet you can still achive an \"oh god why\" and a \"oh yeah haha\" reception and deliver without being sexual in any way or without it being in fact another word?\n\nI'm going to be honest, your problem is not words, it's the controller, just make all of your games use a 2001 Jet Air Craft joy stick, and let them figure it out; it is a propper medium to bind and connect every aspect required to achive Awesome PG.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}} Enjoy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKzGct28Vxw","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-03-14T17:33:20.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feature MF in the pool party or star guardian one!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"OMG RITO PLZ","date":"2018-03-13T23:12:58.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"star guardian pool party and project, says so much bout lol community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draclen","date":"2018-03-09T23:59:40.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope Jhin is somewhere in the project one.","replies":[]}]}
