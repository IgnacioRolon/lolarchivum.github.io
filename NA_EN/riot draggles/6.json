{"poster":"Riot Draggles","date":"2018-04-18T23:09:06.902+0000","title":"Clash NA beta - Whatâ€™s changing? Your feedback in action!","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/e81C2ZU.png\n\nHey all!\n\nThanks so much for participating in the Clash beta in NA! We got a ton of useful information, bug reports, feedback, memes and big plays from you all, and we wanted to share what we&rsquo;re doing next as we ramp up for launch. \n\nFirst up, we saw **over 100,000 players** take part over the three days of the beta. Holy shit, y&rsquo;all.\n\nWe&rsquo;re so glad so many of you had a great time playing Clash - the new ways you&rsquo;re thinking about pick/ban, practicing specific comps, map rotations and objective control. It warmed our lil&rsquo; macro-loving hearts.\n\nWe knew some things wouldn&rsquo;t quite hit the bar yet. We are still in beta! Don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;ll have a survey in your email to share more feedback soon. \n\nHere&rsquo;s 10 things we&rsquo;re looking at after your feedback from the NA Clash beta:\n\n#1. Clarity, tooltips and UI\n* **_You said_: It was sometimes unclear to navigate Clash with some confusing tooltips, incorrect information and missing animations**\nWe&rsquo;ll be implementing better error messaging, tooltips, and cleaning up some of the errors you probably saw. We&rsquo;ll make sure you have a way to navigate Clash before entering a tournament to see where you go after each win. We&rsquo;ll also spell &ldquo;ineligible&rdquo; correctly.\n\n#2. Substitutes\n* **_You said_: The substitute process felt rushed, and &ldquo;Unknown Error&rdquo; issues got in the way of inviting**\nWe knew the tooltip would be an issue going into the beta, so the &ldquo;Unknown Error&rdquo; is already fixed for launch. The error came from the invitee being too high tier than the player they were replacing (which was also a mistake in our FAQ). We&rsquo;ll make it clearer ahead of time what the restrictions are on substitute players, and we&rsquo;re exploring larger improvements to the sub system post-launch, including having a longer time window to make sub selections before lock-in. \n\n* **_You said_: Substitutes should last for more than one day, or you should have access to more substitute players**\nClash&rsquo;s substitute system is designed for emergencies, not a &ldquo;6th/7th person&rdquo; on the roster. Introducing a 6th/7th creates really awkward situations for prizing - do we treat the extra players as a full teammate, and allow people who don&rsquo;t play to get free stuff, or only give rewards based on participation, in which case being the 6th player on a team is strictly worse than being one of the starting five somewhere else? While it&rsquo;s a little harder to understand, swapping in people for a specific day affords a lot more flexibility to both the team and the sub.\n\n#3. SMS verification\n* **_You said_: Inputting your phone number for SMS sometimes bugged out**\nWe&rsquo;ll be adding a flag dropdown in place of country codes, and continuing to make sure that as many mobile carriers as possible can accept SMS. As a reminder, VOIP phone numbers (Skype, Google Voice etc) will not work, as that would be an abusable way to play on more than one account.\n\n* **_You said_: SMS verification for smurfing only partially solves the issue**\nYou&rsquo;re right! We&rsquo;ll never have a 100% deterrent for smurfs in Clash, but we&rsquo;re committed to removing them where possible. SMS is just one piece of the puzzle, and we&rsquo;ll have more ways to remove smurfs from the ecosystem, as well as encouraging higher-tier players to enter tournaments on their mains.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lkVbsoT.jpg\n\n#4. Matchmaking and smurfing\n* **_You said_: Facing obvious smurfs is a game-breaker**\nFirst up: not every match you lose, even if you lose badly, is due to smurfing or matchmaking issues. Sometimes games get out of hand, even between perfectly balanced teams. This is a single-elimination tournament, which means we have to pit you against a lot of different people - some will be worse than you, some will be better. \nThat said, we&rsquo;ll be penalizing smurfs we find, and using some behind the scenes matchmaking to help make sure any smurfs we miss start moving up through the Clash tier system, getting them back to their true tier faster. When we go to a global release, we&rsquo;ll also have much clearer guidelines on smurf detection, reporting and penalties.\n\n* **_You said_: Some of the 16-team bracket winners were verifiable smurfs**\nWe&rsquo;ve taken immediate action on those accounts, starting with removing all earned Clash rewards. For launch, we will have more robust processes in place to discourage smurfing.\n\n* **_You said_: Sometimes matchmaking felt off with teams of vastly different skill in the same tier**\nWe uncovered at least one particularly nasty bug in this beta test that was creating some rather unpleasant matches for players who came back after playing Day 1. We were able to adjust our algorithm for Day 3, but apologies to those affected. Additionally, we&rsquo;re going to adjust our team MMR algorithm to account for some edge cases where one high rated player could group with four low rated players and end up in much lower tiers than they should. Beta tests are invaluable for these kinds of matchmaking issues, because real data beats our test data any day of the week. We&rsquo;re going to keep tightening up these calculations before (and even after) launch, and additionally evaluate whether we need more tiers if competition feels truly stacked.\n\n#5. Tickets\n* **_You said_: The ticket buying process was a bit awkward, and it&rsquo;s unclear why the three-for-BE restriction is in place**\nThis was another feature that didn&rsquo;t make it into our beta build; we&rsquo;re enabling multiple BE purchases in one transaction. \nAs for the BE ticket restriction: In order to give the best possible prizes for running the gauntlet (like high tier skins), we need to gate a premium entry behind an RP purchase. We want to make sure that (aside from prizing) the Clash experience is identical no matter how you choose to enter, but for those of you that want to go ham, you have that option available. This also gives you the opportunity to enter all three days for BE if you don&rsquo;t end up winning a single bracket.\nWe&rsquo;ll likely be changing the ticket system to have a clearly defined &ldquo;basic&rdquo; and &ldquo;premium&rdquo; entry with different individual ticket types, but that&rsquo;ll be after launch.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VQSjDcu.png\n\n#6. Team creation\n* **_You said_: You want to be able to break apart your team, permanently kick players, or form new teams throughout the weekend**\nTeams in Clash should win, lose and improve together. Clash teams are locked for the full weekend, partly because the easier it is to leave a team, the more potential problems this can cause. Assuming we did allow you to blow up a team and start over, who makes that decision? If a single player can just depart from your roster consequence-free, they potentially leave the rest of the squad in the lurch. All those other players then no longer can really play Clash, and may not be able to reform a team in time. Bear in mind that we can&#039;t just hold a vote, because that&#039;s easy to abuse by just saying you&#039;ll refuse to come back unless the team disbands, potentially holding everyone hostage. \nAlso, allowing you to leave a team only if that team has lost creates a weird set of incentives. If I know some of my teammates aren&#039;t around later in the weekend, do we throw the final match on Friday so that we can still make another team? Or am I stuck in a squad that can&#039;t play, and forced to get fewer rewards because I was foolish enough to win my games? And if we allow players on teams that won to disband, we get back to the same problem about whose decision that is, but the severity is increased 10x because other people&#039;s entries and potential prizes are on the line. \nFor these reasons, we&rsquo;re not going to be changing at the moment, but we will continue to make it clear that your lock-in is for the whole weekend so you don&rsquo;t feel misled and trapped into a team.\n\n* **_You said_: Finding a team to play with is hard**\nWe&rsquo;ll be partnering with op.gg to release a team building tool to find other players like you! There&rsquo;ll be ways to filter by skill level, position and even playstyle to try and find the most suitable matches for you and your squad.\n\n#7. Eligibility and participation\n\n* **_Some of you said_: It&rsquo;s not clear how to get out of Honor 0-1 to play Clash**\nWe recently [lowered the requirement](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-86-notes#patch-honor) to get from level 0 to level 2, and we&rsquo;re continuing to monitor those changes. It&rsquo;s something we know can seem like a grind, but just getting honored isn&rsquo;t sufficient for climbing - you still need to ensure you&rsquo;re _playing to win_ consistently to get back to level 2.\n\n* **_We also heard_: What if Clash was double elimination?**\nDouble elimination brackets take a lot of time, and can end up punishing the teams in the winners&rsquo; bracket really heavily. There are some situations where winning teams would have to wait hours for their final matches. We could nerd out here about bracket formats and stuff but we&rsquo;ve only got so much space in this post.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NjlxE9Y.jpg\n\n#8. Rewards\n* **_You said_: The new rewards for Clash feel pretty good, but it&rsquo;s not clear how and when you earn them**\nWe&rsquo;ll be adding some more information around when exactly you can expect to receive your capsule (hint: it&rsquo;s when you lose out of a bracket) and some better graphics to differentiate between 1-ticket and 5-ticket entries. We&rsquo;ll publish full loot tables for Clash at launch, too, so you know what you&rsquo;re fighting for.\n\n#9. Other known issues\n* **_You said_: Not transitioning to champ select and losing feels bad**\nWe&rsquo;ve been specifically [looking for this bug](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/hapd2crT-need-more-clash-come-play-clash-and-kill-bugs-this-wednesday-april-18th) and similar ones for a while now. If you never made it to champ select during the Clash beta, you should have your tickets returned to you already. If you experienced other issues like bugsplats or game crashes, check out our [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) guide.\n\n* **_You said_: Voice chat breaking after games are over is jarring**\nThis is being fixed. We&rsquo;re going to make the transition for your team out of Clash and back to normal League a lot smoother, rather than unceremoniously booting you out of voice chat and your party.\n\n* **_You said_: You got timed out while inviting teammates, entering tickets, or locking in**\nWe fixed this!\n\n* **_You said_: The time in champ select after the last lock-in is too short to edit runes**\nWe&rsquo;ll likely be adding 10-20 seconds to the finalization phase in champ select.\n\n* **_You said_: Only having one flight time to play on Days 2 and 3 can be tough for players on the west coast, and east coast players may end up playing very late on day 3**\nWe&rsquo;re looking at moving start times to better accommodate early starts and late nights, but NA is a big territory with several time zones. Adding several flights of games would make matchmaking very poor as the population splits.\n\n* **_You said_: Scouting issues were real**\nThis&rsquo;ll be fixed too! If a player subbed into a team, they would break scouting data for all players to the right of them - because spaghetti.\nWe&rsquo;re exploring offering more robust scouting data post-launch, making it more comprehensive, but no firm plans here yet. What sorts of things do you want to see?\n\n#10. One more thing...\n* From all the teams working on Clash, thank you. Your participation helped us locate a lot of areas of improvement before we go to a global launch, but we&rsquo;re not stopping now. If you took part you&rsquo;ll receive a survey link in the coming days - please fill this out, it&rsquo;ll help us make Clash better for the future. Oh, and you get to keep all your banners, logos, tickets and loot for the main launch of Clash, which May be coming soon&trade;.\n\nKeep calm and Clash on,\n\nClash dev team","replies":[{"poster":"MasterChief1801","date":"2018-04-19T02:28:53.449+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":15,"body":"We should implement a pause feature into clash so each team gets 5 minutes of pause time in case of bug splats/dcs/technical problems or even just to think/reset","replies":[{"poster":"ForFoxSakes","date":"2018-04-19T03:33:04.053+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":2,"body":"This isnt the LCS where huge $$$ is on the line.

Who was the coolest? Which one could probably beat Hercules in a 1v1? I would always run out of space at the bottom of my paper because I was very bad at drawing knockout brackets, and that's part of the reason I feel most comfortable writing on squared paper.

We won anyway, but I think that makes the scouting a little too easy.

Caitlyn was high mastery/played % for all of us. Our actual ADC had Caitlyn as third pick. Seeing match history is vastly more valuable than most played/mastery. I'd hoped that Match History would've been easy to access, and in fact you could see that there was a disabled tab for it, because there *was* no Clash Match History in existence before that weekend.\n\nTL;DR: Match History is way more useful, and will probably be implemented in the future anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"0367","date":"2018-04-19T01:47:56.572+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree, in ranked i played mostly jg but for clash i was top lane, and every opponent i fought banned sejuani, i think it shuld either show lane % or just show what lane they are registered for that current team, cuz i also saw teams where 4 of them would have 3 or 4 adc's as their main 5 and it just got confusing","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FF1224","date":"2018-04-18T23:31:07.388+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor is a very ambiguous system and the checkpoint system is a good change, however there still doesn't seem to be enough transparency (forsenCD) when it comes to reforming.

If I understand correctly, the Tier you belong to is dependent on your Rank/MMR which is understandable to keep games with Bronze vs Challenger from occurring. What doesn't make sense is how a player gets less VP for victories if they are in a lower Tier. These games are between other players of roughly the same skill on either end of the Tier spectrum so why should a Tier 4 get less than a Tier 1 for doing essentially the same thing? Players already receive rewards for getting higher ranks in ranked game play so why should those same ranks with their own rewards dictate what rewards a player gets in a completely different game mode? If Riot is implying that they think higher ranks should get more rewards then why not give those rewards for getting higher ranks instead of messing with rewards given in a game mode that has 0 effect on ranked game modes?\n\nI'll admit I'm salty I didn't get a Blue Banner after going 2/0, 0/2, 3/0 but it makes me curious why if I went 2/0, 3/0, 4/0 effectively winning every game every day that I wouldn't get a Purple banner.\n\nEDIT: Also, is the banner supposed to be view-able on your profile by other summoners?

Adding even one minute actually ends up adding quite a few minutes for everyone in that bracket.  And that's only part of the logistics part of the issue.  Even in pro-play, pauses are heavily controlled and often only granted because of a glitch in the game and even then players are not allowed to communicate with each other during that time.\n* Regarding changing teams - you entered as a team not as a free agent.  You live as a team.  You die as a team.  Think of it as a group project (you got to choose the group), you can't change your group because your group isn't pulling their weight.  But you _do_ now know to choose a better group next time.\n* Regarding multiple flights or more options for when to start - more flights or more time options means a decrease in game quality.  So those who are already complaining about unfair games, you should be thankful for there being fewer flights, because this is what's preventing that team of bronze from going against a full team of plats every game.\n* Regarding subs - adding more players to the roster means that someone's gonna take a hit for it**.  For everyone to earn as much as they can, I do believe that overall the current system _is _ actually the best solution.\n* There seems to be a misconception for those who said their team couldn't play due to multiple players being unable to play that day, and thus you were also unable to play.  You **_WERE_** allowed to sub for another team and therefore play (can't blame Riot on this one).\n* Regarding adding roles and/or lining up drafting phase with roles - that's not information teams _want_ to give out.  It only puts them at a disadvantage.  So what prevents a team from all choosing fill as their role?  You want it because it helps you, but they don't want it because it helps you.  General rule of thumb in tournaments the fewer champs/roles you play, the more of a liability you are to your team.\n* For those who said you couldn't play because you didn't have a team - the Clash Beta Discord allowed players to find a team or find players for their team, so there are resources available - use them.  You might even make new friends in the process.\n* For those who said you couldn't play because your honor level wasn't high enough - level 2 is not too high of an honor level.  Every summoner starts at level 2.  If your honor level is below level 2, you know what you did wrong - if not, [Riot Games Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) would be happy to help you out.\n* Regarding Scouting - there were bugs with scouting especially when subs were involved, Riot already posted that in the known issues.  Hopefully this bug will have been squashed by full release.\n* Regarding Recent/Clash Match History - seems that many didn't notice the option, but there was a Clash History tab on the Scouting page.  It wasn't working at the time, but based on the fact that it exists, I would imagine Riot has plans to implement it for the full release.\n* For those with suspicions about smurf(s) in their games - send a support ticket to [Riot Games Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), Riot will look into it. \n\nSpecial shoutout and thank you to SchoolofNami, Kayn the Team Coordinator, Mister, and Peach, these were individuals (unaffiliated with Riot and these are only their Discord names, because I don't know all of their summoner names) that gave up a hours and hours of their time to help others on the Discord server and asked for nothing in return.\n\n**If you want details, just give me a scenario and I'd be happy to go into further details.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saint Haven","date":"2018-04-19T04:55:20.525+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clash was the most fun me and my friends have had in league thus far. Being in an environment where tryharding is utmost encouraged, it breeds teamwork and intentionality. Even the rough bits like inting first blood away was fun because the environment allows you to have justifyable reason to give and take feedback. It was fun pretending to be pros, as low elo players haha (Myself being only SII currently, one other being SIV, everyone else being Bronze). Every part of it was so fun! Thank you so much :'-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naut lmpressed","date":"2018-04-19T00:49:13.162+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was some frustration, poor communication, and bugginess... But overall, I was really surprised and pleased with the Clash experience. My biggest takeaway from Clash is how incredible it can feel to play with a team where every player is truly invested in playing to win as a team. My Clash team tried harder to win as a team than any solo/queue or flex team I've played with... and we were complete strangers only a week ago. I really appreciate how this mode brought together people who care about teamwork, regardless of rank or experience. Thank you for listening to our feedback, but also a huge thank you for trying out such an ambitious idea. \n{{item:3110}}  {{champion:201}}inator","replies":[]},{"poster":"0dyssey Kayn","date":"2018-04-19T17:37:46.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay Op.gg will take over my job of team coordinator!!\n\n\nYEa I'm Kayn the Team Coordinator from the Clash Discord","replies":[]},{"poster":"TajikDaSummoner","date":"2018-04-19T03:57:15.256+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope by \"accommodate late nights\" you don't just mean only moving flight times up.  I work nights  and the times were 7 & 10 pm my time.  I get off work at 11pm...  Literally impossible for me to participate short of swapping my work schedule (which is set three weeks in advance and clash was announced, what?  A week?)  I had been looking forward to this for months, feelsprettyfuckingbadman! Perhaps have a late night flight and evening flight between the two flights instead of two that are essentially the same shift, or maybe a midday flight so us night-shifters can fit one in before work; Though what happens if it runs long? Late night seems more ideal in all honesty... (Like 12pm central maybe, que times might be longer, but it is the weekend so I feel like odds are more people can stay up than call off work. Somebody has to stock shelves, clean, clerk and etc on the weekend evenings guys. (I understand most people work/school during the day, but feels bad to feel like a second class player when I see no evidence of concern for things being too early or awkwardly timed.)

I think this is a great idea and would love to see it weekly or monthly as something for teams to compete in.
