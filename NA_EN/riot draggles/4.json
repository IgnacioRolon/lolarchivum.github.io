(Team Jam Packed - Thunderdome XI)","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/4Kly4Oy\n\nHi everyone!\n\nIt’s been a wild ride, but we did it. We made 3 mini-games in 48 hours, with the help of your thoughts and feels along the way. And now we’re so excited to release… \n\n**Star Guardian: Insomnia** – Blast Void monsters and save the city as Star Guardian Jinx in this bullet-hell side-scroller.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ODS7H4M\n\n**PROJECT.EXEcute** – Play as PROJECT Lucian or Vayne as you fight through swarms of killer robots. Team up with a local duo or tackle the hoards solo in the twin-stick shooter.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/EBcyNAD\n\n**Super Zac Ball** – Challenge a local friend or a bot to a game of Super Zac Ball, a sports arcade game where each character has their own ~~Super ability~~ unique playstyle (whoops, earlier un-caffeinated ideas crept through there).\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Fmu4VlB\n\n**Download all three mini-games in one package here!**\n**([64-bit (recommended)](https://d3a99h1uu682xq.cloudfront.net/JamPackedDisc-0.2-Win64.exe) / [32-bit (this might be bad)](https://d3a99h1uu682xq.cloudfront.net/JamPackedDisc-0.2-Win32.exe)**)\n\n_Disclaimers: These games, unlike League of Legends, Blitzcrank’s Poro Roundup, Mechs vs Minions, etc., are NOT official Riot products. They are unoptimized and may not be compatible with all machines._\n\nHuge thank you to everyone who participated in the playtests and chatted with us throughout development. We wouldn’t have made it without your encouragement, live input, and memes. Y’all are awesome.\n\nHead over to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teamjampacked/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teamjampacked) if you’d like to see some behind-the-scenes footage of the madness, or drop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/jHvdTmu) to ask questions, share game stories, and post your high scores. Otherwise… glhf!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot GMang","date":"2018-03-17T03:00:55.837+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Extremely legitimate and official Super Zac Ball [strategy guide](https://i.imgur.com/hQKobtS.jpg)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hQKobtS.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesterCapp","date":"2018-03-16T21:10:57.077+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woot!
