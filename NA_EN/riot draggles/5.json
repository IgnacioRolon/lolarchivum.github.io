This is making tier restrictions more strict than we intend, so we’re turning off the four division restriction on high tiers until next patch. \r\n\r\n**Until we fix the bug, you’ll be able to queue with players within one tier of you, even at high levels of play. **\r\n\r\nGiven the options, we’d rather temporarily revert to the old ruleset than block almost everybody in Plat and Diamond from playing together in their placements. When next patch comes around, we’ll ship the bugfix and return high-tier restrictions to their regular settings.","replies":[]}
