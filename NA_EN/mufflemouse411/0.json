How can I repeal the ban or prove that I have reformed? I know a lot of people say that if you&#039;ve gotten permabanned, you don&#039;t deserve another chance, and that Riot is not willing to repeal any bans, but I have serious anger management issues which got the better of me in the last game I played with my friends. I would also like to note that I never received a chat suspension, or if I did it was so long ago that I cannot even remember. I think it was 4-5 months ago that I got a 2-week ban, and I hadn&#039;t been toxic since that until this one game. I&#039;ve never fed or trolled in games, and I&#039;m more than willing to disable /all chat if I return on this account. I know that it is possible to remove a permanent ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-09-26T17:09:56.033+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

The only way it can be removed is if it was placed incorrectly.\n\nRiot uses a tiered punishment system, where any punishment will increase your tier to a more harsh punishment.  The 14 day ban is the final punishment before a permanent ban, so something minor can push you over the edge.  Depending on what you say you can also skip the two levels of chat restriction and jump directly to the 14 day ban.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/tSp0yaq\n\nThis image explains it in a visual way if that helps.\n\nThe TL:DR of it is your account is gone.

It essentially was a ban on the person, that whenever he was caught streaming League, the account he was playing on would be issued an immediate permanent ban.\n\nTyler1's ID ban was the only thing that got lifted - none of the accounts which were permabanned before or during the ID ban were unbanned.

ID ban is harder to get, sure - but it's also much _different_ than a permanent account ban.\n\nThink of a chat ban as a manager of an establishment telling a customer to calm down.\n\nThink of a 14-day suspension as being kicked out of an establishment. You're free to come back. Just be on good behavior.\n\nThink of a permabanned account as being criminally trespassed from an establishment's location. Sure, you could disguise yourself and probably sneak back in without issue (i.e. create a new account).\n\nThink of an ID Ban as being on a terrorist watch list. You're free to travel mate - but you're not coming HERE.\n\nSo, in the end you might be taken off the terrorist watch list and allowed back into the USA. But you're still criminally trespassed from Wal-Mart.\n\nAnyway, hope things work out. If you believe you have reformed, I hope you make a new account and we'll see you on the rift maybe.\n\n[editted, because my post made it seem like I was actively trying to be an a-hole, which was not my intent.
