I have a question I want to discuss today. I have been punished for toxic behaviors around 4 months ago, since then I have been reforming and not flaming at all, and I kept getting 2-3 honor almost each game but unfortunately I have not been able to climb in honor level. I got the season end rewards but I am a little confused. Can anyone explain what is happening? Thanks in advance, have a good one!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T22:34:27.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor level is seperate from season rewards.  Depending on the severity of your recent incidents, it may be a bit to get your honor level 1.  It's good that you're getting honor, but the key here is consistency.  If you still are having bad or dishonorable games in between, you can slow down.  Keep at it, and focus on constantly playing honorably, not just sometimes.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Joyful Hope","date":"2017-11-30T22:44:00.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I just wanted to know if it will ever grow back up, it has been quite a while...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T22:46:12.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It can definitely go back up as you continue to play honorably.  :)  Keep at it!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JÃ¼rgenForestlive","date":"2017-12-01T00:00:57.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will take time before you reach leveling in such thing. If you first get punished by tribunal, you'll struggle to grow. Same if you already been punished with a chat ban, its always easier to get another ban, than get your first.","replies":[{"poster":"Joyful Hope","date":"2017-12-01T00:42:43.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am just curious how much or how many games I need to play in order to grow because sometimes to me it just looks like I will never get key fragments again. I can obtain chests but I can't really get keys, and somehow this stuff gets my motivation lowered in a way that makes me want to quit trying but I guess life goes on. I noticed other people writing posts on how it took them a month to get from honor level 0 to 1 and I have grinded league non stop and nothing happened. And belive me I have changed my behavior and typing and got a lot of honors.","replies":[]}]}]}
