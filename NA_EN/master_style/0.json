It doesn't happen all the time--however, it's happened a lot more recently than it has since the server move.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I've noticed is that I have incredibly high ping when you consider how far I am from the servers. I live in Chicago and I get 15-17 ping on average, yet I've come across people who live farther away (Champaign, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc.) and they get lower ping (constant 10 or 11 ping), which doesn't make sense since the servers are supposed to be in Chicago.\r\n\r\nMy ISP is Comcast in case anybody is wondering.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T18:04:48.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the packet loss has been random then there could be a local issue causing the delays.
