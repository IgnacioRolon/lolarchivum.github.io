When you leave a game, there's a small arrow icon at the top of the client when in the post-game screen. That allows you to download your replay. You can then click the same icon to watch the replay.\n\nOr, you can go to your profile and in match history, the arrow icons for download/play are next to any eligible game.\n\nSince this is Alpha, maybe certain features are being A/B tested and your client isn't there yet. But take another look.\n\nI also looked quickly for a repository for downloaded replays in the client and couldn't find one. I assume you'll be able to access this through a folder somewhere on your drive, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-10T22:35:42.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!
