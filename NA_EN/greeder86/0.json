The chat keeps disconnecting and I'm having problems reconnecting to it most of the time.\r\n\r\n2. When I'm about to get into a game and supposed to get the loading screen I instead get a message that the server didn't respond and I need to retry. At first this could be \"fixed\" by just waiting until people in my game had loaded their game and I could get in afterwards. But now I can't get into the game at all.\r\n\r\nI've reinstalled LoL and closed down all other programs I could think of that's been running during but it doesn't help. Anyone else that experiences this since the latest patch or am I alone?","replies":[{"poster":"Existencexx","date":"2016-05-09T20:19:05.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup ive had bad packet loss allll weekend long","replies":[{"poster":"fairoz","date":"2016-06-08T08:00:33.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me 2 :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-05-09T19:38:59.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please follow the steps (if there are any you haven't completed) on the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure your connection is set up properly.\n\nYou can view your connection by running a traceroute, and sharing the results might show us where it's going wrong.

Getting disconnected from chat and not being able to enter a game after Champ Select all seem to point to some sort of weird connection issue.  Your computer is consistently trying to connect to our Chat servers or to the individual Game Server, but is blocked from doing so (hence the error).  \n\nSometimes this can be a result of Firewalls being turned off, but still active in the background or a variety of other settings.  It's always best to complete the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).
