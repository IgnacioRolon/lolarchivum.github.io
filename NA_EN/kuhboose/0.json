I've just installed League of Legends and it disconnects cca every minute. Dialog window with text: \"_Connection Timeout: The request to the PVP.net server timed out._\" It is also disconnected after finishing the match and I can't see my final stats, give honor, see my grade or whatever in summary screen, I have to click \"_Skip waiting for stats_\" button. Almost after every game, I have to relog because I can't receive any game invitation requests or I can't see my champion mastery levels in my profile. Any ideas?

The Mac client, in particular, is pretty sensitive to drops or inconsistencies in connection, and it's likely that there's an issue with local settings or along your route to the server.
