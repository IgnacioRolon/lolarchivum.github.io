I knew we would lose. I was looking at the other kindred and I heard this.\r\n\r\nWolf: Lamb, tell me a story!\r\nLamb: Well, there was once a pale man with dark hair, a robe, who was very lonely.\r\nWolf: Why was it lonely?\r\nLamb: All things must meet this man.\r\nWolf: Did he chase them off?\r\nLamb: No, they shunned him. So, he took an axe, and split himself. Right down the middle.\r\nWolf: Is that us?\r\nLamb: I am not sure\r\nWolf: So he did it to always have a friend?\r\nLamb: to always have a friend.\r\n\r\nNow, I know this is extremely similar to the facebook one, but, this one has more details. As many of us thought, he killed himself through the waist, but, apparently, he did it down the middle. So technically, he should have a same personality between them, but he dioesn&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2015-10-16T20:17:54.432+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You got the bonus cookie!

Can we really apply logic (and faulty logic, I mean if you cut me in half I wouldn't become a lamb and wolf at all, let alone dividing my personality) to something that isn't even human in the first place? It's *Death.* \n\nIt's symbolic, it's metaphysical, it's not quite literal or material as you think it is. The guy split himself and became two different beings, one of emotion and one of thought (sorta).
