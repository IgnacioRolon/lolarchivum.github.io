You need to learn how unimportant meta actually is, and start identifying what you are doing wrong in stead of blaming your team for not picking the current FotM.","replies":[{"poster":"Xeref","date":"2017-03-14T21:01:43.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I push roam and focus objectives. keep a pink on map. I don't dive for a kill like most people do and i try so hard to get people to stop chasing through the jungle to get a kill. My KDA on my top 10 champs is all above 2.0 but I don't really play the solo carries like Riven and Daruis or Jungle well. But I should have to carry 4 people every game in ranked. No one should have to carry an adc who does 7k champ dmg in 36 minutes. All i'm asking for a a type of rank ban, like hey reports for feed/troll 5 game rank ban. Force them to go to normal and try to learn a new champ there or just maybe see what they did wrong playing were more people are trying to learn different rolls or champs.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-14T23:24:45.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your stats and bloated ego have no bearing on what is considered \"trolling\", which you seem delusional about.","replies":[{"poster":"Xeref","date":"2017-03-15T00:42:19.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"trying to learn a new champ in ranked is trolling. random picks that some pros are able to play in different spots and win a game here and there is trolling.

Please dont pretend you are any kind of expert on what is viable or not.\nEspecially since you play the same 3 champions every game, even picking them into horrible counters (and then get destroyed by them, predictably).\n\nJust about anything is viable in low ELO, especially as off-meta carries a huge advantage in surprise. \nIt works right up until some little  brat tilts themselves over it and throws the game, instead of sucking up and playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Xeref","date":"2017-03-15T22:11:45.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol another keyboard tough guy. I never said I was pro. And more often than not in low elow the random picks don't surprise people, they get owned because in all reality they don't belong there but pros know how to make it work. And I don't tilt because someone picks something stupid to troll. I tilt when they feed a hyper carry and we start getting 3v5. You ever see what a Brand does to an irlia in mid lane? DESTROYS her then roams the map. maybe my last 10 games I've only played 3 champs but I've done a lot of support and even as nami I out heal and dmg most people. and if these random picks were to viable when do oyu not see them in any LCS OG or any other pro tourney?
