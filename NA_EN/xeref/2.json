If we could start baning these feeders and not all the people bitching at the feeders there would be less people being toxic because there are less people int feeding every other game and costing us 2 games worth of LP per game.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-04T05:09:03.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not everyone feeds every game, and im sure you've fed in a few of your games... so why aren't you banned?","replies":[{"poster":"Xeref","date":"2017-07-06T02:12:21.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"now a 1/13/3 blitz support.
