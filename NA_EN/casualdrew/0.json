When you say crash, what do you mean exactly?  For example is it as soon as you join champion select, or when you are loading masteries? When is this happening?  Are you receiving any errors, and what does it say?  Anything helps!","replies":[{"poster":"CasualDrew","date":"2016-08-15T14:34:42.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i think that's just the worst part about it because the client crashes completely at random, be it while i'm in champion select, browsing the store or in a queue, the only time it hasn't crashed has been loading into a game or in a game, I've already tried repairing my client, I've reinstalled league (which seemed to have worked for like, a day or two) now it just seems to crash id say a few times a day usually while i'm in a champion select where after i immediately log in again i'and be placed in a low priority queue, when it does crash there will always be a pop-up box saying that \" the client has stopped responding\" and will only give me the option to close the program.","replies":[]}]}]}
