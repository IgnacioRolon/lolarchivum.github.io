Anything i say will just make you cry harder. If the 2016 election taught us anything, it is that you cant win a logical debate with the the stupid, the irresponsible or the extremely gullible.\n\nTL;DR is that there is zero evidence for this, it would show up as very obvious data, considering the outcome of every game is publicly recorded by various sites using the API, it would be clear and obvious by now. Your personal experience with a tiny sample size means exactly nothing.\n\nThere is also no logical reason for it? Why would riot do this and then make it secret?\nIf nobody \"knows about it\", it would not help them make any money, and serves absolutely no purpose for them or the community.\n\nIt looks like you just want an excuse for loosing.\n\nI will not bother replying to whatever stupidity you vomit up to deny this, because there is nothing else to say. Deny if you want, nobody else cares how deluded you are.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Genocide Victim","date":"2017-01-07T02:35:24.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOLOLOLOL I don't think I've seen this one before","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-01-07T00:01:02.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't spent money on this game for over a year, and when I did, it was around 5 bucks.\n\nSeems good to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2017-01-07T00:15:34.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't spent money and I climb silver V to plat V in 2 weeks.\n\n\nJust gitgood son","replies":[{"poster":"Omg David Stop","date":"2017-01-07T00:19:08.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You are also on OCE which means nothing actually means you have silver in the special olympics so congrats","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2017-01-07T00:19:45.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i have not spend a single cent in like the past 3 years... i seem to be winning just fine. You are hit harder by the reset that is done every season the higher you are but to compensate you also climb significantly higher than others around your rank.
