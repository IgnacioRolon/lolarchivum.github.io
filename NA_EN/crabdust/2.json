The theme of this iteration is Familiar Plus Goodies.\r\n\r\n**Changes are as follows:**\r\n- Champ meters are now the same width as live and just a bit taller.\r\n- Champ meter colors should be much closer to live values.\r\n- Normal damage hangs around a tiny bit longer - similar to live.\r\n- New spell shield border.\r\n- All borders should look cleaner.\r\n- Themed secondary resources like Corki, Jhin, etc still need a bunch of polish - feedback is still valid, but we are aware of their stylistic issues.\r\n- Kled is fixed.\r\n- Grey health should be much clearer.\r\n- Burst damage is brighter on the left and darker on the right hand side to make current health more visible at all times.\r\n- Extra life and unkillable icons got tweaks.\r\n- Shred and defense up icons and systems have been simplified.\r\n- Mana missing bug fixed (related to the manaflow band rune).\r\n- CC text now has a text gradient.\r\n- Level numbers should be centered (hopefully the fix sticks this time).\r\n\r\n**Upcoming:**\r\n- Resource polish (as mentioned above).\r\n- Tower death and Nexus animations.\r\n- Level number colors.\r\n\r\n**New Burst**\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nGo0GhH.gif\r\n\r\n**Live Burst**\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/LHjGoRv.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Off ßrand","date":"2017-11-06T22:40:49.676+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":25,"body":"Tbh I don't see the issue with leaving them as they were with some slight tweaks, it looks like I'm playing Mobile Legends with the way the new health bars look, and I feel like seeing the health bar go solid red for one shots is WAY more satisfying than seeing some orange/yellow color like it is getting changed to","replies":[{"poster":"Finite Duress","date":"2017-11-06T23:07:34.780+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":12,"body":"I disagree, these Health bars look much more polished than the current ones, and a Solid Color is uglier to look at plus it blends in with the Red HP the Enemies have.","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2017-11-06T23:12:44.216+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":8,"body":"Yeah I don't see how red on red is clearer or more satisfying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2017-11-06T22:43:38.707+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"What's mobile-looking about this iteration?","replies":[{"poster":"Slay Z","date":"2017-11-06T23:21:56.126+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":9,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Rió","date":"2017-11-06T23:50:19.323+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slay Z,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=mkJ0zE5m,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2017-11-06T23:21:56.126+0000)\n> \n> it looks drawn-out and click-baity rather than natural and subtle.\n\nIf by 'click-baity' you mean \"attention grabbing\" then I would say that they're accomplishing the exact goal that was set out by this update. Burst damage should _not_ be subtle.\n\nEveryone keeps throwing out this criticism of it looking too much like mobile game UI design, but I would argue it's more in the direction of Arcade-esque (ala Street Fighter etc, but that's likely where mobile games get their inspiration). I think this is the right approach. We want our combat to feel epic and visceral and the UI can go a long way making that happen.\n\nUltimately I think most people's issue here is the timing/shake animation that happens. Personally I like the idea but maybe the timing could to tuned a bit to find a middle ground.","replies":[{"poster":"Atherton Wing","date":"2017-11-07T02:54:07.521+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy crap you're right it's definitely the shake.
