You don’t have to relearn anything and you’re getting some new toys.\n\n**Y Tho?**\nThe purpose of the health bar is to give players the information they need to make tactical decisions—who they can kill, who they should run from, etc. With this update, we’re adding more tools to help teams coordinate attacks and play around important timing windows (please stop hitting the Rammus when Defensive Ball Curl is up).\n\nA general rule is that the more impactful a mechanic, the more visually notable it should be. League has a few massively impactful mechanics that are basically invisible: shreds, defensive buffs, auras, and more. Others like extra life would benefit from standardization and clearer visibility.\n\nIn order to create more interesting tactical choices for players around these systems, we need to communicate them better than they are on Live. The difficulty of League of Legends should stem from making the right decisions, not battling the interface. \n\nThis is just the beginning—we plan on following up with an additional batch of features including heal over time, damage over time, and more.\n\nVisually, we’re all used to what’s on Live, but there’s a big disconnect between what we as players know is a big moment and what gets displayed. We want to start bridging that gap beginning with new supporting animations on events like burst damage and tower destruction.\n\n**Show Me What You Got**\nChamp Burst\nhttps://i.imgur.com/p1ErowC.gif\n\nOld Version for Comparison\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gZw5KgB.gif\n\nHeals\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ipfNDzT.gif\n\nMoment of Death - Structures\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rCDQYJv.gif\n\nInvulnerable\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iG4pKTV.png\n\nDefense Up and Armor Shred\nhttps://i.imgur.com/K8qR4Ei.png\n\nExtra Life / Unkillable\nhttps://i.imgur.com/toF4uaR.png\n\nThemed ammo\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RAs6cnt.png\n\nNon-champ bars\nhttps://i.imgur.com/r8lMjog.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/eFBIDqr.png\n\n**Sacred Minotaurs**\nRest easy, we are going to great lengths to ensure that we don’t mess with actions where you’ve built up lots of muscle memory and mastery around, such as last hitting or objective takes. In the new system, lane minion healthbars are identical to live and objective healthbars (red, blue, dragon, etc) are the same width. Colors are generally similar as well.\n\nHow much health a player has should **ALWAYS **be instantly readable and we are intentionally not showing some of the bigger moments on your own healthbar just to play it safe.\n\nA note about noise: The health bar is not the buff bar. We value an uncluttered game space as much as you do - for example, many of us play with names off. Additions to this space are mainly high impact and low uptime.\n\n**Your feedback is important, especially in a few key areas:**\n- Does last hitting feel the same? What about jungle takes?\n- Do these identifiers show up responsively enough and clearly enough to understand and react to?\n- In what situations do you most notice the changes?\n- Thoughts on additional moments to amp up through animation?","replies":[{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2017-10-24T19:55:08.886+0000","up_votes":325,"down_votes":16,"body":"Please... this thing:\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/lt1Ltv4Rhr8/hqdefault.jpg\n\nWhen?","replies":[{"poster":"Mamacrow","date":"2017-10-25T02:03:07.980+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":2,"body":"If they change it, then please add a option to revert to 'classic' cursor. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finite Duress","date":"2017-10-24T20:38:47.043+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank God, someone mentioned it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ququroon","date":"2017-10-25T06:07:11.878+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":2,"body":"We've responded to the cursor comment in a few places, but for added measure:\n\nThe current cursors are terrible and need work.

When I started playing MOBAs  5+ years ago the sole reason I chose League over other games was its clarity. The main point I cited was that the health bar was extremely clear, having little to no clutter, and I could easily distinguish what was going on with my teammates, opponents, and my own healthbars, almost instantly. Based on the \"champion burst\" clip I have a few concerns. \n\nFor me, it seems that the duration of the \"damage dealt\" animation is too long. Not sure how it feels in game, but my initial impression is that for a second I may think I have more health than I do. Which I know some people will say \"Oh you're just a bad player if you can't realize that\", but in game, this subtle difference could feel like a drastic change. (I may be wrong but I think the current animation for \"damage dealt\" is more of an immediate decay, where the one proposed in the update is a flash, then really quick decay, which may be the reason for how I feel)\n\nThis is just my initial opinion and I'm sure in the end whatever update is made will be for the better, just wanted to give you a warning.

So, a coloured  marker at the hp-Value the effect kicks in, similar looking to the 1000HP-Marker (but coloured).
