We&rsquo;re back with another iteration on the healthbar update based on feedback. Let&rsquo;s review what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve here:\r\n\r\n**Feels**\r\n- Familiar, but better (no relearning, no change to things like last hitting)\r\n- Game to game differences, not moment to moment\r\n- Interacting with objectives is more satisfying\r\n- Interacting with defensive windows is more satisfying (heals, shreds, etc)\r\n- Bodying fools feels better than ever.\r\n\r\n**Gameplay**\r\n- Easier to track the flow of a fight.\r\n- More intuitive play/counterplay around defensive windows.\r\n- More intuitive play/counterplay around unique mechanics (extra life, unstoppable, etc).\r\n- Huge clarity gains when spectating and watching streams.\r\n\r\n**V3 Changelist**\r\n- Ammo resources like Jhin, Corki, Annie have the same treatment as Live.\r\n- Lots of color tweaks and some sizing tweaks.\r\n- Lots of animation tweaks.\r\n- Tower burst, shake, and death animations are in.\r\n- Option to turn off shake animation coming this week.\r\n- Baron&rsquo;s healthbar now stays in place rather than bouncing all over.\r\n- Resurrecting state improvements.\r\n\r\n**Future Stuff**\r\n- Healing over time\r\n- Damage over time\r\n- Color code objective takes\r\n- Kill streaking\r\n- Stealth state\r\n\r\n**Lookee Lookee**\r\nHere&rsquo;s a spiffy video which shows the changes in a real game setting.

Since the majority of the health bars we have been looking have had level on the right, it may be less jarring to change the self level to be on the right too, if standardization is the priority. I also agree that color is the most important for identification, but looking for the level box isn't about champ or team identification--its about finding that champs level\n\nThe only thing that really bugs me about the new health bars is the level box, which I think is a combination of alignment and color (in addition to what the comment above was mentioning). On live, the box has a dark outline, but the interior is only a shade darker than the rest of the bar. In contrast, the v3 level box has a super dark interior color, and it creates a lot of contrast with the rest of the health bar that wasn't there before, but honestly doesn't seem to improve readability that much. This is combined with the fact that on live, the top of the level box is flush with the top of the health bar, whereas in v3, the health bar is centered in the side of the level box. \n\nAll of these changes make the v3 healthbars feel more to me like a level box stuck onto a health bar, and just a fair bit less integrated, smooth, and polished than those on live. Perhaps I'm nitpicking a little, but this is an element of the game players have to stare at a lot, and I want to make sure you guys have the feedback you need to nail it :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psyrik","date":"2017-11-21T13:48:53.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would prefer it stay the way it is.
