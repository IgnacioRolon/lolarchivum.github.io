The responses are quite relevant.\n\n[So the hype train on Azir and the Shurima event.](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4835317) [/Edit]\n\nThis should have already been apparent from the backlash over the Great Freljordian Retconning.  But for some reason, we are doing this all over again.  You are brutally savaging the intricately detailed backstories of Champions, and replacing them with 1 or 2 paragraphs of super general facts.  Worst of all, you aren't giving any explanation as to why you are doing any of this.\n---\n{{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:15}} \nWith the creation of Azir, it does make sense for Nasus and Renekton to no longer be from another world.  The more reasonable among us can at least understand that.  And you obviously have a lot of story there that you want to tell, what with Azir having a number of VO lines confirmed through PBE for Sivir.  But if you're not going to ever share the story behind all of this, there really is no point in putting that story together in the first place, and ripping the beating hearts out of our chests and grinding them into dust before our eyes.  Renekton used to be a deep character.  His own love for battle was tainted by the continuous exposure to evil.  Now he literally is just a rage-beast hellbent on killing his brother, with no actual context as to what caused it, or why it's Nasus's fault.\n\nSpeaking of Sivir.....  Since she got her VU, there's been this unspoken understanding that she is from some kind of desert nomadic people, whom she left to pursue her career/interests as a mercenary, which made her incredibly rich.  While you are, in part, solidifying that through Azir's VO lines for her...  there's still an enormous amount of story there that is missing, to bridge the gap between her VU Lore, her previously existing Lore, and how that relates to Azir.  As it stands, she's kind of ending up in the same nowhere-space that Sejuani is -- \"Rawr, I'm an angry barbarian and I like to raid and pillage people and stuff, and I'm going to rally the people of the Freljord behind my war banner or crush them under Bristle's hooves!!!  Oh by the way Olaf and Volibear are here too.\"  We know there's a lot more going on somewhere behind all that, but *you aren't telling us what it is!*  Similarly, if we pretend Sivir's old Lore doesn't exist for a moment, she's just this chill bandit chick who went exploring with Cassi this one time and something happened *TO BE CONTINUED (not really).*\n\n**It doesn't matter if whatever you have going on behind closed doors is the best story anyone has ever thought of in the history of storytelling IF NO ONE EVER GETS TO SEE IT**\n---\n{{champion:72}} \nI don't even know where to begin on this one.  I literally cannot wrap my brain around the reasoning for doing this.  Skarner's backstory was the most unique among all the Champion Lore for one specific reason.  He was the only champion who's presence was rooted completely in a plot element.  He was the greatest protector of his people, awakened by the use of the portable Nexus to freeze the warring Demacian and Noxian delegations in time.  He worked to create the Crystal Scar, the battlefield upon which Dominion takes place, in such a way as to further protect his people, rather than continue to awaken them.  He was alone, but his loneliness kept his people safe from the harm they could suffer from a world not ready for them.\n\nNow he's just a giant sentient scorpion from a desert who maybe is guarding someplace deep beneath Shurima.  I'm sorry, *what?*  Not just the fact that you destroyed the most unique thing you had.  Not just that you totally destroyed the interesting backstory of a champion.  Not just that you destroyed all ties between him and the Dominion game mode.  But you did ALL OF THIS, and replaced it with, quite literally, nothing.  I can't fathom who thought this was a good idea, and I refuse to even attempt to contemplate what the motivation was.  There can be no end result that justifies this kind of mistreatment of a truly beautiful character.\n---\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:81}} \nThe long, sad tale of Amumu.  Originally he was just a boy with no memory and an unfillable void of sadness.  Then he became a Yordle who woke up in a pyramid with no memory, but the unshakable feeling that something really bad happened to him once.  Now he's just an animated cadaver.  Granted, it seems like you've never really known what you've wanted to do with Amumu, giving his alternating species over the years.  But I fail to see what the point of even retconning him was if you're not going to actually give his story some expansion.  In fact, you did just the opposite.  You took the shortest, least defining Lore of any champion in the game, and made it *smaller.*  I don't know if you really want to be congratulated on that impressive feat,  but you've certainly earned it.\n\nAnd you did much the same thing with Rammus.  Before, his Lore indicated some really cool things about the Plague Jungles far to the south, and the mysterious wild magics that happen there.  Now he's just an armadillo that somehow became sentient, no idea how that happened, and he's got this cool armor and he wanders around looking for something.  These are your oldest characters.  These should be the ones with the longest, and most compelling backgrounds.  You've had years to think and elaborate on them.  Instead, you're just sucking the life out of them.  And we still don't know why.\n\nAnd last but not least, there's Ezreal.  I hope you're going to throw out his existing VO lines and write him some brand new ones, because his existing set is anything but \"embarrassed\".  He's supposed to be a smart mouth who doesn't care what anyone else thinks or says.  All of his existing VO lines support this, demonstrating a boisterous attitude and a cocky disposition.  And now he's magically embarrassed.  Bigger question though:  why?  Why make this change?  Furthermore, why throw out a far more descriptive Lore, going into details about his origins, for no other gain beyond something that is completely at odds with all the other content related to the character?\n---\nYou may have noticed a certain little 3 letter word that keeps coming up every time we talk about your changes to Lore.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy are you wiping away all the beautiful details that made champions interesting, that gave players reasons to like them beyond what their 4 buttons do?\nWhy are you going to such great lengths to forge half links between characters, if you're not going to actually connect them?\nWhy are you demolishing the most unique aspects of your game?\n\nWhy?\n\nHere's the part that's really telling about all of this.  You'd think, from the way I've written this post, that I main some of these champions, and play the others fairly heavily.  But that's the thing.  * **I DON'T MAIN OR PLAY ANY OF THEM** *  I mean, I'm decent at Ezreal and Sivir, and I manage to do ok with Nasus and Renekton in ARAMs.  But no, I do not have any real gameplay attachments to any of them.  I care about them because I find their Lore to be fascinating.  Reading the backstory of each new Champion, and figuring how they relate to the other existing champions, is awesome.  And somehow I doubt I'm alone in this view.\n\nRecently, you have been going out of your way to starve a portion of the community.

In my spare time in the past two years I could've (and have, for unrelated things) managed plenty of character stories and lore events, around having a job and being a student. They might not all be solid gold, but they would certainly define the characters. Furthermore, there are plenty of ways to incorporate old lore into new storylines without destroying the old stuff.\n\nFor instance, if they want Skarner to be a sort of enemy/monster of Shurima, why not make the Brackern and some Shurimans have some conflict? They only ever say Shurima was ancient, not how ancient. So Azir could know of some age old conflict and wish to eradicate an old Shuriman enemy. Bam, storyline.\n\nNasus and Renekton are still basically gods in the new lore, so why not just leave them as the basically gods of the old lore. It's not like being from a different planet/plane of existence ever mattered to fantasy interactions, or even mythological ones. I point you to all of Greek/Roman/Norse mythology, all the interactive planar spells in dungeons and dragons, the interactive influence of the Outlands on Azeroth. Precedent stands, and is strong.\n\nPoint is, if there can be a basis thought of in all of two seconds for a decent storyline incorporating the characters people already know, why destroy it just because you think nobody cares? It's not like we're looking for the next great piece of high fantasy to follow on the footsteps of things like the Wheel of Time or Game of Thrones, just a decent enough story to latch onto a character.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skyhawke","date":"2014-08-31T18:39:58.499+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't even know where to begin on this one.

That's no secret. But I can't tell you what the story of Azir, Xerath, Sivir, etc is because that'd blow the whole point of doing an event like this. What I can tell you is that the shortened bios you're seeing on the PBE are bios that are meant for the client. They will live on the website as well once they go live, but longer story pieces will accompany them in time. The idea is to change our bio format so you get a *quick* snapshot of who/what a champion is in the client - like, when you're gearing up to play a game - and entice more people to get to know champions. A very small portion of our players actually want to sit and read a novel (or 500ish words, but who's counting?) about a champion, so we're trying to appeal to as many players as possible while they're *in* the client. Meanwhile, you'll still be able to delve into a bigger story if you choose to seek it out for x champion. Azir will be one of these - I wouldn't want to give you new a champion with only a two-sentence explanation. I know we've disappointed you guys, but we aren't THAT out of touch.\n\nBe patient. It pains me to say that. But it's COMING. IT'S COMING. STORY THINGS ARE COMING I SHIT YOU NOT. SOON (FURREAL)!!1!\n\nHowever, I *know* you don't want to hear that.

So far that's come with promos, shorts, champion interactions, bigger VO sets, and a new bio format. Unfortunately, this has also taken us a lot longer than anticipated for a ton of reasons that I won't bore you with. It doesn't matter to you, I get it. You just want it. It will come. But FUCK that feels bad to say.\n\nPlease read the Dev Blog - it's much more concise than I am, and Tommy Gnox & co are more eloquent than me. I. Whatever.

You spent years and years quietly making these decisions, regardless of what we say, and at this point it's done. Retcons are happening, and won't be changed.

So sorry if I'm not particularly excited by someone claiming that things are ACTUALLY HAPPENING THIS TIME GUYS! They said that about the freljord event, too, and that was a whole lot of nothing but retcons.\n\nSpeaking of which, I wasn't too attached to what the current lore is anyway, but seriously, Riot's predilection for retcons is worrying. You see the same things in comic books; executives thinking that current books are too hard to get in to, so they reboot everything. All that does is A) annoy the current fanbase, who have to figure out which stories are canon or not, what happened to their favorite characters, etc., and B) not bring in new readers, because if they actually liked comic books, they would have been reading the old ones. I get that you have to bring in new readers, but will completely rebooting everything do so?\n\nMe and Riot seem to disagree on what 'lore' is. That 'New Dawn' video was not lore. It was cool, but it told us nothing but 'these are characters in the game! They fight!' Some of them showed their personality (Draven,) but others simply were there to do things (Jax). The champion interactions in league barely exist. Lucian having one line when he taunts near Thresh simply doesn't cut it in comparison to Dawngate or even DotA2. Backstories and VOs aren't lore. They're character establishment. They tell us 'Draven is self absorbed and cocky' or 'Amumu is sad' but they don't tell us about the world, or what's going to happen to Amumu now. The JoJ actually propelled things forwards. Most of the time, current league stories are about the past. That needs to happen, sure, but I'd rather have a post about Ezreal's and Lux's burgeoning relationship than about 'Gnar and Rengar fight'\n\nHell, there's so many problems I have with the lore itself I could keep myself going for a while.

If they're really dead, they can never appear again in future lore movies.\n\nAnd of course, there's the issue of \"if this is their end, their story went unresolved for no reason\".

I'll try to find a way to explain why without seeming extremely rude/dismissive, but that's difficult right now.\n\nTo put it very basically: That seems to indicate that we should expect no significant change, but rather more removals and retcons and long waits.\n\nEdit: Okay, here's my perspective. I'll address each of the things that the lore team has been working on, and hopefully clarify this frustration.\n\n1. Skins are not lore. That's something that has been true from the first skin releases. They can be cool, they can have side-stories, but in the end they are non-canon. Also, the stories around them tend to be fairly shallow anyway.\n2. Retcons do not count until they provide an actual net gain. For instance, Trundle's remake did not actually add to the world and the stories in it in a meaningful way, so his Freljord retcon (in terms of story) was net neutral or worse. Many people were disappointed by the change, his new connections remain unexplored, and his previous story was arguably more complex.\n3. Champion releases have lately been very lore-shallow. The champions themselves might have cool personalities and be interesting characters, but characters are just one tool to be used in the crafting of stories. They are not, in themselves, stories. This is also why things like the Jinx music video do not count as lore; there is no actual canonical story being told.\n4. VO's have begun to include actual building of lore. This is the sort of world building which really counts, for me, and I'll be glad to see more. The expansion of VO's has been a bright spot in all of this.\n5. Worldbuilding/R&D will be meaningful when we see the things built on that foundation. Because I can't see much of anything yet, I won't comment on what the results of that have been or might be. Really, this is just another \"why must we wait yet longer\" problem.\n\nSo, okay, work has been done which relates to the profession of writing, and I can see why skill/time/care/etc. would be involved. I'm not accusing you guys of being lazy. However, the lore department seems to have not actually been producing much lore for these past few years, and the update is \"Yeah, no, not much to show, but we have a new *direction*!\".
