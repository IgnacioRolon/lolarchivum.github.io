I logged out and relog back in just to find the match is over and I could rejoin queue.... It's not been 1 minute since I crashed and I dont think they would surrender or enemy team could finish game in under that 30-45 sec delay but when I relogged it is counted as my team loss. wtf riot.. not even a bugsplat or anything too; just black screen","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-19T17:56:31.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello JayAM!\n\nFirst, I want to apologize that you had this terrible experience when playing ranked!  While I am unfortunately unable to remove this loss from your record, I want to make sure that I can do all I can to help prevent this issue from occurring in the future.\n\nTo that end, have you ever experienced this type of issue before?  Is this the first time, or does it happen sporadically? Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"JayAM","date":"2013-09-19T18:40:15.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually my first time getting crashed while in game, I wouldn't know what sound it was making since I disabled the sound,  but the screen went from perfectly fine game to a black screen. I don't think it's my computer problem, since I have been running few games earlier (some aram and around 4 ranked games with no trouble at all. But I wouldn't know if it will happen more in the future or not since I just finished upgrading my computer and that was kind of my test run with it. I wouldn't mind about my own lp, since I could regain it back eady, I just mind about others lp from my team that lose theirs( hopefully not their series) and would I be in trouble of getting banned since I duo quit it using alt+f4 to close the black screen?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-19T20:31:52.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I absolutely understand what you mean.  Knowing that you may be letting your teammates down is one of the worst feelings.  If you just upgraded your computer, there might have been an issue with your Graphics Drivers.  If you have an Intel, Nvidia, or AMD card, make sure that you visit the manufacturers website and make sure that you download the latest drivers for your particular card.  This should help prevent those type of issues from occurring in the future.\n\nI hope that helps!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"TheSickFlux","date":"2013-09-21T06:07:40.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a similar issue, I will black screen, during the most inopportune moments but I can't find anything that is a cmmon factor in each occurence. I can hear game sounds but I can't see anything but a black screen, no amount of alt tabbing and ctrl alt dlting brings me back to the window, so I'm forced to hard shut down my PC and restart it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheSickFlux","date":"2013-09-21T06:07:34.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leave a comment...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Super Pedo Panda","date":"2013-09-19T17:36:03.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"similiar thing happened to me, league was super laggy so i tried to relog and it crashes 5 times in a row before working, then i get smacked with a leaver buster suspension. best thing is they dont care why you crash all they care about is $. not surprising though seeing as how in my and my friend's experiences riot has by far the worst customer service ever.","replies":[]}]}
