It simply won't load and crashes. When you restart league it keeps doing it. But now, when i restarted it I got a HTTP error.  Had to reinstall lol.airclient and then it took 2 hours to update when i tried to open league again.  This has happened to me a couple of times now, and frankly it's very frustrating.  * i've been loading in a ranked game every time it happened, which means i lost ranking and probably received a x9 report.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-16T21:10:54.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like you had two separate issues unfortunately.
