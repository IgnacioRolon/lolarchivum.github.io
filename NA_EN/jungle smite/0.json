It has been messed up since patch 7.3 for me and I am not enjoying this. Its not my computer not my settings or my power cord I have tried Riots troubleshooting FPS it has done nothing! I have always had 160-270 FPS and since the patch 20-75 FPS is all i get. If i go into game and change my setting to windowed I get my normal FPS back but windowed mode sucks and is tiny so CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION?! I have seen multiple people with the same problem so I know its not just me!
