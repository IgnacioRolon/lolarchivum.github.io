You just need to know how to properly build them, and most people don't know how, because they associate damage with stat numbers too much. My favorite weapon to build for tanks (like Braum, Volibear, Nautilus and Thresh) is Wit's End. It deals 42 magic damage and provides a decent amount of magic resist and steals more from the enemy (a stat most neglect to build). Tanks that specialize in dealing magic damage through their skills (Rammus, Sejuani, Zac, Nautilus, Amumu) benefit from building LIandri's Torment as their primary damage item (though Thornmail works just as well for Rammus). Tanks that have a lot of basic attack focus (Nautilus, Volibear, Braum, Vi, Udyr, Trundle) should focus on upping their DPS and maximizing what they can do with on-hit effects (Sheen items, Wit's End, Black Cleaver, Frozen Mallet).\n\nIn the end, though, yes, they are meant to be team players, and allies should know when you're ready to charge the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-02-22T02:22:56.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love being obnoxiously hard to kill for the enemy team.\n\n{{champion:254}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:14}} can build straight tank and still do plenty of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2015-02-22T02:37:00.880+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't tread on the bear {{champion:106}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-02-22T02:51:30.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:26}} Kick him out instead.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"426287","date":"2015-02-22T07:21:21.363+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not play tanks in low elo.

A lot of tank players fall into the trap of \"my team is following my lead and watching me\" so when he/she thinks its time to go in they expect the team to follow. But there are other factors at play. Things the tank can miss. For example; you are facing a 5v4 advantage and say BOOM, time to go in. But maybe you missed seeing that assassin poking his head out of the jungle in the rear. Your team is backing out and now you are out of position. You go in, they say \"shit\" and try and follow. 8-9 seconds later, you are dead and they are finally joining the fight.\n\nDont get me wrong, there are times when it IS the right time to go in and the team does get it (bad positioning, poor situational awareness, etc). I 'mained' tanks for most of seasons 1-4 so I get it. But I also enjoy playing other roles so have been able to see things from all sides.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2015-02-21T19:48:28.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why I like Sejuani jungle, I don't even gotta risk my life when initiating.
