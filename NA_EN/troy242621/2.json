Yesterday I had two vayne games. One was the back end of an ass bad, the first one before that was actually good in hindsight (not great), but I wanted none of it because I thought I was doing terrible.\n\nI felt I was making dumb plays, screwing up my tumble, fail flashed not once but twice that game. My team kept being encouraging and saying I did good when I made plays, but I felt I was doing so terrible that if they weren't doing so well it would have showed a lot more.\n\nI didn't say anything about it and just went with \"thanks\", but inside I was annoyed at myself for doing so poorly and my teammates treating me like I was doing so well.\n\nEdit: Why am I getting downvoted? I never said anything about being negative towards anyone. I said I was annoyed at myself. Someone apparently can't read. I said I was frustrated because they were being nice and I knew I didn't deserve it.
