If it turns out poorly, scrap it and go do something else\". Most companies go, \"Here's the new project. Complete it and do a good job, then we will move on to the next project\". What are the advantages to the way you all do it?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-27T18:55:54.424+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some reworks are need driven (Sion for example).

He has fans.\n\nJust because a champion isn't played in the LCS doesn't mean his players don't matter. Something that in recent years Riot, beyond the rework team, seems to have completely forgotten.\n\nShaco's been in the garbage for multiple seasons now.  I get you guys have a lot of champions and that's a lot of work, but the whole \"we only care about the top 30-50 until the pros play something else\" mentality is really kinda... \"lame\"... to put it nicely. Just because you guys think \"yeah, we might rework the champion sometime maybe when someone gets inspired to work on them\" is a fine way to do things, doesn't mean acting like the players of that champion don't matter.  \n\nYa'll are willing to \"fine-tune\" the same champions over and over all season, yet can't spare a single guy on the balance team to actually pitch some ideas for making the so-bad-they're-just-sitting-around-waiting-to-be-reworked exist in a better state than they're in?\n\nDunno guys. Just seems real shitty to play favorites all the damn time with \"what needs balance changes when\". Stop avoiding nerfs to champions you like (you know the one. Hint: He's a jungler.) while avoiding buffs to the ones whose fans have had to tolerate being called \"joke picks\" for ***years***.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lynbro Senpai","date":"2015-03-28T00:51:36.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happened to the Diana rework Vesh (I think) was looking at doing last year?

It fools literally nobody anymore. If Shaco has a buff it's a dead giveaway, if not, just click on one and whoever has the items is the real one. Basically only good to dodge one attack of your choice. Maybe make it harder to tell which is which unless a pink is down? Then they see it the way you see it?

Don't get me wrong, I hate Shaco and want to see the rework or at least *something* done to his kit, but at the same time, it's not fair if people aren't happy with changes.  \n\n>When tested in game though, we weren't as happy as we needed to be to ship changes.\n\nYeah, YOU weren't happy, but why not ask the PLAYERS how they feel about the changes?  It doesn't have to be a \"Rito do dis instead\" kind of thing, but more like \"This idea isn't what we want\" or \"This doesn't solve any of the issues they had / This is fixing a problem that didn't exist to begin with\" interaction.  \n\nHow many Cass players were happy with the rework?  How many people were satisfied with you killing Veigar?  How many times does Riot have to piss off Ahri players and continue to make changes to her that don't need to happen to her?  Fizz got changed from an AP assassin to a tanky AD bruiser, why?  When DFG got removed, entire playstyles like assassin Malphite and Lissandra,  or DFGaren weren't possible anymore.  How about Revive being removed, and Suicide Karthus was no longer doable?  So much for offbuilds and 'diversity.' \n\n Just as a disclaimer, I only played Ahri and Karthus to any extent out of the champions listed, and  believe you've ruined them in recent patches, and I know that I'm not alone in that belief.  That said, I feel for the other players who are negatively affected by the changes you enforce, ignorant of how many are angry or confused by them.  Their long lists of issues or reasoning behind their frustration seems ignored but altered IF AND ONLY IF you feel the same way. With your recent balancing atrocities, it all ties into something Ghostcrawler said you're trying to avoid doing - telling us how you want us to play.  \n\nSo if you're going through a rework process now and in the future, would it kill you to communicate with the playerbase  what you want to do for once?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ScreamPaste","date":"2015-03-27T07:53:27.319+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Please don't change Shaco.
