Their reasoning each time has been along the lines of it would increase queue times too much.\n\nMay have been relevant 5 years ago but now that theres 27 million people playing I'm pretty sure it would be a reasonable thing to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuma No Neko","date":"2015-07-30T10:58:47.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More a problem with report system, not pre-mades","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-07-30T10:48:36.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suddenly nobody can queue up with 3 friends because they will not find anybody willing to put up with their shit xD\n\nI couldn't agree more.

Got reported by 3 premades cause at about 25-30 minutes into the game i was stating \"I can only see 2 wards on the map and they are from my upgraded trinket. Can you please ward a bit more cause we can't see the enemies coming from the sides?\"\n\nAnd it was a very polite question imho, no one upgraded their trinket or sightstone... i still got reported for intentional feeding with a 11/4/7 as toplaner.\n\nI would love to have a pure SoloQ without premades or have at least an indicator in Teambuilder and Normals where i can see which people queued up together. This would remove the \"we are premade i would like to sup [xy]\" and make you maybe think twice for going aggressive vs someone and just mute them alltogether.\n\nAfter several games this week i am in a state where i don't want to chat anymore in Normals and just keep my mouth shut often which i think is morally questionable when someone is being accused falsely for \"feeding, not ganking, not warding, KSing in teamfights, ...\"\nThis means that a mixed SoloQ and PremadeQ will not reward standing in for players who get accused ingame but instead will make me just think \"oh good they blame the jungler. At least it's not me\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2015-07-30T04:58:35.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd buy that for a dollar.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulghunter","date":"2015-07-30T07:26:38.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This ain't Robocop.
