I am not using max builds for an evaluation. Yes he can do a crapload of damage with a max build and cause a turn around in a team fight but the way the game is now it just doesn't come to that and early to mid it isn't a great main attack because it is really situationally dependent as to whether you can even hit someone with it without being instantly destroyed. It is great against bad players or people who don't understand how he works but most decent players should be able to wreck you and get away with one of the 60 or so better characters that are available. Even if they lowered the cd of his ult and made his e a little better he would still be a niche character. \n\nThe thing about the way the game is now is that if you can't leap in and vaporize people or run away forever hitting people from distance with auto attacks and easy to hit spells then you need to be able to eat a ton of damage or stun/silence lock someone. Karthus can't really do any of those things. He wasn't amazing or anything before they nerfed him he was a really limited caster but everyone cried about how unfair his ult is nonstop while ignoring that he has shortcomings in the rest of his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-11-19T03:25:50.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With a champ that is made to be garbage early and scale up late, you need to use his late as a meter for what he can do.

That doesn't exist anymore which is why everyone thinks characters like karthus and kogmaw are bad and why you can't use max gear as a litmus test for viability. Characters that are only strong in late game are now a liability.\n\nNooooo. Kog'Maw is straight bad because the kit change was actually a complete nerf unless you're running on-hit.\n\nRun the numbers. He gets double attack speed, but on non-minions (Structures, champs, monsters, etc.) he only does 55%, which totals 110%. He gains 10% and some range on his W while he's proc'ing on-hits. Now, I dunno about you, but last I checked BotRK got nerfed, Devourer isn't going to be happening unless you can make smite-kog in lane work, and he's got no mobility. \n\nWhat's Kog got? 710 range and procs on-hits twice and does 10% more damage. His W got nerfed from a flat 8% to be 1.25% of his total AD. With an AS build to maximize on his W, you're only going to have a max of about 250-280ish AD. That's maybe 2.5-3% per hit of MAGIC damage. Grab a tiny bit of MR and you can make his W's damage almost unnoticeable given the fact even at 2.5-3% just so he can attack at twice the speed means he's only doing 5-6% compared to the old 8%. \n\nHe got nerfed, through and through. The only build you can likely do now is BotRK, Rageblade, Gunblade, Runaan's, and a Void Staff and pray your team protects you because that's the only 'hyper carry' build you can really do. Thing is, Bruisers like Irelia and Jax can have a good early game and scale quicker and do the exact same thing as Kog while being mobile, having defensive steroids, and hard CC. \n\nKog hasn't been considered a hyper carry in a long, long time. We had hoped to see 'Protect the Kog!' teams, but when you're only viable when your team plays for you and only you to do well and do the damage, there's something SERIOUSLY flawed. At least the old BotRK+Trinity Kog had good burst and sustained damage. Now BotRK has 2% less current health per hit and Trinity lost AP, AS, AD, and MS... all stats that Kog sorta wanted... Plus his R does less than half the damage it used to (Base ratios were nerfed) until you get the person to half health (Doesn't do 100% increased damage to champs) where it then doubles the damage, showing more damage because it also doubles the ratios (Old R only doubled the base vs. Champs), but you have to get them to half health... Plus his R's mana cost debuff lasts for 4 more seconds. Pretty painful nerf if you ask me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chespin2013","date":"2015-11-18T03:24:26.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and Warwick","replies":[{"poster":"doombotMECHA","date":"2015-11-18T12:30:07.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW's actually pretty great with devour, perhaps the iconic sustain jungler in a difficult jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"TDubH","date":"2015-11-18T14:40:12.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"__I'M SO SAD RIGHT NOW\nI was screwing around yestarday \ntrying out the raging kings devouring gunblade on warwick, but WW's ult doesn't stack rageblade! so salty\n{{item:3124}} + {{item:3153}} + {{item:1415}}  + {{item:3146}} + {{champion:19}} \nwell at least he has insane sustain and can duel anyone...\nGame was on a secondary - i won it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lithium Rosa","date":"2015-11-18T17:53:46.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is not enough time for ww.
