There is nothing wrong with making her more plant-focused; indeed, that&#039;s her whole theme to begin with. However, the implementation, which is to say the use of RNG, was the wrong way to accomplish it.\r\n------\r\n**The Issue of Chance**\r\nRandom chance really has no part in a competitive game like League of Legends because it adds variance outside of the players&#039; control. This is why it mystifies me that Zyra&#039;s rework incorporated a considerable amount of random chance into her plants. Turning her into an area denial support is fine, but the means by which they did it are not.\r\n\r\n**Contrast to the Original**\r\nPreviously, her plants were important, but her Q and E were potent in their own right. Now, most of her damage comes from landing a snare with multiple plants in range. You only have partial control over how many plants are in range, and it makes her somewhat more predictable.\r\n-----","replies":[{"poster":"inplane","date":"2016-07-31T20:17:14.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know trying to emulate plant growth and trying to play around the gimmick of nature is hard, but randomly spawning plants is a horrible concept mechanically. They could've just given her more Seed charges (2 is just ridiculously small) but in order to balance that out it has a casting cooldown of maybe 2 seconds? It would give Zyra the incentive to plant Seeds and not just use it mid cast, which is what makes her combos so powerful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Backup4now","date":"2016-07-31T20:24:27.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"RNG ~~Passives~~ Feel**s** Really Crappy","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-08-01T00:52:58.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Backup4now,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jxocsOWM,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-07-31T20:24:27.085+0000)\n>\n> RNG ~~Passives~~ Feel**s** Really Crappy\n\nAgreed.\n\nHonestly crit should just be turned into a modifier for autos.

What it actually means is that crit can randomly trigger, but won't trigger more often or less often than the % dictates. In short, it's already less random than crit, but does in fact have varying amounts of burst with high points in dps and low points. Such could completely be eliminated by my proposition.\n\n\nNOBODY except ADC players think crit is even a remotely interesting mechanic. It simply isn't. There is no skill in something that *could* kill you, or *could not.* You have no control over it, thus it is not interesting. All you can really do is buffer your crit chance by hitting a few minions and waiting till you stack up a few non crit autos, before turning around and attacking the enemy champion. *If you consider that interesting gameplay, I don't know what to tell you.*","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2016-07-31T21:02:18.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it RNG?

While I'll be the first to lambaste the use of RNG in a skill-centric video game, I don't think Zyra's passive really is RNG, as it's meant to spawn plants around important targets, and the issue I take with the above criticism is that it just criticizes Zyra's new innate for supposedly being RNG and stops at that. What I think would be more relevant would be to point out how this truly affected gameplay for you, e.g. by spawning plants inconsistently around your main target or spawning them in places where you didn't want them to be, both of which would normally be consequences of a random seed spawning system. From the very limited experience I've had with Zyra's new kit, her seed generation felt fine and even rather reliable, though that is clearly not a universal opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-08-01T08:39:19.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not random.

Do you care enouph to protect your seed? Do you pop it if enemy wants to clear it? Do you keep them for a better trade or just pop them for one attack? Those are decisions that Zyra players have to take for each seed from passive and there may be a lot of them to think about.Yea you can pop them at sight but it wont be the most efficient thing.
