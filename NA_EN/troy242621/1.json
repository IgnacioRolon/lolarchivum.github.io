I usually like your vision for champion updates, but I have to strongly disagree with you on preserving the whole \"AD Malzahar\" aspect. In my humble opinion, I believe that Malzahar is a mage and should strictly be played like a mage. I find his voidling passive to be odd, to say the least, because it doesn't really fit with his kit. \n\nI believe that for the sake of clarity and in order to create a more cohesive, healthy identity for Malzahar, that his voidling passive should be removed and replaced with something that adds value to his mage identity instead of conflicting with it. It's always very counter-intuitive to me when a mage (or any champion for that matter) that was clearly designed to scale well with a certain type of offensive stat scales with an opposite stat. To me, Malzhar is a mage and his kit should be designed accordingly in order to meet that expectation, even at the cost of eliminating an awkward, niche (and quite frankly unhealthy) build like AD Malzahar. Just my two cents, good sir.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-23T04:15:53.718+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">  It's always very counter-intuitive to me when a mage (or any champion for that matter) that was clearly designed to scale well with a certain type of offensive stat scales with an opposite stat.

I'm just spit-balling here, but something like Voidlings getting a small OnHit nuke on their first attack against a new enemy that scales off ability power.  In that way, AP Malz would be more concerned with just getting that one attack off while AD Malz would be more invested in making sure they continue attacking over a longer span of time.  That would also make the Voidling growth stages less important to AP Malz, but VERY important to AD Malz.\n\nA higher focus on burst would likewise fit better with AP Malz' identity, I think.  It would be a good point of mastery to encourage him to queue up one Voidling ahead of time, and then drop his full combo on a target to make sure he gets that second Voidling nuke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-01-23T17:33:03.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wVRF8Bq1,comment-id=000200020001,timestamp=2016-01-23T04:15:53.718+0000)\n>\n> The hope is that Voidlings can be a meaningful source of damage and gameplay for Malzahar regardless of build.\n\nthat doesn't mean your going to gut his damage and move it all to his voidlings right? because not a single Malzahar Player wants that","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-01-23T21:19:25.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=warpenguin555,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wVRF8Bq1,comment-id=0002000200010004,timestamp=2016-01-23T17:33:03.423+0000)\n>\n> that doesn't mean your going to gut his damage and move it all to his voidlings right? because not a single Malzahar Player wants that\n\nThe vibe I've been getting is that AP Malz players don't want their spells gutted to give the Voidlings AP scaling and the AD Malz fans don't want the Voidling AD ratios gutted to give them AP scaling.\n\nSeems to me the safest thing to do would be to completely ignore Malz' Passive for this rework and focus only on his spells, otherwise both AD *and* AP Malz players will probably be upset.  As it stands, Malz' Passive is probably the most healthy, most unique part of his kit.  Why change the one thing that works?

Malz' spells are as strong as they are *because* AP Malz doesn't get the full benefit of the Voidlings.\n\nThere's no reason to ruin other people's fun just because you don't enjoy it.

That's an incredibly narcissistic point of view.\n\nYou're free to view Malzahar's identity however you want to view it, but that doesn't mean your view of him is the \"appropriate\" one or of the \"correct\" one. Malzahar is an old champion who was designed during Riot's infancy. In my opinion, the reason why his voidling passive has such an odd scaling, and the fact that it even exists in the first place, is due to the lack of experience that his team most likely had when initially designing him. One aspect of Malzahar that evidences this is how schizophrenic and random his passive is when compared to the rest of his kit. \n\nIt's never fun getting 100 to zeroed by a champion, and this is especially true when a champion is capable of doing it with a niche build. This needs to be rectified so that Malzahar can retain his mage identity while having his kit balanced in a healthy way. There isn't any narcissism in recommending a kit adjustment that clarifies a champion's identity (for both the player and his enemies) while allowing for healthy gameplay patterns and reasonable counterplay. If anything was narcissistic, it would be your audacious suggestion that I was only making this recommendation because I have some bias against Malzahar or Malzahar players. But guess what? I believe that this needs to be done for all champions that have unhealthy, dated kits - not just Malzahar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuri By Mail","date":"2016-01-23T21:08:44.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best Malzahar NA, Aqua Dragon, would probably invite you to beat AD Malz with AP.\n\nHe'd probably win too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"El Del Este","date":"2016-01-26T19:49:22.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who uses Malzahar exclusively as an AD caster, and noticing that you (ninjaguy69) don't play Malzahar (according to match history I could find), why do you care about this update?

More than likely  Ad malz will get more attention when urf comes around I learned about ad malz during the first urf and use him every urf since\n\nGlad to see someone else enjoy him. I see your point, but I already saw it was mentioned on the thread, and nobody replied to it. I've seen reds are forum lurking right now, and I'm hoping one will tell another until eventually someone gives some insight on the topic in terms of if preserving it is something Riot wants to do.","replies":[{"poster":"LaoBushido","date":"2016-01-22T05:49:14.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Fciw3HN4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-12T06:25:55.532+0000)\n>\n> Seems like something worth preserving in some fashion or another. As less of a Malzahar-specific thing and more as general principle, I think it's probably best to try to leave things like off-builds in a roughly equal state following updates, though it can be difficult. This assumes they're not causing large scale gameplay problems, and that they're not forcing the champion to be balanced around an off build. It's something I tried to manage well with Kog'Maw, though it's hard to say to what effect.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2016-01-23T23:03:22.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Malzahar is never healthy in any way.","replies":[]}]}
