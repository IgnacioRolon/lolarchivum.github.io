I know he&#039;s not exactly considered the strongest right now, but he just fits my playstyle, and I REALLY love his AAs. \n\nNeedless to say, he&#039;s my favorite, and I want to make him work. However, I&#039;m having a few problems.\n\n1. This applies to any ADC but **my CSing is trash**. I&#039;ve tried bot matches, but of course I can get 90%-100% of the CS then. The problem comes when I have 50 things dividing my attention and enemies harass and zoning me.\n\n2. I **lose duels MOST of the time**, even when ahead, even mid/late game. Is that just the nature of the beast with Twitch?\n\n3. Every champion, even the likes of {{champion:67}}, seems to **bully the poor rat early. How do I alleviate this?**. My main issue is being zoned from CS. I poke back and can trade decently but I go OOM very quickly, even when Expunging at only 3+ stacks, then get zoned.\n\n4. I&#039;ll be using him anyways but just to know what I&#039;m up against here, **is he still decent** and worth using in your opinion?\n\nThanks in advance!","replies":[]}
