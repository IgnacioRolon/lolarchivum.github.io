Obviously this was a completely broken concept; ulting a Janna would just be too cruel of gameplay. However, Camille&#039;s ult makes it so only the one ulted can&#039;t leave, the enemy champs knocked away can reenter the &quot;arena&quot;. It this an example an ability that didn&#039;t make it into a champ&#039;s kit but was a basis for a new champ&#039;s kit?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-11-22T04:09:48.642+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Camille's ult follows a similar thought process to some of those old Fiora ults, it's not one of them directly though.
