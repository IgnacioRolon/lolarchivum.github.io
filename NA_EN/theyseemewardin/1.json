Maybe have her lookin up at him and giving a King Kong feel where the beast has an infatuation with the beautiful lady or maybe have her simply scream in horror. Just something small to commemorate the gem that was Crabgot.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-07-12T06:02:42.951+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Victor actually painted one in on the bow for that exact reason.","replies":[{"poster":"TheySeeMeWardin","date":"2017-07-12T13:01:13.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow!
