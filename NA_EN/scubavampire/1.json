So good! The darker thematic along with the music and lore that&#039;s sure to come is thrilling! But being an avid Game of Thrones fan, I noticed that Pyke is very similar to the characterization of the Greyjoys in Game of Thrones. \r\n1. Their religion follows The **Drowned **God. Pyke (LoL champ) apparently drowns his victims. \r\n2. Their castle (and 1 of the islands of the Iron Islands) is named **Pyke**. Pyke&#039;s name is... Pyke. \r\n3. They&#039;re the closest thing Westeros has to **pirates **and/or Vikings because they pillage, plunder, etc. due to their lack of farming abilities. Bilgewater = pirates and merchants who trade because they do not produce on their own. \r\n\r\nI am LOVING the similarities and am really hoping this is where you all found your muse!\r\n\r\nMiss Fortune {{champion:21}}  is probably one of my favorite champs overall and I can NOT WAIT to see where you all take Bilgewater in the next few weeks! {{champion:41}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:111}}","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2018-05-11T21:51:18.301+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pyke's narrative writer here.

Lol\n\nYou can disagree, that's what internet discussions are for. :P I just don't think GoT had an influence on the name. 'Pyke' the word only has references as a name, befor GOT, just a surname. Taking a Surname and making it a name of a character is easy, as it could have been his surname not given name. The idea of 'from the sea' and how pikes are using in killing people, work too. You could be right too, I'm just not sure (unlike early development of the game) they take as much input from popular culture as they once did.\n\nPyke also doesn't have meaning in other languages unlike 'pike', the fish or weapon. So it's easily transfered to other languages.\n\n\n\nAlthough, I'm not sure how much thought they really put, they named Nami... Nami which means Wave in Japanese. The next Marai they bring out they'll probably call Shio (Tide) The Wave Shaper.\n\n... that's not a bad character concept, I might work on that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lady Faceless","date":"2018-05-11T10:33:05.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reav3 mentioned that name Pyke was not inspired by ASoIaF.\n\n[\"It was just a cool name we thought fit his personality and theme, wasn't inspired from GoT at all.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8iggxc/pyke_the_bloodharbor_ripper_champion_teaser/dyrt6tw/?context=3)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2018-05-11T08:22:31.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right?\nSomewhere in the back of my mind i thought of GoT... \nHe reminds of the infected that spread greyscale that sir jorah had :// \nand also he reminds me of the pirates somewhat","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheGreatRasputin","date":"2018-05-11T16:34:51.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He should have a skin similar to Greywick.
