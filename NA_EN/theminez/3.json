Although Wobbafett outclassed Wynaut in everyway, with the item leftovers he could out stall any other pokemon as he could heal enough hp for struggle to be meaningless which means if properly played Wynaut could just stall out your entire team unless you had a dedicated check to Wynaut/Wobbafett.\n\nSmogon, which is what play and actually peaked at around top 120 in the Anything Goes format (by design the most unbalanced format) banned the Abilty Shadow Tag in almost all formats as it was deemed unbalanced and not healthy for the competitive scene such as putting the entire enemy team to asleep, evasion boosting, OHKO moves, etc. \n\nNowadays there is a item that lets you switch out called shed shell which can almost entirely negate the duo.\n\nI wasted 7 minutes of my life typing this, hope you enjoy :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2016-08-27T18:28:22.824+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was very informative.

You can't status it, It'll mak you repeat the same move again and again. If it caught you in a status, you'll waste turns on an immune pokemon, if it caught you in a buff, it'll switch to a hazer or something to kill the mon. If it caught you attacking, it'll counter to reflect the damage back. If it caught you using a special attack move, it'd use mirror coat to reflect that. It would destiny bond to take anything with it when it died. It was a guaranteed pick on at least 2 pokemon, so it was too strong.
