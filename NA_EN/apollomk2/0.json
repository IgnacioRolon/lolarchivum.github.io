But I want to talk about his wand wall, and how it works. One I think it&#039;s a little OP to begin with blocking multiple ults and all AA&#039;s. BUT, thats not my real beef with it. My real problem is that it should really only block straight line projectiles, it should NOT block things that go up and come down like Nami&#039;s bubbles! It probably shouldn&#039;t block some of the other borderline spells like Heimerdingers E/stun either.\n\nIn my opinion, and in order for it to be consistent with other abilities in the game, Yasuo wind wall should only block dircetional spells. Meaning spells that go in a line, like Lux Q, Nami ult, MF ult (as it already does). And should NOT block the omni directional abilities like namis bubble. \n\nIt&#039;s a small change that i think makes sense, and it&#039;s not like Yasuo is in a state where a minor change like this would really hurt him.","replies":[{"poster":"MorganFreemanBot","date":"2015-12-23T19:56:44.690+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo has, since the Warlord's and Shiv nerfs, had one of the worst winrates of any champion in Diamond.

Even looking at over-all stats.. He's been within 1% of 50% for weeks now.\n\nYasuo really doesn't need \"minor nerfs\" or any nerfs right now. He could really probably do with some minor buffs, considering he's showing to be horrifyingly weak once you get to the point where people have any idea how to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-12-23T23:09:29.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MorganFreemanBot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eEwZuaFJ,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-12-23T19:56:44.690+0000)\n>\n> Yasuo has, since the Warlord's and Shiv nerfs, had one of the worst winrates of any champion in Diamond.

Yasuo hasn't been picked or banned once in pro play since Shiv got nerfed in either All Stars or IEM. You know who has been picked?  Fucking Cass, the boards lovechild. Guess which one needs nerfs and which one needs major buffs?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Prospector Pete","date":"2015-12-23T16:41:47.687+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"And it should only block things from the front.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-12-23T20:15:43.605+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It blocks anything coded as a projectile that doesn't move above the map's visible area, such as Xerath's and Ziggs's ults, or Nautilus's ult, which is something of a corner case due to how it moves.\n\nIt's only unintuitive if you try to think about it using physics-based interactions. Instead, look at it mechanically. Does it move in a line from one point to another without rising above the map? If yes, then it's projectile and it probably gets blocked.\n\nAlso, yasuo is really kind of weak right now because of the various indirect nerfs. No need for any kind of direct nerfs at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"L0ve Is Blue","date":"2015-12-23T17:05:23.244+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What i find funny is this wall blocking vel'koz W and Braum ult while those are not even projectiles and they are litteraly coming from the ground.
