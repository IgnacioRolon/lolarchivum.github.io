We're merely paying Riot to add some RP to an account that Riot owns and has deigned to let us use. If _they_ want to block us from using _their_ RP that _they_ own on _their_ account by restricting our access to it, it's up to them. It's like giving money to a neighbor so that they can buy some nice things and decorate their house for a more aesthetically-pleasing experience when you visit. If you cause a ruckus, they can prevent you from entering, because it's their house and their stuff that you graciously (but perhaps foolishly, in light of your behavior) gave them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Donthurtmepleese","date":"2019-01-13T07:40:47.642+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"As I explained - it was denial of service.

That leads to a lot of false positives, probably more false positives than there are true positives. It also allows for pre-made teams to game the system whenever they get butthurt. Lastly, I would argue the language is accepted by the FCC probably as TV-14 or some similar rating.\n\nI'm not going to provide legal advice, but suffice it to say when a vendor makes it impossible to access something you purchase, you have the right to refund which in most cases will supersede something like a ToS. Consumer fraud is something completely different because it **must** include a _misrepresentation of fact_ to benefit the individual/group.
