NO JOKE i left like that foe 3 hours. i left it reconnecting and left to the mall. when i came back it still was. so i just did my work until it was done. and after 2 more hours something happened. it kicked me and said leaverbuster and now i have to wait 20 minutes just to play a game for 5 games. Riot how do you expect to get a new player to play when this is what you do. the whole leaver buster thing is garbage. do what overwatch does. instead of not letting them play their game they take away exp and loot you get from a game. that would be more fair and on a certain extent it would be better for both sides. you would get more players to play. And we would actually be able to play.chances are riot wont even read this but ohwell what am i going to do about. guys help me. spread this message so riot can read it. for the sake of people with actual lifes","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T01:59:27.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically, the leaverbuster system is designed to help protect the other players in the game. When your power went out, the other teammates were instantly put at a great disadvantage being a player short. Since you were gone for so long, the game noticed that could have a major impact and this is why your account had an LPQ. If this system *wasn't* in place, you could theoretically start a match, leave 5 seconds into it and never come back, but still get all of the rewards and be able to rinse and repeat. \n\nIt sounds like this only happened because of that power outage, in which case your wifi probably didn't get up and running quick enough to reconnect you. If you keep having issues like this (but without an power outage, we can't really fix those) hit me back up and we can walk you through a few steps to help your network.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dannybre","date":"2017-11-05T14:36:39.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if anyone agrees please vote yes","replies":[]}]}
