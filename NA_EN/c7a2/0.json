Maybe give Jax a new ultimate that lets him Pick-A-Weapon (like {{champion:4}} ) and use that for the next whatever seconds before he trades it back in for ol Lampy.\n\nKinda like this dude from Final Fantasy! http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/b/b3/FF5_Gilgamesh.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120716023940","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-04-14T10:22:30.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winged Hussar honestly really needs to yell ''THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED'' whenever he jumps in.\n\nFor reasons.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75zmIj_4LFQ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-04-13T14:32:27.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
