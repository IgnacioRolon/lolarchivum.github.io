I started \"ranked\" HotS at good ol' 50 . . . I'm assuming that's where everyone starts by how the ladder seems to work. \n\n1st game:  At 50: I'm last pick.\n\nRandom guy \"Why do you not pick Tyrande?\"  \n\n\" . . . I don't own Tyrande?\"\n\n\"What  a %%%%%%, don't play ranked if you don't own Tyrande. Fucking noob cost us the game.\"\n\n\"It's . . . champion select, we haven't even started yet?\"\n\n\"I'm reporting you for not having Tyrande, fucking %%%%%%.\"\n\n\" . . . Well, I'm just going to pick Sonya . . . 'cause that's who I own.\"\n\n\"OMFG, WHY ARE YOU PICKING THE WORST CHAMPION IN THE FUCKING GAME. OMFG!!\"\n\n\"'Cause I can?\"\n\n\"Reported.\"\n\nWon in 13 mins with a score of 17/0 with 40 thousand more siege damage than my team, and 28k more damage than our Valla who was second in dps. Needless to say the Valla didn't say a fucking word afterwards.\n\n\nGame 49 points: Last pick again.\n\nIronically yet again.\n\n\"Why. Are.You.Picking.Sonya.You.Fucking.Troll.\"\n\n\" . . . 'Cause I want to play Sonya?\"\n\n\"Gee.Gee.We.Lose.Cause.You.Picked.Such.A.Terrible.Champion.\" ((yes the dude typed like that))\n\n\" . . . Game hasn't even started yet.\"\n\n-Victory-\n\n\"Omfg. How'd we win.\"\n\n\"I spun to win.\"\n\n\"Still reporting you %%%%%% for picking such a trash champion.\"\n\n\"I out dpsd you by 60k, and you're a Zeratul . . . \"\n\n\"Fuck you %%%%%%. get gud. Don't play ranked if you're going to pick shitty champions.\"\n\n\" . . . \"\n\nGame 48:\n\n\"So help me if you pick Abathur I'll fucking throw intentionally.\"\n\" . . . \"\n-defeat-\n\n\"report Abathur for refusing to communicate with me. Fucking %%%%%%.\"\n\n\"You've been nothing but a dick to him. But then again, I am reporting him for picking Abathur.\"\n\n\" . . . what da fuck. Can I simply not play champions I feel like playing? Holy fuck this community.\"\n\nNeedless to say. It's pretty much been like that every game all the way up to \"rank 35.\"\n\nI've basically been picking Sonya, or Arthas, or two other champions, but mainly Sonya. And almost every single game is a giant toxicity fest that usually starts because I picked her, and then just chains into absurdity.\n\n\"Get carried %%%%%%. So bad. You're lucky I'm carrying this shit.\"\n\n\"You have 3k damage Valla . . . you're also unaware that I just made their entire team flee from the curse objectives because of my blade storm letting us snow ball hardcore >_>.\"\n\n\"Wow, you're so bad that you don't even know that you're bad. Fuck you. Troll. So bad. %%%%%%.\"\n\n\nI like . . . have no words to try and explain the mindset of these people. Oh well. I wonder what it's like at the top in this game.\n\nPS: I've been called %%%%%% about 800 times in the last 9 hours of playing this game.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI now stand around rank 30:\n\nOddly enough, the toxicity \"for the most part\" has died off. \n\nSo, I'm assuming in NA it's just the first 15 rankings that are blatantly toxic. \n\nHOWEVER, unconventional picks are still often laughed at, suggested alternatives. \"Why pick Sonya, when you can pick Illidan?\" Questions are brought upon you instead of . . . say, \"gg %%%%%% you picked bad champ we lose.\"  Picking a Gazlowe, or Raynor still inherits the \"lol gg.\" comments the moment you pick him. And, if the enemy team picks them they say \"ez game, ez life.\" ((Sadly it's borderline true. I've only lost two games vs him, and he contributed very little to the actual victories :/. He just . . . more or less happened to be along for the ride.\n\nRegarding toxicity: Oddly enough right around the  \"Silver\" Ranking ((34/36)) IS probably the most toxic. Unlike in LoL. They don't need to friend request you to message you. So, after a game it wasn't uncommon for me to get blatant murder, I'm going to kill your family, go kill yourself threats in whisper. I had that happen about 5 times. \n\n1. For picking Sonya\n\n 2. Because I didn't have a healer ((I'm only going through ranked playing 3 champions. Either way, my only healer is Lili and the enemy team picked her.))\n\n3. I picked a tank when we already had a tank. We still won. The argument was that \"We're lucky we had him, otherwise we'd have lost.\" \n\n4. This one was the most interesting . . . and I'll explain below after. But, basically \"He wants to kill my family because whoever gave birth to such an autistic r%%%%% should not be allowed to live. You're only a level 34. Level 34 r%%%%%s should not speak unless spoken to. Shut up and don't ever tell me what to do again.\" He was level 30. Apparently that's a big difference?\n\n\n5. I picked Abathur.\n\n\nWhy number 4 was . . . interesting:  We were on Booty Bay, and I told the group to stay in lanes, instead of running around in the fog for whatever reason. The guy was saying \"group group group group.\" I told him no because the more we fight, the lower in levels we get.  He said I'm  a \"%%%%%%\" ((Notice this seems to be the staple word for whatever reason.)) His mindset was thinking that if we \"grouped\" we'd instantly win game. But, unfortunately the games balance is sort of . . . contradicting.\n\n\nWhy is it contradicting?\n\nWell, as everyone knows, HOTS is pretty snowbally and heavily based on objectives. Yet at the same time there is no gold, no items, only exp. NOW. This is what I've noticed time and time again, and this here is also why we lost that game.\n\nThe game is based on objectives, everybody groups and does that. BUT here is where the biggest fuck up happens. And where the game is ultimately lost and often times they're not even aware of it. \n\nThe team groups and tries to get the objective. But the other team isn't fighting. They're just \"poking\" you to keep you from obtaining said objective. MEANWHILE there's one or two people in lanes gathering exp. What just happened?\n\nWELP the other team just got a level. Laugh. But, one level more or less determines whether you win or lose. Two levels and it's basically game. 4 levels and you might as well just sit at base because you ain't winning. 4 level difference is like a level 18 team vs a team of level 5s. It's that big of a difference.\n\nNeedless to say the team that grouped is now half health to 3/4ths health, and the team with a level advantage comes in and wipes the team. That turns into a 2 level advantage. Why is this important? This usually puts you around level 8/9, and the other team around 5/6. By the time the next objective rolls around ((Usually right close to the dot.)) The 5/6 team is around 8. And then the other team hits 10, hard engages and gets the next objective because the other team had no ulti. \n\nNOW: The other team can't win a group fight. They can't take objectives. They can't even milk lane exp. Almost all of their shit is gone, and now the team is 3 to 4 levels ahead, has complete control of everything, has all the mercenary camps and basically just sealed the game.  All of this, because of 1 level. \n\nDo you see how this directly correlates to death threat number 4? Welp, more or less when he was telling us to group up. However, before we had even actually \"grouped.\" We were already 2 levels behind because they had one person always up top, and my team kept leaving mid. So, they were literally milking two lanes worth of exp over us. What this basically did was give their carries a death cap + infinity edge, and the tanks two cinderhulks + gromp smite buffs ((talents)) vs  our bf sword and a 40 ap mid, and tanks that havent even went to buy a cinderhulk yet. That's how big of a difference it made. \n\nAnywho conclusion: There is definitely micro managing in this game, and one of the biggest throws is actually falling for the \"grouping\" concept. EXP > Objectives.  You don't NEED to fight over the very first curse mark in cursed hollow. By merely delaying them from getting it will leech a lanes worth of exp, if not 3 lanes worth of exp scaling you up one to even 3 levels on them making the next objectives, and the rest after impossible for them to obtain from you because they're so far behind. \n\nBasically, know how to mix \"farming\" and harassing and \"objectives\" similar to LoL and you can make it pretty far in this game.","replies":[]}
