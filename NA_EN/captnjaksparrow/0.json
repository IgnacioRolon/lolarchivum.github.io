My ping went from an avg of 200+ down to 10-14, and 20 on a \"bad\" day.\r\n\r\nNow, 6 months later, My ping  bounces around 80-100.  But if I drive 8 hours up yonder to Chicago, I get 2 ping. Not 20 ping. Not 200 ping. 2 ping. \r\n\r\nWhy am I getting the same level of ping 8 hours away as people that are a whole half country away from the server, when I originally was not? I had 10 ping for half the season, and now my ping is damn near identical to what it was with constant 150+ lag spikes like it was when the server was in California.\r\n\r\nI don't understand it, and it's frankly annoying. I thought I was done with the erratic ping that randomly on a flip of a coin decides that you need to die due to a sudden ping jump, and the relatively high ping that makes the majority of champions frankly unplayable at a higher level. \r\n\r\nBut that's neither here nor there. \r\n\r\nI just want to know why my ping was set to be 10-20, and it was for months, and then upped and skyrocketed back to 100 because reasons. Even though if I drive 8 hours north I get almost nonexistent ping.  Why is that?","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-31T20:35:03.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Utilise Riot’s Log Reader to see what’s happening with your network.]( https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader)","replies":[{"poster":"CaptnJakSparrow","date":"2016-07-31T20:49:05.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That honestly didn't tell me anything related as to why my ping is now no longer 10-12.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-31T20:51:28.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your increase in ping is likely due to your network, ISP or routing to the servers.
