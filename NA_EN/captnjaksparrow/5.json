It&#039;s not even interesting to watch anymore. I just see Trundle picked, I&#039;ll do my first buff then hear &quot;first blood&quot; See Trundle has killed my top, and then proceeds to 1v3. \r\n\r\nIf you shove him in: He gets back to full. You can&#039;t 1v1 him. You can&#039;t build tank against him. You can&#039;t build glass cannon against him. You can&#039;t really cc him. The only thing you can do is pray your Yi is super sated and wins, or if the player behind him is retarded and tries to 1v5 a team. Otherwise GL as he presses R on your tank and your team proceeds to evaporate.","replies":[]}
