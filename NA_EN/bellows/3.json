REALLY bad. And why does Vayne build IE and Static Shiv and suddenly rek everyone&#039;s day? ADCS are an OBVIOUS factor at what is making this game stressful. Unavoidable damage whilst being ranged is almost like saying they are going to do true damage. Dodge was an effective way to play against ADCs back then. (minus the broken shitt that old sivir was) \r\n\r\nThe idea of Auto Attacks and ADCs needs to be reworked entirely or give melee a dodge chance or mechanic again.
