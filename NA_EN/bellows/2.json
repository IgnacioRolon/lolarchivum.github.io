Simply cause, you can get to &quot;late game&quot; really fast especially in this snowbally rut league is usually in. Fed Kog, gg, fed twitch, gg. Most of the time. Fed Trist, its all the same. I dont feel like champs especially marksman who have range and lifesteal advantage, should be able to out put THIS MUCH DAMAGE, it feels helpless most of the time even when you&#039;re &quot;itemizing&quot; against them. Its not that i have an issue with adc&#039;s or lifesteal (even though lifesteal is really stupid concept in a game like this if its not built into a champs kit already).\n\nDoes anyone else think that all champs should have an advantage if they are late game, but not a complete faceroll? ADC&#039;s shouldnt be a role that is given all these advantages, yes, i believe adcs should be weak af. ADC mains will dislike me sayingt hsi but its true. I find come lategame these particular adc&#039;s are overwhelming or if the get ahead. \n\n   I guess the point of this post is that, game health is relative to its diversity. The more diverse something is the harder it is to balance. ADC&#039;s are too diverse in power level, they should be left click range damage dealers with little to no utility or defensive stats. Instead they are so safe, regain uber amounts of health and just absolutely shred things. Part of me sometimes thinks that ADC marksmen are a bad concept for a game completely. But I wouldnt honestly go that far. I would highly consider making &quot;late game&quot; more about evening with the enemy team or having a slight advantage over others, definitely not, &quot;wait till late game guys and im gonna carry us to victory, this&#039;ll look sick for my montage! OH BOI!&quot;\n\nIts not just ADCs though its also champs like fiora and yasuo.....\n\njust some thoughts about game health from a joe of the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Swiftstrike4","date":"2016-09-05T21:00:00.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most champions can't get to late game at this point. The games are so short, or they are at such a disadvantage in the early game, that when they really scale their team is down already is \"too late\".\n\nThese champions may do better in longer games against lower elo players (Bronze and Silver) because they do not close out games as fast. The higher your elo though, the short the game typically. \n\nThe one exception to this is {{champion:96}}. I think he is becoming a problem due to itemization and his kit. I've been playing in games where he will get shut down early and then by the 30 minute mark he kills everyone by standing still and hit team peeling for him. The other champions if you punish them early they usually don't scale as fast.\n\nI think Riot already said they are addressing Kogmaw next patch or the following one. They don't like the kogmaw jungle thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-09-05T20:37:01.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why massively restrict gameplay diversity? that's my question.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-05T20:40:16.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, No one wants Stale gameplay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-09-05T20:08:26.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, upvote from me","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemainaNyx","date":"2016-09-06T10:19:18.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC/Support main here.  To be fair, late game is when ADCs are supposed to be strong, they do consistent damage without being reliant on cooldowns (except maybe Lucian/Ezreal).  However, they are also easily killed by anything except maybe the supports.  If your team isn't focusing the easiest to kill person who also does the most damage over time, that's your teams fault, not the fault of the game.  They don't have cooldowns to wait for, that is the only reason ADCs do so much damage.  They are only limited by attack speed and if someone is forcing them to stop attacking.\n\nKnow what I hate, assassins that blow me up in .5 seconds with two abilities and no counterplay.  Or a burst mage who kills me without even being close to me.  But, that's their job, so I can't fault the game for that.  I also hate fighters with gap closers, cause I can never get them off of me without a teammates help, again, that's the point of those abilities.  Getting one shot by a Nasus Q is BS, but he did the work to make it strong, so he should be rewarded for it.\n\n\"ADC's shouldnt be a role that is given all these advantages\"\nCould you explain what advantages you are talking about?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stick In Mudd","date":"2016-09-05T20:49:25.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is my most hated late game champ. \n\nIt gets so stupid, that you are doing decent all game; taking towers, dragons, winning teamfights, winning lane; but once 35+ minutes hits, he is two shotting your carries, is untargetable for most of the fight (with his q), and then heals for an obscene amount of damage (if no one built a grievous wounds item). \n\nIt does make one wonder about if something like that is 'healthy', since it only requires a massive amount of farm to achieve, basically PVE.
