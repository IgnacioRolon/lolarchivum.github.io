The new client will stay at 0% until this error shows up. \nhttp://imgur.com/a/GkX7C.png\nThe Legacy client will show the same error, but will load to about 33% after an hour.\nUsing the Hextech repair tool did not fix the problem. I've checked my internet and that is not the issue. I've never had issues downloading a patch until now...\n\nrito pls i just want to play {{champion:498}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-21T02:56:03.855+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client typically throws this error if your OS doesn't have the right permissions set up to let League scan the game files for patches. Go through the steps in our [**permission guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to get those permissions setup, and you should be able to patch after that!","replies":[{"poster":"quatrence","date":"2017-04-22T23:55:42.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your response. I have tried everything in the permissions guide and unfortunately, nothing has worked. More recently, the client has been able to load much more than 33% (it's gone up to 99% a few times, but usually stops around 70% now) only to be stopped by the same error.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-23T20:31:33.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like those permissions were able to get you started patching, but now we're running into some kind of weird connection issue...\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\nNo worries though! Since you're able to get up to 99% sometimes, it probably just means that the download is having some hiccup and it can't finish.

The client now consistently reaches 75% only for the percentage to slowly drop down every minute or so.
