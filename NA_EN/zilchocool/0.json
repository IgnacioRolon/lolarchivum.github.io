I constantly hear casters say something  around 10 to 15 minutes like &quot;Xadc is behind in farm and should be ahead at this point,&quot; when in fact Xadc&#039;s support has the only relic shield in lane with 20 CS, most of which are probably obtained with stacks. After some simple math and normally even reducing the support CS a few for non-stack CS, Xadc is usually ahead in farm and gifted the CS to the support. Are these comments from the casters correct or should the casters calculate in the relic shield support CS? These comments annoy me and if there is good reasoning behind what the casters are saying I would like to know so as not to be annoyed any more.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-04-12T18:08:43.386+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"They changed the relic shield a while back so that it gives the receiver of the extra gold another creep score so that when you hit tab you can tell how fed an enemy is without having to add in the supports creeps also.
