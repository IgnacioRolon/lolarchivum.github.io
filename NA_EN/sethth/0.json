I took the quiz and got a result of &quot;You are star guardian jinx!&quot; The quiz said the generic: &quot;Congratulations! You got a star guardians icon!&quot; after I completed it. The end screen also said that it would take up to three days for the icon to arrive, however its been longer than three days, and I haven&#039;t received an icon.\nTo get this bug I went through the quiz with these answers in this order:\nFreedom, True light never fades, Nothing, Your Beloved sleeping under a willow, I reach out and swing at it, As nobody, Soar, I move on, With those I love, Hide it, Peace, Enchanting, To-do Lists.\nThe quiz will then say &quot;Congratulations! You are Star Guardian Jinx!&quot; and tell you you will get a star guardians icon. (Hate to crush your dreams kiddo, but you won&#039;t)\nI&#039;ve taken the quiz a couple more times since that first attempt just in case, but no luck. \n p.s. Dear forum mods, if this is an issue for technical support rather than the bug forums I&#039;ll be happy to move there.\nEdit: I'm looking on the forums and I've seen some other people say that they didn't get their icon.\nThanks!\nSeth","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-10-11T17:01:12.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nOriginally, we had stated that it was 2-3 days, but with the overwhelming amount of summoners who wanted to know which Star Guardian they were, it may take up to a week for the icon to be added to your account. The icon should find its way to you soon. ^-^","replies":[]},{"poster":"sethth","date":"2016-10-13T02:20:52.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got my icon, thanks for all the support guys! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"sethth","date":"2016-10-11T01:49:41.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm hope that's true.
