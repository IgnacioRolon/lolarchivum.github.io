PLZ HELP. I know it is not a permanent issue because when I tried the $5 it worked and added it and removed $5 from my account but earlier when I tried $20 it just ate my money. What I am trying to say is that with the $20 it took money but did not give RP but with the $5 it took money and gave RP. Where the RP at?\n                                                                                  ~ThePhysiscyst","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T17:51:54.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this is a billing issue and will require some investigation, I recommend [submitting a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
