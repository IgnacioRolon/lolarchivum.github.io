Fortunately the new system of essence/rewards/crafting will probably bankrupt them, as no one will have to pay for anything, but I digress.\r\n\r\nIn a surrender shortened game, on Blitz support, I scored 4/2/4, with 5,424 gold and a vision score of 24(9 was the second highest). I got an A.\r\n\r\nThe ADC, Tristana, scored 1/1/6 with 5,378  gold, and a vision score of 5. CS was 3rd best on the team and sixth best in the game, 75 in 16 minutes. She got an S. Not an S-, but an S. \r\n\r\nSeriously, whatever formula you are using Riot needs to be changed. I am so livid it&#039;s impossible to make a rational statement. The fact that you have no other way to complain than these idiotic boards is infuriating me more. I will spend zero dollars on this game in the future. I  already have all the champs and enough blue essence to buy every new champ for the next 10 years.","replies":[]}
