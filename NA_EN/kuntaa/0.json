Of course, League will still have their dedicated player base to support them even if that occurs...\n\nBut from what I&#039;ve seen from this season, things have changed dramatically. Before (season 2-6 just before mid dynamic queue season),  when any* individual made a post on the comment board to critique Rito changes which he/she deemed unnecessary and moreover, at certain times, they&#039;ll present factual or mathematical evidence to back up their claim, they&#039;ll always be shut down and discouraged by the community, downvoted, called a troll, and worst of all, if the commentator (or Brown Noser) of the post had no clue what he/she was talking about and jumped to conclusions with repulsiveness in order to defend Rito changes by any means necessary, he/she will do so! Now, I do not see that happening as much and the reason why is because of.....Dynamic Queue!\n\nDespite the uproar in the community about Rito&#039;s decision for not opening a Ranked Solo Queue mode and in return, leaving Dynamic Queue, I understand that the majority of the player base is contempt with this decisions (many polls throughout the site showed this).  So this we cannot touch on, but many other things (like promised champion reworks which we are suppose to get, but never do like Urgot; the many champion reworks which destroy the players interest in using the champion like Taric, the total destruction with nerfs to the most &quot;memorable and classical champions to use like Gangplank (and the worst part about it is, this was actually a good rework then they had to nerf him insanely to the extent that he can&#039;t even farm and it takes long to utilize his passive serpent mechanism since they nerfed the amount which you gain also). I could go on but then it just be another paragraph multiplied by 3.\n\nSo for those of you with the **SHORT READING SPAN** or if you&#039;ve actually finished reading that whole wall of texts (I know I wouldn&#039;t if it weren&#039;t mine :-),  what is your take? Do you think Rito should conduct a poll and place it in both their client and there website front page for the community to make their votes before they make any changes (which should be solely based on the majority of the votes)? Let us know! We do live in a \"democratic society,\" or at least that's what I was taught in school after all?  BTW, when I say votes I'm also placing champion reworks, nerfs, and buffs in the same playing field!

League is complex and tactical, with multiple objectives and so much more in terms of strategy. Overwatch is an FPS \"take the point\" game who's biggest strategy is \"Hide behind Reinhardt\" and \"Find the alternate path to objective.\" There's isn't much more depth to the game other than trying not to die and trying to find clever ways to snipe enemies before they shoot you. Furthermore, Overwatch won't be developing MMORPG aspects because Blizzard has sailed that ship in WoW and is actively trying to expand into other markets. Blizzard's top competitor with League is Heroes of the Storm, and clearly that game is not going to be pulling over any League players considering how long it's been out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lohrr","date":"2016-06-22T13:10:18.279+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Riot.. don't listen to them.

Hmmm.\n> \n> Stop insulting people and treating it like a good base for an argument.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n^ I drew this line specifically to let both you and other readers know that rebuttling your \"response\" will be bring true meaning to a piece of cake...and a reminder to never cross it ever again with your low intelligent capacity!\n\nI do not lash out at people that do not agree with me, nor  did I call you \"stupid\". After reading your sentences (at least this one), I could now come to the conclusion that calling you \"stupid\" will be an act of mercy upon your ethereal intelligence. You are PLAIN STUPID! There is a difference! HERE'S WHY YOU'RE CONSIDERED THIS CLASSIFICATION FROM THE AVERAGE STUPID:\n\n1) \"Stupidest\" is a word! As a matter of fact, if you stop placing your emotions over everything and start researching before you even speak (which you can't even due to to your plain stupidity), you'd understand what a superlative adjective is, or to the very least, type in the word \"stupidest\" on google search before jumping to your conclusions. Too bad you couldn't think of that XD, or could you really not think of that XD.\n\n2) No one was attacking you! You left multiple unpleasant comments filled with the phrase \"doesn't give a shit\" in your post and on my thread and furthermore, you've indirectly referenced me when you're speaking to someone else about it! It wasn't even a rebuttal to the poster which you were responding to or this thread. It was straight disrespect and nonetheless, it was uncalled for. That is why I stepped in to remove that old chip on your shoulder which now I'm 100% sure it became computerized, punctured your shoulder skin, dropped into your spine anatomy, travelled upwards through your blood stream, found its way into your brain and lastly, short circuited while inside the center of your brain! \n\n3) Destroy my thread, haha you wish! I hope you didn't forget to take your crayons and resting mat before your Junior Kindergarden classes begin, because honestly, that is where your logic seems to be heading towards. Yes i've complained about a rework that isn't here yet for the same reason to validate my points. Urgot was suppose to be reworked back in 2013. Both fans and players were excited to hear an announcement that Rito was fixated in reworking him back in 2013. Now is 2016 and still we have not seen or heard any news about it. Yet they want to rework champions that often see gameplay like Fiora, Ryze (they are even reworking him for a 3rd time), and warwick which'll soon hit PBE? Most importantly I was not against the whole rework, I was simply stating that they should have a poll to see if their player database is for/against it! Plain stupidity interpretation. What does Azir have to do with this? Why even bring him up or his issues alone in the same paragraph which is conveyed towards champion reworks? You can't even back up your arguement with a proper reason...?\n\n4) Yes Rito nerfs things to keep this game balanced, even a plain stupid person will know that! Despite their long efforts in doing this, the game is in fact more imbalanced than it ever was, especially in comparison any seasons prior to season 6. We've noticed this issue from season 5, and had even tried to share our insights with closed minded individuals such as yourself (though I must admit you are in an entire seperate lane from them due to your condition). If you're telling me that Rito is doing a fantastic job at gameplay balance, then why are there so many posts dedicated to dynamic queue disadvantages when solo queuing, enabling solo queues, champion nerfs ASAP (such as Malzahar, Vayne, and some more, who are notoriously known to be discussed throughout the forum post) and even item nerfs, buffs, and requests (such as the ones requesting the return of mana potions and boot enchantments)! Very well balanced if there is still more then 10 champions that never see the light of being selected in the majority of any game play mode (and even LCS for that matter) from Season 3 till now. I understand that gameplay balance should somewhat be maintened and perhaps on going, but when the choices for those gameplay balances further deteriorate it's goal due to \"what the balanced team would like to see and experience,\" then the goal is no longer about balancing. It becomes based on \"experimentation!\" See the difference?\n\n5)  \"Taric was a one-dimensional non-threatening boulder before his rework. He had a single target stun, and then that was it. His ult was numbers, his W was numbers, his old kit barely did anything interesting. The best thing Taric was back then was a meme. Atleast now he can be a meme, AND a decent pick. As for destroying interest in Taric with his rework, um...no. The rework generated more interest in Taric than there's ever been.\"\nHe quoted. Taric had a single target stun and that was it. I've seen posts where the majority of the people were complaining about the mechanism in his new stun (even writing RIP Taric because of it) due to the awkward angling of his stun on his bastion, the delay 1 second delay before it activates, and even more worst, it's low range in comparison to the old stun which was a certified hit and most importantly, was useful in taking down or scaring away an enemy laner! His new Q is so terrible, that he has to wait a full 15 seconds (without any cooldown reduction items) in order to fully utilize it, and even so it's healing numbers are so insignificant in comparison to other healing supports such as Kayle, Nami, and Soraka that can heal twice in the same amount of time span which the new Taric rework needs to utilize the most optimum heal! Even his old Q healed more then this new hunk of charred crystal junk! His W is the 1 and only benefit to his rework kit! That is probably the only thing that needed to be changed about him and I give Rito credit for that! But look at even his standard passive with the attack speed auto attack and furthermore, the nerf to its armor ratio from his old passive. His Ultimate can be exploited easily with displacements and crowd control and in addition, the taric team ends up either being outside of the area of effect of his ult or they're killed before or after it activates due to having low hp from being in a wrong position, but however, attempting to gain the AoE ult. With his old kit, his ultimate affected you and it did not have to include putting a \"squishy mage, assassin,\" or   AD bruiser per say in a dangerous or ineffective position just to gain the AoE benefits from either Taric or his W bastion which is typically the ADC. He's been reworked and yet, has not made it even to the top 5 most popular daily/weekly/monthly support pick when compared to the other ones like Blitzcrank, Thresh, Annie (who isn't even a real support but yet more favored then this reworked taric) and the list goes on. Heck, even Soraka and Sona get more gameplay in ranked games then Taric support! This is a problem, especially if a champion that was used before multiple times sees a decline in use. Rito payed the balanced team to do these kind of things, and instead, after they make their drastic champion changes, the popularity of the champion being played will go up for the first week or two the champion get's released, then it will decline dramatically to the point they were better off not making those drastic changes at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuntaa","date":"2016-06-22T17:12:39.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">As for your attack on Riot's loyal fanbase, or as you call them, \"Brown-nosers\", who are you even?

The problem is those are only a very small fraction of the change posts with the rest of them just bitching and moaning with no real feedback.\n\nBut if the boards and riot is trolling these people in the last couple of seasons then isn't the implementation of dynamic que (something that you said yourself) a positive?  It reduced trolling according to you.\n\n> No disrespect SnugglePuggle94, but like we're pretty much moving past the \"most people don't like it\" argument at this point. It's just not true—it's a small but vocal (and very passionate) minority that's super upset about dynamic queue. Lots of people always wanted the ability to play ranked with more than one friend, and lots of people are fine with DQ now. The upset vocal minority has some very legitimate complaints about dynamic queue, so we're gonna bust our asses to try to address those criticisms and make ranked better for everyone. That means new features, more communication tools, better matchmaking tuning, and on. That's where we're going now. Again, this isn't to say that we're ignoring the criticisms of dynamic queue. We hear you. And we're gonna get creative to make things better for all players.\n\n Cactopus  - a day ago\n\nThis was posted on the last riot pls.\n\nAnd then the reworks. The teams the do reworks are seperate from the ones who do dynamic que. Also there have been plenty of great reworks, taric being one of them.  They also just released a list of like 10 champs that need a rework and urgot is on it.\n\nAnd now the last paragraph.  Wow you act so entitled. People fought bled and died so you could have democracy.  Riot and its relationship is not a democracy and shouldn't be.  Just like nintendo and their fans.  These are businesses not countries.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuntaa","date":"2016-06-22T19:03:22.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've read your response, and from the information which you've presented, it appears as if: \n\nA) You've misunderstood the paragraphs and incidentally are not able to grasp the central point of arguement well enough or\nB) Your using pre-subjective thought of disapproval for the entire thread, which may had been a result from reading the title alone, henceforth, not properly interpreting any sentence at all afterwards.\n\nThis may explain why \"so much is wrong\" for you and likewise, the second paragraph not making sense to you. I agree that some people should be polite when they're requesting to see a champion become buffed, nerfed, or even halted on a rework but you and I know that isn't the case most of the times. Whether a person is \"rude\" or not, they're still a part of the community and always have been. This means, the majority still stands whether we like it or not.\n\nLet me give you an example before I further elaborate on this. You own a banquet hall! Your business is predicated on the catering of your customers and the commerce between you and them (same exact example as the player base and Rito). As the owner, you've purchased 2 mounted stereos on a tripod and have convinced all your customers to not move or touch it at all, not even your employees! Some of  your customers become frustrated due to the stereo positioning, and subsequently, they make ad hominem remarks against you. Few others have brought up their concern with an impulsive attitude about the stereo positioning and have requested for you to move it; fewer others have brought up the issue in a polite manner according to your point of view to move the stereo. After reflection, hearing, and even peer review analysis, you've realized that the majority of your customers want to see the 2 mounted stereos removed from the banquet hall. Now, you as the corporate boss of this banquet hall, if you choose to ignore their request for too long, what do you think will happen? \n\nIt's the same concept. Now back to your factual points. When you speak about \"bitching and moaning,\" you must obviously be speaking figuratively, and undoubtedly, you mean complaining. But here is where you're wrong! Their is feedback! In fact, people have posted multiple screenshots of team scores, champion statistics via lolmatchhistory screen shot and many more as to the reason why certain changes are required, but never get fulfilled until months, or even a year(s*)! It is not very small if every patch release webpage, someone is asking why such and such champion is being nerfed or why this item is being nerfed and i can go on and on. I'll give you perfect evidence! http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-612-notes and on the bar that says comments sorted by, click recent and see all those comments against reworks and the patch itself. It's not the minority that are complaining, it's the majority! Swallow reality and realize that it is more then a minority bringing up the issue!\n\nI honestly do not know why you brought your former quote paragraph up! That just furthered my case and point that Dynamic queue was heavily favored more by players then re-opening solo queue. If you ask me it was irrelevant to bring that up because even I made the same conclusion about it. So there is no need to address something I agree, my thread agrees with, and which they've enacted. I'm talking about the countless other things which the majority of the player base requested and do not make it into live servers, such as 1v1 lava chamber, in-game voice chat (which was requested by the majority since 2012 and even today, but still hasn't been implemented into the server). So many more things.\n\nNow for the rework scenerio. Did you know that the new reworked taric's popularity in all regions as a bottom lane support, and even top lane, has dropped significantly when compared to his old kit? That is a big issue! If you don't believe me, here is my evidence: http://www.lolking.net/charts?region=all&type=bottom-synergy&range=daily&map=sr&queue=1x1&league=ranked so that already destroys your arguement that he's a great rework when he's been seeing a dramatic decline in gameplay all throughout every region, especially after his post rework. Urgot was on the list of rework since 2013 so don't even bring him up until we actually see him get reworked! People have requested to see him get reworked even before all of these champions that are getting theirs, and still till this day no one has taken the effort to shed some light or even attempt to make changes to him.\n\n>And now the last paragraph. Wow you act so entitled. People fought bled and died so you could have democracy. Riot and its relationship is not a democracy and shouldn't be. Just like nintendo and their fans. These are businesses not countries.\n\nI had every respect for you as an individual expressing their thought until this last comment. This was totally uncalled for, BS, and contradictory to your own statement. First and foremost I was speaking figuratively. Since when do politics and video games go hand in hand? This was to emphasis my statement about voting before implementing in game changes. Not electing the president of sales or anything of that nature in the corporate chain. Before you maroon yourself in an uninhabited island thinking that Rito is there, don't forget that Rito games IS LOCATED IN NORTH AMERICA, which is a DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY!  Nonetheless, this was again, one of your horrible pre-subjective translation of the actual sentence. And then you have the nerve to say I was acting so entitled when in fact, I said \"we,\" live in a democratic country and not \"I.\" If a business operates in a country, then it obviously has federal laws which it must follows! You're trying to put it in a context that a business can do w.e the heck they want without following any government laws, which is wrong, but no more of this. It'll further confuse you since I doubt you're smart to intellectually grasp the comment that follows after this last comment! And please for the love of whatever you believe in, do not compare Nintendo to Rito, likewise their fanbase! Nintendo makes games for fans. Nintendo responds to their fans, especially if their is an unwanted change in any of there game. Nintendo fans contribute to Nintendo and are satisfied with their contributions. Nintendo get's player feedback as they promote, create, or dispose of game materials. Does Rito do any of that? NO! So if you're going to go into the defense of a business that clearly closes the bathroom door on you and wipes your money with their gravy coming out of their behind, then maybe it's about time to confront them on that matter instead of defending them you Vanilla Fappuccino","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The JigSAW","date":"2016-06-22T14:10:18.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didn't agree with them when they took away our mana potions.\n\nI didn't agree with them when they took away Team Builder.\n\nI didn't agree with them when they removed the Dominion mode as a full-time mode.\n\nI didn't agree with the mana regen and spellvamp removal that has made most matches either insanely difficult or insanely easy for the mages they either overbuffed or underbuffed.\n\nI didn't agree when they say Yasuo, Yi, Tryndamere's ult, Veigar's infinite stacks, Nasus' infinite stacks, and Xin Zhao's new crit/heal mechanic are 'balanced' \n\nI didn't agree that they refuse to offer refunds on reworked champions, which shows how much confidence they have in their own work.\n\nI didn't agree Fiora and Irelia's art look better than they used to, that Shen and Taric aren't useless and pathetic in comparison to pre-rework versions, and that champions need reworks just because they said so.\n\nTell me this, with the current regime how many people actually think there will be less things to agree with and more people saying sayonara to the game?  The ONLY reason I'm not on Overwatch is I need to update my GFX card first and I'm planning to build a new comp from scratch soon.  After that?   Tell me why I should stick around.\n\nFor trolls and AFK's who get one lousy five minute queue ban and then head right back in and do the same thing again? For smurfs in ranked holding down players who can't compete against a bronze III who is really Plat I on their actual account to help boost their friends, which is LEGAL? For decisions Riot makes on reworks, item and kit changes without bothering to ask the plebians who pay their salary if they like the idea first? For the once in a while \"crackdowns\" on toxic behavior that go away quickly and people are right back into their troll all day every day mode?\n\nThe last fun season I remember was 4.  It was also my last ranked season because it was getting unbearable and insulting to have to \"place\" back into your old rank.  I can imagine the look on any NFL quarterback or running back's face if the NFL said they have to \"do placements\" for their old position.  They earned it, and they should keep it, same as ranked players.   Now, with the archaic ELO system and their own messed up MMR they find a way to drop people up to two full tiers on placements from their old rank, making it much more difficult.  ELO was designed to measure the chances of somebody winning a game of chess between two people, not a 5vs5 team fight on a MOBA computer game in 2016.  \n\nWorse, their matchmaking!  I have a great teammate ribbon and over 1700 teamwork honors - How many times do you think I'm matched with others with ribbons?  If you guessed about 3 times a month out of 100-150 games, you'd be correct.  Why aren't good players with sportsmanlike honors given more teammates possessing the same traits? Hell, a few weeks ago I was matched with randoms vs a Plat IV and his pre-made buddies.  Another few times, I teamed with a friend just about to hit level 30 and we got paired against silver players... an under level 30 player matched with silver and higher? The system isn't just broken it's absolutely FUBAR'd.  \n\nIn the end, Riot needs to remember their paying, casual playerbase are their main income source.  Start catering to pros and your OWN view of what the game \"should\" be and chapter 11'll be calling soon enough, and there's no /remake to get out of that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-06-23T15:46:21.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Internet forums are not the majority.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShhYoureMuted","date":"2016-06-23T04:39:19.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point, I doubt League of Legends will ever improve.
