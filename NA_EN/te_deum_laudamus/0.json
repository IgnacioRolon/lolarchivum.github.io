Afterall, you have a hyper tank like poppy (which you don't know how to use), cass a hyper carry and a long range AA champ like cait. Your late game is strong, just because you can't figure out how to use the comp doesn't mean the game is over.\"\n \nCan u please show me how normaln communication looks like? Because everytime i try to communicate with my team, no matter how, all i can see as an response is ''who cares'' or ''i dont care''. Stop believing in this stupid idealistic ideas. This game was lost, They had too many range poke, too much damage which means even if i tank thier damage for all my hp it won't matter, they can overkill anyone from our teamcomp, u dont know how aram works. If u really think cait is a long range champion against lux or ezreal u are trolling. There is no late game in ARAM when game ends in 12 minutes no matter what just because enemy had better picks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Te Deum laudamus","date":"2018-12-30T15:43:57.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't be, because if those guys won't take off this ban and revert my honor i won't ever play this shitty game, cause i won't play game in which i can be banned for literally just talking with my teammates, I GUESS THIS IS WHY THIS CHAT IS ADDED TO THE GAME, but unluckly thats not it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-12-30T13:09:49.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I would not want your chat in my game.

My team could mute me!!! i tried my best to be nice - this is why i changed. I had 2 permabans because of insulting. \n\nYou're at least familiar with what negative behavior is, having been honor 4 and having had punishments before, so it shouldn't be surprising that this is both negative and could resort in a punishment.\n\nWas this the only game in your reform card? If so, did you recently have any other punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"Te Deum laudamus","date":"2018-12-30T13:44:53.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tell me please, is it fair to lose whole year work (honor 4) for one 12 min long game of ARAM saying 'go open, report toxic player, go ff', is it ok?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Te Deum laudamus","date":"2018-12-30T13:25:38.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On this account i had one chat restriction before, like year ago? Like january maybe, and that was fair in my opinion. Yes, that was ONE game, of ARAm, just getting it instantly after the game. I know what i did wrong, i just shoudlnt play the game, just dodge but it happend. But  this guy was toxic, what else should i say? I said truth, he was toxic. Yeah i got a lot of punishmend before but not for saying ''go ff, open, report'' just for flame, and this is why im so frustreted, not doing this anymore - still getting banned.","replies":[]}]}]}
