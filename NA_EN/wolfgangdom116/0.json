It keeps telling me that I am at maximum purchases of RP, and that I need to wait 24 hours every time i try. I don&#039;t know if this is a bug, or I can&#039;t add any RP anymore, but I wanna see if I can get any help on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T21:06:12.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh you're going to need to wait that *full 24 hours* before attempting to purchase again. If the store detects too many failed attempts at entering the card, it'll lock you out in case someone has hacked your account. If you make any attempts before the 24 hours have passed, then it resets the counter.","replies":[{"poster":"WolfGangdom116","date":"2017-07-24T22:52:40.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I waited a full 24 hours and an extra hour since the store was down.

Reach out to our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to get everything straightened out for you!","replies":[{"poster":"WolfGangdom116","date":"2017-07-25T00:23:17.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright thanks, I'll try for probably another 24 hours to see it'll work.
