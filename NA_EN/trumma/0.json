I have 2 Thresh tokens so I can unlock mastery 6 I guess but I don't have 500 blue essence. What is \"1 Thresh Permanent\" and \"1 Thresh Shard\". And is it even worth using these things to get Mastery 6?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T22:40:23.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone here gave some really solid details, and I hope it helps!  If you don't have a shard or permanent, you can use the store to purchase a random shard for a chance at one for Thresh, or burning them for blue essences.  Congrats on your prowess!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-10-14T22:21:55.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Thresh shard is the Thresh champion shard that you can get by opening hextech chests.\n\nThe \"permanent\" is what you get when you re-roll 3 other champion shards that you do not want. It is not simply just owning the champion. \n\nNow, to make mastery levels 6&7 easier to obtain, there is an option to purchase a random champion shard in the store for 1700 IP. If you don't get a Thresh shard from it, you can always disenchant the shard for blue essence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2016-10-14T22:20:33.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am pretty sure the \"Thresh Permanent\" is acutally owning the champion. The \"Thresh Shard\" is a thresh token in hextech crafting. Honestly though riot really fucked up the advanced mastery. It's not hard enough that you have to get 2 s- for mastery 6 and then 5 s for mastery 7, but they also said fuck you and made it so you need additional resources.","replies":[]}]}
