But it's becoming too much.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":14,"down_votes":10,"body":"Before I start, I will point out, I am a 27 year old guy. \r\nI study para-medicine &amp; work as an International Bodyguard/Private Security Officer when I'm not teaching Krav Maga back home.\r\n\r\nMy job is prevention. I Identify behaviour traits and patterns to ascertain risk level and minimize chances of said risk becoming an actuality.\r\n*That said, I already see it's not a great idea to post a thread such as this on these boards. *\r\nBut hey, I don't have to risk my life on this one, I only lose a moments time.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I do recognize the gap in *\"demographics\"* I force myself into by playing LoL. Considering LoL is largely a younger player-base. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong.\r\nThe game itself can be fun and challenging. **Which is why we play games don't we?**\r\nCharacters, Mechanics, Spells and Game Modes to name a few selling points.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe player-base however.\r\nIt is like watching the slow degradation of humanity.\r\n\r\nWhile I admit it is prevalent in real life, and that **I am far from a perfect example of what humanity has to offer**, the ever growing *\"shield of internet\"* people wear makes 'communities' such as LoL hard to bear. And, quite often, contributes to humanities degradation at a much faster rate.\r\n\r\nA few points I noticed:\r\n\r\n**1. Ego.**\r\nThis game reeks of it. From the top down.\r\n\r\n*-Announcers in the world streams.* From the way they speak. It is so \"know it all\" it can be hard to watch the play-by-play breakdowns and Panel discussions.\r\n*-\"Pro players\"*. Skills and knowledge of the game? You betchya. Nobody is taking that away from them.\r\nUnsportsman-like attitudes? Oh we know it to be true. (Though not all are guilty). And it does set an example.\r\n*-Casual gamers.* Just play a few games and see.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a lot of this identification of ego being present, you can literally watch the interactions in facial expression, team communications, narrations of live streams and webcams of LoL players. Doing this, you can see how especially in the *\"pro circuit\"* the ego is immense .\r\nOr just jump on the forum.\r\n\r\n**Ego is not a good thing.** \r\nAnd what is scary is the fact that while, *that kid probably wont go and shoot up his school because he played Postal 2*, the physical** and** mental behavioural patterns that are created by people who **routinely** exhibit these types of attitudes (such as being ego-centric jerks), ACTUALLY have the patterns manifest in real life encounters.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I have had the \"miss fortune\" :P of working and training alongside people who exhibited the aforementioned traits.\r\nThey never make it far.\r\n\r\nEgo is a f***ing monster. All it does is hinder true growth and understanding. \r\n\r\n\r\nI want to point out something that perhaps is a bit of a *'nitpicking'* but, even that LoL world championships 2014 song \"Warriors\"\r\n\r\nLook at the character interactions. \r\nThe glares at one another.\r\nThe Looks of the characters (a gross misperception to the reality of how the players actually look. Though I'm not here to debate what a gamer should look like.)\r\nEven the lyrics. Apart from the opening verse being ironically hypocritical, the lyrics alongside the imagery depict a fair amount of Ego in the characters whom are meant to be (I imagine) a reflection of the LoL community.\r\n\r\nOverall, the Ego is strong in this community. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Sheep. Far out LoL players can act like sheep. **\r\nIt's as though ANYTHING you do in a game and you are flamed. UNLESS Faker did it. Or someone else from the *\"pro\"* league.\r\nAnd god forbid you want to use something/someone you are good at over what is considered 'acceptable'.\r\n\r\nThen something you were flamed for a week ago can now be the norm because \"some guy did it in his stream.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, \"Words\" used in games (and now Real Life).\r\n*Now this will also tie into my next point. (I will give examples there)*\r\n\r\nIt takes a week for someone to come up with a new turn of phrase and BAM...everyone is doing it.\r\nWhile it is funny at first, and in small moderation, these behavioural traits infect people subconsciously and it does manifest into real life habit.\r\nI will prove it to you in the next section.\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Language skills.**\r\n(Just a **few** examples)\r\n*Rekt. wot? Dat smite doe. Fast blitz is fast.*\r\nAnd my personal hatred.\r\nThe over-use of the verbal filler \"Like\"\r\n\r\nMost people are utterly oblivious as to just how much they use such words known as \"verbal fillers\"\r\nIt is literally used because people want to talk faster than they are actually thinking. Then, it becomes a habit. \r\n\r\nNow the proof. \r\nGo and listen to a friend talk. Or a sibling. Hell, watch the recent LoL panel-type discussions or streams. You will hear it more when you are aware of it. And when you become aware of it. It becomes painful to listen to. \r\nYou can literally remove most (if not all) the uses of the word \"like\" in many people's sentence structure and have it **not only** make perfect sense, **but** it will actually sound less imbecilic.\r\n\r\nIf I hear someone in my industry talk like this, it's usually understood that they aren't a desired team member as it shows the lack of thought.\r\nYes even a lack of thought before speech can lead to a lack of thought before action. *(Plus it's downright unprofessional.)*\r\nThe body/mind works this way. Patterns and habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot many people actually know that the *\"like\"* habit began in the 80's with the pitiful \"Valley Girl\" trend.\r\n\r\nAnd now, it is so prevalent that I have seen people WRITE it in sentences.\r\n*Talk about utterly superfluous.*\r\n\r\nUsing this word instead of the multitude of verbs that the English language offers isn't evolution – it’s regression. It’s nothing more than a grammatical cancer.\r\n\r\n*(Though it is less prevalent throughout European/Asian countries as opposed to Native English ones..though I fear it could spread)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**If you stuck with me thus far, then kudos!**\r\n\r\nI know it was a long one, however I had a moment and thought I'd have a bit of a gripe.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I am feeling that this community is painfully regressed beyond what I can stand.\r\nThe *(possible)* responses I get to this thread could send me packing, or potentially give me a shred of light here.\r\n\r\nI would note that I would like to stick around - because lets face it, player-base aside, LoL is a pretty fun game as far as MOBAs are concerned.\r\nAnd Riot offers quite a lot to its customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again if you stuck with me.\r\n\r\nCheers ~","replies":[]}
