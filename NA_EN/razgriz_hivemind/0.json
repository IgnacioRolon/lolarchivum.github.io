I've had near breakdowns over it","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":22,"body":"I have played League since Season 3 and I can't begin to express how much I regret ever playing this game. It has done so much emotional and mental damage to me and the stress of it is a constant struggle between trying to enjoy a well made game that has unfortunately significant portions of toxic players and a company that doesn't care. Part of this I blame Riot for never, ever, taking measures to truly end the struggles we suffer dealing with players who ruin the game, and the broken, absurd punishment system Riot put into place.\r\n\r\nI think I've become addicted to this game as I play it once or twice a day or every other day, and there isn't a week I go without playing league once. I start feeling bad if I haven't played in awhile, perhaps because the game feeds your endorphins or whatever chemical in your brain gives you the satisfaction of playing it. Riot claims they censor speech if it's negative, but it truly makes little difference at all, and sometimes it makes it alot worse. \r\n\r\nRiot will allow you to afk many many times maybe forever in games and never truly get banned with only a few exceptions, but will ban players who flame you. Sounds good? It's not. Those players, even the ones who say the worst things, racist and homophobic things, players who tell you to kill yourself, they will be banned, but Riot will allow them to make another account and they will return like nothing happened. \r\n\r\nI believe Riot doesn't care about anyone being toxic. They only care about money. And they know when they ban players they will just make a new account often times, and spend all that money on things they purchased before and the cycle continues. They lie about their statistics on number of players being banned. There are solutions but they will never or have never tried them.\r\n\r\nEither find a way to permanently ban people, by IP or MAC address or something, or don't ban anyone at all for any reason, except maybe DDosing or cheating.  I have heard that on Koreans servers, they almost never ban anyone, and that you have to use your photo ID just to register to play the game. this would mean no one has a second account. This brings alot more reason for accountability and better behavior. They also could instead permanently ban people from using chat, and have options to disable chat permanently. People could still use pings to communicate.\r\n\r\nor they could add voice chat for all players, the only reason I think they haven't is because they can't monitor it. This is something that fits if they were to end censorship.\r\n\r\nThose are the possible solutions, end censorship or start doing actual PERMANENT bans on these people who ruin games. People that have ruined games for me and try to ruin games is probably 1 out of 5 games, every time.  It has caused me many days and nights of emotional distress. And it's almost as though my brain is addicted to the game, perhaps it's the money making portion of the game. \r\n\r\nI feel like I need therapy as I have massive depression and panic attacks over these incidents, with these terrible people. And I admit I have many times AFK'd games because of toxic people, and not been punished for it. That is a terrible solution. They won't punish or rarely punish afk but seem to punish verbal more. \r\n\r\nI was once banned for saying \"my team... so heavy\". That as all I said and got 2 week banned. On a team where I had a 0/18 gankplank at the 15 minute mark and a mid laner who just kept running into tower over and over at 0/11. Who then said they would report me for saying they were heavy. It was clearly inting. Im punished for stating a fact? I've reported so many people who said far worse things and i never once got a notification they were dealt with. Meanwhile people call me the N Word and much more and then they intentionally feed and there is no punishment for it. I have never seen anyone get banned for inting except when it's on stream. \r\n\r\nRiot, you do not care about us. If you did you would do one of the following: \r\nIp or MAC address bans on toxic players, or\r\nRequired Photo ID for account creation and only allow 1 account, or\r\nAdd chat bans or disabled chat permanently to the options or enforce them on toxic players, removing their ability to chat at all, or\r\nend all censorship and let people say whatever they want, at least then it's fair game on these terrible people. \r\n\r\nBut as for me, hopefully this is goodbye. This company and this game have been nothing but trouble for me, and I don't blame the developers, I blame the people who write the TOS, the support team and marketers.  You've done nothing but bathe in corruption, greed, hypocrisy, and neglect.","replies":[{"poster":"BoRnToKiLL666","date":"2019-10-30T18:53:05.505+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"So then stop playing it?\n\n{{champion:74}}","replies":[{"poster":"Razgriz Hivemind","date":"2019-10-30T19:03:56.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BoRnToKiLL666,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ha95FhFX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-30T18:53:05.505+0000)\n>\n> So then stop playing it?\n> \n> {{champion:74}}\n\ni'd like my 140 bucks back i've spent on the game.

Let me break this down for you so you can understand what is being argued here and what is not.\n\n------------------------\n                                                                                           **_Argument A_**\n                                                                                   \n**A movie theater does not kick out people based on rules but merely suggests behavior and kicks people out subjectively who exhibit poor behavior.**\n\nThis is the argument you led with and the one that I have rebuffed. I pointed out that movie theaters do indeed have rules and they kick people out who break the rules and not just on a whim or based on a customer complaint. \n\nRather than deny that you responded with...\n\n--------------------------\n                                                                                            ** _Argument B_**\n                                                                                           \n**Movie theaters can't make a rule kicking people out for talking or using their cell phone**\n\nThis is the second argument you're trying to make which isn't related to the first. This is not being argued nor was it ever argued. I DID point out that Regal does have a rule against cell phone usage while the movie is playing but that is just showing that movie theaters have rules. What kind of rules they have is irrelevant to Argument A. You're most likely not going to get thrown out of a movie theater for talking. You will if you light a cigarette in there though.\n\nOf course there are unwritten rules everywhere you go that are implied. Most of these rules are laws in society so breaking the law will still get you thrown out of places. In terms of your argument about cell phones specifically, the only point is any usage is against the rules of that particular movie theater. It doesn't mean they will throw you out, more than likely they will just ask you to stop the behavior. But if the doctor keeps getting house calls during the movie, they're gonna ask him to leave if he doesn't step outside.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-10-31T11:37:11.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"First, my whole point, as originally stated, is that theaters cannot say __ABSOLUTELY__ NO CELL PHONES or NO TALKING. However, people get removed from theaters for these reasons, but the customer is breaking no rule in the process. The rest of what I state is backing that point up. In other words: your so-called argument B is where I started.\n\nI'm not making up a stance for you. Really. Let's try again. First, I did acknowledge they have rules. However, most rules are black and white, but the cell phone is uniquely not. This is not a subjective interpretation, it is clearly different from the others. Likewise, talking in theaters isn't against the rules but it is ABSOLUTELY something that can get you kicked out. In other words, you are SUBJECTIVELY removed from the theater when you're not directly breaking rules. There's more to it, but often in such cases, you're entitled to a refund, even if asked to not return. Further, despite what you're saying, the simple use of your devices isn't against the rules. It is __recommended behavior__ to not use it.\n\nYou understand that, minus the part about it being recommended behavior and not an absolute rule. So why is it recommended behavior and not an actual, absolute rule?\n\nBecause it is illegal to block the use of cell phones in America, generally speaking, thanks to instances of emergencies. Hence why the doctor is perfectly in line for answering his phone in a theater to see if it is an emergency __before taking it out of the theater__ (which I said already). There are rare circumstances where cell phone use CAN be disallowed- but schools and theaters are not among them. The theater _cannot_ say you are not allowed to use your cell phone at all. Still, I also acknowledge that disruptively using your phone can, and should, get you kicked out.\n\nAgain, the whole point is that cell phone use is the only rule that isn't absolute in that list, unlike all the other rules, which makes it subjective. So if a manager goes up to the doctor who took one call and walked out of the theater, saying \"you have to leave because you broke the cell phone rule\", that manager's employment might end up in question if no refund is given, as you seem to understand. The theater seems to have struggled with this rule, seemingly as if they were told they can't outright disallow phones, given how every other rule was written.\n\nSo if it's not a clear, black-and-white rule, when can it be cited as grounds for removal? When it's disruption is considered significant enough, without violating the rights of a person to take a call in the first place. And, when is that?\n\n_When someone complains about it._ These questions are not meant as stand in arguments for you, but to show their logical connection. These are direct responses. I've been expanding on previous statements, believing them to have been sufficient to explain why.\n\nLastly, regarding unwritten rules, isn't it an oddity that the word \"talk\" or any of its synonyms isn't anywhere in the written rules, outside of \"communication devices\"? You do realize that taking action on unwritten rules is the pinnacle of subjective judgement?\n\nAnyway, I know what I'm talking about. I was the one making these subjective decisions at one time in my life, and I've had my share of angry rebuttal over my choices yet rarely did I make a mistake.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Razgriz Hivemind","date":"2019-11-01T12:49:52.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GatekeeperTDS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ha95FhFX,comment-id=00000000000000000001,timestamp=2019-10-30T21:16:28.951+0000)\n>\n> You were not sold anything.

You should buy a game, and PLAY it to unlock the content in the game, not PAY MORE. But unfortunately, for years people have supported these models by buying the content and putting the time into the product. Its now accepted by most people, otherwise most people wouldnt support it, and the business model would fail. I never knew about them until like 6 or 7 years ago, because I always played RPG games on consoles, or starcraft, or diablo 2. I was so disappointed when I finally got my own PC and saw so many games using this model. Oh well... the way things have progressed through the years has irritated me for the past 20 years, in much more significant aspects of society than video games.

Before getting any more bullshit from Riot (but really Tencent since Riot's their servant now im willing to bet) i'll just opt out. It's been about a week and i'm pretty much over it. Perma chat mutes are great, if players continue to be toxic they need to find a way to deal with them, even if it means only moderating ranked games, not shilling out on the whole procedure for a much lazier one.
