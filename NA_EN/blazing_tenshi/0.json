You can only get as many chests as how many champs you own and play. So let's say you have a champion pool of thirty champions, which is quite high. And assume that in one season you get an S on all of them. That would mean 30 chests in a year. \nNow, 4x12 is 48 keys a year. This is the absolute maximum for keys, but it's not rare to get two keys a month, which would equate 24 keys. \nI'm pretty sure I won't get an S on 24 champions that I own this  year. So while certain people who own a lot of champs and play a different one every game might have more chests than keys by the end of the year, I think most people will end up with more keys.\n\nExcept if you play with premades I guess, but I'm talking about solo players here.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2016-05-15T17:40:16.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is around 140 champions and you are assuming people play on accounts with less than 40 owned at any given time?\n\nPlus chests are calculated based on whether you own the champion at the time.
