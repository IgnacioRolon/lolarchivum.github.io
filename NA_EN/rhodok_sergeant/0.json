I've always thought it'd be neat to have an actual snake champion that's a jungler. Like .  . . an actual snake, not that cassiopea crap. Like a big, monstrous snake that maybe even eats people/ monsters. I'm not sure I would lean on poison?? But it's possible. You could get ideas from the basilisk from harry pottee, or even Nagini?\n\nI think there's a lot of potential to make it a really solid champion. Can either make it an assassin with the the camoflague slither route with a coil snare/ stun. Or, you could go the debilitating poisonous route . . . can also make it so steraks + cleaver + cinderhulk or good buys on it and turn it into a giant python like champ that scales in size with health and acts sort of like camille? A big beefy champ that sneaks up on you and plays like an assassin, but is this terrifying/sneaky bruiser assassin lock down champ.\n\nUltimate can be some form of hypnotizing CC(think jungle book) or the champion literally eating another champion?  \n\n\nCould very easily tie this champ to the void, and or the jungle where Qiyana comes from. And instead of making it very Anime-esque/cheesy. You could go full brutal and terrifying with this champ (like reksai) make a fixation on its eyes + tongue. Slithering + maybe even tracking capabilities.\n\n\nThere is a crap ton you can play around with, and ive always wanted a legitimate snake champion. Itd be sooo awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhodok Sergeant","date":"2019-08-16T04:19:39.787+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOTS has Dehaka.
