By this I don't necessarily mean pure AD focus, I was hoping maybe there would be an item that granted a minor amount of damage and would have a poking focus. The fully built item would be a bit like this (the passive is my real focus the rest could really be just about anything): [Not sure about name yet] +15 Attack Damage, +200 Health, UNIQUE Active: Grants 10(+7% of bonus attack damage) attack damage to nearby allies for 3 seconds. (750 Range) UNIQUE Passive: Upon damaging an enemy with a basic attack, deal another 10(+7.5% of bonus attack damage) points of non-fatal physical damage and gives 25 gold. (15 Second Cooldown). It would probably be a blade looking similar to the> {{item:3144}} \n\nWhat do you think? I think it would be fun and really helpful for the odd team comps. It would certainly make things more interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-07-23T01:22:51.530+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem with AD supports is that they need a gold item to avoid stealing farm from the proper ADC. An AD support item isn't bad at all, it just needs to have a way to give gold while encouraging the AD support's playstyle. A way to do this would be to tinker with the Spellthief's Edge, and make an AD version of it. The third-tier item's active could be an attack-speed debuff for a single target or an attack-speed buff to those around.","replies":[{"poster":"PsychoticFreak","date":"2014-07-23T01:31:42.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the poke passive is what should give the gold as well, and thanks I forgot about that. Also the frost Queen's claim doesn't actually seem that supportive to me, I wanted a bit more support in terms of power. This item also is pretty similar to the Spellthief's edge now that I look at it.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-07-23T01:35:39.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, Riot is really hating auras right now. Sona's getting a rework due to this, because auras are an invisible power that doesn't affect play-counterplay and instead lets your allies do what they were already doing, but invisibly better. The aura part of the passive should be removed and instead turned into an active for the third-tier-level of the item itself (like Talisman of Ascension is with movespeed).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"eztarg3t","date":"2014-07-23T01:30:46.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"let's not forget many of the items in the shop are more focused towards ap supports(I think.).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-07-23T01:54:36.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3050}}","replies":[{"poster":"PsychoticFreak","date":"2014-07-23T01:58:28.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changed it to an active 3 second boost.
