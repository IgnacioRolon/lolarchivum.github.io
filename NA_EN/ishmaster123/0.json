Then guess what..after waiting 20 min to finally join a game it happens again and I have to start **ALL OVER** its very aggravating.\n\nBefore this never happened to me but now i cant see post match stats, Chat disconnects, all panels within the launcher appear black. I receive constant connection interruptions among random disconnects, post loading screen splash , when i queue with friends it stops me from accepting matches, even going to the shop to buy things this happens and I cant buy anything.  I would like to know if there is a fix or something because I want to play this game but having \"Connection Timeout: The request to the PVP.net server timed out.\" pop up all the time is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T20:41:10.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that you having severe network problems that's failing to stay connected to our servers, which would result in failing to use basic functions of the client or get into game.
