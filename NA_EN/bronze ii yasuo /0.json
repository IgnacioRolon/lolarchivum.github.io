Your minions.\n\nIf he kills you before you leave the W, you didn't leave fast enough.\n\nGraves is NOT tanky at the beginning of a fight. Half of his durability comes from E stacks, which he doesn't have many of early into a fight, and the rest comes from lifesteal, which can be countered by Nomicon or Executioners. Tankier than the average marksman? Yeah.

He has to build nearly full damage to be effective and has to get up close to deal damage, and his autos can be body blocked. He's fairly easy to kill late game, and laughably easy for almost any skirmisher, diver, or juggernaut to duel late game.\n\n> &amp;quot;oh but his winrate goes down late game so wait&amp;quot; wait for what late game doesn&amp;#039;t even exist and his win rate still hovers close to that 50% even if you get there.\n\nNormally it's even lower than that, it just so happens that lethality is too strong right now. And you said he scales very well. A 49% win rate isn't scaling well. Master Yi has a 56% win rate late game. Vayne 59%. They're actual late game champions.\n\n> He can get nearly 150+ armor and magic resistance without building a single fucking resistance item, like who thought that would be a genius idea? \n\nHe also can't deal a great deal of damage without building it. Whereas champions like Jax, Master Yi, or Darius have a lot of damage built into their kit and can build some durability to keep themselves alive, Graves gets some durability in his kit so he can build mostly damage items and succeed. \n \n> He stays way too healthy in the jungle because he can infinity kite meanwhile Kindred needed to be gutted having a mediocre 42% win rate early due to weak clear.\n\nHis clear is a problem yes, and he is certainly OP. Kindred was just as OP or more-so when she was nerfed, and was even more frustrating because her good early game let her transition into a formidable late game. She also has more utility than Graves.\n\n> He scales way too well with life steal items for a tank (yes I&amp;#039;m going to call this piece of shit a tank)\n\nYou'd be stupid to do so my friend. \n\n> and other items like PD giving him too much dueling potential.

Don&amp;#039;t even get my started with lethality build.\n\nEarly game he's a strong duelist. Without a lead he's laughable mid to late game. The problem is that right now he's too good at getting that lead.\n\n> This champion ever since his rework has been completely disgusting and unfun to play against meanwhile Riot balance team is taking an extended vacation thinking Graves is healthy for this game? Lmao what a joke. \n\nHe was fine for a little while until the lethality buffs.\n\n> Revert his rework it&amp;#039;s been a complete failure ever since his rework he&amp;#039;s been problematic, regardless if he&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot;.\n> \n> /End Rant and Salt.\n\nI can't help but notice that you didn't actually manage to address how Graves has no counterplay. It's likely because you're not very intelligent and are using it as a buzzword to make your post seem more legitimate than it is, when Graves does in fact have counterplay, more than most marksmen.\n\nSo first of all, Graves is the only champion in the game whose auto attacks can be body blocked by someone else. Late game his DPS and survivability fall off a bit, leaving him with his burst, leaving his autos to be body blocked by your tank. Furthermore, his attack speed is fixed and he has a reload mechanic, meaning you know how many shots he can take before he blows his load.\n\nHis Q also has counterplay, being that it has a delay for the fallback damage (the bulk of the damage), and of course he only gets the instant fallback if it hits a wall, meaning you can counter it with your positioning as well.\n\nHis W has the counterplay of walking out of it, though this is admittedly less notable than the previous two abilities.\n\nHis E is just a short-ranged dash that gives him a durability steroid. There's not much counterplay because it doesn't do much. You can still stop him mid dash obviously.\n\nHis ult is a long range relatively narrow skill shot that you can avoid by dodging it or, if he's firing it at your front line, not positioning in the blast cone.\n\nGraves is OP right now, but to claim that he has no counterplay when his autos can literally be body blocked by a minion is stupid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-03-05T16:10:44.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I was playing master Yi yesterday.
