You cannot assume a 5 man bronze premade vs. any number of golds, plats etc. is going to be fair and the fact that they have to do this in the first place to try and 'balance' DQ is proof that it is flawed at its core. There are far too many variables and the majority of the time it's still a shitshow for one side or the other. These band-aids are naive and short sighted and they cannot fix the root of the problem.\n\nImagine it this way; I have a scale and I give out two different sizes of gold nuggets. Who gets which size is completely random. Eventually the people getting less gold are unhappy, and rightfully so. When I place the two nuggets on a scale it's obvious who gets the shorter end of the stick.\n\nSo to balance things out, I place a mechanism under the scale on the side I weigh the smaller nugget to pull it down. I place both sized pieces on the scale and demonstrate that they're now balanced. In a way, they are. The scale appears even. But it's not because I've equalized the amount of gold I give people. I've just artificially inflated one side. The problem is still there. No matter how I calibrate the scale, or put little rocks on one side, or cut the larger gold nugget into little pieces. **People will still receive different amounts of gold**.\n\nOkay, so you have a 4-man premade. Obviously they stomp 5 solo players. So you place them against players 2 tiers above them. Their individual mechanical skill will never be greater than the higher ranked player so they're still free to snowball their lane or solo carry. Conversely, no matter how good a player is, they are still just one person. One champion. They cannot provide the same level of communication or cohesion as a 4 man team. Either the higher ranked player snowballs out of control or gets massacred 1v4. The odds of the two imbalances somehow cancelling each other out and creating a perfect equilibrium between the individual skill of the higher ranked player and the coordination of the premade is **zilch**.\n\n**TL;DR**: Dynamic Queue is a patchwork akin to sewing a banana to a cat and painting the cat yellow to 'balance things out'.
