Even if you attempt to retaliate during their cooldown windows, you will stillburn a resource that recovers MUCH slower than your opponent's does, and once their cooldowns are back up they don't need to also wait for mana recovery to jump you.\n\nLet a lane phase go long enough and the mana user will always end up low and either recalling or dying. If they can't burst the manaless user down before their mana resource dies to attrition, it's gg for the lane. And manaless champions often have equal or HIGHER burst damage to mana users, so the mana user doesn't have the power advantage needed to kill while their resources are strong enough to allow free spell use.\n\nJust my opinion, but I really don't think champions with infinite or swiftly-recovering resources like Manaless Rage Energy and Flow should HAVE burst damage. Their long-lasting resources should give them an Over Time advantage, not a Burst advantage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-12-23T19:05:09.253+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"You learn to budget your mana.\n\nEdit: kinda hard for mana based champions to fall out of favor when the MAJORITY of champions are mana based.

Can't say much about them since I don't play Assassins that often. But when I do, I tend to find myself bullying or killing my opponents, long before mana becomes a problem. For an Assassin, Mana isn't something you need to regenerate. It just needs to hold out until your job is done. \n\nMost Fighters have Taken up Corrupting potion. Seems like a fine replacement for flask. And those champs seem to only have said problems in the early game. Which is what Corrupting potion is so good for. \n\nAs for tanks, I'd argue the one's who don't build FH are most likely Juggernauts. But Juggernauts, (like Assassins) can do their Job long before the mana runs out. But most Caster Tanks should build FH. Simply put it, Your CC is your Defenses. Your enemy can't hurt you if their CCed.
