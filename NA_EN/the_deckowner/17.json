It's fair to take this approach and see if they further need buffs rather then make them too strong and have the opposite effect - from games ending abruptly with few mistakes to games never ending because you can't destroy the first turrets.\n\nHonestly, the buffs were more than fair. I am not sure what were you expecting but having someone get killed from just one turret shot is not acceptable either.\nTower buffs were majorly focused on turret diving with pals, where turrets switching focus won't reset the stacking damage buff and they ramp up in one shot less than before (from 4 to 3). They also have an early game damage resistance buff to every type of damage and also protection from backdooring.\nTurret gold has also been reduced in general, for tier 1 and 2 turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"NsEternal","date":"2016-05-22T20:30:55.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think you're over exaggerating what i meant by buffing them. i dont want them to do more damage i just want them to have more armor and hp at earlier levels. the fact of the matter is the towers are basically are as strong as cardboard pre 10 mins and are basically useless after that.

Whether this wasn't enough will require time to see clearly, as Riot never wants to make last minute changes to the game that can have an impact in prolonging the game substantially.\n\nWe both remember the Marksmen update, where the average game time was reduced by a few minutes. That was a huge deal but Riot was making the changes in that direction.\nNow imagine if they didn't do their homework and overbuffed turrets so that the average game time goes up about 10+ minutes. That would've completely screwed things up and the games would feel very different because everything would've been delayed for an additional 10 minutes.\n\nI'm completely OK with them not buffing something enough and then buffing it gradually until it's fair because this way, you will always have better experience than before, as opposed to overbuffing them and feeling like you can never finish a game if 5 people are not whaling on a turret to do any meaningful damage.\n\nJust my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"NsEternal","date":"2016-05-27T14:37:43.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well at least we can come to an understanding on that point, only time will tell and we will just have to wait.
