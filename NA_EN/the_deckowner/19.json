It's still my main, but there used to be a time where Smite wasn't *mandatory*. I'm not implying that I wouldn't get it or anything, but it has gotten to the point that a jungler simply cannot sustain a realistically positive role on the team without Smite present. I forgot Smite for one game this season. It was the scariest match I've ever had, and my team's support *was quite strong*. I even bought a backup plan, the Hunter's Potion. That in itself was a questionably good idea, as the sustain it provides is peanuts when your clear rate is that abysmal.\n\nIt used to be that junglers could keep up in level, and therefore relevance, even if their jungle was grudgingly hard to clear without a jungle item. They, instead, had to invest in a jungle item to scale up their gold income to ensure their relevance lategame. However, with experience being the price paid for lacking a jungle item, if you fail to perform for whatever reason, you are now behind in level and gold, which leaves a compounding penalty to your clear speed and vulnerability throughout the entire game.\n\nThe entire jungling scheme needs rethought, methinks.

I definitely think if they're gonna tie it directly to the role like that they DO need to clean up the summoner spell interactions with DQ/NCS right away - I've had a fair number of support games where I end up with summoner spells like teleport because of the same issue, though it's not QUITE the same as not having smite on a jungler (the tp janna ganks 2 gud).","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2016-07-04T05:14:11.795+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was not mandatory before jungle items required Smite.

Roles are to e-sports what positions are to real sports.  So are you seriously going to tell me that a football team should have like 15 quarterbacks, 1 halfback, and leave all the other positions vacant?\n\nAbsolutely not, that would never work. What I mean isn't so much to alter the roles entirely, but rather have variance in placement and tactics. For example, some European football teams play with all their forwards far ahead and one midfielder, while on other teams they prefer to keep three midfielders and two forwards.\n\nSome examples of what I mean might include...\n\n* Top lane bruiser and a tanky support with Smite, mid lane caster, bot lane ADC and traditional support. Smite is there for objectives and can proc Targon, and it'd be hard to bully that lane out. Alternately, a less sturdy toplaner who deals more damage and a tanky support.\n* Normal top lane, a passive solo botlaner who can control space, and three mid. One caster, one ADC and one assassin who can roam into the jungle now and then for extra farm. Maybe even let the ADC roam for some farm around 5:00. This strategy would either force their jungler to camp mid or would give mid an insane push. Possibly both.\n* Two ADCs mid, one with Smite for objectives. A caster and a pokey support bot, and a normal top. Two ADCs would be able to deal enough damage without abilities that most mid lane casters would have a very difficult time outsustaining them. Meanwhile, in bot, you have the potential for a caster to turn any potential armor rune strategies on its head and burst down the enemy ADC with a tanky support to protect them.\n\nThese are just ideas for how the tactics might change, but through them, you can see what I mean. It's not so much that I think it should be an all tank or all ADC game (although I did have a game with four tanks and a Syndra and we absolutely dominated), more than there could be slight variations in how the traditional meta roles are deployed.\n\nBefore anyone counters with \"BUT THAT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE...\", it expects every player involved as the skill to run such a setup. But that's nothing different from any real sport or, for that matter, normal League play. Any strategy should play to the strengths of the players executing that strategy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
