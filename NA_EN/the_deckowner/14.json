What you can do with the rectangle is place it so the centre is slightly behind the enemy. If they want to dodge the spell when you do this they have to run forwards.

If for instance it was a soraka support, she could heal twice and use her ultimate and heal spell to account for about 30 or 40% of this but nothing is ever perfect\n\nzyra can unleash her entire combo in a matter of seconds and for the majority of that, the opponent will be crowd controlled\n\nfor instance, let's say auto attack, ignite, exhaust, and then a full spell rotation, the damage is there.  of course, that only accounts for the lower elos, but so long as there is a target (such as if caitlynn were to land a trap) then there is no reason why her full damage would not happen other than player inability\n\ndo some research on her stats and the masteries and see what you come up with.  Of course an ADC should run magic resist runes to account for their low scaling, but some opt for outright damage\n\neven so, if you account for 30% of the damage with resistances (if they were potentially optimal as i'm not sure what the exact format is but the player could achieve a decent amount by sacrificing early offense), let's say that leaves them with neutral amounts of base magic resistance total as the wikia seems to account for by stating the amount a total of 25 magic resist would account for though if we use their exact formula, 30 magic resistance:  100/130 =  76% of damage is dealt\n\nnow, let's apply that to my figures and bear in mind that is their optimal scenario unless they bought items early for hexdrinker\n\nfor the sake of saving some typing, i'm goign to include armor in these results (and yes, each auto attack is roughly 52 damage at level 6 from a zyra so with 2 that comes to 104 instead of my 100 estimate)\n\nall of this in mind, it still comes to 846 damage,\n\nwith this in mind, it will take roughly one ability and one auto attack on the part of the adc or 2 to three auto attacks to kill the opponent\n\nSoraka can increase that amount, but so long as the opponent is not given optimal circumstances, it is still almost a guaranteed kill with less than 300 hp remaining\n\ncorki, ezreal, varus, caitlynn, jinx and any marksman who has abilities to cast within their early game can finish this amount\n\noptimal circumstances\n\nif they have a soraka to heal or a nami to end the fight, then yes, the ADC will survive\n\n\nblitzcrank can throw this math out the window as any opponent within range long enough is going to die\n\n\nit's all situational, but yes, a support zira with absolutely attrocious gold income can finish off a marksman that has not specifically dedicated runes to countering such damage\n\nalso, within the build I set up, the masteries increase allied damage to the target by 3% , although minor, it can add figures","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2017-02-05T22:25:43.749+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No Zyra EVER takes that mastery.

A 260 AP build should not be high damage for a mage, if it is you probably have too much base damage.\n\nIn Zyra's case this is very true, it takes her 760 AP to double the damage on her plants, her main source of damage. Her plants deal 114 damage at 18 before any AP, if you have 760 AP, a very high AP build they deal 228 damage. Nami's W deals 230 damage, if you have the same 760 AP build Nami's W deals 610, almost triple its base.

Maybe you forget, but when {{champion:12}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:53}} etc. were strong, they were also considered overpowered and anti-fun to play against, just like {{champion:63}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:143}} are right now. That's not even mentioning the fact that half those champs at least have been meta within the past year or so\n\nBlitzcrank for instance, considered a classic support by the majority of players, is downright obnoxious to play against. When he is good, he has an overly potent burst combo that leaves him exceptionally safe while hard CCing an enemy champ for multiple seconds while bringing a lone enemy into the waiting arms of his team. He decided team fights on a single hit or miss. This was far less healthy than having a bursty mage-like support (although I gotta say the OG mage \"supports\" like Morg and Annie are pretty bad too).\n\nThe problem with support as a role is that *utility has become too prolific within League's cast of champions, in tandem with the ever growing damage creep.* \"Old school\" supports are essentially irrelevant  in any iteration of the modern meta because you don't need a pure CC>Heal>Poke bot anymore, you can just find a team with the necessary supplemental abilities. That's why it works to have a support who's main contribution is bursty engage, because you've got multiple sources of DPS, plenty of frontline (for what its worth in the current nuclear war tier damage comps) at least two other champs with hard CC, etc.\n\nFurthermore is the issue of gold. Supports are earning more gold than ever, and this is actually NOT GOOD for \"traditional\" supports, since their main selling point is *not needing gold because of what they bring in utility*. As I just stated, their standout utility isn't standout anymore, so being able to function without gold in a role which actually makes plenty of gold now is essentially obsolete. This leads to them either being useless because another champ that uses gold better is more potent throughout the game, or because these champs once given gold are too strong and subsequently nerfed to keep from being oppressive.\n\nTL;DR: Classic supports were only relevant when their function was unique (high function and capability on a minimal budget, unique combination of traits that couldn't be found in other classes) and have at this point become irrelevant, thus leading to the cycle of support types tied to what is meta in the other roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2017-02-05T19:11:36.755+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:143}} is an official base disruptor support.\n\n{{champion:63}} & {{champion:161}} are recognized as supports.\n\n{{champion:90}} is a result of a identity issue that currently provide to much disruptor tools to a champion that suppose to be designed as a primary battle mage.\n\nAP supports are fine, they are relatively ballanced.
