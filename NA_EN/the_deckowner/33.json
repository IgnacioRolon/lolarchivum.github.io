Seriously how is any part of this considered new?\n\nSo remembers season 2/3 when the jungler actually was a support, and built items like sightstone and iron solaris, small camps took almost twice as long to respawn, and there was no rubberbanning to keep you from falling off hard.  The jungle reworks have done nothing but move jungler away from support tank, and thats why champs like kindred, graves, elise and nid are dominating.   Yet even in that early S3 state jungler was still the highest impact roll you could play.  Plz pull your heads out of the clouds.\n\nYou are the only player on the map whole is accountable to every lane so oc you are going to have people gripe when things go bad.  Do you really expect them to take credit for there own failures?  This is the fucking internet learn to ignore people. On the other hand you are the only player in a position to look at what is going on in the early game and fix/snowball it.  And if you are playing tank jungle you basically are the defacto play caller. Make good choices, you will win games.\n\nIf you rely on a buff make it clear in the lobby, and if they dont respect it use smite, or steal the other junglers buffs. Honestly if you cant secure your buffs from your own team, counter jungle to put more buffs on your side or just deal without it you pretty much suck at jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky Moniker","date":"2016-06-27T12:35:30.775+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy has got it right, even when I play Shaco or Elise I still go in with a 'support' mindset where it is all about getting your team fed.
