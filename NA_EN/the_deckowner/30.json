Liandry's is an infinitely better item on her, and you still proc the double burn with E snare, E plant slow, and ult knockup. In other words, Rylai's is a wasted item on Zyra for all-ins.\n\n\nIts only real use on her is for the double burn on Q plants only, which means you're trying to zone or poke. In that case, Luden's is probably the better item, and it has the added benefit of being great for all-ins and better for wave clear.\n\nA lot of Zyras still build it, but there's split opinion amongst high-ranked Zyras over whether it's actually worth it. One said says it's a wasted item because you should be using your E plants/E/ult/FQC plants anyway. The other side builds it because it works best on high hp enemies when you'll be mostly poking with Q plants anyway.\n\nMy point is that it's not overpowered on her, and there's not even consensus on whether it's worth building at all. Most people still built it before this patch for the combo of AP and HP or because they didn't realize the slow was gutted for plants. In any event, there are reasons why she builds it, and none of them are because it's OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RexSaur","date":"2016-12-09T15:11:33.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra needs to be nerfed","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2016-12-09T02:32:00.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both Brand and Zyra are within acceptable levels right now.\n\nYou just have to pick a sustainable support like Soraka and Janna.\n\nViktor is more of a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-12-08T23:39:40.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not really.
