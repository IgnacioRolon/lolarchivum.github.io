Akali's kit is also hard to work on in terms of effect, HH Akali, which is a semi-legendary skin still feels lackluster because there's just not much to do with her kit.. Not according to the coding capabilities and ideas they had back then. If it was released now, she's probably throw a dark-red smoke canister with BM themed visuals for her W and probably just a bunch of BM effects spread all over the kit. I can see how it would work, I think this skin deserves a second chance to shine (as in a remake of it.. After Riot's done with all the huge projects like Eve, Galio, Morde, Urgot and the tanks).\n\n\nAnd if it's a candidate for a remake, then it's behind other skins like PF Ezreal in line.\n\nAlso, I think it's the one and only BM skin that exclusively, does not represent a demon, unlike the rest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2017-02-10T01:57:24.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a very, very, very old skin.
