If u are planning on \"repairing\" it anytime soon or even giving us a brand new awesome one. Or do you not really see anything new in that area that for the next few seasons?\nI realize its not really high priority but just knowing that u guys are not ignoring  it for the sake of other content and that we can expect something in like 1 or 2 seasons, or if its gonna take longer than that.","replies":[]}
