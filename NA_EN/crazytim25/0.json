Partway into loading the client freezes, I cannot alt+tab or do anything. I have to hold my computer power button to turn off my computer. \r\nAfter restarting my computer and restarting league, my client is set to US, instead of EUW which I normally play on. Then I have to reselect EUW and I can log in again. This happens about once every 10 games, this resulted in getting me into low-priority queus for 2 times.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue and does anyone know how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-25T16:51:27.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on Windows 10?  This issue might be the result of the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been known to cause freezing like this.  Disable it and test it in a custom game, and let me know if that does the trick for you.","replies":[{"poster":"CRAZYTim25","date":"2017-10-25T17:34:56.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am indeed on Windows 10.
