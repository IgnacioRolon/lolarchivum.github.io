Doesn't mean your internet is bad, but that's just how things go. It's not uncommon whatsoever to have a crystal clear link with some servers but not be able to reach others sometimes, it's due to how the internet functions as a whole with how ISP routes connections.\n\nOn that note, I'm curious as to if something is going differently with how your connection is usually routed. Run a traceroute for me for about 5-10 min to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1, that'll give me a good idea of what's going on to start with. Be sure to post those results back here if you want us to help out!","replies":[]}]}
