Maybe just give her a more sliming fit boot with a small heel. Other than that I like this art a lot.

As for the imagining in the OP's image, I like most of this looks save for the hair and heels. It really tones down the grossly 80s/90s obsession with spikes, and it brings her to a place that's seductive, yet not a testosterone fueled wet dream for a female character. I do need the heels though. Eve without heels just isn't Eve. Her line \"It takes a lot of effort to move like this in heels\" is one of her most iconic lines, I feel.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-07T13:50:10.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, she needs to keep the heels (and in fact, walking in heels is not that hard for an athletic individual, because it is just like running on the balls of their feet, which is the healthiest and most natural way to run).

I think it was added in her texture update.\n\nAlso, I think the line about moving in heels has more to do with being stealthy while wearing heels (they click!) and potentially wading though rough terrain and water in spiked shoes that would surely end up with a broken leg if she takes one wrong step on squishy ground.

Not everyone is going to agree, I know. But I think she looks outdated. Troll-doll hair and the outfit. I love Eve and everything she seems to embody, such as that mysterious sexy assassin look she has going on. The artist that I posted who did his own rendition of Eve; I feel like it suits her. Sexy.
