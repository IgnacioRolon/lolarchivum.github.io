So to sum this up, if you wanna really fuck someone, ban their picks, then troll them in game without saying much of anything, then report them after the games over. Congrats, you successfully fucked someone and nothing will be done to you, and they will get punished because you trolled them.\n\nGame 1\nPre-Game\nßåd: ok.\nßåd: someone dodge\nßåd: this mid\nßåd: is a troll.\nßåd: 100% lose.\nßåd: he banned my 67-70% winratye pick.\nßåd: troll.\nIn-Game\nßåd: if i lose bot\nßåd: tis cuz this peice of garbage banned my 70% winrate pick\nßåd: ow\nßåd: that wouldnt havehappened\nßåd: if i had my pick\nßåd: cuz i wouldnt have been there\nßåd: shaco\nßåd: i will.\nßåd: u shouldnt ban ur  teammates picks\nßåd: shit stain\nßåd: akali trolling.\nßåd: i want the fuck out\nßåd: now.\nßåd: mid bans my pick, my ADC just randomly runs off. i want out.\nßåd: im not trolling\nßåd: oh yea buddy\nßåd: its my fault my mid trolled me\nßåd: take it as a lesson learned\nßåd: dont fkin troll ur teammates\nßåd: wouldnt be happening\nßåd: if i had my pick.\nßåd: oh so that death was somehow my fault too right?\nßåd: i havent said or did anything wrong\nßåd: aside from tell u to stop trolling ur teammates and banning their picks\nßåd: 4 mid, but rammus got that blue tho\nßåd: did nothing wrong.\nßåd: reporting someone cuz u banned their poick\nßåd: isnt a thing\nßåd: meanwhile\nßåd: mf bot\nPost-Game\nßåd: report me all u want\nßåd: u cant report someone for getting their pick banned\nßåd: by their teammate\nßåd: thats not how it works\nßåd: u cant troll someone\nßåd: then report them for u trolling them\nßåd: akali reported.\nßåd: stop trolling ur teammates, asshole.\n\n\nIm not here to argue if i did anything wrong, becuase i didnt and you opinion on it doesnt matter, i was there, you werent. - The moral of this story is riot endorses trolling your teammates, if you dont say much of anything in game, you can passive aggressivly troll people and tilt them off the face of the planet, then report them after to get them punished.\n\n\"ßåd: u cant troll someone\nßåd: then report them for u trolling them\"\n\nLesson learned, but you CAN though, nice automated system u got there riot. i know what ill be doing form now on when someone fucks me over :)\n\nEnd of the day - i should NOT have been punished for this - nothing i said was bad. called him a shit stain, but truth is truth. only a shit stain would intentionally ban his own teammates hovered pick when that pick isnt even something he has to worry about in his lane in any way shape or form. if anything, this kid should be the one being punished, he went OUT of his way to troll a teammate and IM the one who gets punished for him trolling?.... and now my honors are locked because of what? nothing?","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-05-05T04:07:18.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the OP has admitted they don't want feedback, this thread has been locked.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about this action please visit us in the [Moderation Discord here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).\n \n~ Ulanopo","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-05T03:31:13.179+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You say you did \"nothing wrong,\" and yet you raged the entire time, including calling someone a \"peice [sic] of garbage,\" a \"shit stain,\" and an \"asshole.\" That is why you were punished.","replies":[{"poster":"ßåd","date":"2019-05-05T03:33:13.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-05-05T03:41:42.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, buddy.

Where you can be the odd one out, get assaulted by pre-mades and get punished because they simply dont like you and want to troll you.\nThere are several ways to go about abusing this automated system, both of these are prime examples.","replies":[{"poster":"Femme Fatale","date":"2019-05-05T03:25:57.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ßåd,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2sLRmQNp,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-05-05T03:22:44.911+0000)\n>\n> Yup, Welcome to LEague of Gangbang.

Because I think my punishment is very unjust based on my logs. I dont think that by typing back to them, i should get punished for excessive typing and in all honesty the log isnt even that long its probably about as long as yours and part of it was in the post game lobby.
