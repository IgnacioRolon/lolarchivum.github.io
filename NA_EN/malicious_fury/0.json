It opened it in Chrome. I beat the Singed boss just fine then fought the poros in Piltover. I didn't see any noticeable delay or anything wrong at this point. As soon as Jinx landed on the road it froze and the music started doing a half second infinite loop.  I couldn't click anything in the game. I tried pausing and unpausing. No reaction to my mouse. However Chrome did close when I clicked the red X on the top right of the browser. No issues there, meaning it was just the game that froze.  \n\nHeaded to bed right now and will answer any more questions tomorrow. Thank you! The Singed fight was pretty fun ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"ivo02","date":"2015-08-24T11:55:07.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 9TB DDR3 Memory\n\nWait, what?
