The patch has caused not only my games to lag, but it slows down my ENTIRE laptop. Before the patch League was running smooth. Now the ping spikes to 500+ and my frames drop to below 15 fps every few seconds. Absolutely unplayable. I reinstalled, updated my computer, scanned for malware, scanned for corrupted files, and waited 3 days to try playing again. it is still unplayable. Riot please fix this because I wanted to play during Thanksgiving break but it's looking like I won't be able to play at all :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-15T18:43:00.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your laptop plugged in while playing?

I'll try that. The client is slow without me being in game though so I don't think that will help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sol to Squeeze","date":"2016-11-15T19:07:23.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this same issue.
