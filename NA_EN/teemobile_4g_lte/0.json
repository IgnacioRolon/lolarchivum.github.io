Whenever the Kog'maw was in sight of me he glitched, kind of like how Udyr was with his massive crotch, and this streak of Kog just stretched across the map. I was the only one who could see this glitch, and don't really have photo proof right now.. Am I the only one seeing this? Or is it kinda just a random thing I'm making up? xD","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-13T17:15:24.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zorra De Fuego! \n\nThanks for the report!
