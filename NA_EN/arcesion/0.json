At first, the recalling was fine.  However, after a couple times recalling, I noticed that the Voidling Poro was not skinned, but had a solid blue color instead, which I can probably guess means that there is a skin error. I dont know if it is just my client personally or an actual issue, but I thought I might as well report it. Here is a screenshot.\r\nhttp://imgur.com/z1vjBlY","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-26T00:41:57.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
