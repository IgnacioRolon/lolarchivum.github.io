A reason for that is because solo lanes get more xp so they are higher level than bot lane  . If xp sharing is removed we would all be around the same level and the game would become quicker. For some adc having ur ult could turn around the gank from the jungler or just being the same level could possibly bring up a counterplay. I think xp sharing should be removed, it makes the game quicker and will make adc a less shitty role.\n\n(Edit: After some comments I saw I realized that this would change the game a lot because there could be 3 top or  even 2 top 1 mid 2 bot  without a jungle and it would still work out because of not having to share xp. Ty for comments.)
